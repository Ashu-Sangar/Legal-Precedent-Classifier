Twenty-five years ago, in <em>Alpern v. Coe, </em><a href="/pa/352/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="352 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="464062" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0208-01">352 Pa. 208</a>, <a href="" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="42 A.2d 542">42 A. 2d 542</a> (1945), this Court, speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Charles Alvin Jones, held that a court of equity in Pennsylvania “can act <em>in rem </em>with respect to lands lying within its territorial jurisdiction.” (ib<em>id., </em>at 213). In that case, plaintiff, the occupant of real estate in Allegheny County then negotiating for the purchase of the property, brought a bill <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>in equity against the record owner, a Mrs. Moody, her husband and her brother, one Coe. The bill alleged that Coe purchased the property under circumstances which constituted fraud on the plaintiff; that Coe was the plaintiffs employee and stood in a position of trust to plaintiff; that, in aid of the alleged fraud, he caused title to be taken in the name of his sister, Mrs. Moody, who forthwith gave plaintiff notice to vacate. The bill prayed that Mrs. Moody and her husband be declared trustees of the property for plaintiff; that they be directed to convey the property to him and be restrained from conveying it to anyone else; and that all the defendants be enjoined from evicting plaintiff from the premises. Coe lived in Allegheny County and was personally served; the Moodys lived in West Virginia and were served there pursuant to a court order under the Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 387, §1, as amended, 12 P.S. §1254, the forerunner of Pa. E. C. P. 1504. As do the Levys in the case at bar, the Moodys claimed that the relief sought as to them, i.e., the execution of a deed, would be <em>in personam </em>and that the court lacked power to summon persons from beyond its territorial jurisdiction and make them answerable for relief of such nature. The court held that the real relief sought by the suit was <em>in rem, </em>not <em>in personam, </em>and that “the ancient doctrine that the decree in equity can only act upon the person of a party” has been virtually abolished by such statutes as the Act of April 6, 1859, <em>supra, </em>and the Act of April 19, 1901, P. L. 83, §1, 21 P.S. §53. The latter act enables the sheriff, prothonotary or clerk in a county in which land is located to execute a valid deed to the property when ordered by the court having jurisdiction. Thus the court concluded: “The Act of 1859 operates to make the court’s decrees <em>in rem </em>effective as to nonresident defendants who have been served in accordance with the provisions of that Act, while the Act of 1901 makes available the efficient <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>means for effectuating the court’s orders or decrees in such regard without the defendant’s personal compliance.” The opinion makes it crystal clear that this equitable <em>in rem </em>power with respect to land lying within the jurisdiction of a Pennsylvania court for the protection of persons who claim interests therein under the law of the state applies “even as to non-residents” (<a href="/pa/352/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="352 Pa. 208" data-case-ids="464062" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0208-01">352 Pa. at 216</a>), such as the Moodys were there and the Levys are here. Accordingly, regardless of whether the Levys come into Pennsylvania to defend, the Court of Common Pleas in the case, at bar can order reconveyance of the undivided half interest in the Zinman home owned of record by the Levys, provided that the plaintiffs prove their case. <em>American Trust Co. v.

Coe, supra. </em>The fact that plaintiffs-appellees here possess no judgment establishing their status as creditors is not relevant. The Fraudulent Conveyance Act carries no requirement that the creditor have a judgment before initiating an action to have a fraudulent conveyance set aside. While Sections 9 and 10 of the statute distinguish creditors with matured claims from those whose claims have “not yet matured”, both classes of creditors are entitled to the remedy of setting aside a fraudulent conveyance. No logical interpretation of this legislative pattern supports the conclusion that a judgment creditor may bring a valid <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem </em>proceeding with respect to real estate fraudulently conveyed to out-of-state residents, but that a creditor lacking a judgment-may not. While the plaintiff in <em>Alpern v. Coe, supra, </em>did not expressly base his claim on the Fraudulent Conveyance Act, it is to be noted that he also possessed <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>no prior judgment adjudicating his right to become the owner of the property, which was the basis of his claim to a constructive trust.</p>
    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[187,537,1151,1126]]]'>Nor is it of significance that the principal alleged wrongdoer in <em>Alpern v. Coe, supra,, </em>was a Pennsylvania resident who was served personally and was thus before the court from the beginning, whereas in the present case the principal alleged wrongdoer, Mrs. Levy, is a resident of Massachusetts, and has been served only by registered mail. As indicated above, the extent of the court’s power will depend on whether the Levys do or do not see fit to appear generally in the case. But nonresidence does not insulate when property of the nonresident is located in the territorial jurisdiction of the court. The whole proceeding in Foreign Attachment, for example, is based on this proposition. Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 568, §13, 12 P.S. §2861; Pa. B. C. P. 1251 et seq.; Goodrich-Amram, §1251-6. Indeed, the present proceeding in equity under the Fraudulent Conveyance Act bears close analogy to a proceeding in Foreign Attachment. In both forms of process, plaintiffs without judgments are able to imperil the in-state property of persons not then subject to personal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.</p>
