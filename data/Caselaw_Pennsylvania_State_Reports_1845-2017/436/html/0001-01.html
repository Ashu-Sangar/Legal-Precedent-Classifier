We reversed the Orphans’ Court on the question of forgery and directed that an issue devisavit vel non be awarded to the appellant: <em>Lare Will, </em><a href="/pa/352/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="352 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="464137" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0323-01">352 Pa. 323</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.2d%20801" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 A.2d 801">42 A. 2d 801</a>. No trial was ever held on that issue. Subsequent to our decision, the Bank was appointed administrator de bonis non, although that part of the lower Court’s Decree removing appellant as administrator c.t.a. was not disturbed by us. The Bank <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>then procured a citation directing the appellant Lare to file an inventory and account, and, after filing and audit, this appellant was surcharged over $9,000. The assets to which the Bank became entitled as administrator approximated $75,000, including the surcharge.</p>
    <p id="b54-5" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[186,665,1147,696]]]'>The Bank thereafter filed a first and partial administrator’s account covering its administration from January 6, 1944 to October 28, 1949. Lare (the present appellant) filed objections to this account, principally with respect to (a) items of credit taken by the Bank as compensation for its services and (b) counsel fees. The objections were dismissed, the account confirmed, and another appeal was taken to this Court. We modified the Orphans’ Court Decree in that case by disallowing the administrator’s claim for compensation based on principal, on the ground that such claim was premature until the final account: <em>Lare Estate, </em><a href="/pa/368/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="368 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1230361" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0570-01">368 Pa. 570</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="84 A.2d 334">84 A. 2d 334</a>.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[186,1373,1147,862]]]'>Subsequently, the Bank filed a second and partial account covering its administration from the time of the first accounting up to October 28, 1958. Lare filed exceptions to this account, but because of his ill health and because of efforts that were constantly being made to amicably resolve all differences among the interested parties in the will contest, the exceptions were never argued. Upon petition of the parties, the account and the exceptions were withdrawn in January 1963. It appears now that the will contest has finally been brought to a mutually agreeable settlement, with the will of Gertrude K. Lare having been restored to probate. The Bank has filed a final account covering its administration from the date of its first account to February 26, 1964. This was supplemented to April 13, 1964.</p>

In view of the fact that Lare would have been entitled to a portion of the estate regardless of the outcome of the will contest, the Bank regularly distributed to Lare approximately one-half of the cash income. These distributions or payments totaled in excess of $177,000 up to and including 1963. However, the remaining funds were deposited in a <em>non-interest-bearing account with the Bank; </em>and during its administration the Bank held <em>uninvested </em>funds of the estate, on which it paid no interest, in the amounts set forth in the following table:</p>

In support of this contention that its status was that of administrator pendente lite, the Bank cites the footnote which appears in this Court’s Opinion in <em>Lare Estate, </em>368 Pa., supra, which reads as follows (page 572) : “While the Trust Company was so designated in its appointment, the designation should have been ‘pendente lite,’ such appointment being authorized by Section 4 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, P.L. 447, 20 P.S. ch. 3, app. 354. Such an administrator is virtually a custodian of the decedent’s assets pending the will contest and endures only until the termination thereof.

As this Court said (pages 559-560) : “Section 4 of the Banking Code, supra, provides that a bank and trust company may use funds, <em>awaiting investment or distribution</em>

Technically, therefore, the corporate executor was within its statutory right in using the estate funds in its commercial department.

When the legislature contemplated the employment of estate funds by a bank and trust company in its commercial department, <em>such employment was clearly to be temporary in nature; </em>the statutory description of the funds which may be so utilized are <em>funds awaiting ‘investment or </em>distribution’. We find no legislative intent expressed in the Banking Code authorizing the use of such funds on a long term basis; such a construction would be both absurd and unreasonable. Cf: Statutory Construction Act of 1937, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, art. IV, Sec. 52(1), 46 PS §552.

But, in fact, one need only look at the record of that very case to see that in a partial accounting the parties are not concerned with the administration of the balance of the estate. In <em>Lare Estate </em>this Court noted that counsel who prepared the schedule of distribution, as well as the trial court, forgot to award the balance of the estate back to the bank. We awarded the balance back “for further accounting after termination of the will <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>contest.” <em>Lare Estate, </em><a href="/pa/368/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="368 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1230361" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0570-01">368 Pa. at 577</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="84 A.2d 334">84 A. 2d at 338</a>. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to see how we can now foreclose such an accounting for those years.</p>
    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[127,624,1152,1028]]]'>The second point on which I must dissent is the majority’s decision to limit the surcharge to six percent per annum. We are holding that the bank acted improperly in failing to invest these funds. Surely appellant is entitled to receive the amount of money he would have received if the bank carried out its fiduciary duties. I cannot say that this would amount to six percent per annum, nor do I understand how the majority has arrived at this figure. Further, no matter what the figure should be for any one year, we cannot apply some “average” rate of return to a balance which increased dramatically from year to year. For example, in 1949 the balance was approximately $50,000; in 1963, when interest rates were much higher, the balance was approximately $190,000. The bank must give appellant his due—no more, no less. In my opinion, we should remand to the chancellor for a determination of what the proper interest rate should be, not limited to six percent.</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[127,1663,1152,525]]]'>The determination of what interest the bank could have received is a factual one. This Court is not equipped to make such determinations, as a matter of first impression and on a silent record, nor are we permitted to guess at what the proper rate of interest should be. Accordingly, I would remand this case to ■the orphans’ court so that it might determine the proper amount to surcharge the bank. And, as I stated above, I would not bar surcharge for the years 1944 to 1949.</p>
