The FBI, however, has a standard policy against granting such pretrial interviews without the consent of the district attorney, and, in the case at bar, the district attorney refused to give such consent. On August 22, 1969, defense counsel filed a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County, .requesting that the district attorney be directed to permit the interview of the expert witness, Stombaugh.</p>

Strombaugh [sic], and that the District Attorney is enjoined not to prohibit Special Agent Strombaugh [sic] from discussing the testimony and the evidence with counsel for the defendant.” The same day that this order was made, the district attorney wrote a letter to Agent Stombaugh in which, after quoting the court order, he stated that he felt that the FBI should not agree to the interview, although he did not have the power to bar such an interview.</p>

See <em>Pa. R. Crim. P. </em>310 (adopted June 30, 1964). However, these cases and Rule 310 are applicable only to pretrial discovery and inspection and govern situations in which the district attorney is called upon to produce physical evidence which is in his control. Rule 310 was adopted to incorporate the general rule in criminal proceedings that, <em>in the absence of exceptional circumstances and compelling rea</em>sons, an accused has no right to the inspection or disclosure before trial of evidence in the possession of the prosecution. <em>Commonwealth v. Wable, </em><a href="/pa/382/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="382 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1259978" data-case-paths="/pa/382/0080-01">382 Pa. 80</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="114 A.2d 334">114 A. 2d 334</a> (1955). Thus, “discovery” in the context of criminal procedure has a much more limited scope than it does with respect to civil proceedings. <em>Compare Pa. R. Crim. P. </em>221, 304 and 310 <em>with Pa. R. C. P. </em>4001-25. In the case at bar, the defense counsel is not seeking to “discover” any evidence in the possession of the district attorney. Counsel is seeking the opportunity to question an expert witness for the Commonwealth in preparation for trial, and such request does not involve the production or inspection of evidence which is already in the hands of the prosecution. Discovery proceedings, under Rule 310, need only be used when counsel wishes to acquire access to evidence within the control of the district attorney. Witnesses themselves can certainly not be so classified. Accordingly, Rule 310 is inapplicable to the instant petition, as are the cases which presaged Rule 310.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The state has an interest in seeing that the innocent not be wrongfully punished, as well as in convicting the guilty. <em>See Berger v.

S. 83</a>, 87 (1963), the special function of a public prosecutor was discussed as follows: “Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly. An inscription on the walls of the Department of Justice states the proposition candidly for the federal domain; ‘The United States wins its point whenever justice is done its citizens in the courts.’ A prosecution that withholds evidence on demand of an accused which, if made available, would tend to exculpate him or reduce the penalty helps shape a trial that bears heavily on the defendant. That casts the prosecution in the role of an architect of a proceeding that does not comport with standards of justice, even though, as in the present case, his action is not ‘the result of guile,’ to use the words of the Court of Appeals.” A district attorney may not suppress evidence or secrete witnesses; indeed, such conduct may constitute a denial of due process under the United States Constitution. <em>Giles v.

We are not persuaded. In the majority of instances, as in the case at bar, the effect of the prosecutor’s expressed disapproval would be to prevent defense counsel from speaking with the witness until the witness testifies at trial. This result is unsatisfactory. We are concerned with the interference by a district attorney with the <em>right </em>of a defendant to interview an otherwise willing witness. The issue is not the form which that interference takes, but rather whether it is effective. A district attorney who wishes to bar such an interview may employ one of three methods: he may hide or incarcerate the witness; he may order the witness not to speak; or he may “advise” the witness not to speak. The district attorney certainly has not adopted either of the first two methods. His choice of the third method, even though exercised in good faith, nevertheless was in error.</p>

Specifically, after a witness has stated that he is willing to talk with counsel for the defendant unless the district attorney objects, the district attorney may not, as we already indicated, relate his lack of consent to the witness. The district attorney may not interfere with or impose his preference or judgment on the defendant. In a case such as that at bar, the district attorney has no legitimate interest in preventing the witness from aiding the defendant. A public prosecutor is entrusted with an awesome duty which requires him to serve the interests of justice in every case. For this reason, a witness who may have information which is favorable to the defense must be made available to the defense. <em>See Giles v. Maryland, </em>

Where a district attorney can show some special circumstances, such as the probability that the witness will be or has been intimidated or otherwise induced to falsify his testimony, then justice may require that the proposed pretrial interview be had with certain safeguards or should not take place. The <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>decision as to whether snch a situation exists should properly be left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gockley, </em><a href="/pa/411/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="411 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1885935" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0437-01">411 Pa. 437</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.2d%20693" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="192 A.2d 693">192 A. 2d 693</a> (1963); <em>Commonwealth v.

Under proper circumstances the trial court may, in its discretion and upon stated grounds for such drastic action, make such order as it should deem necessary in the individual case. Thus, a trial court may. bar defense counsel from approaching a witness before trial, require that the district attorney be present during questioning, limit the questioning to specified subjects, or otherwise fashion a remedy which it deems proper under the totality of circumstances surrounding the case.</p>
