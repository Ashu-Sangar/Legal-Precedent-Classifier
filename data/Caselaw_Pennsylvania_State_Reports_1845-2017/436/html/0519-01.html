Appellant, Robert E. Nash, Jr., was convicted by a jury on May. 2, 1962, of murder in the first degree and was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
    <p id="b570-10" data-blocks='[["BL_570.16",570,[198,1792,1146,314]]]'>On June 5, 1968, appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief, alleging that he had not knowingly waived his right to appeal. On July 26, 1968, the court granted appellant the right to file post-trial motions <em>mmc pro tunc. </em>A motion for new trial was filed; it was denied on June 11, 1969. This appeal followed.</p>

First of all, he claims that his confession to the police was involuntary. The court below, in its brief memorandum opinion, held the confession to be voluntary. We fail to see how the court could have reached the merits <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>of the question of voluntariness without holding a hearing pursuant to <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a>, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a> (1964). See <em>Com. ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/429/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="429 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1913542" data-case-paths="/pa/429/0141-01">429 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=239%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="239 A.2d 426">239 A. 2d 426</a> (1968). However, the denial of relief on this claim was clearly proper because appellant waived any right to challenge the confession by virtue of his failure to object to its admissibility at trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/427/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1910414" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0083-01">427 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20530" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="233 A.2d 530">233 A. 2d 530</a> (1967).</p>

Ordinarily, we would not treat an issue such as the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel without an evidentiary hearing on the matter. However, here, as in <em>Snyder, </em>supra, it is apparent from the face of the record that counsel’s failure to object was not ineffectiveness, but rather a “deliberate bypass”. As we stated in <em>Com. ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, 604, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A. 2d 349</a> (1967): “[0]ur inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” (Emphasis in original). In the instant case, appellant testified at trial, stating that what was contained in his confession to the police was correct. Furthermore, appellant’s employer testified, relating that appellant had come to him and confessed before he went to the police. The entire thrust of appellant’s case was that he had committed the crime, but had been driven to it because he was hungry and broke, and that he was now remorseful. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the confession to the police was involuntary (a rather doubtful assumption on the facts before us), it could hardly have helped appellant to exclude this confession inasmuch as he was still confronted <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>with, the confession to his employer. Moreover, it could well have hurt by antagonizing the jury to which he was appealing for sympathy. It is perfectly clear that a reasonable basis existed for counsel’s failure to object to the confession to the police.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[182,642,1149,752]]]'>Appellant’s final argument is that the admission of appellant’s confession was error because the confession had been given without the warnings mandated by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S. Ct. 1602</a> (1966). This contention is made in the teeth of numerous decisions of this Court holding that <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">384 U.S. 719</a>, <a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">86 S.
