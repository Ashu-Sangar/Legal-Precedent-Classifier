In <em>Ellis, </em>we were concerned with the proposed sale of <em>admittedly </em>partnership assets of a partnership in which a decedent prior to his death was a partner ; in that factual posture, we held that the court of common pleas had jurisdiction to deal with matters concerning the dissolution of the partnership and distribution of assets of the dissolved partnership, and that, <em>after </em>the dissolution had been resolved and <em>after </em>proceeds of the dissolved partnership had been earmarked as assets of the estate of the deceased partner, <em>then </em>the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court would attach and that court would distribute the now-identified estate assets.</p>

In <em>Ellis, </em>the question was the disposition of partnership assets titled not in the name of a decedent but rather in the name of a partnership. The majority opinion does not affect, nor is it affected by <em>Ellis. </em>In fact, if the Orphans’ Court decides that Eberhardt and Ovens were partners and that the assets, although titled in Ovens’ name, were actually owned by the partnership, then the <em>Ellis </em>rule applies and the Court of Common Pleas will proceed, within <em>its </em>legislatively-mandated power,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> to dissolve the partnership and determine distribution of the partnership assets. <em>Ellis </em>does not govern the instant case.</p>

This suggestion is of such significance that it cannot go unanswered.</p>

While the Constitutional amendment abolished the orphans’ court <em>as such, </em>it did not, either expressly or by implication, extinguish and destroy what had been the jurisdiction and functions formerly exercised by the orphans’ courts. On the contrary, Section 4 of the Schedule to the Judiciary Article provides that the former orphans’ courts shall now be “divisions” of the reconstituted Court of Common Pleas: “Orphans’ courts in judicial districts having separate orphans’ courts shall become orphans’ court divisions of the courts of common pleas and the court of common pleas in those judicial districts shall exercise the <em>jurisdiction </em>

That Act further provides that, although judges may temporarily be assigned to another division, they “shall nonetheless remain members of their original division.” Our new Constitution was designed to permit the assignment of judges from one division to another in order to expedite court <em>business; </em>however, this is a very far cry from an <em>abolition </em>of <em>jurisdictional </em>and functional distinctions among the several divisions.</p>

For example, in neither court would the parties in this controversy have had a right to a trial by jury. See also Orphans’ Court Rules §3, Rule 1 (unless otherwise provided by statute or local rule, pleading and practice in orphans’ court conforms to common pleas sitting in equity).
