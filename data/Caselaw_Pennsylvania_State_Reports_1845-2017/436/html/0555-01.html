Therefore, <em>Ulrich </em>is inapplicable and we must follow the general rule with respect to competency of witnesses: “The Act was intended to make competency the rule and incompetency the exception, and a narrow construction of the Act would often result in suppressing the truth.” <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Clanton, <a href="/pa/395/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="395 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1282744" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0521-01">395 Pa. 521</a>, 527, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%2088" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="151 A.2d 88">151 A. 2d 88</a>, 92 (1959).

The record shows that, during the course of an argument, D. L. Sitots stabbed and killed Mary Walker, who was unarmed. Stots claims that Mary first threatened him with a knife, that he then took it from her and stabbed her. This version of the incident, although supported by the testimony of Martha Stots, was denied by Mary Walker’s son, who testified that it was the defendant who first obtained the knife. However, even if we were to accept defendant’s story, we find his claim of self-defense to be totally refuted by the fact that he stabbed the victim <em>ten times. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s argument with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence is without merit.</p>
