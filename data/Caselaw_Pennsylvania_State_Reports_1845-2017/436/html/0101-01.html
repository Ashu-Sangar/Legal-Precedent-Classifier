    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.10",153,[142,877,1148,320]]]'>This is an appeal from a Decree of the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County directing the Provident National Bank, as guardian of the Estate of Helen L. Christie, an incompetent, to deliver certain property to Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia, as executor of the Estate of Robert A. Christie, deceased.</p>
    <p id="b153-7" data-blocks='[["BL_153.11",153,[141,1209,1146,153]]]'>This case involves the troublesome question of the ownership of the stock and other contents of two safe deposit boxes leased jointly by a husband and wife.</p>

Christie, were the lessees of two safe deposit boxes—one at the G-lenside office of the Continental Bank &amp; Trust Company<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> and the other at the Jenkintown office of the. Industrial Valley Bank &amp; Trust Company.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">**</a> Although the contents of these boxes included a small amount of tangible personal property and a few stock certificates registered either in Helen’s name alone or in the names of Robert and Helen as tenants by the entireties, the controversy in this appeal centers on a substantial number of stock certificates <em>which were registered in the decedent husband’s </em>name alone.</p>
    <p id="b153-9" data-blocks='[["BL_153.13",153,[134,2089,1149,153]],["BL_154.1",154,[195,394,1151,1143]]]'>Shortly after Robert’s death, Helen was adjudged an incompetent and her guardian took possession of all of the contents of the aforesaid two safe deposit boxes. <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>In this proceeding, Robert’s executor sought to recover as part of Robert’s estate those stock certificates <em>which were registered solely m Robert’s name. </em>Helen’s guardian defended on the ground that Robert had created a tenancy by the entireties in these stock certificates when they were deposited<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> in the jointly leased safe deposit boxes, and that the stock certificates now belong to Helen by virtue of the right of survivorship. Basing its decision on the difference in the language of the contracts covering each of the two safe deposit boxes, the Orphans’ Court initially ordered Helen’s guardian to deliver to Robert’s executor the stock contained in the Continental box which was registered in Robert’s name alone, but not the stock in the Industrial box. Both parties filed exceptions. The Orphans’ Court, in its final Decree sur the exceptions, <em>directed that the stocks in both safe deposit boxes which were registered in the name of Robert alone should be delivered to his executor as part of his estate. </em>It is from this Decree that Helen’s guardian has appealed.</p>

The fallacy in appellant’s argument lies in its assumption that this safe deposit lease (which is almost always a contract prepared by a bank to protect itself in the event of disputed right of access and withdrawal, or controversial claims between and among lessees) stated not only that each lessee may have a right of access and withdrawal, but that “each” (instead of “each or either”) is the owner of the present and future contents of the box.
