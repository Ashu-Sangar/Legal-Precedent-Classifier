The appellant, a member of the congregation and one of several plaintiffs in the court below, contends that St. John’s was founded as an independent church, and that it has always been autonomous in its government. The appellees are Nicholas T. Elko, Bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Reverend Andrew Pataki, Pastor of St. John’s Church. The appellees, of course, contend here, as they did successfully in the lower court, that St. John’s is a constituent part of the Greek Catholic Church united under the Pope.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

This is so because the law of Pennsylvania prevents a diversion <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>of church property from a use to which it was originally dedicated to another inconsistent use.

Thus, if St. John’s was founded as a church under the authority of the Roman Pontiff, it must remain that way. Conversely, if St. John’s was founded as an independent church, beyond the mandate of hierarchical authority, but possessing for itself the full measure of control and governing powers, then it must remain independent.</p>

Thus, the appellant asserts that in this dispute, where the similarities between Greek Catholic independent churches and Greek Catholic Uniate (united with Rome) churches are pervasive, and where dissimilarities are obscure, ritual and practice are not valid determiners of St. John’s governmental nature. The only real test, argues the appellant, is to determine the ultimate authority in St. John’s; to determine whether St. John’s relations with the Uniate hierarchy existed be<a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>cause of St. John’s convenience and administrative need, or because St. John’s had no choice in the matter, just as a son cannot choose his father.</p>

On September 30, 1910, Reverend Theodosius Vasochik, who was a Uniate priest in charge of a local Uniate parish, excepted to the application, stating that the founders of St. John’s were not truly Catholic, i.e., under the authority of the Pope. On November 12, 1910, a Charter was granted to St. John’s in the name of “St. John Chrysostom <em>Autonomic </em>Greek Catholic Church of Pitts-, burgh” (emphasis supplied), the name having been arrived at after Reverend Vasochik excepted to the original application which bore the name “St. John Chrysostom Greek Catholic Church of Pittsburgh.” The chancellor did not assign much significance to the name change, but rather surmised that it came about as a typical agreement of counsel. The lower court noted that no evidence was produced to show that Reverend Vasochik had authority from anybody to contest the original charter application, and in the absence of that kind of proof, the chancellor was reluctant to decide the present issue on the basis of the consequences of Reverend Vasochik’s exceptions. Also attesting to the inconclusiveness of the Charter on the issue of St. <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>John’s governmental nature, said the court, was the action of St. John’s parishioners just a little more than one year after the Charter was granted, when, on December 23, 1911, the parishioners petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to amend the corporate name to “St. John Chrysostom Greek Catholic Church of Pittburgh”, which the court did on January 22, 1912. Thus the lower court, quite correctly we think, refused to decide this very important dispute by . the mere recitation of the name in the Charter as granted in 1910. We agree that the several proceedings concerning the Charter must be considered together, and so considered, they are silent on the question of St. John’s governmental nature.</p>
    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[195,1174,1145,703]]]'>In the above regard, the appellant asserts that the doctrine of “res judicata” establishes for all times that St. John’s is independent. The argument conceptualizes the grant of St. John’s Charter in 1910 as St. John’s “Autonomic” Church as a judicial recognition and decision on the very question of St. John’s independence. The grant of the Charter was hardly conclusive upon the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of St. John’s. The decree of incorporation merely decided that St. John’s was a proper subject for incorporation under Pennsylvania law, and that it had fulfilled all of the mandatory conditions precedent to incorporation under the law of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b298-5" data-blocks='[["BL_298.6",298,[194,1890,1146,483]],["BL_299.1",299,[140,397,1148,1316]]]'>Furthermore, we agree with the chancellor that an isolated consideration of St. John’s bylaws and minutes cannot answer the jurisdictional question at hand. The records, to be sure, contain infrequent assertive statements directed against certain aspects of the Uniate influence at St. John’s; for example, in 1931, the parishioners placed an interdict against the mention in the Mass of the name of Bishop Takach, the Bishop of the Pod Carpathian Diocese, because of his stand on <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>the issue of priestly celibacy, and because of the permission given by him to certain of St. John’s parishioners to start a new parish at a different location which, of course, resulted in a diminution of St. John’s population. The records of such incidents seem to us, however, to be no more conclusive as to St. John’s governmental, nature than the very facts of such occurrences, all of which were not only well known to the chancellor, but were also considered by him in arriving at his decision. But besides the fact that the recordation of some facts does not make them weightier than others, another reason precludes the bylaws from being the determiner of the real authority at St. John’s. Until 1935, church property was held, by force of the Lay Control of Church Property Act, Act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 328, §7, 10 P.S. §81, subject to the direction and control of the lay members of the congregation. This control could not have been accomplished without bylaws and the bylaws could not help but reflect the authority and power actually reposed in the lay trustees by the statute. These assertions, however, are not inconsistent with hierarchical control, and hence cannot be relied upon to decide the question. The lower court so held, and we agree.</p>

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.6",300,[200,497,1145,591]]]'>The parishioners of St. John’s emigrated from Central Europe to the Pittsburgh area from about 1880 onward. The area in Europe from which they came was called Pod Carpathia, and is now eastern Czechoslovakia. The Pod Carpathians are Slavs, and until the early 1900’s were ruled by the Hungarian Empire. They lived in dire economic conditions and, having an almost feudal-type existence, were anxious for a better life. When they came to America, they naturally tended to keep to themselves, since they were quite distrustful of others.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.7",300,[203,1105,1144,594]]]'>Historically, the Pod Carpathians were practitioners of Orthodox faith<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> from the time of the Schism of 1054<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> until the middle of the seventeenth century, when a general reunion with Rome began. By the eighteenth century, the Pod Carpathians were steadfast in their allegiance to the Pope, partly because the Austro-Hungarian rulers were the titular successors to the Holy Roman Empire. When the Pod Carpathians emigrated here from Europe, they were universally Uniate, knowing neither Orthodoxy nor independence.</p>

Consequently the Slavs were placed under Latin Rite Bishops, a circumstance not pleasing to the emigrants who mistrusted the Western Church. The emigrants therefore adopted the “trustee” system which allowed them to keep church property out of the hands of the Western Bishops. Even when the Greek Catholics were given their own bishops, difficulties seemed to appear which prevented a complete administrative fusion between the local parish and the diocesé.</p>
    <p id="b301-4" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[162,1059,1148,597]]]'>The people who became the parishioners of St. John’s settled in the Frankstown area of Pittsburgh. Until they formed their own church, they attended two local churches, both of which were Uniate. In the summer of 1910, these people decided to found their own church. In early September 1910, the first Mass was said by a Uniate priest, Reverend Alexis Petrasovich, who was ordained in 1863 by the Bishop of Presov, a Uniate Diocese in Pod Carpathia. Reverend Petrasovich remained a Uniate priest in good standing with the church hierarchy until his death in 1929.</p>

All <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>have requested and received permission from the Uni-ate bishop for the dispensation of marriage banns.

    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[185,612,1146,596]]]'>Significantly, the parishioners of St. John’s have always sought to redress grievances through the established hierarchical channels of the Uniate church, and not by self-action. For example, the church minutes of 1927 show some dissatisfaction with Reverend Volensky, the parish priest. Protest was lodged with the Uniate bishop, who informed a committee of St. John’s parishioners that Reverend Volensky could be ordered to leave St. John’s only by him. In an independent parish, a disliked priest would have been discharged by the parishioners.</p>

    <p id="b303-3" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[125,836,1149,1091]]]'>Several times in St. John’s history, the ruling Uni-ate bishop has fallen into disfavor with the parishioners of St. John’s. For example, Bishop Takach was strongly disliked by the people, mainly because of his position on priestly celibacy, and because of his permission given to some of St. John’s parishioners in 1931 to leave St. John’s and erect a new parish elsewhere. The dispute was generated by the decision of St. John’s in 1931 to erect a new church. Some favored the existing location as the site for the new church, while others, those who were permitted to leave St. John’s, favored a new location. The remaining parishioners showed resentment to Bishop Takach for allowing a diminution in St. John’s population, but the chancellor found this resentment to be personal, for Bishop Takach’s successors were greatly respected by St. John’s. Even the harsh feelings against Bishop Takach found expression through the legitimate channels of the Uniate Church which existed for the redress of grievances.</p>

While this theory is adopted by the majority in the cases now before this Court, I do not believe that it can withstand analysis in light of the broader strictures which <em>Presbyterian Church </em>places on the civil courts in deciding church property disputes. I do not believe it likely that the Supreme Court of the United States would have heard and so decided <em>Presbyterian Church </em>in order to do no more than what had already been done in <em>Watson, </em>especially since the very issue which controls in a <em>Watson </em>determination, whether a church is hierarchical or congregational, would appear to be an ecclesiastical question within <em>Presbyterian Church. </em>See Comment, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Iowa%20L.%20Rev.%20899" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="54 Iowa L.
