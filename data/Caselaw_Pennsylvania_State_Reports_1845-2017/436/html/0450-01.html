    <p id="b502-5" data-blocks='[["BL_502.8",502,[174,768,1149,479]]]'>Beatrice Sullivan [appellant] was convicted of murder in the first degree arising from the killing of her supposed husband, Dock Sumpter. The Commonwealth’s theory was that appellant conspired with her paramour, Willie Payne, who admitted firing the fatal shot, to murder Sumpter. The trial court denied a motion for a new trial, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment, and from that judgment of sentence the instant appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b502-6" data-blocks='[["BL_502.9",502,[176,1259,1147,470]]]'>At trial, Payne testified that appellant had become friendly with him approximately three months before the murder. Some time later appellant asked Payne to kill Sumpter in exchange for which Payne would receive one half of a f&gt;10,000 life insurance policy on Sumpter’s life. Finally, on the day before the murder, appellant gave Payne money to buy a gun and accompanied him to a pawn shop where he purchased a rifle.</p>

Payne testified that appellant had called him on the telephone and asked him whether he intended to go through with the murder. The testimony as to the substance of that conversation was properly admitted on the basis of Payne’s voice identification of the appellant, Mrs. Sullivan. <em>Burton v. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/368/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="368 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="1230384" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0613-01">368 Pa. 613</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20310" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="84 A.2d 310">84 A. 2d 310</a> (1951); <em>Commonwealth v.

Unknown to either party, Payne’s mother (Mrs. Maxwell) picked up the extension phone on the second floor and over<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>heard the conversation. She was allowed to testify, over the vigorous objection of appellant’s counsel, as to what she heard. The lower court overruled this objection on the ground that it was unnecessary for Mrs. Maxwell to identify the caller as appellant because her son had already made a positive identification. On cross-examination, she further testified that she recognized the voice as belonging to a Mrs. Sullivan, who had called a few times before asking for Payne. Although several other witnesses corroborated portions of Payne’s story, Payne and his mother were the only witnesses who testified as to the actual conspiracy.</p>
    <p id="b503-3" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[111,1049,1149,531]]]'>Appellant’s principal objection concerns the testimony of Mrs. Maxwell. Appellant argues that Mrs. Maxwell should not have been permitted to testify as to what she overheard because she could not adequately identify the voice of the party to whom her son, Payne, was speaking. However, our primary question is not whether Mrs. Maxwell’s identification was adequate, but rather whether <em>any </em>further identification was required after the voice had been positively identified by Payne.</p>
    <p id="b503-4" data-blocks='[["BL_503.5",503,[111,1594,1150,315]]]'>This is a question of first impression in this Court. Under our case law, before one of two parties to a telephone conversation may testify as to the substance of that conversation, the proper identification of the other party to the conversation must be established. <em>Smithers v.

On the other hand, “there is no rule of evidence which requires that <em>every </em>witness to a conversation shall himself identify the participants in it, identification by others being considered sufficient.” 22A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>§644, at 516 (1961) (emphasis added). The rule stated in <em>Smithers v. Light </em>is inapplicable where the substance of the conversation is to be related by a witness who was on another line, <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>and where the recipient of the call has already testified and made a valid identification of the caller. In snch a situation, the identity of the caller rests upon the testimony of the recipient rather than that of the eavesdropper. The eavesdropper’s testimony would merely corroborate the substance of the conversation which has already been properly identified. Thus, as long as the identity of the caller has been established by some competent means such as voice identification or circumstantial evidence, <em>Smithers v. </em>Light, <a href="/pa/305/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="305 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1134590" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0141-01">305 Pa. 141</a>, 144-45, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20A.%20489" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="157 A. 489">157 A. 489</a>, 490 (1931), it is not necessary that the present witness also be able to identify both parties. One such identification may satisfy the requirement for foundation testimony that is needed to establish the relevance, and therefore admissibility, of the testimony sought to be introduced as to the substance of the conversation. It would not be in accord with the reasons for requiring identification to demand such proof from a witness who is called upon merely to corroborate the identifying witness’ version of what was said.</p>

The only foundation evidence that would be required from him would be evidence sufficient to establish that he was in fact testifying as to the same accident seen by Witness A. Applying this same concept to the case at bar, once Payne testified that he recognized Mrs. Sullivan’s voice and had related his version of the conversation, all that was required to make Mrs. Maxwell’s corroborating testimony relevant, and therefore admissible, was evidence that she and Payne were speaking of the same eon<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>versation. We find that there was sufficient evidence to support the ruling of the lower court that they were testifying as to the same telephone conversation.</p>

Jur. 2d <em>Evidence </em>§384 (1967). In the case of a bystander’s testimony, as in the case of an eavesdropper’s testimony, the witness is merely corroborating the substance of what he heard of the conversation. Whether the jury believes that the defendant was the other party to the conversation is the problem of identification. However, in both instances this problem would involve the credibility of the testimony of the first witness, who was a party to the call, and upon whose identification the admissibility of all evidence as to what was said must rest.</p>

In essence, appellant seems to argue that Payne’s testimony is inherently untrustworthy. She then proceeds to point out six alleged inconsistencies in his testimony. We are not persuaded. First, credibility is peculiarly an issue for the jury and the jury chose to believe Payne. Second, we have studied Payne’s testimony and conclude that, on the face of the record, his testimony appears to be consistent. Several of appellant’s examples of inconsistent testimony were taken out of context and are fully explained by later testimony. Other apparent inconsistencies can be attributed to the fact that Payne has had very little formal education and, not surprisingly, does not always express himself with clarity. Appellant’s second contention is totally without merit.</p>

Mrs. MaxAvell did not testify that the woman Avhose voice she heard Avas the defendant, but she did testify that the unidentified caller said she wanted Payne to kill a man and would pay him f5000. While the conversation was in progress, Mrs. Maxwell, by her testimony, “walked doAvnstairs, took the phone out of his [Payne’s] hand and hung it up.” She talked with her son, telling him not to get involved Avith “people like that.” Since her cab had not arrived, her son agreed to drive her to her destination. This “must have been around 8:00 p.m.” Her son took her there, she stayed until “about 10:00 p.m.,” and arrived back home “at 10:30 p.m.” Mrs. Maxwell testified that she was sure of the time. When she returned home at 10:30 p.m. she went to bed—and did not see Payne any more that evening.</p>

Hence, there is no link between Mrs. Maxwell’s overheard conversation and the defendant in this case, and, in my view, appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[114,596,1147,318]]]'>Further, in my view the facts of this case present a serious question under <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[111,926,1150,644]]]'>Although appellant’s failure to object at trial to the admission of the testimony of the witness who overheard the telephone conversation on the ground that it violated the Act of July 16, 1957, can be excused by the fact that <em>Murray </em>(which interpreted the act) had not yet been decided, the same cannot be said for appellant’s failure to press this argument on appeal, either in briefs or at oral argument. This appeal was taken well after the date of the <em>Murray </em>decision, and appellant’s failure to argue that the admission of the evidence in question violated the Act of July 16, 1957, precludes us from giving her relief on that ground.</p>
