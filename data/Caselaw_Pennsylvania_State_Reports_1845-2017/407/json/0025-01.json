The lower Court held a hearing and made certain findings of fact and returned the record to this Court. The lower Court found, contrary to the petitioner\u2019s contention, that \u201cNeither these exhibits nor any criminal record of anyone other than the defendant was offered in evidence, presented in evidence, admitted in evidence, nor in any other way introduced at the trial as against the defendant.\u201d\nIn view of this determination of fact, the following Order is entered:\nPetition dismissed.",
