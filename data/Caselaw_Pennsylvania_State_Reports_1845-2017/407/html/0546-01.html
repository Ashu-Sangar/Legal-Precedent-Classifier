At the time, she was single. Approximately ten months later, she married the defendant. Subsequently, these actions were instituted against the defendant, Wayne Richard Little, alleging that his careless driving caused the accident. The plaintiff, Mildred Meisel, mother of the injured minor, sued to recover the money necessarily expended in treatment of her daughter’s injuries and also for earnings lost during her minority. The minor plaintiff sued through her natural guardian to recover reasonable compensation for the pain and suffering caused by the injuries and also for future loss of earning power.</p>

Her appeal was undoubtedly entered because the court below mistakenly said in the course of its opinion that the action was derivative and could not be maintained. This is not correct. This action may be pursued irrespective of the action of the minor plaintiff. However, since the order appealed from did not in fact aggrieve the plaintiff, Mildred Meisel, her appeal must necessarily be quashed.</p>

She put the matter into the hands of an attorney who, through her mother (since she was a minor), brought an action in trespass against Wayne Richard Little. The suit was filed on June 15, 1960. In the meantime, however, something else happened to Janet Marie. She fell in love with her tortfeasor and married him, this taking place on April 25, 1959.</p>

It must be stated here parenthetically that during trials at nisi prius in personal injury cases the pleasant fiction is entertained that no one knows that the defendant carries liability insurance because it is supposed that such knowledge on the part of the jury might predispose it in favor of the plaintiff. However, here in the deliberations of the court of last resort in the state, such fictions must be <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>set aside, if conclusions consonant with realities are to be attained.

The Majority Opinion thus states in the case at bar that for a wife to sue her husband in tort actions is against “public policy.” The defendant’s brief, expatiating on this subject, asserts that this denial of the wife’s right to sue her husband “is based on the sound principle of public policy to promote family unity and avoid family discord and disturbance.”</p>

In 1960 there were 71,885 marriages in Pennsylvania and there were 14,429 divorces. The Pennsylvania Department of Health, Division of Statistics, has stated that the divorce rate is increasing and has pointed out that the divorce rate of 1960 was 3.9% higher than that of 1959.</p>

It is the insurance company which will have to pay the verdict. The payment of such a verdict by the insurance company, thus will <em>promote, </em>instead of disturb family unity. Certainly both husband and wife will be happy in the realization that medical bills and and other expenses accruing because of the accident of July 6, 1958, will come out of the insurance company’s treasury and not the young married couple’s modest budget.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

If the theory that a suit between husband and wife creates a mutually hostile feeling is to be given any credence, what explanation is offered for the fact that that supposed hostility did not prevent Janet and Wayne from marrying one another? Certainly the love which is strong enough to bring two persons together after one has hurt the other in an automobile accident would be strong enough to hold them together after a court adjudicates the strictly business relationship between them arising out of that accident. If Janet had a car of her own and it was damaged by Wayne before or during marriage, the law would permit her to sue him for the damage done to her car but, according to the Majority decision, she could not sue him for physical injuries which she sustained in that same accident.

Primarily, of course, it is to save one from heavy financial burdens in the event he should unfortunately get into an accident and be sued. But there is another reason too, and that is, that the motorist wishes to be in a position to do something for the person he may unintentionally hurt. Every person of honesty and self-respect, with an appreciation of the dignity of mankind, desires to meet his just obligations; and the least that one can do for the person he has unintentionally brought to grief is to compensate him for the expenses he has had to undergo and the loss he suffers through no fault of his own. The conscientious motorist thus is thinking about protecting the whole world from his mistakes as much as he is protecting himself. Is it not strange, then, through the workings of the law as expounded by this Court that in the financial ambulance which the motorist has pur<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>chased to carry to safety, remedial care, and renewed well-being such persons he may have injured on life’s highway, there is room for everybody but those he loves most? The remotest stranger has a place in that ambulance but not his wife, not his children, nor his parents. Why? Not because he hasn’t paid premiums on a policy which is intended to cover anybody he may injure, but because this Court (and I am, of course, speaking here only of Pennsylvania, because there are other States which look upon the matter a little more realistically and more in conformity with principles of true justice) has declared that somehow, some way (not explained by the Majority) it is against public policy for one to take care of his own.</p>

In that case the Majority held that a five-year-old child could not maintain an action in tort against its parents on the theory that such an action would disrupt family unity and promote family discord and disturbance. The Majority said this in spite of the fact that, in view of the insurance in the case, the parents would not be compelled to expend a dollar of their own money as the result of any verdict rendered in the case. “Where, therefore, would there arise any cause for family disharmony?” That is the question I asked in my dissenting opinion and it was not answered.</p>

I was a member of the Court which reversed the trial court, and of course participated in that wise and proper decision. However, under the ruling of this Court today, the action of this Court in the <em>Johnson </em>case was improper. The barring of a suit by a wife against her husband during his lifetime is predicated (as the Majority holds) on the assumed public policy of preserving domestic harmony and felicity. I don’t see how that policy changes because the husband is dead. Does a widow love her husband less after he dies? What about 'the surviving members of the family, — the family which is the backbone of organized society? If there is something morally incorrect about showing the husband to be wrong while he is alive, it would seem to me to be doubly wrong to attack him when he is dead and cannot defend himself. I repeat that I emphatically approved of the decision in the <em>Johnson </em>case when it was made and I still heartily endorse it as good law today, and I believe that it is a precedent for reversing the decision of the lower court in the case at bar, for if it is proper for a wife to sue her husband, in order to protect her property rights, after her husband is dead, because of a negligent act he performed while he was her living husband, it should be proper for a wife to sue her husband for a negligent act he performed <em>before </em>he became her husband.</p>

The case proceeded to trial and the jury returned verdicts in favor of the plaintiff against the original defendants and in favor of the original defendants against Koontz, the additional defendant. The defendants appealed, seeking judgment n.o.v., arguing that since Mrs. Koontz could not sue Koontz, who was her husband, she could not sue his masters. They reasoned that since a.master’s liability is a derivative one, the master could not be liable if the servant is not liable. • Under the ruling of this Court today, the argument of the defendants in the <em>Koontz </em>case should have been a valid one because if, under the Act of 1883 Koontz could not be held liable in damages to his wife for any tortious act, on what ground should his employer be liable when the supposed liability is based on the husband’s tortious act? If the purpose of the Act of 1893 is to preserve domestic and marital tranquillity, as this Court says today, what happened to that domestic tranquillity in the Koontz family when Koontz was brought in as an additional defendant? -At that trial Mrs. Koontz had to show that her husband was at fault, that he had improperly driven the car, that he was inattentive, that he was reckless, and so on.

Justices John Marshall Harlan, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Charles Evans Hughes, three of the truly great justices in the whole history of the United States Supreme Court, filed a strong dissenting opinion which I believe more closely responded to the demands of law, reason and logic — to say nothing of justice — than the Majority Opinion. Justice Harlan, supported by Justices Holmes and Hughes, said: “If the husband violently takes possession of his wife’s property and withholds it from her she may, under the statute, sue him, separately, for its recovery. But such a civil action will be one in tort. If he injures or destroys her property she may, under the statute, sue him, separately, for damages. That action would also be one in tort. If these propositions are disputed, what becomes of the words in the statute to the effect that she may ‘sue separately for the recovery, security and protection’ of her property? But if they are conceded —as I think they must be — then Congress, under the construction now placed by the court on the statute, is put in the anomalous position of allowing a married woman to sue her husband separately, in tort, for the recovery of her property, but denying her the right or privilege to sue him separately, in tort, for damages arising from his brutal assaults upon her person.
