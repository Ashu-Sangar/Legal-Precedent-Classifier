Subsequently, the court dismissed appellant’s motion for judgment n.o.v. and new trial. The court dismissed appellee’s motion for judgment n.o.v. as to damages but granted him a new trial limited to the issue of damages for detention of the premises.

At this meeting with Mr. Doyle, in 1960, what was discussed? A. Your Honor, do you mean before the settlement or during this time? Q. In April, 1960. A. April, 1960 in his office? Well, may I talk to you — Q. Talk to the members of the Jury. A. We went over there to the office and Mr. Doyle accepted 420 — I forget now what item it was, 400 and some odd dollars. He said, ‘This covers the two notes. Now I’ll get a hold of my lawyer and I’ll tell him to stop the block,’ whatever that meant I don’t know, and he said — I imagine it was a Sheriff’s Sale. He said ‘You go ahead and get your mortgage and everything will be all right, I’m not interested in the house, I want my money.’ Q. Was there anything else said? A. He asked me what in the name of God did I put $1700 in the house for in repairs, and I told him. I told him he knew it at the time. Q. Aside from that, I mean, what else was said in regard to foreclosure of the property? A. He says, ‘You go ahead and get a mortgage <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>and you can have your house.’ Q.

And he said that he was going to call you to stop the sale and — Q. Did he ever tell you that he would give you a 30 day extension? Mr. Kilimink: I’m sorry, your Honor, but I don’t think she had quite finished. The Court: Let her finish. A. And he said, ‘If you still want your house, you better get a mortgage.’ And I says, ‘Well, I am trying to.’ And he says, ‘Well, maybe I can help you out.’ So he says, ‘You get it straightened out.’ And I shook hands with Mr. Doyle and walked out. Q. Did Mr. Doyle tell you he was going to get you a mortgage? A. He said he would see what he could do. Q. Did he tell you he was going to get you a mortgage? A. I answered your question.

And what happened at that place? A. Got the same answer we got at 52nd Street. Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whether any other attempts have been made to obtain a mortgage on the property owned by your mother? A. We have tried, but we got turned down on each one of the places. <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>Q.

I don’t think it should be withdrawn, I think the record should show the question has been asked and no answer given. The Court: Read the question. (Read back by Stenographer.) The witness: Yes, I do. He said to us that he didn’t want the property, he just wanted money.
