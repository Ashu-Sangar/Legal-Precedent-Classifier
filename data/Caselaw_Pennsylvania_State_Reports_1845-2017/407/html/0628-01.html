Plaintiff filed a petition for Declaratory Judgment and joined as respondents all persons who might have an interest, i.e., all who suffered personal injuries or property damage or both. The petition contained two causes of action. In the first cause of action, plaintiff seeks a declaration that it is not liable to any of the respondents because, at the time of the accidents, Wallace W. Kearns was <em>not </em>operating the automobile with the <em>permission </em>of Miriam B. Kearns and therefore was not an “insured” under the provisions of the policy in question. In the second cause of action, plaintiff seeks a declaration that, even if Wallace W. Kearns was an insured under the policy, it is not liable to any of the respondents because the damages were <em>intentionally caused </em>by Wallace W. Kearns and such damages are specifically excluded under the terms of the policy.</p>
