Their mere presence upon the premises raises no presumption that they were “business visitors.” That they were such may not be conjectured.

Lavin, assistant chief of police, was making his night rounds in Sharon in the area of the Shenango Eiver close to Sharpsville Avenue and the Ohio Street Bridge when he stopped to try the doors of the Thomas Building, a one-story concrete block structure, owned and occupied by J. Fred Thomas, ex-mayor of Sharon and one time state senator of Pennsylvania. The door yielded to pressure and Lavin entered the building. He noted that a light was burning in the rear room overlooking the river. He approached the window of that rear office, and looked in, and beheld Thomas slumped in a chair. To his left a man was lying inertly on the floor and in the southwest corner of the room Lavin detected a woman on her side, also apparently helpless. He broke into the room, examined the body of Mr. Thomas and concluded life had left it. He bent over the body of the woman and discovered no sign of breathing.

He could find no telephone although the room was obviously an office.

A few moments later the fire department put in its appearance with oxygen equipment, and artificial respiration was applied to the man gasping on the floor, Carl F. Davies.

If Thomas was negligent in allowing an instrumentality or device on his property which could endanger the lives of others, he would be liable in damages to those who suffered because of that dangerous agency. Thomas would not have to have had direct knowledge of the perilous device on his property in order to be found liable. Without immediate access to statistics on the subject I believe it would be safe to say that there are as many cases where the property owner is liable because of constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition on his land as where he has positive knowledge of that condition.</p>

In order properly to evaluate the factors moving in this entire unfortunate episode, it must be stated at once that Thomas was an ill man on the day he fell beneath the cobra touch of the carbon monoxide. For some time he had been under doctor’s care because of arterio-arthritis and arteriosclerosis. On October 22, 1959 his physician, Dr. E. F. Conlin, instructed him to cease driving his automobile because his condition would not permit it. He told Thomas this in the presence of his step-daughter, Mrs. Davies and her husband, Carl E. Davies, and both immediately committed themselves to the task of providing Thomas with transportation every day. Thus, it is the most natural inference in the world that on the day of the crucial event of November 18, 1959, Mr. and Mrs. Davies were in the Thomas office in the late afternoon for the purpose of driving him home. While they were there, Thomas had a seizure and Dr. Conlin was called. The doctor treated Thomas and then left him under the care of the Davies. Dr. Conlin testified that Thomas had responded to his treatment and it was agreed between the doctor and the Davies that they would keep Thomas at the office for approximately an hour and then take him home. It was during this fate-laden hour that the carbon monoxide struck fatally.</p>

    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[140,583,1149,371]]]'>The Majority Opinion says: “The determinative issue is: Was the proof at trial legally sufficient to warrant the submission of the question of negligence to the jury? In evaluating the testimony in this respect, the record must necessarily be read <em>in the Kght most favorable to the plaintiffs’ cause.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[134,965,1153,918]]]'>It does not seem to me that the Majority has so read the record, because the record, even without the favoring light to which the Majority adverts, speaks out boldly for a jury determination. Denying the plaintiffs that determination is to deny them fundamental justice as written into current law. Denying them that determination is to repudiate stare decisis. Denying them that determination is to penalize them for responding to the highest duty known to mankind, that of assisting others in mortal danger. There is no superior duty to this, whether it be written in a code, emblazoned in statutes, or proclaimed through court decisions. This is rudimentary, fundamental, natural law. A world of people could not exist without it. It is the basis of every system of jurisprudence, it is the heartbeat of government, it is the breath of the nostrils of organized society.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[131,1891,1152,532]]]'>It would be regrettable enough if the Majority’s decision were based on a technicality. To surround the temple of the law by a fence barbed with the spear points of technicalities, meaningless abstractions, and empty formalisms would indeed be deplorable. But the Majority’s decision fails in a graver degree than this because even the technicalities of the law favor the determination of this cause by the fact-finding tribunal established by the Constitution for resolving just such issues.</p>

      <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>The precedents of this Court and the law of the land invite Carl Davies and the administrator of the estate of his dead wife into that tribunal. Since the Majority of this Court has closed that door to these legally-deserving plaintiffs, I must note a vigorous Dissent.</p>
