Burson, an employee of defendant School District of <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>North Franklin Township. Defendant School District filed an answer to plaintiffs’ complaint alleging under New Matter, that it is immune from suit for the negligence of its employees while engaged in the governmental functions of the School District, and praying that the suit be dismissed. Plaintiffs then filed an Answer to New Matter averring that at the time of the occurrence of the injury .the School District was fully <em>insured </em>against the risk involved in this case. Plaintiffs further averred that the insurance constituted a waiver of the defense of governmental immunity from suit and that in any event, by reason of such insurance, plaintiffs are entitled to maintain this action and recover a judgment against the School District to the extent of the insurance coverage. Defendant School District thereupon filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Court en banc directed the entry of judgment in favor of defendant School District. From that judgment, plaintiffs took these • appeals.</p>

The fallacy in this contention is demonstrated by <em>Morris v. Mt.

It follows that a School District which purchases liability insurance does receive value since it protects itself against liability arising from its participation <a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>in proprietary functions.
