Fawcett, 78 years of age, was president, active head, manager and chief salesman for the corporation, that financial statements were not given to anyone and that FaAvcett resented inquiries into the financial status of the business to the extent that, upon the declaration of dividends, he paid, by cash or cashier’s checks, the amount of the dividends. Between 1950-1954 there were no known sales of the stock and Fawcett testified that no one besides himself kneAV the value of the stock and, even though he did not know the market value exactly, he would never offer $800 per share for the stock. Thus, the record presents the picture of a corporation around whose financial condition Fawcett had drawn an “iron curtain”, <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>a corporation completely dominated by a man of advanced years who went to unusual lengths to hide — for no other reason than that it was not the business of anyone else — its financial condition. The only value which Fawcett would give was its <em>par </em>value of $50 per share. Against this background, appellants sought to prove the “fair” value of this stock.</p>

K. Stull, a certified public accountant who had examined Penn’s records. At first, the court beloAV sustained an objection to this testimony, then later the court permitted such testimony to be taken and, again later, in its adjudication, rejected such testimony. In this respect, the court erred. This testimony was material and relevant and, for the purpose of these appeals, we have considered this testimony as tending to show a value of at least $800 per share on Penn stock. Furthermore, the dividend record of Penn clearly and unequivocally shows that the value of $50 per share for this stock was ridiculous. Dividends were paid during the pertinent years as follows: 1950-$100, 1951-flOO, 1952-$150, 1954-$10Q or a total of $450.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The record facts indicate that Penn stock had a value of approximately $800 per share during this period; in fact, payment of taxes on the basis of $800 per share by the estate with the acquiescence of McCreight would seem to preclude him from questioning that value.</p>

The record indicates that, <em>after </em>the death of testatrix’ husband and <em>prior </em>to the execution of the first will, McCreight filed an inventory in testatrix’ husband’s estate in which the value of the stock was given as $50 per share. When he inquired of a Washington, Pa., stockholder, according to Mc-Creight’s testimony, he was told the stock had “no value”; upon acquainting testatrix with that information she told him that the stock paid dividends, that it did have value and that he should inquire from Fawcett as to the value of the stock; that he inquired of Fawcett and was told that the “fair” value was $50 per share.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> If such testimony is to be believed, then, prior to the execution of the first will, all McCreight knew was that the stock had a value of $50 per share.

Though there was no direct evidence of knowledge on McCreight’s part of the dividend of $100 paid in October, 1950, the tax return for 1950 of testatrix’ husband, to whom this dividend had been paid, was in Mc-<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>Creight’s office. Again, though there was no direct evidence that McCreight knew of the dividend of $100 per share paid in January, 1954, a notation of the receipt of that dividend was in an account book which was in McCreight’s possession. Even if McCreight had knowledge only of the 1951 and 1952 dividends totalling $250, it taxes one’s credulity that a lawyer would believe that a stock productive of such dividends had a value of only $50 per share, 20% of the two-year dividends.</p>

Upon relating this to testatrix, McCreight, according to his testimony, was told by the testatrix that Fawcett had already talked to her about a sale or liquidation of Penn but had assured her that, if that happened, he would take care of her interests. Bigler testified that in his conversation with McCreight, the only reference to Penn arose in connection with a discussion of his lack of collateral for the loan which he sought and he stated that, ultimately, he might get some collateral “possibly through a sale of the stock, or a liquidation of the stock” in Penn which Bigler’s father-in-law owned. Beading Bigler’s testimony, it is clear that when he referred to a sale or liquidation it was not of Penn but of his father-in-law’s stock in Penn.

In view of this dividend record, how could testatrix have been lulled into believing by anything McCreight told her that the stock was worth only $50 per share?

Stated otherwise, what evidence is there on this record that testatrix intended McCreight to be the beneficiary only of 84 shares of Penn worth $50 per share and not of <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>84 shares of Penn worth $800 per share?

Furthermore, absent any proof of undue influence, the fact that a will appears to be unnatural is not ground for setting it or any of its provisions aside.

There cannot be the slightest doubt that it would have been far wiser had McCreight done so. At the hearing, McCreight testified that he had so advised testatrix but that she had refused his suggestion, although in his depositions taken six weeks prior to the trial McCreight did not so testify.
