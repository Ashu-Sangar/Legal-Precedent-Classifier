    <p id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.10",284,[252,1038,1146,155]]]'>This appeal was taken from the final decree which dismissed Plaintiffs’ Bill. The facts are not in dispute and the issue is solely a question of law.</p>
    <p id="b284-8" data-blocks='[["BL_284.11",284,[251,1202,1146,426]]]'>The defendant is a social club with 382 voting members. A special meeting was called, upon proper notice, to vote upon a motion to sell a portion of its real estate. 93 members attended the meeting and 91 of them voted upon the motion. 52 members voted “Aye” and 39 members voted “Nay”. The appellants contend that a majority <em>of all of the members </em>of the club, i.e., 192 are required to pass the motion.</p>
