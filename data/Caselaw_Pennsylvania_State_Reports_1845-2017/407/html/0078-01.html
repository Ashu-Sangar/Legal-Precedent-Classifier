Subsequently the legitimate daughter filed a bill in equity to require this $4000 to be paid to her. It was dismissed without prejudice to the rights of the parties so far as compensation was concerned, on payment of $2000 to the legitimate daughter. Compensation . . . was awarded the legitimate daughter, and ... on behalf of the illegitimate children.

By ‘widow’ is meant lawful widow, and by ‘children’ is meant legitimate children: [citing cases]. Neither [the employee’s widow by the invalid marriage], nor her children, could take any of [the employee’s] personal estate, in case of his death intestate. . . . The illegitimate children had no legal claim against [the third person] for damages because of the death of their father, the employee. The sole right of action under the law was in the legitimate daughter. . . . Under the law the illegitimate children were entitled to no part of these damages. . . . The subrogation rights . . . were not increased by the fact that [the legitimate daughter], in the settlement of her equity suit, chose to divide the damages legally payable to her with the illegitimate children of her father.” <em>Mols </em>clearly repudiates appellant’s present contention.</p>

It is not a matter of guess or conjecture, but must be grounded on reasonably continuous past acts or conduct of the deceased: [citing cases]. The reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage to one standing in the family relation may be shown in many ways . . .; to be reasonable, the services and gifts must have been rendered with a frequency that begets an anticipation of their continuance <em>; </em>occasional gifts and services are not sufficient on which to ground a pecuniary loss: . . . .” Neither expressly nor by implication has the petitioner averred that these illegitimate children have suffered the loss of a reasonable expectation of a pecuniary advantage by reason of their father’s death for which they would be entitled to recover in this action.</p>

      <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[226,1996,1149,358]]]'> As appellee points out in its briefs: “While text writers point to instances of judicial approval of the right to include an illegitimate child as a beneficiary in an action for wrongful death of the mother or vice versa, such decisions are not applicable here. The theory underlying those cases is that where there are laws allowing inheritance between a mother and an illegitimate child, it is presumed that the legislature intended to allow recovery of wrongful death benefits by or for a mother.”</p>
