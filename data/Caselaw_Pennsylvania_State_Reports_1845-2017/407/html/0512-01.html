The test to apply in order to determine whether such inseparability exists has been variously stated, — sometimes that the criterion is the ‘main and dominant purpose of the testator’ (Johnston's Estate, <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>, 192, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%20879" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="39 A. 879">39 A. 879</a>, 883), other times that the inquiry should be directed to ascertaining whether ‘the striking down of the void gifts would, in vital matters, so <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>emasculate Ms [the testator’s] plan of distribution, as to render it reasonably certain he would not have made the will in the way he did had he known it could not be sustained in the respects in which it must be set aside.’ (McCaskey's Estate, <a href="/pa/293/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="293 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1111154" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0497-01">293 Pa. 497</a>, 508, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20209" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="143 A. 209">143 A. 209</a>, 213). In other words, would the testator probably have desired that all the limitations of the trust should stand or fall together? Is the ultimate limitation apparently so essential to his dispositive scheme that it can be inferred that, if it were to be declared invalid, he would not have wanted the prior limitations to continue in existence?”</p>

The Court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice von Moschzisker said (pages 288-289) : . . When a will shows such a condition of affairs, the life interests which support the illegal ultimate limitations fall with the latter, because they are all part of a common testamentary scheme violative of the rule against perpetuities. This result follows without regard to whether the testator, with actual knowledge of the rule, deliberately planned to defeat it; in such cases, the point is, does the general testamentary scheme under attack indicate a plan in which the dominant intent was not to create life estates particularly to benefit those who were to enjoy them, but to create such estates as in<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>cidental to and for the principal purpose of supporting remainders which might not vest till a time beyond that allowed by law?
