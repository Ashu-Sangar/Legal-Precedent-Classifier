Marhoefer answered and also filed a complaint joining Seisel Construction Company as additional defendant. Seisel Construction Company answered Marhoefer’s complaint and also joined Steel City Piping Company and Hale-Devlin, Inc., as additional defendants. In April, 1958, both Steel City and Hale-Devlin filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to Seisel Company’s complaint on the ground that the cause of action on which they were joined was separate and distinct from the cause of action sued on by plaintiff; they also objected to the jurisdiction of the Court on the ground that the contract between each of them and Seisel Company contained a provision to arbitrate.</p>

During this 3% years no action was taken by anyone with respect to the aforesaid preliminary objections until the same were praeciped for argument by Steel City and Hale-Devlin in October, 1961. The lower Court dismissed the preliminary objections and declared that in the instant case there is a strong presumption that a delay of 3 <em>y2 </em>years by additional defendants in praeciping their preliminary objections to argument was prejudicial to plaintiff. Steel City and Hale-Devlin appealed from the Order which dismissed their preliminary objections.</p>

We there pointed out that the test of jurisdiction was the competency of the court to determine controversies of the general class to which the case presented for its consideration belonged, — whether the court had power to enter upon the inquiry, not whether it might ultimately decide that it was unable to grant the relief sought in the particular case; that the Act of 1925 was not intended to furnish a short cut to a determination of the issues of law or fact raised by the pleadings and that it was not concerned with matters going to the right of the plaintiff to recover on his cause of action but only with his right to have his cause of action heard and determined. ...</p>
