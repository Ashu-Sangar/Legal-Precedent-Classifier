    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[122,852,1151,644]]]'>Appellants commenced an action of assumpsit against appellee alleging that they were third-party beneficiaries of the contract of lease between appellee and Mid-Atlantic and that appellee had breached the contract by failing to make repairs, abate nuisances, indemnify Mid-Atlantic and pay appellants for their claims. Appellee filed preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer, which were sustained, the complaint dismissed and judgment entered for appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> It is from the entry of judgment for appellee in this assumpsit action that appellants appeal.</p>

The intention of the parties in <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>this respect is determined by the terms of the contract as a whole, construed in the light of the circumstances under which it was made.” 12 Am.

    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[236,634,1149,860]]]'>There is nothing in the terms of the contract, construed in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, which leads to the conclusion that the parties intended it to benefit anyone but themselves. The learned court below, in its opinion sustaining the demurrer, aptly asked and answered the controlling question as follows: “Can it be that this landlord and this tenant had the notion that their contract include a husband whose wife was injured on the leased premises, or even the injured wife. The present lease-contract does not contemplate or touch such beneficence to a third party as beneficiary. Rather, the intent is to benefit only the landlord in certain circumstances by holding him free from liability. The landlord is the one to be indemnified of any liability he might brace against.”</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[233,1505,1148,642]]]'>A careful scrutiny of the instrument sued upon convinces us that the court below correctly decided that: “Here, the tenant and landlord agreed that if the landlord is sued, the tenant will protect and defend and pay, if liable, and to make sure of the effectuation of any contingency the tenant was to get a ‘liability policy.’ It is an agreed sequence and consequence in the thread of relationship as landlord and tenant; it means that and not more. It is a duty of the tenant created by the will of the parties and by no reasonable contemplation or expectation could reach to and include anyone but the promisee.”</p>
