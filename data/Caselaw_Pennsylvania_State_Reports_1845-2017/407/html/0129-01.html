Although appellant initially attacked the statute upon a variety of grounds under the federal constitution, these issues have been foreclosed by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Two Guys from Harrison v.

Appellant now asserts only two bases for the alleged invalidity: (1) that the act violates Article III, §7, of the Pennsylvania Constitution in that it is a local or special law regulating labor or trade and (2) that the act violates the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution because its enforcement has been conducted in a discriminatory manner by the Philadelphia officials charged with the duty of enforcement.</p>

In finding no clear constitutional violation, this Court, in an opinion by former Chief Justice Charles Alvin Jones, stated: “Likewise, since it has also been held that the Act of 1959 does not violate the ‘equal protection’ clause of the Federal Constitution, it would be equally unreasonable for us to conclude that the Act plainly violates Article III, Section 7, or Article XVI, Section 3, of the Pennsylvania Constitution.”</p>

And, as indicated above, it does not exist as an isolated enactment but rather as one increasing penalties in a certain area of generally restricted activity. Justice Frankfurter, concurring in the <em>Two Guys </em>decision, pointed out the bases upon which the reasonableness of the 1959 Act must be upheld : “Rather it [the 1959 statute] singles out the area where a danger has been made most evident, and within that area treats all business enterprises equally. That in so doing it may have drawn the line between the sale of a sofa cover, punished by a hundred-dollar fine, and the sale of an automobile seat cover, punished by a four dollar fine, is not sufficient to void the legislation. ‘[A] State may classify with reference to the evil to be prevented, and ... if the class discriminated against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly is to be feared, it properly may be picked out. A lack of abstract symmetry does not matter. The question is a practical one dependent upon experience. The demand for sym<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>metry ignores the specific difference that experience is supposed to have shown to mark the class. It is not enough to invalidate the law that others may do the same thing and go unpunished, if, as a matter of fact, it is found that the danger is characteristic of the class named.’ Mr. Justice Holmes, in Patsone v. Pennsylvania, <a href="/us/232/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="232 U.S. 138" data-case-ids="3671937" data-case-paths="/us/232/0138-01">232 U.

    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[270,750,1145,315]]]'>This reasoning is equally as applicable to the question here before us.

    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[263,1084,1151,640]]]'>Appellant’s second point of attack is that the statute violates the federal constitution because of a policy of discriminatory enforcement. In this respect the court below originally found as a fact (No. 14) that the Police Commissioner of Philadelphia had established a policy of enforcing the act only against employees of certain large retail establishments. It also found as facts (Nos. 11 and 12) that this enforcement policy was followed because of limited personnel available to the commissioner, no findings being made, however, that the policy resulted from any arbitrary and evil design.</p>

Secondly, Police Commissioner Gibbons is no longer in office (nor is District Attorney Blanc, the other defendant directly involved in law enforcement activity); and no findings regarding enforcement were made as to the other defendants. This means that we are being asked to authorize the issuance of an injunction against a public official as a re-<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>suit of an alleged policy of discrimination set by Mm when he is no longer able to enforce the statute.

But, as likewise there stated, the power is not unrestricted; its exercise, like that of all other governmental powers, is subject to constitutional limitations and judicial review. By a host of authorities, Federal and State alike, it has been held that a law which purports to be an exercise of the police power must not be unreasonable, unduly oppressive or patently beyond the necessities of the case, and the means which it employs must have a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained. Under the guise of protecting the public interests the legislature may not arbitrarily interfere with private business or impose unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon lawful occupations. The question whether any particular statutory provision is so related to the public good and so reasonable in the means it prescribes as to justify the exercise of the police power, is one for the judgment, in the first instance, of the law-making branch of the government, but its final determination is for the court.”</p>
