Faller was dissolved by divorce in August, 1952. In connection with a property settlement attendant on the divorce proceeding, decedent, on August 20, 1952, created two inter vivos trusts wherein Wilkinsburg Real Estate and Trust Company (Trust Company) was the sole trustee; (1) the first trust provides that certain securities (then valued at $15,137.50) be held in trust to pay the net income therefrom to Gladys C. Faller during her life or until her remarriage, and, upon her death or ■ remarriage, the principal is to be divided between the children of Gladys C. Faller and decedent; (2) the second trust provides that an undivided one-third interest in certain realty be held in trust to pay the income to decedent during his lifetime and, upon his death, to pay the income to Gladys C. Faller and, upon her death or re<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>marriage, <em>after decedent’s </em>death, the principal of the trust is to be part of decedent’s estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Faller who, together with three children of the first marriage and the divorced wife, survived him. Under decedent’s will — the terms of which are not presently pertinent — decedent named the Trust Company and his son, F. B. Faller, as executors.</p>

Willison, president of the Trust Company, and counsel for the estate, Attorney Norman Davies, advised the widow, Helen C. Faller, to elect to take against the will and to secure her own counsel. Mrs. Faller adopted their advice and on September 9, 1960 éngaged the services of Attorney Ellsworth Jordan. On September 9, 1960, Mrs. Faller filed an election to take against decedent’s will which was filed within the time provided by Section 11 of the Wills Act of 1947 (Act of April 24,1947, P. L. 89, §11, 20 PS §180.11).</p>

L. 100, as amended by the Act of February 17, 1956 (1955), P. L. 1073, §4, 20 PS §301.11). The Trust Company then filed in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County a petition to annul Mrs. Faller’s election to take against those trusts on the grounds: (1) that the election was made more than one year after probate of the will (November 5, <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>1959) and (2) since in neither trust decedent retained either a power of appointment by will or a power of revocation or consumption over the principal, neither trust is within Section 11 of the Estates Act of 1947, supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After answer filed, the matter was heard before Judge William S. Rai-iausek. After hearing, Judge Rahausek found that the widow’s election to take against the trusts had been <em>untimely </em>filed and annulled her election. Exceptions to that decree were dismissed by the court en banc; from its decree Mrs. Helen Faller has taken this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[244,960,1153,916]]]'>Mrs. Faller admits: (1) that Section 11(d) of the Estates Act of 1947, supra, requires that the election be filed within a year of the date of probate of the will or an application for an extension of the time made within the year; (2) that her election was <em>not </em>filed within the year and no application for an extension made within the year. However, Mrs. Faller would excuse this belated filing on two grounds: (a) that she had no <em>knowledge </em>of the existence of either trust until December 12, 1960 when she was so informed through her counsel, Attorney Jordan; (b) that, during the period from the death of her husband on October 27, 1959 until she retained Attorney Jordan on September 12, 1960, she relied solely upon the advice and counsel of the Trust Company president and the counsel for the estate and they withheld from her any knowledge of the existence of such trusts.</p>
