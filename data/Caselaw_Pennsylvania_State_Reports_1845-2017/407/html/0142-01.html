Robert Bryans is the lessee and the appellees are the lessors. The clause is as follows: “The tenant hereby releases the landlord from all responsibility, and expressly assumes all liability, in any action for damages which may arise from any kind of injury, to anyone, by and on account <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>of the use, or misuse, of the demised premises, or by and on account of any physical condition whatsoever that may at any time exist upon the premises, or the sidewalk adjacent thereto, during the term of this lease. Provided, however, that in respect to the condition of the premises or sidewalk adjacent thereto, this clause shall not apply in any case where the Landlord shall have received written notice from Tenant of any defect in said premises or the sidewalk adjacent thereto, within a reasonable time after the Tenant has knowledge thereof. Provided, further, that nothing in this clause shall be construed to relieve the Tenant from taking all necessary measures, during the interval between the Tenant’s knowledge of the defect and the Landlord’s repair thereof, to protect the public and others from injury by reason of such defect.”</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[246,1225,1145,367]]]'>We are presented with the legal question of the effect of the foregoing paragraph. The verdict was directed for defendants by the trial judge, based solely on the exculpatory effect of the paragraph and the matter of negligence of defendants and contributory negligence of the plaintiff was not considered and did not enter into the judge’s action.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[241,1612,1148,749]],["BL_167.1",167,[111,340,1151,480]]]'>The essential facts are that the parties entered into a written lease and the plaintiff became a tenant of the defendants on September 1, 1957. The leased premises was an apartment in a building that had been previously a single dwelling but had been converted into an apartment building. The former single dwelling was converted into five apartments, one of which the plaintiff leased. The premises are located on West Chester Pike, Delaware County. The apartment building is located about 75 yards from West Chester Pike and has a macadam or black top driveway, which driveway is the only means for ingress and egress of pedestrians and vehicular traffic to the apartment building. The plaintiff used this means of ingress and egress daily <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>from tlie time lie became a tenant until January 9,1958, when he fell on the drive when leaving his apartment in the morning. He described the condition of the surface of the driveway as consisting of loose stones of various size scattered on the surface, which had become covered with snow and ice and when he stepped on some of the stones his right foot slipped backwards off a stone, which was covered with an icy surface and he fell on his right knee and was injured.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[111,831,1149,642]]]'>The trial judge, in stating his reason for granting a directed verdict in favor of the defendants, pointed out that the direction was based upon the fact that the plaintiff had signed a lease in which he agreed to the exculpatory clause in it. No factual dispute is present for our purpose of determining the issue before us since it is solely a question of law. It has been held that a tenant may sign a lease agreeing to release the landlord from liability for damages arising from negligence on the part of the landlord, if the public policy of the law is not contravened and in the absence of a statute prohibiting the action by the parties.</p>
