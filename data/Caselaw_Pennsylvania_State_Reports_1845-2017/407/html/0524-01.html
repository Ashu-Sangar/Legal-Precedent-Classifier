L. 1333, §1102, 25 P.S. §3002, the voters of New Kensington, in 1953; of Arnold, in 1954; and of Lower Burrell, in 1956, adopted <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>by referenda the use of voting machines. Since the time of their purchase by the county commissioners and approval by the secretary of the Commonwealth, voting machines have been used in all primary and general elections within these communities. The qualified electors of said municipalities have not voted to discontinue the use of the machines.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[228,751,1152,523]]]'>In early 1962, the county commissioners, acting as the county board of election, decided that paper ballots were to be used in the forthcoming primary election.. The ostensible reason for the commissioners’ action was to “eliminate the confusion resulting from write-in candidates on the voting machines at primary elections. . . .” Notwithstanding widespread protests from electors in the affected communities, the commissioners ordered ballots printed for the primary. This class action followed.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[225,1295,1147,532]]]'>As long ago as <em>Davidowitz v.

They have been installed in the various counties at great expense and by vote of a majority of the electors thereof. A court, therefore, should not restrain their use unless a legislative or constitutional provision is clearly violated.”</p>

L. 1333, §1116, 25 PS §3016 that: “If a method of election for any candidates or offices is prescribed by law, in which the use of voting machines is not possible or practicable, or in case, at any election, the number of candidates nominated or seeking nomination for any office renders the use of voting machines for such-office at such election impracticable, or <em>if, for any other </em>

    <p id="b549-7" data-blocks='[["BL_549.7",549,[101,1783,1149,427]]]'>The legislature, in the Act of 1937, §1116, 25 PS §3016, determined under what conditions the use of the voting machine may be discontinued once they have been approved by the electorate. The board of county commissioners, acting as the county election board, is bound by this legislative expression and can substitute paper ballots for the voting machines only upon a clear showing that their use is not possible or practicable.</p>
