Topelski (Topelski), a police officer of Allegheny County (County) on a county-owned motorcycle in the line of duty, was escorting three automobiles containing as passengers “Lone Banger”, “Tonto” and other television entertainers in an easterly direction along East Carson Street, Pittsburgh. At the intersection of East Carson and South 18th Streets, the motorcycle operated by Topelski and a 1953 Mercury automobile owned by Francis J.

(Universal) in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Crane then joined as an additional defendant the County alleging that the County was either solely or jointly liable by reason of its negligent acts as Topelski’s employer. The County filed an answer and counterclaim in the latter of which it asked recovery for salary, medical and hospital expenses paid to or for Topelski. The case was tried before Judge Homer S. Brown and a jury. The jury found Crane, Universal and the County guilty of negligence and awarded a verdict in favor of Topelski in the amount of $50,000 against all three defendants and the verdict as moulded found in favor of Crane and Universal <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>against tlie County on the County’s counterclaim. Universal and Crane moved for judgment n.o.v. and the County moved for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial. All these motions were refused and judgments entered on the verdict. Crane (Appeal No. 140) and Universal (Appeal No. 91) appealed from the refusal of judgment n.o.v. only. The County (Appeal No. 145) has appealed from the refusal of judgment n.o.v. and the refusal of a new trial.</p>

In Universal’s appeal, the contention is that, in addition to Topelski being guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, Topelski had failed to prove any negligent conduct on Universal’s part which was the proximate cause of the accident. In the County’s appeal, the County contends that it is entitled to a judgment n.o.v. because the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the verdict against it or, in the alternative, it is entitled to a new trial because the court below erred in moulding the verdict and in failing to recognize the County’s subrogation rights for payments made to or for Topelski.</p>

He stated: “Before I entered the intersection I looked to my left, that would be down 18th Street, and then I looked to my right, and I saw one car coming down 18th Street” in a northerly direction; Topelski raised his hand to the oncoming car to stop and that car did stop; Topelski looked to the left again and saw nothing, looked in his rearview mirror to see <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>where his convoy was and continued at approximately five miles per hour; he then stated: “I looked to the right as I kept moving down the intersection” and stated that, as he “paused at the intersection”, he “looked to his right”. Under this testimony, Topelski, with a green light in his favor, did look both to his right and left before proceeding into the intersection; there was no traffic approaching from the left and the automobile which he did see approaching from his right stopped in obedience either to his signal or to the red light against traffic proceeding on 18th Street. Furthermore, Topelski blew his siren, proof of which is upon this record. The Crane automobile came from behind the stopped automobile on South 18th Street, passed the stopped automobile and proceeded into the intersection where it collided with Topelski’s motorcycle.</p>

Our review of this record indicates that the circumstances are such that contributory negligence <em>could not </em>be declared as a matter of law. As Topelski approached this intersection, according to his testimony, the traffic signal was green and he had the right to assume that this traffic signal, red as to 18th Street, would be obeyed by traffic on that street: <em>Zurcher v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., </em><a href="/pa/353/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="353 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="465874" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0212-01">353 Pa. 212</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20581" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="44 A.2d 581">44 A. 2d 581</a>; <em>Koehler v.

Topelski, however, did not place full and complete reliance on the traffic signal because, <em>at the intersection, </em>he looked in both directions before proceeding into the intersection. To his right he saw one automobile approaching in a northerly direction and, before he proceeded, he made sure that that car had stopped and he rightfully assumed that all following traffic would <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>likewise stop. He then looked to Ms left and, as was Ms duty, looked to Ms rear to check the convoy which he was under a duty to escort. He had no reason to anticipate that a car would swoop out from the rear of the stopped automoMle on 18th Street, swing around that vehicle and enter the intersection to which he was committed at the time. The language of Justice (later Chief Justice) Maxey in <em>Graff v. Scott Bros., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/315/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="315 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1156722" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0262-01">315 Pa. 262</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.2d%20659" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="172 A.2d 659">172 A. 2d 659</a>, is particularly apposite: “He not only looked ahead but he looked <em>to the right, </em>where he saw the halted cars. He was under no obligation to look far down the street to ascertain whether or not some motorist was coming at a reckless rate of speed which would carry Mm across the intersection in defiance of the red traffic signal. Furthermore, in his calculations, he had the right to assume traffic from his right would stand still until it was given the green signal. . . .” (pp. 266, 267) In our view, the question of contributory negligence was solely for the jury and judgment n.o.v. could not be entered on the ground that Topelski was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. Since this is the <em>only </em>ground of Crane’s appeal, that appeal cannot be sustained.</p>

      <em>After </em>the accident Crane’s automobile was taken to the City Pound where it remained from September 1 to September 5, 1959 when it was taken to Universal’s garage where it was examined on September 20, 1959 by Leo Geis, an expert mechanic, in the presence of one Davis, a county police officer. Geis testified: “A. I jacked the car up, got underneath it, checked all the cables, the rods, and I could see that they weren’t <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>touched. They were all rusted and full of — you couldn’t even see the nuts on them. So that was an indication that nobody had touched them. Q. What was their condition? A. There just weren’t any brake.” Geis further stated that the brake lining on the front wheels was new and the brakes were in good condition but the emergency brake did not engage at all and the cables were loose. There was too much free pedal travel between the master cylinder and the foot brake. On removing the front wheels he found: “The eccentric bolts on the brake were not properly adjusted. By that, the shoe was wore on the bottom of the shoe, where it should have been wore ever around. I would say it was improperly adjusted.”</p>

The evidence has been objected to as too remote. The mere passage of time, unless considerably greater than twenty days, cannot change the condition of the brakes. The greater the passage of time, however, the greater the opportunity there is to deal unfairly with the evidence, and cause the evidence <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>to reflect a condition that did not actually exist at the time of the accident. This could also be accomplished in a few minutes. Whenever the condition of a thing is in question, evidence of its condition at a prior or subsequent time is admissible if accompanied by proof that its condition has not changed in the meantime, [citing a case]. Where a car is not used between the time of an accident and the time of its inspection about a month later, and it was under lock and key in the meantime, it is not error to admit testimony as to the condition of the brakes at the time of the examination, in the absence of evidence that the car was used, [citing a case]. In the case before us, there was evidence to the effect that the car was towed from the scene of the accident to the City Pound immediately following the accident; that the automobile remained in the City Pound for the five days succeeding the accident; and in the possession of [Universal] the remaining period before the inspection took place. There was no testimony to the effect that the automobile had been used after the accident. There was evidence to the effect that the automobile was not in condition to be used before the inspection. Thus, the only element of remoteness proved was the mere passage of time. The testimony provided evidence from which the jury might infer that the condition of the vehicle had not changed, through use or otherwise, during the twenty days.</p>

On cross-examination by Topelski’s counsel, Carr testified: “Q. Did you give them [officers in the detail] any instructions if they came to a red light at an intersection? A.

In the case at bar, the County sought to enforce its subrogation rights against Crane, one of the alleged tortfeasors, and the procedure it adopted was improper. “Under our practice the right of subrogation can only be enforced in the original action and not in a separate suit in the name of the <em>city Philadelphia v.
