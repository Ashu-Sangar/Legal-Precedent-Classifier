Prior to May, 1957, Axilbund had dealt with Filbert, having on one occasion represented the seller of a property which Filbert purchased and on another occasion rented some building space for Filbert. It is undisputed that, in the early part of May, 1957, Jacob Axilbund, at Mc-Allister’s invitation, met with McAllister to discuss the sale of the Filbert building and, at that meeting, Jacob Axilbund tried, without success, to secure from Filbert <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>for Axilbund an exclusive sales agency for the building. Finally, as appears from a stipulation entered into at trial, McAllister, acting for Filbert, informed Axilbund that “if they produced a purchaser for the premises for $300,000 net,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the usual brokerage commission would be paid”. <em>At that meeting Jacob Axilbund told McAllister that Axilbund had a client named Julius Gross whom, he </em>believed, <em>could use the building </em>and he said he would arrange to have Gross inspect the building.</p>
    <p id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[238,881,1150,1023]]]'>At that time Axilbund, which two months previously had sold a property for Julius Gross,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> was looking for a building suitable for purchase by Gross and tc which he could move his printing establishment. Upon Jacob Axilbund’s return from this meeting with Mc-Allister, he informed his partner Balsam of the availability for purchase of the Filbert building and Balsam then contacted Gross. From that time on Jacob Axilbund had only three contacts with Filbert: (1) that same day to arrange for an inspection of the building; (2) several days later to inquire whether a parking lot in the rear of the Filbert building belonged to Filbert; (3) in the latter part of September or the early part of October, after learning of the sale to Gross, Jacob Axilbund visited McAllister, stating “you sold that building to my customer and therefore I am entitled to my commission” to which McAllister replied “I don’t know anything about that. All I know is that Mr. Gross came in to see me about this building.”</p>

Balsam, George Axilbund and Gross the next day inspected the building; during the course of that inspection, there was a discussion whether the height of the ceiling would preclude the use of Gross’ heavy printing presses and whether this difficulty could be overcome by digging into the ground, the availability of a railroad siding and the ownership of the adjoining parking lot. Balsam at that time informed Gross that the purchase price would be $315,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Gross said he would discuss the matter with his son and son-in-law. From that time on Balsam, although he did not see Gross, called him eight or nine times on the telephone between May and October, 1957. In the early conversations Gross told Balsam that his son and son-in-law were too busy at that time to look at the property but, on or about June 1, 1957, Gross told Balsam that he was not interested in the Filbert building and wanted a one-story building or a piece of vacant land. However, even after that, Balsam continued to call Gross.</p>

After examining the model and questioning Corry who was familiar with the Filbert building, Milton Gross said that “it would be an ideal building for their company” to which Corry replied that his company had “first choice on it”. In the latter part of July or August, 1957 when Milton Gross came to see Corry in connection with another matter, the latter told him that his company was not going to take the Filbert building.</p>

After their inspection of the building, Gross and Milton Gross met with the McAllisters at their office, told them they were interested in the building and ascertained the asking price was $300,000. Two days later an agreement was made by Gross with McAllister to purchase the building for $295,000.</p>

In <em>Keys </em>it was said: “Brokers are persons whose business it is to bring buyer and seller together. They need have nothing to do with the negotiation of the bargain: [citing a case]. A broker becomes entitled to his commissions whenever he procures for his principal a party with whom he is satisfied, and who actually contracts for the purchase of the property at a price acceptable to the owner: [citing a case]. He must establish his employment as broker, either by previous authority, or by the acceptance of his agency and the adoption of his acts, and also must prove that his agency was the procuring cause of the sale; and when, being duly authorized to sell property at private sale, he has commenced a negotiation with a purchaser, the owner cannot, while such negotiation is pending, take it into his own hands and complete it either at or be<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>low the price first limited, and then refuse to pay the commissions: Chilton v.

This Court said that, although the price was limited, there was no evidence such price was to be exclusively cash. In the letter of authority to the broker the owner had said he would sell “on terms to suit the purchaser”.

That action clearly ended [Axilbund’s] right to claim its commission under the oral agreement. Its services failed to bring about the sale at the stipulated price.” With this conclusion we cannot agree. Balsam did <em>not </em>testify that Gross said “he would not take the property at the price of $315,000” or that “he refused to do so”; Balsam <em>did testify </em>that Gross told him he was not interested in this building but that he wanted a one-story building or a piece of vacant ground. Such testimony related to the question whether or not there had been a break in the negotiations to the extent that a later sale of the property to <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>Gross would preclude Axilbund’s claim for commissions ; under the facts on this record that question was clearly for the jury, not the court, to determine. The court failed to take into consideration the testimony that for upwards of one year Gross had been looking for a desirable location for his plant, that the Filbert building was the only building which Gross had seen which was desirable, that, under Gross’s testimony, within four days after he saw the building he bought it and that, even after June 1, 1957 (the date Gross said he was not interested in this building), Balsam continued to talk over an extended period of time with Gross concerning the purchase of this building.</p>

Assume that a broker takes a prospective customer to inspect a property, having notified the prospective seller of the prospective buyer’s name and that an inspection would take place, and later on the prospective buyer, <em>admittedly, </em>tells the broker that he is not interested in the property. Under the reasoning of the court below, if the prospective buyer and the seller <em>then </em>deal directly and effect a sale, the broker is deprived <em>as a matter of law </em>of his commissions because the prospective buyer had told him he was not interested, even though the broker brought the parties together and even though the broker’s actions constituted the efficient procuring cause of the sale (as has been established in this case by the verdict of the jury).

At that <em>point </em>— before the paragraph and answer thereto were admitted into evidence — the court said: “Suppose we agree, for the record . . . that the parties agree that D.

Jacob Axilbund testified that at his meeting with McAllister, the latter said: “I am asking $315,000. You bring me a customer . . . .” Balsam testified that he told Gross the sale price was $315,000. It is clear, therefore, that the terms of the oral contract of employment provided that, if Axilbund obtained a buyer for Filbert’s building at a price which would <em>net </em>Filbert $300,000, then Axilbund would be entitled to a commission.

On the other hand, there is Gross’ denial of <em>any </em>contact with Axilbund concerning this building and Gross’ complete lack of any <em>recollection </em>of an inspection with Axilbund of this building, a building which Gross admitted so impressed him that four days after he inspected it with his son he purchased it for a price which almost approximated<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">21</a> that which Filbert told Axilbund he wanted <em>net </em>for the building and yet precluded the payment of any commission to Axilbund.
