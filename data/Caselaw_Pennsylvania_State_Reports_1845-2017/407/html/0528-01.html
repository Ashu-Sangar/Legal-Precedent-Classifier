    <p id="b551-11" data-blocks='[["BL_551.17",551,[115,1734,1151,639]]]'>Adam Eidemiller, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, having a contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Highways and the State Highway and Bridge Authority, brought a claim for additional compensation against these agencies before the Board of Arbitration of Claims. The claim was captioned “Adam Eidemiller, Inc. to use of Highway Paving Company” and recited therein that the defendant agencies were liable to Adam Eidemiller, Inc. “on its own behalf and in trust for the use of the Highway Paving Company.” Appellant, a subcontractor, had actually performed the work which was the subject of the contract,</p>

      <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>The Board determined that under the Act of 1937, May 20, P. L. 728, No. 193, as amended, 72 PS §§4651-1 to 10, it had no jurisdiction over a claim of a use-plaintiff, since the use-plaintiff was not a party to a contract with the Commonwealth as required by section 4 of the Act of 1937, 72 PS §4651-4. Accordingly, it dismissed the claim.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[242,739,1148,587]]]'>Thereupon, appellant filed its complaint in mandamus against appellee, seeking thereby to compel the Board to rescind its order and hear the merits of the claim originally instituted by Adam Eidemiller, Inc. The court below held that: (1) the Commonwealth had not authorized the filing of a subcontractor’s claim with the Board, and (2) the complaint presented no cause of action because appellee had an adequate remedy of law by an action of assumpsit upon the contractor’s bond. The court, therefore, dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for appellee.</p>

Such a writ may be used only to compel the performance of a purely ministerial or regulatory duty. In the words of former Justice (later Chief Justice) Horace Stern, “It is elementary that [mandamus] cannot be used to control the exercise of discretion or judgment on the part of a public official or an administrative or judicial tribunal; nor to review or compel the undoing of action taken by such an official or tribunal in good faith and in the exercise of legitimate jurisdiction, even though, in fact, the decision rendered may have been wrong; nor to influence or coerce a particular determination of the issue involved; nor to perform the function of an appeal or writ of error even though no appeal or writ of error be permitted by law.” <em>Kaufman Construction Company v. </em>Holcomb, supra (<a href="/pa/357/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="357 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="472102" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0514-01">357 Pa. at 520</a>).</p>
