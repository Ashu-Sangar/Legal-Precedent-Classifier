The principal Commonwealth witness was one of the alleged co-conspirators, Edward Nitsche,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> who admitted that his purpose in testifying was to “get even” with Neff. Nitsche, a construction foreman employed by the Highway Department, testified that in the winter of 1955-1956, at the instance of and accompanied by Yoho, he attended a meeting in Neff’s home at which meeting were present Neff, Yoho, Nitsche and Macry. Nitsche testified that the purpose of the meeting was “about raising funds for the campaign”. In reply to what plans were discussed at that meeting Nitsche testified: “Q. Mr. Nitsche, you were telling us now about the plans to raise money for the campaign. What plans were discussed there? A. Well, there was plans for a club, and I don’t know whether it was supposed — each man that worked for the Highway Department was supposed to give f 5 a month dues — each employee. Q. Tell us what you heard said about a club and who said it? A. I think Mr. Macry said about the club, that he was supposed to have tickets printed, but I didn’t see the tickets at that time, but I know they was printed afterwards. Q. Was there any discussion there about whether or not the club was a good idea? A. Well, there wasn’t much discussion there; but when we went back from Neff’s home, I was talking to Mr. Corcoran about it, and he said he didn’t agree with anything like that. Q. What else took place at Mr. Neff’s home? A. Well, the question come up about contrac<a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>tors — about rented equipment owners. Q. The question came up about contractors? A. Yes, the rented equipment contractors that rented equipment to the Highway Department. Q. What was said about that? A. Well, I couldn’t say who brought it up about they should donate; I know it was — I was appointed to go out and hit the contractors for donation. Q. Who appointed you? A. Well, Mr. Neff. Q. What was said about that? A. Well, I just asked him, ‘How much do you think the fellows ought to pay?’ and he said, ‘At least five per cent.’ Q. Was there any other discussion about that plan? A. No, just that I was nominated to do the job, that was all. Q. How is it you got the honor of picking up that money? A. Well, the only way I could state that is when the Democratic Party took over in 1955 and I sold a lot of banquet tickets for that Party, and that is the only way I could see about that. Q. Your job since 1941, you said, had been construction foreman? A. That’s right. Q. As construction foreman, where did your duties call for you to work? A. County-wide. Q. County-wide? A. Yes. Q. Did that have anything to do with your collecting from equipment owners? A. Oh, yes. I was told that I know the County better than anyone else — that I should go and contact the contractors. Q. Who told you that? A. Mr. Neff.” According to Nitsche, this meeting lasted approximately 45 minutes with Macry “only present maybe 20 minutes to a half hour”. In January 1956, Nitsche began collecting money from certain contrac<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> tors and continued to do so until February or March, 1957 during which time he received contributions from nine or ten contractors. According to Nitsche, the-original understanding was that the contributions were to be given to Macry but, after making two such payments, Neff told Nitsche: “Turn the money over to me. I don’t trust Macry ... I am pretty sure Mr. Neff says not to take a check.” Asked where Neff made that <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>statement, Nitsche stated: “Well, he told it to me personally. I just don’t know exactly where it was.” Nitsche further stated that the money collected by him was given to Neff once a month or once every six weeks, adding “I don’t know exactly”.</p>
    <p id="b32-4" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[244,613,1153,1288]]]'>Nitsche related certain incidents: that, in collecting money from a contractor named Eocco from whom he secured $200, Eocco told him: “You know you can be arrested for this” and, when he related this to Neff, Neff told him “Well, don’t ask him for anything more”; that he collected from a contractor named Denny in Neff’s presence and shoved the money into his [Neff’s] pocket, stating to Neff, “This belongs to you”; that a contractor named Beards offered a $1,000 campaign contribution if Nitsche could secure summer work for a grader which Beards owned and, when Nitsche informed Neff of the offer, Neff told him “Well, go ahead and see if you can get an agreement through for him”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Nitsche further testified that both Kaleta and Yoho turned over to him “money collected” from certain contractors. Near the end of Nitsche’s direct examination the following colloquy took place: “Q. What was the result of anybody who complained about paying? A. Well, the only thing that was said was ... I asked Mr. Neff what I should do in case somebody doesn’t pay and he says, ‘Well, don’t cancel their agreements,’ he says, ‘but don’t leave them work.’ Q. Where was that said? A. Oh, I don’t know where it was said. Either — I couldn’t remember where that was said.”</p>

Harden testified that he gave one Slade, a construction foreman, a $50 check payable to the Democratic Party and that some time thereafter Yoho and Nitsche “approached [him] about five percent,” Nitsche being the one who asked him about it; that he refused to give anything; they then asked him to give back the check he gave Slade and substitute for it a check in the same amount payable to cash and he did as Nitsche requested and gave the check the following day to Nitsche. Harden worked thereafter until the spring of 1957 and he did testify that the $50 contribution was voluntary. Peters testified that he never met either Neff or Macry but that he knew Yoho as a Superintendent of the Highway Department; in March, 1956, Nitsche informed him: “Runt [a nickname], you will have to kick back 5% to Sam Neff or you don’t work”; he refused to give any money and continued to work until about July 15, 1956 when his equipment was replaced by the equipment of a Democratic committeeman. Corbin testified he made various payments amounting to approximately 5 percent of the equipment rental fees to Nitsche, Yoho and Kaleta, all of which payments, except one, were made in cash; that Yoho sought a “5 percent for himself” which Corbin refused to pay, settling for “around 2 percent”; that his payments were voluntary and were understood to be campaign contributions; that it is “understood” that “in politics you donate so much or you don’t work”. However, he testified that Neff informed him that he did not have to pay and no one had threatened him with loss of work.</p>

In so finding, we do not usurp, the function of the jury; we simply find that the evidence presented on this record fails to satisfy either qualitatively or quantitatively, the standard of proof required to sustain a conviction in a conspiracy case. Stripped of all its gloss, this record at most reveals agreement to secure contributions for political purposes and that such contributions were secured. While there is implication of record that offenses other than charged may have taken place, such fact, if it is a fact, does not aid in proving a charge of conspiracy where there- is an absence of proof of an unlawful agreement.

The preponderance of the evidence clearly shows that the contributions were made by the contractors and received by Kaleta and Yoho as political contributions and not made to either of them for their personal use. It may well be that either Kaleta or Yoho or both pocketed some of the contributions and devoted them to their own personal use but the Commonwealth has not proven beyond a reason<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>able doubt such to have been the case. The one exception arises in the testimony of Corbin that Yoho exacted from him a payment of two percent for his own purposes. Such testimony is sufficient to sustain the conviction of Yoho on the charge of extortion. However, prosecution of Yoho on the charge of extortion, unfortunately, has been barred by the two years statute of limitations in the Act of 1989 (Act of April 6, 1939, P.

While the Act contains two distinct periods of limitations — a two year and a six year period — the applicability of each or either is dependent upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the Act is not faulty, but, in fact, is supported by reason and logic. In this regard and to this <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>extent, we agree with the rationale set forth by Judge Montgomery in his concurring and dissenting opinion wherein he stated: “The Act of 1939, April 6, P. L. 17, §1, 19 P.S. §211, is the applicable statute. It provides generally for a two-year limitation on the time for bringing prosecutions in such cases as we are considering (extortion and conspiracy to extort). However, it does contain certain provisions relating to (a) absentees, (b) officers of banks and other corporations, and (c) public officers, employes and their accomplices and confederates, in which cases the running of the general provisions of the statute is postponed or the time of the limitation period is extended. In the case of absentees, its running is postponed until the offenders return; in the ease of bank and corporation officers, it is extended to six years; but in the case of public officers and employes, it is postponed with a limitation on the period of postponement. The majority in its opinion ignores the postponement provision because it believes that its application creates an absurd situation in the light of the limitation and considers this provision as a general extension as in the second provision. I find no absurdity in the application of both provisions but, on the contrary, see a reasonable result. The obvious intention of the legislature Avas to deny to offenders in government service the benefits of the statute until they had been out of service two years, during Avhich period their affairs Avhile in office could more readily be explored than when they were still present in office. However, the legislature apparently did not wish to extend this privilege to enforcement agencies beyond the six years provided as the period of limitation for bank and other corporate officers (as extended by proviso (b)). Under the Statutory Construction Act of 1937, May 28, P. L. 1019, article IV, §52, 46 P.S. §552, we are obligated to give meaning, if possible, to all parts of legislative enactments, and I think both provisions should be applied in this case.</p>
