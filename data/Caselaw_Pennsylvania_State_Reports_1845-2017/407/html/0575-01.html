    <p id="b599-8" data-blocks='[["BL_599.10",599,[114,1339,1148,204]]]'>According to the overwhelming mass of testimony offered by the Commonwealth, the killing was a cold, cruel, malicious and planned murder. It can be fairly and briefly summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b599-9" data-blocks='[["BL_599.11",599,[111,1556,1150,696]]]'>The defendant and one Louise Hickson lived together “off and on” in her apartment in the city of Philadelphia for a period of time, under meretricious circumstances. During the months of June and July, 1959, their relationship became strained because, among other things, of his failure to help defray the cost of the household expenses and his relationship with another woman of which he openly boasted. Over the weekend of July 31, he was the guest in the apartment of this other woman. Over the same weekend, Louise had as guests in her apartment her sister, Ver tell Hickson, and the latter’s boy friend, Ronald Berry.</p>
    <p id="b599-10" data-blocks='[["BL_599.12",599,[116,2263,1143,97]],["BL_600.1",600,[246,360,1147,316]]]'>On August 4, Louise told the defendant that she did not want anything further to do with him and that <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>their relationship was at an end. The defendant attempted to dissuade her, but to no avail. During these conversations, Ronald Berry took Louise’s part which the defendant bitterly resented, causing him to threaten Berry with serious bodily harm and to engage in other conduct patently manifesting bitterness and hatred.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[239,695,1152,742]]]'>Late in the morning of August 4, Louise, her children, Yertell Hickson and Ronald Berry went out visiting. Their departure was immediately preceded on the stairway in the hallway of the apartment by bitter words during which the defendant threatened to shove Berry “out of the second-story window” and, finally, to say, “I’ll get you when I come back.” While Louise and her guests were gone from the apartment, the defendant went out and bought a gun. In order to do so, he traveled by bus and by subway to another section of the city. He then returned to the apartment and sat to await the return of Louise and her guests. He placed the gun on the top of the refrigerator with a cloth over it.</p>

Ronald and Vertell sat down at a table and engaged in a game of cards. The defendant was in an angry mood and resumed the argument with Louise as to why she was leaving him. In the course of this conversation, he threatened “to blow all their brains out.” He then directed his conversation to Berry, telling him that he had taken offense at what Berry had said earlier in the day. Berry replied that what he had said meant no harm but if the defendant didn’t like it, there was nothing he could do about it. The defendant replied, “Well, I promised the next time a man said anything to me I didn’t like or did anything to me, I’m going to get him before he gets me.” He then walked to the refrigerator, grabbed the gun and pointed it at Berry. As the latter stood <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>up, saying “I’m not afraid of your gun,” the defendant retorted, “I’ll kill you” and shot Berry in the neck. Vertell jumped up from the table screaming, the defendant turned to her and said, “You want some of it too” and then shot her in the abdomen. The defendant then turned toward Louise threatening to kill her with the gun but finally decided against it for the sake of her children.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[103,806,1149,586]]]'>As Berry and Vertell lay on the floor, both begged for a doctor. The defendant told Berry to get up and get one himself. When Berry said he couldn’t move, the defendant sneered, “Well that’s too bad, because 1 want you to die. ... I want you to die slow. I want you to be damned near dead when you get a doctor.” Both victims begged for water. The defendant filled two jars with water and placed them on the floor but just out of reach of the injured. Berry said he couldn’t reach the water and the defendant replied, “Well get it the best way you can.”</p>

He testified that at the time of the shooting he was in great fear and that he shot Berry to defend himself. He stated that Berry “made a step toward me, and I just threw the gun up and I must have shot him and the girl. I didn’t have no intention of shooting either <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>of them, but I just went in fear of something, I don’t know.”</p>

The contention that a new trial should be granted is based upon assignments of error involving the conduct of the trial. We shall discuss them ad seriatim.</p>
    <p id="b602-5" data-blocks='[["BL_602.5",602,[251,755,1146,367]]]'>During the course of the trial, the defendant introduced the testimony of' a psychiatrist, Dr. Mallin, as an expert witness. He was presented to the jury with a rather impressive background of credentials including membership on the staffs of seven hospitals and the position of Chief of Neurology and Psychiatry at two of these hospitals.</p>
    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[243,1142,1152,969]]]'>He testified that he performed a complete neurological and psychological examination of the defendant, totaling approximately three and one-half hours, four months after the occurrence and while the defendant was incarcerated. He stated his conclusions were based on this examination, his own experience and the <em>history of the </em>occurrence, <em>and the life of the defendant as related to him by the defendant. </em>He stated that from his information, the defendant had a good background, drank only occasionally, never used drugs, and was never involved in any previous illegal conduct warranting an arrest. In- the year, 1951, the defendant developed a very serious case of tuberculosis requiring hospitalization for several months and subsequently requiring surgery and the removal of the right upper lobe of the lung. As a result, the defendant told him he developed a supersensitive and. constant fear of injury to his chest. ■ ;</p>

As a result, his constant-existing fear increased, he became very confused and very intently disturbed. On the basis of the defendant’s physical condition, past medical history and the occurrences of the day of the shooting as the defendant .had related them to him, he concluded that at the time of the shooting the defendant suffered from an intense fear psychosis, which made it possible for him to. do something irrational, and not to be aware of what, he was doing.</p>

These concerned the “insight” of the defendant; the content of his thought, and his emotional status at the time of the occurrence, examination and trial. Defendant contends that this constituted an “extensive, aggressive” and unwarranted examination by the trial judge. Nothing could be more unsound. The inquiries were reasonable, pertinent and essential. They were not only proper but necessary to render more understandable the doctor’s testimony for the jury. The questions were not in the nature of a cross-examination, were not overextended, nor did they indicate bias or argument with the doctor’s conclusions. The trial judge, under such circumstances, not only had the right but the duty to pursue the questioning. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Watts, </em><a href="/pa/358/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="358 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="8845042,8845060" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0092-01,/pa/358/0092-02">358 Pa. 92</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%2081" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="56 A.2d 81">56 A. 2d 81</a> (1948) and <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b604-4" data-blocks='[["BL_604.4",604,[252,477,1147,261]]]'>It is also strenuously argued that in the course of the charge, the trial judge so disparaged the doctor’s qualifications and so evaluated and characterized his testimony, that the defendant was seriously prejudiced. We cannot agree, following a study of the entire record.</p>
    <p id="b604-5" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[249,749,1147,478]]]'>In the course of the doctor’s testimony, he stated specifically that he had been certified in psychiatry by the American Board. He did not say that he was certified in neurology. The trial judge charged the jury that in view of this testimony, the jury could not infer that he had been certified in neurology. While this observation was unnecessary, we cannot say that it was incorrect or, more importantly, that it was prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b604-6" data-blocks='[["BL_604.6",604,[246,1248,1146,423]]]'>In charging the jury and discussing the weight to be given the doctor’s testimony, the trial judge emphasized that it was merely opinion testimony, that in the law such is considered the lowest type of testimony, unsatisfactory in character, and further that bad as it is, the court permits it because nothing better is available. We cannot say that, under the evidence in this case, such was unwarranted.</p>
    <p id="b604-7" data-blocks='[["BL_604.7",604,[238,1682,1151,694]],["BL_605.1",605,[135,373,1149,372]]]'>The questioning of the doctor clearly established that he relied upon and based his conclusions upon erroneous and insufficient information. For example, he made no effort to substantiate the truth of the history given him by the defendant. Before coming to a conclusion, he refrained from a thorough inquiry into basic facts. If such had been pursued, he would have determined that all through the fatal day, it was the defendant who was the threatening and attacking aggressor, the one looking for trouble — not the abused and frightened individual the doctor concluded him to be. In addition, certain clinical and medical records were known and available to the witness; and, ad<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>mittedly, lie did not seek to study them. He did not administer psychological testing to determine the defendant’s mental quotient or any thematic apperception tests for the purpose of seeking corroboration of his findings. In view of all this, the value of the particular testimony is very questionable and the observations of the trial judge were not improper.</p>

It is claimed that this issue became pertinent in view of Doctor Mallin’s testimony. We do not agree. A thorough review of his testimony manifests that it did not include, at any time, an expression regarding defendant’s sanity which would have constituted an opinion within the legal concept of the term. He was never asked to state, nor did he volunteer, an opinion concerning the defendant’s ability to understand the nature and quality of the act, or whether he knew the difference between right and wrong at the time of the shooting.</p>

Just as malice is the impelling power of murder, either anger or rage or resentment or terror is the impelling power of voluntary manslaughter. Passion includes both anger and terror, provided they reach a degree of intensity sufficient to obscure temporarily the reason of the person affected. A sudden passion which will reduce an unlawful killing to voluntary manslaughter must be due to a legally adequate provocation. The terror from the belief on the part of the defendant that his life is in danger is sufficient, even though his belief is not reasonable. In other words, if he has, in your opinion, a terror on his part, believing that he is in danger of life or grievous bodily harm, that is sufficient, if you find that to exist in him, even though it is not reasonable.
