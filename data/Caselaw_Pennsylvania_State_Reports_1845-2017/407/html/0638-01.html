This case involved an ademption, as well as lapsed legacies, general legacies and specific legacies and the Court found that the testatrix intended to bequeath to each legatee <em>an equal half-share </em>of the stock which she owned in that corporation at the time she made her will. We have frequently said that no will has a twin brother and the present will is distinguishable from the <em>McFerren </em>will because of the difference (a) in the surrounding circumstances and (b) in the language of the wills.</p>
