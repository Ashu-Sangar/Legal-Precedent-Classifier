The Court sustained the affidavits of defense in the nature of a statutory demurrer which asserted that the Commission was an instrumentality of the Commonwealth and as such was not liable for the torts of its employees or agents. President Judge Sheelt, specially presiding, aptly said (pages 680-681, 682) : “In Greene County v.

It may impose the cost incident thereto entirely on one agency to the exclusion of another, or it may permit them to agree on a division of costs. . . . “And, in the building of roads, it [a county] is acting in its governmental, <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>rather than business, capacity.” Townships are in the same situation as counties with respect to roads.’ See also Szilagyi et al. v.

Moreover, since the <em>House </em>case (supra) was decided in 1942, the legislature has passed seven acts relating to new or additional extensions of the turnpike and each contained the identical “sue and be sued” clause.

If the statutory construction and the result reached in <em>House </em>and unanimously followed in the later cases had not been in accordance with the intent of the legislature, it could easily have changed the language of the new Acts to impose trespass liability.

    <p id="b643-8" data-blocks='[["BL_643.9",643,[117,1510,1152,480]]]'>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has decided exactly the reverse. It has reached the conclusion that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission may not be “sued for negligence in the construction, operation and maintenance of the Turnpike.” However, I believe that Judge Kalodner-’s reasoning more correctly responds to legal realities, decisional integrity, and jurisprudential truth, not to mention natural justice, than does the Majority Opinion of this Court in the case before us.</p>

      <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>
      <em>may sue and be sued. </em>This statutory authority carries no limitation. It does not say that the Commission may be sued only with regard to construction or in actions arising out of contractual responsibilities. The phrase is there for the world to see and understand. It would take a great deal of interpreting of language to construe those words to mean that the Commission may be sued, “but — .” That interpreting, unfortunately, has not been lacking. The herculean effort to have “be sued” mean “be sued on every subject except tort” has been manifested by many lower courts of the Commonwealth and their distortion of language has now received the official approval of the highest Court of the Commonwealth and nothing can be done about it — at present.</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[232,1182,1154,698]]]'>Nevertheless, in the interests of even-handed justice, which is always looming on the horizon of hope in the courts, I believe it is necessary to speak out and declare that the decision of this Court does not accord with legal principles which should control in actions of this kind. I do not intend to write a long dissenting opinion because I do not believe it is necessary. When a statute states that a commission may be sued and it adds no limitation to that suability, the only conclusion possible is that the commission may be sued like anybody else may be sued. I would be willing to state my case of dissent entirely on the excellent opinion written by Judge Kalodner in the case already cited.</p>

I have touched on the subject in other dissenting opinions, but I cannot avoid saying that the immunity proclaimed in the case at bar outdistances the injustices I have heretofore referred to in this field because the entity which is here <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>being sued is <em>not </em>the government.

There is no difference between buying a ticket to ride on a railroad train and buying a ticket to ride (albeit in your own automobile) on a high-speed highway specially constructed to attract fee-paying clients. The Commonwealth recognizes that the Turnpike Commission is a business engaged in providing service for a monetary consideration. While, therefore, it wants to help it in every way it can because, after all, its success redounds to the credit and prestige of the Commonwealth, it does not in any way want to be obligated financially for obligations incurred by the Commission. Hence, Section 2, 36 P.S. §652b, of the Turnpike Act provides: “That turnpike revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this act <em>shall not be deemed to be a debt of the Commonwealth or a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth </em>or a pledge of the faith and credit of the Commonwealth, but such bonds shall be payable exclusively from the fund herein provided therefor from tolls. All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face that <em>the Commonwealth is not obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon except </em>from tolls and that the faith and credit of the Commonwealth is not pledged to the payment of the principal or interest of such bonds.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

What could be more ordinary, in the sense of regularity and continuity, than the maintenance of the very instrumentality which is the sole reason for its existence, that is, the highway? And if it does that job of maintenance negligently, why should it not be sued? And if found guilty of the charged negligence, why should it not pay as it must pay for any other expenditure in the “ordinary business and functions of the Commission”?</p>
    <p id="b646-6" data-blocks='[["BL_646.6",646,[230,1451,1147,686]]]'>It is true that the turnpike statute makes the statement that the Commission is “hereby constituted an instrumentality of the Commonwealth”, but this provision must be read in connection with other portions of the statute.

The <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>naked statement that the Commission is an .instrumentality of the Commonwealth does not make it so.

In the interests of public safety, the Legislature may prescribe a speed limit over any terrain, including private property.</p>
    <p id="b647-4" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[111,1010,1154,362]]]'>This Court has already indicated that it would not regard the Commission as an integral part of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and thus not suable.

Aside from the tangible reasoning which makes the Commission something entirely different from the Commonwealth, it is to be noted that the legislature cannot confer sovereignty. Sovereignty may be acquired only through the affirmative action of a plebiscite because the sovereignty of Pennsylvania is vested in the people, and the people alone. And in this <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>respect, the Commission cannot point to any expression by the people to the effect that a body which charges ■ for the nse of a road it has constructed and maintains may not be sued when, through negligence, it allows ■that road to deteriorate and as a consequence injury is inflicted on fee-paying users of the road.</p>

Supp. 681</a>, the Commission pleaded immunity on the ground that it was in substance and effect the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Judge Follmer of the Middle District of Pennsylvania declared that the statement in the statute that the Commission is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth was “not decisive of the question and not the equivalent of saying that it is entitled to the immunity of the Eleventh Amendment.” He held, therefore, that “There is nothing in the relationship of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to the State to remove it from that group of public corporations and political subdivisions which are not clothed with the immunity from suit which belongs to the State alone.”</p>
