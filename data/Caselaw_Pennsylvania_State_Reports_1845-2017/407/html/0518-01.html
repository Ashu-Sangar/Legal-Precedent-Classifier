Lewis, died on June 11, 1954, leaving a personal estate of $10,658, of which $251.80 was in cash, $270.25 in household goods, and $10,185.95 in stocks and bonds. Her debts and expenses of administration (which were not itemized or broken down) amounted to over $5,000. In her holograpMc will dated February 1, 1950, testatrix made specific cash bequests of more than $1,750. She then gave, in separate paragraphs, specific articles of silverware, china and household goods or furnishings to eight friends and one cousin. She then provided: “To Mrs. Willard (Margaret Taylor) Bates of Stevensville, Penn’a. <em>all my </em>per<a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>

Mrs. Bates is incorrect in her contention that the gift in this will of “all my personal property except as otherwise specified” is a residuary clause. She is correct, however, in her contention that personal property, when used in its ordinary (as well as in its legal) sense and meaning includes stocks, bonds, household goods and cash. Mrs. Bates also contends that “money” in its ordinary sense and meaning means “cash”. “Money” <em>in its ordinary, customary and usual meaning, </em>does not mean stocks or bonds or real estate; it means “cash”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> However, it is equally well settled that where a testator indicates an intention to dispose of his entire estate by a gift of “money”; especially if the gift as here is in a residuary clause, a gift of money will pass all his personal property or all the rest of his personal property, as the case may be: <em>Conlin Estate, </em><a href="/pa/388/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="388 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1272524" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0483-01">388 Pa. 483</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20117" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="131 A.2d 117">131 A. 2d 117</a>, and cases therein cited.</p>
