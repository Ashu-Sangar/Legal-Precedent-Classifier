      {
        "text": "OPINION\nNIGRO, Justice.\nIn this slander and libel action, Appellant Stanley B. Lindner appeals from the Order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County granting Appellee James F. Mollan\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing Lindner\u2019s complaint with prejudice. We affirm.\nThe facts of this case are undisputed. At all times relevant, Appellant Lindner was Vice-President of the Yeadon Borough Council and Chairman of the Yeadon Borough Council\u2019s Finance Committee. Appellee Mol\u00edan was the Mayor of the Borough of Yeadon.\nOn March 5, 1992, the Borough Council held a regularly scheduled meeting in the Borough of Yeadon. Mayor Mol\u00edan attended the meeting. The Borough\u2019s budget deficit and financial affairs were under discussion when Mayor Mol\u00edan stated to Councilman Lindner, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll say it right to your face; you\u2019re the village idiot.... You\u2019ve been dipping into the till. I know for a fact. And you know I know.\u201d R.R. at 68a-69a. A local cable television station was videotaping the meeting for later broadcasting, and members of the print media and the general public were also in attendance.\nAppellant filed a two-count civil action against Appellee alleging slander and libel. Appellee filed preliminary objections, which were dismissed. After discovery was completed, Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. The Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County granted Appellee\u2019s motion on the ground that he was immune to this civil suit under the doctrine of absolute privilege afforded high public officials.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order granting Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Commonwealth Court held that Appellee was a high public official eligible for absolute immunity from civil suit. The Commonwealth Court also found that since Appellee\u2019s remarks were made within the course of his duties and the scope of his authority as Mayor, the doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials applied.\nThe two issues which we now address on appeal are (1) whether the doctrine of absolute privilege afforded high public officials remains the law in Pennsylvania and (2) whether Appellee\u2019s remarks were made within the course and scope of his authority as Mayor such that the doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials applies in this case. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that Appellee is immune from this civil suit under the doctrine of absolute privilege afforded high public officials.\nMore than forty years ago in Matson v. Margiotti, 371 Pa. 188, 88 A.2d 892 (1952), this Court explained that the doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials,\nas its name implies, is unlimited and exempts a high public official from all civil suits for damages arising out of false defamatory statements and even from statements or actions motivated by malice, provided the statements are made or the actions are taken in the course of the official\u2019s duties or powers and within the scope of his authority, or as it is sometimes expressed, within his jurisdiction.\nMatson, 371 Pa. at 194, 88 A.2d at 895. The doctrine of absolute privilege \u201crests upon the * * * idea that conduct which otherwise would be actionable is to escape liability because the defendant is acting in furtherance of some interest of social importance, which is entitled to protection even at the expense of uncompensated harm to the plaintiffs reputation.\u201d Montgomery v. City of Philadelphia, 392 Pa. 178, 181, 140 A.2d 100, 102 (1958). This sweeping immunity is \u201cnot for the benefit of high public officials, but for the benefit of the public.\u201d Barto v. Felix, 250 Pa.Super. 262, 272, 378 A.2d 927, 932 (1977) (Spaeth, J., dissenting), appeal denied, 487 Pa. 455, 409 A.2d 857 (1980). Absolute privilege is\ndesigned to protect the official from the suit itself, from the expense, publicity, and danger of defending the good faith of his public actions before the jury. And yet, beyond this lies a deeper purpose, the protection of society\u2019s interest in the unfettered discussion of public business and in full public knowledge of the facts and conduct of such business.\nMontgomery, 392 Pa. at 183, 140 A.2d at 103.\nAs such, absolute immunity for high public officials from civil liability is the only legitimate \u201cmeans of removing any inhibition which might deprive the public of the best service of its officers and agencies.\u201d Id. Even though the innocent may sometimes suffer irreparable harm,\nit has been found to be in the public interest and therefore sounder and wiser public policy to \u2018immunize\u2019 public officials, for to permit slander, or libel * * * suits where the official\u2019s charges turn out to be false, would be to deter all but the most courageous or the most judgment-proof public officials from performing their official duties.\nMatson, 371 Pa. at 203, 88 A.2d at 899-900.\nAppellant contends that Section 8550 of the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act (\u201cPSTCA\u201d) expressly abrogates Appellee\u2019s immunity to civil suits arising out of false defamatory statements. Appellant argues that the plain language of Section 8550, when read in conjunction with the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in Section 8501 of the PSTCA shows that for acts of \u201cwilful misconduct\u201d the legislature meant to abrogate the longstanding common law doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials. We disagree.\nIf this Court were to adopt Appellant\u2019s argument, an irrational disparity would be produced in the immunities for Commonwealth and local agency employees. For example, high public officials who happen to receive their salary from the Commonwealth\u2014such as the Governor\u2014would be permitted to raise the defense of absolute immunity whereas high public officials who happen to receive their salary from a municipality\u2014such as a Mayor\u2014would not be permitted to raise the defense. Such an interpretation of Section 8550 of the PSTCA would produce an \u201cabsurd or unreasonable result,\u201d which, under the rules of statutory construction, we must presume that the legislature did not intend. See Goodman v. Kennedy, 459 Pa. 313, 326-27, 329 A.2d 224, 231 (1974) (rejecting appellant\u2019s interpretation of a Pennsylvania criminal statute because it would lead to an \u201cabsurd or unreasonable result\u201d which the legislature did not intend). We are therefore unable to accept Appellant\u2019s argument.\nThis Court has never called into question, much less overruled, the common law doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials. Moreover, our lower courts have consistently relied upon the doctrine. See, e.g., Mosley v. Observer Publishing Company, 422 Pa.Super. 255, 261, 619 A.2d 343, 346 (1993) (quoting Matson), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 622, 629 A.2d 1382 (1993); Yakowicz v. McDermott, 120 Pa.Cmwlth. 479, 484, 548 A.2d 1330, 1332 (1988) (same), appeal denied, 523 Pa. 644, 565 A.2d 1168 (1989); Rok v. Flaherty, 106 Pa.Cmwlth. 570, 572, 527 A.2d 211, 212 (1987) (same), appeal denied, 517 Pa, 628, 538 A.2d 880 (1988); DeSantis v. Swigart, 296 Pa.Super. 283, 286-87, 442 A,2d 770, 772 (1982) (same); Barto v. Felix, 250 Pa.Super. 262, 267, 378 A.2d 927, 929 (1977) (citing Matson and Montgomery); McCormick v. Specter, 220 Pa.Super. 19, 21, 275 A.2d 688, 689 (1971) (quoting Matson).\nFurthermore, our courts have agreed that Section 8550 of the PSTCA does not abrogate the common law doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials. See Suppan v. Kratzer, 660 A.2d 226 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995); Petula v. Mellody, 158 Pa.Cmwlth. 212, 220, 631 A.2d 762, 766 (1993); Factor v. Goode, 149 Pa.Cmwlth. 81, 87, 612 A.2d 591, 594 (1992), appeal denied, 533 Pa. 654, 624 A.2d 112 (1993). These courts have limited their application of Section 8550 of the PSTCA only to render an employee of a local government agency subject to civil suit for wilful misconduct, where that employee did not qualify as a \u201chigh public official\u201d for purposes of the common law doctrine of absolute privilege.\nIn the leading case of Factor v. Goode, 149 Pa.Cmwlth. 81, 612 A.2d 591 (1992), appeal denied, 533 Pa. 654, 624 A.2d 112 (1993), a defamation suit was brought by two property owners against the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia and the Revenue Commissioner of the City of Philadelphia. In Factor, the Mayor and Revenue Commissioner held a press conference wherein they identified the twenty property owners with the highest delinquent real estate taxes, including the plaintiffs, and described them as \u201cdeadbeats\u201d and \u201ctax cheats\u201d who think that \u201cthey\u2019re above the law.\u201d Factor, 149 Pa.Cmwlth. at 84, 612 A.2d at 592. The issue before the Commonwealth Court in Factor was whether the Mayor and Revenue Commissioner were entitled to absolute immunity for making allegedly defamatory remarks against the plaintiffs.\nExplaining that the Mayor and the Revenue Commissioner were undeniably \u201chigh public officials,\u201d the Commonwealth Court in Factor held that these two officials were immune from a defamation action because Section 8550 of the PSTCA did not abrogate the absolute privilege afforded high public officials. The Factor court explained that its review of those cases discussing Section 8550 of the PSTCA \u201creveal[ed] no instance in which it [was] applied to defeat the absolute privilege of a high public official, as Appellants suggest.\u201d Factor, 149 Pa.Cmwlth. at 87, 612 A.2d at 594. The Factor court concluded that Section 8550 of the PSTCA has \u201cno bearing on the common law absolute privilege regarding high public officials, but rather addresses only those employees of local agencies who do not fall within the category of a high public official.\u201d Id.\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding in Factor has been adopted in two subsequent Commonwealth Court decisions, Suppan v. Kratzer, 660 A.2d 226 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) and Petula v. Mellody, 158 Pa.Cmwlth. 212, 681 A.2d 762 (1993). In Petula, a former school administrator brought a defamation action against three school superintendents and their respective school districts. Relying on Factor, the Commonwealth Court in Petula granted all three school superintendents immunity as high public officials, finding that the \u201cabrogation of immunity defenses provided for in Section 8550 of the [PSTCA] is applied only in those cases regarding employees of local agencies and has no bearing on the common law absolute privilege regarding high public officials.\u201d Petula, 158. Pa. Cmwlth. at 220, 631 A.2d at 766 (citing Factor).\nSuppan involved an applicant for a borough police job who brought a defamation action against the Mayor of Northampton Borough, the Northampton Borough Council President, and the Borough of Northampton. Relying on Factor, the Commonwealth Court in Suppan ruled that, regardless of the language in Section 8550 of the PSTCA, a \u201cmayor and a borough council president are high public officials entitled to the absolute privilege described in Factor.\u201d Suppan, 660 A2d at 230.\nOur cases on absolute privilege have sought to strike a balance between the public\u2019s interest in the unfettered and full discussion of public business among our government officials while recognizing the undeniable right of the individual to be protected in his or her reputation. In so doing, we have \u201cdeclared that the public interest does not demand that all public officials be entitled to absolute privilege, but only that \u2018high-ranking officers\u2019 be so protected.\u201d Montgomery, 392 Pa. at 185, 140 A.2d at 104 (quoting Matson).\nSince Section 8550 of the PSTCA does not abrogate the common law doctrine of absolute privilege afforded high public officials, the question becomes whether Appellee qualifies as a high public official such that he is immune from this defamation suit. The standard used to determine who qualifies as a \u201chigh public official\u201d was set forth by this Court in Montgomery. See, e.g., Reese v. Danforth, 486 Pa. 479, 406 A.2d 735, 739 (1979) (adopting Montgomery definition of high public official); Jonnet v. Bodick, 431 Pa. 59, 244 A.2d 751 (1968) (same).\nIn Montgomery, we explained that the \u201cdetermination of whether a particular public officer is protected by absolute privilege should depend on the nature of his duties, the importance of his office, and particularly whether or not he has policy-making functions.\u201d Montgomery, 392 Pa. at 185, 140 A.2d at 105 (citing cases). This Court made clear in Montgomery that, absent statutory classification, the parameters establishing \u201chigh public official\u201d status would be delineated by the judiciary on a case-by-case basis, rather than establishing a bright-line \u201cof demarcation, if any there be, which separates offices which are protected by absolute privilege from those which are not.\u201d Id. Explaining that both of the city officials had policy-making functions and that the public interest demanded that public officials be encouraged to inform the community about the progress of public works paid for by the taxpayers, we concluded in Montgomery that the Deputy Commissioner of Public Property of Philadelphia and the Philadelphia City Architect were high public officials. See id.\nAppellant argues, however, that in DuBree v. Commonwealth, 481 Pa. 540, 393 A.2d 293 (1978), this Court changed the criteria set forth in Montgomery for determining which public officials qualify as high public officials for purposes of absolute privilege. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12. We find Appellant\u2019s assertion unpersuasive. DuBree did not involve the question of absolute privilege for high public officials and, as such, DuBree did not discuss any of our earlier cases on absolute privilege. In fact, we made clear in DuBree that the issue of whether the seven named members of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were high public officials for purposes of absolute privilege was not before the Court since the Commonwealth Court had disposed of the case below without deciding the status of the officials in question. See DuBree, 481 Pa. at 540 n. 4, 393 A.2d at 293 n. 4. Rather, DuBree articulated a standard to determine which officials qualified for official immunity where those officials were not considered high public officials entitled to absolute privilege under the common law. Thus, in DuBree, for those officials who were not high public officials entitled to absolute privilege, we held that immunity was not absolute but qualified and its availability depended on the circumstances of each case.\nThere is no more important local public official than a mayor. He exercises the entire executive power of the borough or municipality and works closely with the city council on a wide range of social and economic policy issues. Our courts have ruled that a wide range of public officials with no greater a policy-making function than that of the Mayor in this case, and less of a policy-making function in many instances, are high public officials. See, e.g., Jonnet v. Bodick, 431 Pa. 59, 244 A.2d 751 (1968) (Township supervisor was a high public official for purposes of absolute privilege); Montgomery, 392 Pa. 178, 140 A.2d 100 (1958) (Deputy Commissioner of Public Property and City Architect are high public officials); Matson, 371 Pa. 188, 88 A.2d 892 (1952) (Pennsylvania Attorney General is a high public official for proposes of absolute privilege); Suppan v. Kratzer, 660 A.2d 226 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995) (Mayor and Borough Council President were high public officials for purposes of absolute privilege); Mosley v. Observer Publishing Co., 422 Pa.Super. 255, 619 A.2d 343 (1993) (County Attorney was high public official for purposes of absolute privilege), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 622, 629 A.2d 1382 (1993); Factor, 149 Pa.Cmwlth. 81, 612 A.2d 591 (1992) (Mayor of Philadelphia and Revenue Commissioner of Philadelphia were both high public officials), appeal denied, 533 Pa. 654, 624 A.2d 112 (1993); Rok v. Flaherty, 106 Pa.Cmwlth. 570, 527 A.2d 211 (1987) (City Comptroller was high public official for purposes of absolute privilege), appeal denied, 517 Pa. 628, 538 A.2d 880 (1988) ; Freach v. Commonwealth, 23 Pa.Cmwlth. 546, 354 A.2d 908 (1976) (Superintendent of the Parole Division of the Board of Probation and Parole, District Attorney and the Assistant District Attorney of Delaware County were high public officials for purposes of absolute privilege), aff'd in part, 471 Pa. 558, 370 A.2d 1163 (1977); McCormick v. Specter, 220 Pa.Super. 19, 275 A.2d 688 (1971) (District Attorney was high public official for purposes of absolute privilege).\nAs Mayor, Appellee routinely makes significant public policy decisions, and is accountable to the voting public. Exercising significant policy-making functions as the most important public official in the Borough of Yeadon, Appellee clearly qualifies as a \u201chigh public official\u201d under the criteria established in Montgomery.\nAs explained above, this Court has made clear that the doctrine of absolute privilege for high public officials applies \u201cprovided that the statements are made or the actions are taken in the course of the official\u2019s duties or powers and within the scope of his authority, or as it is sometimes expressed, within his jurisdiction.\u201d Matson, 371 Pa. at 194, 88 A.2d at 895; see also, Montgomery, 392 Pa. at 183, 140 A.2d at 102. Having determined that Appellee is a high public official, the remaining inquiry is whether his remarks were made in the course of his duties and scope of his authority as Mayor of the Borough of Yeadon.\nBoth the trial court and the Commonwealth Court in this case found that Appellee\u2019s statements to Appellant Lindner regarding Appellant\u2019s ability as Chair of the Yeadon Borough Council\u2019s Finance Committee were made in the scope of Appellee\u2019s authority as Mayor. Since the Mayor of the Borough of Yeadon has statutory authority over the Borough\u2019s fiscal affairs and is permitted by statute to attend any or all regular and special meetings of the Borough Council, we agree that Appellee\u2019s remarks were made within the scope of his official duties as Mayor.\nIn this instance, Appellee was engaged in a discussion with members of the Yeadon Borough Council about the Borough\u2019s financial affairs, which is a matter within the course of his duties and the scope of his authority as Mayor. See, e.g., Mosley v. Observer Publishing Co., 422 Pa.Super. 255, 261-62, 619 A.2d 343, 346-47 (1993) (holding that district attorney\u2019s defamatory remarks about plaintiff were closely related to his official duties and thus protected by the doctrine of absolute privilege); McCormick v. Specter, 220 Pa.Super. 19, 275 A.2d 688, 689 (1971) (holding that even though a district attorney\u2019s statements regarding an ongoing investigation by the city may have been excessive, they were nonetheless closely related to a matter pending within his office and thus within the scope of the privilege). Since Appellee\u2019s remarks were within the scope of his authority as Mayor of the Borough of Yeadon, he is immune from this slander and libel suit under the doctrine of absolute privilege afforded high public officials.\nFor the above reasons, we AFFIRM.\nNIX, C. J., concurs in the result.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Appellant offers this Court no Pennsylvania case authority supporting his position. Instead, Appellant relies solely on the federal district court opinion in Weinstein v. Bullick, 827 F.Supp. 1193 (E.D.Pa.1993). However, Pennsylvania courts are not bound by the decisions of the lower federal courts construing Pennsylvania law. See Rader v. Penn sylvania Turnpike Commission, 407 Pa. 609, 615, 182 A.2d 199, 202 (1962); see also Lilley v. Johns-Manville Corp., 408 Pa.Super. 83, 97, 596 A.2d 203, 210 (1991) (citing Rader), appeal denied, 530 Pa. 644, 607 A.2d 254 (1992).\n. See, e.g., Lancie v. Giles, 132 Pa.Cmwlth. 255, 572 A.2d 827 (1990) (holding that police officer is a local agency employee and subject to civil suit under Section 8550 of the PSTCA); Keeler v. Everett Area School Dist., 111 Pa.Cmwlth. 297, 533 A.2d 836 (1987) (holding that high school principal was a local agency employee but was nonetheless immune from civil suit because his actions did not constitute wilful misconduct); Acker v. Spangler, 92 Pa.Cmwlth. 616, 500 A.2d 206 (1985) (holding that school district employee was a local agency employee subject to civil suit under Section 8550 of the PSTCA); Morris v. Musser, 84 Pa.Cmwlth. 170, 478 A.2d 937 (1984) (holding that police officer was a local agency employee subject to civil suit under Section 8550 of the PSTCA).",
