Ward and Medashefski left Ward’s residence to go to a bar and appellant remained at the residence with Ms. Ward’s four sleeping children and Ryan. Appellant called Medashefski at the bar twice, after which she and Ward returned to the residence. Upon Medashefski’s return, appellant handed her Ryan, who was limp and not breathing. Appellant had called an ambulance which arrived shortly and transported the child to the hospital. The child was put on life support; however, it was determined that the child was brain dead and, thereafter, baby Ryan was removed from life support.</p>

He initially claimed that he had consumed four to five beers at 4:00 p.m. He said he napped and awoke to hear the baby gasping, face down on the floor and with blood in his mouth, and to see Ward’s four-year-old running up the stairs. He said he tried resuscitation measures and then called Medashefski and an ambulance.</p>

He explained that while sitting on the couch, he had been tossing Ryan in the air and leaned too far back so that the baby hit the right side of his head on the back of the couch. He then put Ryan in a car seat and, as appellant let go, Ryan fell backwards and struck his head on the floor, which is linoleum over concrete.</p>

    <p id="b412-5" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[248,475,1166,792]]]'>The expert testimony at trial contradicted the appellant’s claim that the baby’s injuries were accidental and the result of rough play. Dr. James Caggiano testified that his examination of the baby revealed that the part of the baby’s brain that controlled breathing had suffered trauma, that the left forehead and left side of the head had bruises, and that fluid was inside the baby’s brain. He also testified that as a result of the infant’s broken clavicle,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the baby would have experienced pain every time he was picked up, shaken or struck in the head. Also, an expert in the field of ophthalmology testified as to the effect of appellant’s beating on the baby’s eyes. He stated that the blood vessels in the baby’s eyes had exploded, causing blood to pour into both corneas and that the amount of force necessary to cause such injuries would be extremely severe.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.6",412,[245,1314,1163,584]]]'>The coroner, Dr. George E. Hudock, Jr., who performed the autopsy testified that he found evidence of bone fractures and injuries to the head and that the baby sustained substantial pain. He testified that the baby’s ribs contained breaks which occurred the day before death and that the baby’s left clavicle had a fracture which was several weeks old. He concluded that the cause of death was “closed head injury with extensive epicranial and subarachnoid hemorrhages,” that six to ten blows were inflicted on the baby’s head, that the blows were on at least forty percent of the baby’s head<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that it would have taken more than five minutes to inflict those injuries.</p>

Dr. Hudock compared beating to other causes of death, e.g., shooting, stabbing, etc., and stated that beating is the one that causes the most pain. He also testified that <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>between fifteen minutes and one hour elapsed before the five-month-old baby stopped feeling pain.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[195,468,1157,580]]]'>The infliction of these injuries demonstrates a willful, premeditated, and deliberate killing by a fully developed adult man of a helpless five-month-old infant boy. Any reasonable human being would realize that these injuries would cause death to such a young infant. The evidence is more than sufficient to demonstrate that appellant committed the death-producing acts and had, at the time of the killing, a specific intent to kill the infant. Here, viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, a jury could have found each element of an intentional killing beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

While an evidentiary hearing is not mandated in every case that ineffectiveness of counsel is raised, the record reflects that an evidentiary hearing was held on appellant’s claim that counsel was ineffective and all of appellant’s claims were deemed meritless.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.7",413,[192,1750,1157,412]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that trial counsel’s performance was so deficient as to be no representation at all and, therefore, that prejudice should be presumed. Where a review of the record reveals that counsel’s representation was deficient, prejudice is not presumed; rather, defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice in individual instances. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/532/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="532 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1835905" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0265-01">532 Pa. 265</a>, 274, <a href="/pa/532/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="532 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1835905" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0265-01">615 A.2d 716</a>, 720 (1992).

Appellant argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to have a stenographer present to transcribe the notes of testimony <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>from the preliminary hearing. Counsel indicated that, instead of using a stenographer, he took notes and that these notes allowed him to fully and fairly cross-examine the witnesses at trial. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that counsel erred in failing to have a stenographer present to transcribe the preliminary hearing or, in any event, that such failure caused him prejudice.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[248,749,1164,628]]]'>Appellant also argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to conduct “meaningful discovery” and to pursue insanity, mental deficiency or intoxication defenses based on the information contained in the discovery materials. Counsel testified that evidence which the Commonwealth referred to at trial was received by the defense sufficiently in advance of trial to permit adequate preparation. Further, the record reflects that appellant admitted that counsel was very familiar with the contents of the discovery binder obtained from the Commonwealth. Finally, appellant has failed to establish that any of the claimed defenses had a chance of success. Appellant’s claim has no merit.</p>
    <p id="b414-6" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[244,1418,1166,746]]]'>Appellant then argues that counsel erred by failing to file an omnibus pre-trial motion to suppress the three inconsistent statements provided by appellant. The mere failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v. Stoyko, </em><a href="/pa/504/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="504 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1787796" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0455-01">504 Pa. 455</a>, 465 n. 2, <a href="/pa/504/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="504 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1787796" data-case-paths="/pa/504/0455-01">475 A.2d 714</a>, 720 n. 2 (1984). In appellant’s case, counsel testified that he thoroughly discussed the matter with appellant, that appellant acknowledged that the statements were voluntary, and that there were no grounds for a suppression motion. Further, in light of the fact that appellant received proper <em>Miranda </em>warnings and signed a waiver of rights form before giving his statements, appellant has not indicated how a suppression motion would have been successful. His claim lacks any merit.</p>
    <p id="b414-7" data-blocks='[["BL_414.7",414,[244,2196,1165,205]],["BL_415.1",415,[204,343,1157,303]]]'>Appellant’s third contention is that counsel was ineffective dining voir dire for not objecting to the trial court’s suggestion that the jury avoid media accounts of the trial. The record reflects that the trial court, at the beginning of <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>voir dire, “suggested” that the entire panel avoid the media and that counsel believed that the jurors were adequately instructed to do so. Appellant called no members of the jury panel to support his claim that a “suggestion” meant something less to the jurors than a court “instruction.” This claim is meritless.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[201,689,1159,790]]]'>Appellant then argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for sequestration or a change of venue or venire.

    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[197,1522,1158,737]]]'>Appellant also argues that counsel was ineffective when questioning prospective jurors, and using peremptory challenges instead of challenging jurors for cause and striking jurors who were against the death penalty. Counsel, an experienced attorney who had been picking juries for twenty years, testified at the evidentiary hearing that he believed the ultimate jury panel was fair. He explained there were many reasons why he challenged or struck potential jurors who may have also been opposed to the death penalty. One reason was that he selected jurors he thought would be sympathetic to appellant. Also, the record reflects that appellant failed to establish at the evidentiary hearing that he was not given a fair, competent and impartial jury based on trial counsel’s tactics.

In appellant’s case, the Commonwealth offered testimony from four witnesses in order to demonstrate motive and malice. This testimony demonstrated that appellant had abused the baby before: by throwing the baby boy on the couch, into a car seat, and headfirst into a bassinet; by smacking and punching him; by shaking and bruising him; and by swearing at him. The testimony also demonstrated that appellant had physically and emotionally abused the baby’s mother, Medashefski. This testimony was also relevant because it contradicted appellant’s suggestion that the baby’s injuries were accidental. Counsel testified he had raised the issue of admissibility of abuse testimony in his brief but that, once the trial court ruled on the issue, he did not further object on the record because he believed that the trial court’s ruling was correct. Further, he did not want to highlight to the jury some of the evidence by objecting to it. Appellant has failed to demonstrate that any of the referenced evidence was inadmissible or that counsel erred. There is no merit to this claim.</p>

The majority concludes that trial counsel was ineffective in the present case because he failed to obtain mitigating evidence which <em>may </em>have existed. However, appellant does not even specifically allege that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence of mental state as a mitigating factor during the penalty phase of trial. In his brief, appellant merely alleges that trial counsel failed to present sufficient, proper evidence of mitigation. Although appellant lists the mitigating factors listed in the death penalty statute,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> he does not focus on any specific mitigating factor, nor does he identify any evidence which would support any particular mitigating factor.

As the majority candidly admits, appellant failed to present any evidence at the evidentiary hearing which would establish the existence of evidence of appellant’s mental state which trial counsel supposedly should have discovered prior to the penalty phase. Absent such a showing, appellant has failed to meet his burden of <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>establishing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence at the penalty phase, as appellant has failed to demonstrate that any such evidence exists.
