This says nothing that is not true in every case where summary judgment has once been denied and a second judge has a different view. In effect, the defendant has happened upon a judge for trial who agrees with the analysis that the first judge did not accept. In <em>Harrity, </em>Superior Court properly emphasized the need for finality and the prevention of judge shopping.
