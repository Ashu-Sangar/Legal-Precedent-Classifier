(hereinafter heirs) are the heirs and assigns of Ethel Mae Stewart. They initiated the present <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>action to quiet title to the oil and gas located upon and under a tract of land which was conveyed by Ethel Mae Stewart to Gary L. Young and Sarah L. Caruso et al. (hereinafter buyers and possible claimants). The trial court held that the general warranty deed from Stewart to buyers did not convey any rights to oil and gas and that buyers and possible claimants were barred from asserting any right, title, hen or interest in the oil and gas. Superior Court reversed.</p>

The deed refers to this land as the first and second tracts. With respect to the oil and gas, Stewart’s deed of December 25, 1973 contained the following language:</p>
    <blockquote id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[241,1183,1108,211]]]'>EXCEPTING AND RESERVING from First Tract and Second Tract all the coal and mining rights and the oil and gas as fully as the same have been excepted and reserved or conveyed by former owners.</blockquote>

Heirs contend that the language does reserve oil and gas rights in the grantor, and in any event, construing the deed as a whole makes it clear that the oil and gas rights were not conveyed.</p>
    <p id="b461-8" data-blocks='[["BL_461.8",461,[193,1740,1158,657]]]'>The rationale of the trial court’s holding in favor of the heirs was twofold: first, that since the oil and gas estates had been severed from the surface estate more than 76 years ago and had followed different chains of ownership, the reservation clause was sufficient to reserve interest in the oil and gas to the grantor (i.e., the oil and gas had been excepted, reserved and conveyed by former owners, and by the terms of the present deed it was excepted and reserved now); and second, since the deed sets forth a description of the land conveyed which incorporates a description in a previous deed, and the previous deed reserves interest in the oil and gas, the oil and gas are reserved in the grantor.</p>

      <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>Superior Court disagreed, holding that the reservation clause does not clearly express an intention to limit the fee, and must, therefore, be construed against the grantor. The court further concluded that the above reservation clause was included in the deed in order to limit the grantor’s liability on the warranty of the deed, not to reserve an interest in the oil and gas to the grantor.</p>

That issue is not involved in this case as the method of mining was clearly stated. The deed of 1918 in which the oil and gas was originally separated from the fee stated:</p>

Had the grantor intended only to exclude oil and gas interests which had been conveyed previously to persons other than the grantor, the usual way to do that would be to use only the term “excepting.” By using both terms, she protected herself from liability under the general warranty deed and created in herself an estate in the oil and gas.</p>

The relevant facts with respect to the chain of title as recited by the trial court and as stipulated by the parties are that in 1891 John Stewart died seized in fee of a certain tract of land in Washington Township, Indiana County, containing approximately 151 acres, 70 perches. He devised this land to his sons, Michael C. Stewart and John R. Stewart. In May of 1918 the sons made an amicable partition of this land by exchanging deeds in which each received 75 acres, 115 perches, hereinafter referred to as Tract 1 and Tract 2.

The remaining one-third interest in the gas and oil was owned by William L. Stewart, brother of John Lloyd Stewart. At the time the case was decided, William L.

In <em>New Charter, </em>New Charter Coal Co. owned the coal rights under a parcel of land owned by the McKees, subject to reservation in the McKees of a certain strip of coal. New Charter Coal Co. sought permission to strip mine for their coal, which was located beneath the reserved coal owned by the McKees. This court held that strip mining could not have been intended where coal which had been reserved lay between the surface and the granted coal, even though the grantors had waived their right to support of the surface and gave to the person holding the coal rights the right to remove "all and every particle of said coal” without responsibility for damage to the surface caused by removal of the coal. <a href="/pa/411/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="411 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="1885988" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0307-01">411 Pa. at 313</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20830" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="191 A.2d 830">191 A.2d 830</a>.

Here, the reservation clause dictated that the parties reserve the oil and gas rights in the same way that former owners had reserved them. Only by looking at the prior deeds can we determine the parties’ intent. <em>See Johns v. Castellucci, </em><a href="/pa-super/264/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="264 Pa.

Every deed in the chain of title excepted and reserved the oil and gas rights. In this context, which the Superior Court failed to consider, the deed did not convey the oil and gas rights to the buyers.</p>
