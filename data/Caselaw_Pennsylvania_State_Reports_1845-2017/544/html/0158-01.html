Their bodies were discovered after appellant’s uncle had not shown up for work and his employer went to the home to see if anything was wrong. The employer entered the home through the basement door, discovered the uncle’s dead body and summoned the police. When the police arrived at the home, they found appellant’s grandmother with a single gunshot wound in the forehead in the upstairs bedroom. Appellant’s uncle was found shot to death lying on a couch in the basement. During the subsequent investigation, the police spoke to appellant’s mother who informed the police that all she knew was that the night before, appellant had taken his brother’s firearm and had gone to the area in Cumbola village known as Five Points to go “shooting.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> After obtaining this information, the police went to appellant’s apartment and transported him to the police station for questioning.</p>

He and Miles then went to his grandmother’s house where he shot his uncle. Appellant refused to give the police any information regarding the shooting of his grandmother.

Once they arrived at the house, Miles accompanied appellant, who was armed with the rifle, down into the basement of the house where appellant’s uncle was sleeping. Appellant then fired a single shot into his uncle’s head killing him instantly. He then told Miles to search his uncle’s pockets and take his uncle’s wallet which contained a sum of cash. Thereafter, the two men went upstairs to the grandmother’s bedroom. As appellant’s grandmother was speaking to him, he shot her in the forehead one time killing her instantly as well.
