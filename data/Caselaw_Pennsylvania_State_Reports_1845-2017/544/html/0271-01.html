This Court then held that since there was no adequate administrative remedy available to appellants, the Commonwealth Court erred in transferring this case to the Environmental Hearing Board.

    <p id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[185,697,1156,844]]]'>Appellants argued that the taking of their land, which was done pursuant to the EQB regulation, amounted to a <em>de facto </em>taking. Since <em>de facto </em>takings are cognizable under the Eminent Domain Code, appellants reasoned that the Clear-field County Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction over their pre-enforcement challenges since the Eminent Domain Code vests initial jurisdiction in the court of common pleas of the county in which the property is located. <em>See </em>26 P.S. § 1-401. Appellees, however, did not address appellants’ jurisdictional argument based on the Eminent Domain Code since they believed the focus of the appeal was on whether appellants had adequate administrative remedies for their claim. This Court sided with appellants’ jurisdictional argument and thus, pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code, remanded appellants’ pre-enforcement challenges to the Clearfield County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Appellees sought reargument because they believed that they were not afforded an opportunity to adequately address this jurisdictional issue since it was not the main focus of the earlier appeal before this Court. Appellees alleged in their reargument petition that this Court’s reliance on the Eminent Domain Code to remand this matter was misplaced since appellants’ pre-enforcement challenges concern a regulation promulgated pursuant to the Commonwealth’s exercise of its police powers. Thus, Appellees argued that this case should have been remanded to the <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>Commonwealth Court since it falls within that court’s original jurisdiction when there are no adequate administrative remedies available or they have'been exhausted. Appellants opposed appellees’ reargument petition because they believe this Court correctly relied on the Eminent Domain Code to remand the matter to the Clearfield County Court of Common Pleas. We granted reargument on October 24, 1995 in order to consider whether the distinction advanced by appellees in their petition for reargument affected the jurisdictional determination for this case.

We recognize that sometimes a state action taken pursuant to its police powers can go too far and constitute a <em>de facto </em>taking requiring the state to provide just compensation. <em>See United Artists' Theater Circuit, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="535 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1841544" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01">535 Pa. 370</a>, 379-80, <a href="/pa/535/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="635 A.2d 612" data-case-ids="1841544,7368836" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0370-01,/a2d/635/0612-01">635 A.2d 612</a>, 617-18 (1993). However, we believe that a decision on whether the taking in this case went too far is a question best left for the Commonwealth Court since an adequate record has not yet been developed on this issue.</p>
