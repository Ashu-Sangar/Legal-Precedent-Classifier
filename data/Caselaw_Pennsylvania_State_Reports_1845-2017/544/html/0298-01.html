    <p id="b479-8" data-blocks='[["BL_479.9",479,[194,889,1155,149]]]'>This appeal raises the issue of whether concrete barriers installed by Appellant, Robert Walker, constitute a “structure” so as to require a building permit.</p>
    <p id="b479-9" data-blocks='[["BL_479.10",479,[189,1077,1160,693]]]'>Appellant is the lessee of property in the Borough of Doylestown, Bucks County, and the owner of Doylestown Car Wash. On March 12, 1992, he applied for a fence permit. The Borough denied the application, finding that the fence was actually a “structure” which required a building permit. Appellant then filed an action in mandamus against the Borough of Doylestown and its Director of Building and Zoning, Philip C. Ehlinger (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Borough”). Therein, Appellant contended that the Borough was “required” to issue the permit because Appellant properly applied for the same and was lawfully entitled to it. The parties thereafter submitted a •written stipulation of facts to the trial court for disposition of the case.</p>
    <p id="b479-10" data-blocks='[["BL_479.11",479,[185,1809,1160,584]],["BL_480.1",480,[265,347,1160,152]]]'>The stipulation provided that: (1) the subject concrete barriers measured 8 to 10 feet long, 3 feet high and 1 foot thick, and weighed 2 tons each; (2) the barriers were not joined or attached to each other, but were free standing; (3) the barriers did not rest on footings, nor were they affixed to the ground, but rather were simply placed on the ground; (4) the barriers were movable; and, (5) there were 8 concrete barriers placed upon Appellant’s property for the purpose of preventing alleged vehicular trespass. The parties further agreed that the only issue for the court was whether the concrete barriers constituted a “structure” pursuant to the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>Borough’s code of ordinances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The trial court dismissed the mandamus action, holding that Appellant failed to meet the standard for granting a writ of mandamus.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[263,522,1161,419]]]'>Appellant appealed to the Commonwealth Court. Thereafter, however, the parties filed a joint motion requesting that the matter be considered under the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 7531-7541. The Commonwealth Court remanded to the trial court. The trial court subsequently entered an order declaring that the concrete barriers constituted a “structure” under the ordinance and thus required a building permit under the provisions of the Code.</p>
    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[261,965,1165,471]]]'>The Commonwealth Court affirmed. Judge Kelley filed a dissenting opinion in which he stated that the placement of non-permanent concrete blocks did not constitute a structure since the blocks were free-standing, not affixed to the ground and did not rest on footings. He found the ramifications of the majority’s decision troubling since, although the fence seemingly presented an immovable mass blocking vehicular trespass, the same could be said of a large hedge, which is clearly not a “structure.”</p>
    <p id="b480-7" data-blocks='[["BL_480.7",480,[258,1468,1163,518]]]'>Appellant argues that the lower courts erred in determining that the concrete barriers were a structure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He submits that if the concrete monoliths, which are not attached to one another or affixed to real property, are found to be a structure, then the placing of flagstones for a garden path or the setting down of parking lot bumpers would also require building permits. Appellant contends that requiring prior permission of a building official for the moving of concrete blocks renders the regulatory reach of local government unfettered.</p>
