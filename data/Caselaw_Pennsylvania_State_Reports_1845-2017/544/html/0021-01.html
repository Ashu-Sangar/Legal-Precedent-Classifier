The new trial was granted due to apparently inconsistent jury verdicts as to two separate but similar publications. The jury found both publications libelous but only one false (hence compensable), and the other <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>not proven false (hence not compensable).

    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[182,455,1158,1109]]]'>Between May 15 and May 17, 1983, the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>published a series of three articles entitled “Above the Law” (ATL I) written by Daniel R. Biddle about the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The first two articles in the series described several activities allegedly undertaken by the late Mr. Justice James T. McDermott (McDermott), both before and after his installation on the Supreme Court. These activities included improper favoritism to the coal industry, allegedly due to coal industry lobbying and entertainment of McDermott as well as contributions which the law firm representing the coal companies made to McDermott’s electoral campaign for the Supreme Court. McDermott was also reported to have improperly favored a party in a real estate case due to the party’s relationship to the law firm involved in the coal case which had made campaign contributions to McDermott. Finally, alleging nepotism, the <em>Inquirer </em>reported that McDermott had used the prestige of his office to pressure the Philadelphia County District Attorney to hire his son, Jamie McDermott, as an assistant prosecuting attorney. McDermott brought a libel action against appellees, the author and the corporations which published the articles.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[181,1588,1154,467]]]'>Appellees later reprinted the series of articles in 12" x 14" tabloid form, altering the text in minor respects and adding an editorial and two cartoons (ATL II). Copies of the tabloid publication were distributed at a February 1984 national conference of the American Bar Association and the American Judicature Society, as well as at journalism schools and newspapers throughout the country. McDermott filed a second libel action on the basis of ATL II. The two actions were consolidated in the trial court and were tried together.</p>

The jury found that McDermott had not proved that the first publication of the articles in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>was false, and awarded no damages. The jury found, however, that McDermott had proved that the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>tabloid reprint was false, awarding $3,000,000 in compensatory and $3,000,000 in punitive damages. Following the trial, McDermott died. His sons, appellants, who were the personal representatives of his estate, succeeded to his interest and were substituted as parties.</p>

Appellants emphasize the differences between the two publications: in ATL II, the original articles were explained, amplified, and exacerbated by the addition of highly critical editorial commentary and the inclusion of two cartoons ridiculing McDermott’s court. Appellees, on the other hand, minimize the differences between <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>the publications, calling them “essentially identical” and arguing that if the first series of articles did not libel McDermott, then it is logically and legally impossible for the reprint to be libelous.</p>

This judgment was rejected by the trial court, which granted a new trial, by the Superior Court in affirming, and by appellees in their arguments to this court. The Superior Court stated its rationale as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b205-8" data-blocks='[["BL_205.8",205,[230,1678,1113,690]],["BL_206.1",206,[293,313,1118,356]]]'>Although the jury considered allegations of defamation in two separate publications, ATL I and ATL II, the text of the two publications was essentially identical, as the second was largely a reprint of the first. However, ATL II was not only a reprint, but also contained certain additional material. This material consisted of two cartoons, an editorial piece and a brief introduction. None of these materials made any specific mention of Justice McDermott or his conduct. One cartoon depicted the Supreme Court building as bearing the insignia “PA. Supreme Disgrace,” with two farcical statues standing in front. The other showed the Supreme Court building with a sewer in front from which is issuing the phrase “OYEZ, OYEZ, OYEZ.” The editorial <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>was entitled “The poisoning of justice affects all Pennsylvanians.” Although the editorial was an undoubtedly negative commentary on the Supreme Court and reiterated in general terms the conclusions drawn in ATL I, it contained no new information concerning the court and no specific reference to Justice McDermott and focussed on specific allegations aimed at Justice Larsen.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[282,693,1127,891]]]'>We agree with the trial court’s determination that no reasonable explanation for the disparity in the jury’s findings can be found based on these differences in the two publications. The trial court appropriately did not consider whether the jury could have found a separately false defamatory statement concerning Justice McDermott in the cartoons or the editorial, because the McDermotts had never contended that these portions of ATL II were separately false. The court had not submitted these two items to the jury for a determination of truth or falsity and had properly instructed the jury to consider the cartoons and the editorial <em>only </em>in connection with determining whether ATL II had defamatory meaning, and <em>not </em>in determining the separate question of whether ATL II was false. Therefore, the jury’s conflicting verdicts could not be explained on the basis of the falsity of statements in the cartoons or editorials.</blockquote>

If, however, the jury understood ATL I to communicate one defamatory message and ATL II, enhanced by editorials and cartoons, to communicate a different more egregious or invidious defamatory message, then there is no inconsistency in finding that McDermott proved by clear and convincing evidence that the second publication was false though he failed <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the first was false.</p>

Though this accurately characterizes McDermott’s trial strategy, it is impossible to say that the ATL articles had precisely the same meaning in the two publications when the reprinted articles are read through the screen of editorial and cartoon comment. Indeed, in charging the jury as to the defamatory nature of the articles, the court stated:</p>

What is reasonable, of course, is always subject to honest debate. Here, however, notwithstanding the fact that the majority adopts the correct standard of review, I believe that the “reasonable theory” utilized to reach its ultimate conclusion in the matter <em>sub judice </em>is untenable and implausible.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[231,752,1173,1374]]]'>The majority attempts to harmonize the jury’s verdicts by theorizing that the jury <em>could have found </em>that the first article (“ATL I”) had a defamatory meaning which was, in fact, different and distinct from the defamatory meaning of the second article (“ATL II”). Thus, the question becomes whether this conclusion is a <em>reasonable </em>conclusion based on the facts of this case. A thorough search of the record establishes that although two separate complaints stating independent causes of action were filed and later consolidated for trial, neither initial pleading suggests that the two newspaper articles were capable of two separate and distinct defamatory meanings. To the contrary, the complaints at issue claim that both ATL I and ATL II had the <em>same </em>defamatory meaning. Furthermore, I can find no indication that any alternate theory of defamation was ever presented in evidence or argued at trial; nor was any alternative theory the subject of the trial court’s formal charge to the jury. Thus, to conclude that the lay jury, when deliberating this matter, “could have” come up with an alternative theory of defamation is to conclude that the lay jury possessed significantly more legal talent than any of the professionals involved in the case. Hypothesizing that the jury might have created a new theory of defamation, one on which apparently no evidence was offered and on which the jury was not charged by the court, to me seems to be an eminently <em>unreasonable </em>theory, and therefore, violative of our standard of review.</p>
