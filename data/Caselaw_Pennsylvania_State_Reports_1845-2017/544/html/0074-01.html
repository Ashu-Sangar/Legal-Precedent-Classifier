As stipulated, RossAraco was formed in November 1981 following a merger of Ross Construction Corporation (“Ross”) and Araco Company (“Araco”). Ross was originally known as Araco Construction and Realty Co., Inc. from the time of its incorporation in New Jersey on December 16, 1957, until March 5,1963.

The remaining 21.5 acres of land were heavily wooded and were unimproved during Ross-Araco’s ownership.

The Board of Finance and Revenue asserts that the gain is business income under the functional <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>test as well because the 21.5 acres were regularly pledged as collateral to obtain performance bid bonds from insurance companies, and that without performance bid bonds, RossAraco could not engage in business as a general construction contractor.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[247,651,1160,484]]]'>Ross-Araco responds that the gain from the sale was non-business income under the transactional test because it was not derived from transactions in which it regularly engages. Ross-Araco asserts also that the sale cannot be construed as a transaction in the course of a secondary “investment business” because at no time did it or its predecessor ever engage in the business of buying, selling, and holding real estate. Nor is the functional test satisfied as the property was not used to produce income while owned by Ross-Araco.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Only one other sale of real property had occurred in the 31 years that Ross-Araco and its predecessors conducted business activity in the Commonwealth. The court dismissed as irrelevant the mere statement of proposed business activities contained in the 1958 application for a certificate of authority to do business in Pennsylvania filed by Araco Construction and Realty Company, Inc., stating that “the relevant consideration under the transactional test is the frequency and regularity of the similar transactions in which Taxpayer was <em>actually </em>engaged in the past <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>practice of the business.” <em>Ross-Araco v.

    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[196,468,1157,533]]]'>The court also rejected the argument that the gain from the sale is business income from the regular course of RossAraco’s investment activities. While the record indicates that Ross-Araco maintained substantial investments in U.S. Treasury Notes and mutual funds, there was no evidence that the 21.5 acre tract was directly or indirectly involved in RossAraco’s investment activities and produced investment income before its sale. The transactional test requires comparison of the transaction at issue with similar transactions of the taxpayer’s past business practice. The court stated,</p>

The acquisition, management, and disposition of real property were not integral parts of Ross-Araco’s regular trade or business. Nor did the real estate produce any income during Ross-Araco’s ownership. This case was distinguished from <em>Welded Tube </em>in which it was the taxpayer’s regular practice to acquire property to expand its business operations.</p>

The parties stipulated that during the period from 1984 to 1989, Ross-Araco’s total assets steadily <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>rose from $4,193,531 to $13,596,554. During that period of time and up until the time of sale, the 21.5 acre tract had been listed on the balance sheet at its original cost value of $11,099.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[254,546,1162,529]]]'>The Board of Finance and Revenue concedes that the sale of the real estate was not in the regular course of RossAraco’s construction business, but argues that it was a transaction within the course of its regular and ongoing investment activities. It asserts that the purchase and sale of undeveloped real estate is a passive investment activity similar to the purchase and sale of U.S. Treasury Notes, money market funds, or mutual funds. The use of the sale proceeds to invest additional sums in U.S. Treasury Notes is said to support this position.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[251,1115,1162,529]]]'>Acquisitions and sales of real property may generate business income when the taxpayer regularly engages in such transactions. For example, in <em>Welded Tube </em>the taxpayer originally purchased property in Philadelphia as the site of its manufacturing facility in 1957 and then purchased thirteen additional contiguous parcels of land between 1958 to 1963 for the expansion of the facility. In 1974, the taxpayer acquired thirty-five acres of land in Alabama for a new manufacturing facility that was never constructed. The properties in Philadelphia and Alabama were later sold.</p>
    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.7",266,[247,1685,1163,518]]]'>Unlike <em>Welded Tube, </em>however, the property involved in this case was never improved or used in the construction business. The record indicates that its purchase was incidental to the acquisition of the 3 acre tract on which there was a building suitable for storage of equipment and materials used by RossAraco in its construction activities. There is.no indication that the 21.5 acres were purchased to expand Ross-Araco’s investment portfolio which was used as collateral to secure performance bid bonds. The Commonwealth Court’s analysis of the issue was correct.</p>

Ross-Araco relies also upon a regulation adopted by the Department of Revenue that was in effect when the subject property was sold. The regulation, which was formerly found at 61 Pa.Code § 153.24 before its repeal, was issued after the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Welded Tube </em>and included illustrative examples of business income and non-business income. We need not address Ross-Araco’s argument that the regulation is controlling in this case in view of our disposition of its other arguments.</p>
