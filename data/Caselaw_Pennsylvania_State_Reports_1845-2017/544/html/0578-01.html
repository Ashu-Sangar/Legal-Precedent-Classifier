Fortunately, Ms. Fisher was not struck by the bullet, and, instead, was able to run into a nearby alley. Appellant followed her into the alley and held the gun to her head, threatening to kill her. When Ms. Fisher refused Appellant’s request to release the child she was holding, Appellant knocked the child from her arms and then choked Ms. Fisher and struck her with the gun.

Similarly, Foster was found in contempt after the court found he had committed the crime of simple assault.

To apply the <em>Blockburger </em>test in the literalist and formalistic manner espoused by the Superior Court would simply undercut the very foundation of the guarantee sought to be protected. Although the Superior Court appears to rely on what it believes to be the focus of Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in <em>Dixon and Foster, </em>it would be folly to conclude that the leader of our nation’s highest court is not fully aware of the true focus of the law of double jeopardy and successive prosecution. In short, because the double jeopardy guarantee is meant to deal with particular defendants and <em>actual </em>circumstances, we conclude that an approach that scrutinizes anything other than the actual offense or offenses prosecuted in the contempt proceeding, undermines that very constitutional guarantee being questioned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

However, based on the record presented to our court, there is no indication that the trial court, at the contempt hearing, ever found Appellant guilty of terroristic threats. Even if the finding of contempt was based on the fact that Appellant threatened to kill Ms. Fisher, the trial court need not have found that the elements of the crime of terroristic threats were established since the PFA order prohibited Appellant not from committing the crime of terroristic threats, but only from “threatening” Ms. Fisher.

His wife filed several separate motions to have Foster held in contempt for numerous alleged violations of the CPO, three of which involved instances of alleged threats and two of which involved alleged assaults. At the ensuing bench trial, the court informed Mrs. Foster that with respect to the assault charges she would have to prove first that there was a CPO and then, that an assault as defined by the criminal code in fact occurred. At the conclusion of the trial, the court found Foster guilty of contempt of the CPO with respect to two specific incidents of assault, but not guilty on other grounds. The United States Attorney's Office subsequently obtained an indictment charging Foster with simple assault, threatening to injure another and assault with intent to kill, all of which were based upon the same events which gave rise to the contempt proceedings.

In <em>Allen, </em>the defendant had been ordered pursuant to the PFA. order to refrain from physically abusing his wife and/or their children. Charges of simple assault and trespass were subsequently filed against the defendant as a result of his forcible entry into his wife’s home and his concomitant abuse of her. Several days later, the defendant was charged with contempt of the PFA order. Following a hearing, the <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>defendant was found to be in contempt of the PFA order. Another criminal complaint, this one charging the defendant with raping his wife during the course of his earlier assault and trespass, was then filed against the defendant. All three criminal charges were consolidated for trial. Defendant filed an Omnibus Pretrial Motion seeking to quash the three informations claiming that they were barred by double jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion and the Superior Court affirmed as to the trespass and rape charges, but reversed on the simple assault charge finding that it was, indeed, barred by double jeopardy. On appeal, this court held, in relevant part, that indirect criminal contempt and simple assault were separate offenses under the <em>Blockburger </em>test because (1) the two offenses contained the "requisite 'separate elements' " since the "defendant could have willfully violated the court order by any number of actions,” and (2) the two offenses served distinct purposes in that the purpose of a contempt order is the protection of our judicial system from abuse, not punishment for a criminal act. <em>Allen, </em>at 514, <a href="/pa/506/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="506 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1790920" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0500-01">486 A.2d at 370</a>.</p>
