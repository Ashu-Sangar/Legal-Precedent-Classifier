    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[256,480,1163,631]]]'>Sun Company, Inc. appeals a Commonwealth Court Order awarding unemployment benefits to former Sun employee Ronald Rossi. The issues before this Court are whether an employer must show that an employee’s actions were detrimental to the employer or done with an intent to defraud in order to establish willful misconduct under the Unemployment Compensation Act. Also at issue is whether the standard required to establish willful misconduct varies depending upon the length of an employee’s employment. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that the employee in this case had not engaged in willful misconduct and thus we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.7",444,[251,1144,1165,638]]]'>Ronald Rossi was a senior manager at Sun’s Pittsburgh division. He was employed by Sun for four years and by Sun’s predecessor for over 25 years. Mr. Rossi was responsible for sales and supervised two sales managers and the sales force. He and the other sales employees frequently traveled and entertained prospective customers. Mr. Rossi submitted expense reports to Sun for reimbursement of the costs he incurred. He also approved the expense reports submitted by the other sales employees. While Mr. Rossi never received a written policy or attended a meeting on expense reports, he understood that they should contain business as opposed to personal expenses.</p>

Sun found many discrepancies in Mr. Rossi’s reports. On several occasions in 1992, Mr. Rossi inaccurately reported where he was on a particular day. In March 1992, for example, Mr. Rossi went to the Big East Basketball Conference Tournament in New York but recorded on his expense report that he was working in Pittsburgh. Similarly, Mr. Rossi was at his second home in Avalon, New Jersey on July 16 and 17, 1992 but recorded on his expense report that he was working in Harrisburg and York, Pennsylvania. As a <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>result of the investigation, on November 12, 1992, Sun suspended Mr. Rossi with pay pending further investigation.

The Pittsburgh Job Center denied benefits because Mr. Rossi had engaged in willful misconduct. Mr. Rossi appealed. After a three-day hearing, the Referee affirmed the denial of benefits. Mr. Rossi appealed again and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review affirmed the Referee’s findings. Mr. Rossi appealed to the Commonwealth Court and Sun intervened. The Commonwealth Court reversed and found that Mr. Rossi had not engaged in willful misconduct.</p>

Mr. Rossi argues that the agreement encompasses all disputes including the dispute over Mr. Rossi’s unemployment benefits. The agreement, however, states that the intention of the parties is to resolve all claims that Mr. Rossi has against Sun. Nowhere does the agreement address Sun’s ability to dispute Mr. Rossi’s claim against the Unemployment Compensation Fund or any other third party. Moreover, while Mr. Rossi releases Sun from all of his claims in the agreement, Sun has not executed such a release.</p>

If they intended to include this appeal in their agreement, it seems incredible that they would not have said so somewhere in the 11 page document.

In addition, Mr. Rossi reported that he was working in Harrisburg on July 16, 1992 and in York on July 17, 1992. In fact, Mr. Rossi was in Avalon, New Jersey on these dates. While he recorded no expenses, he offered no explanation for lying about his whereabouts. At his hearing, Mr. Rossi admitted that this misrepresentation was “stupid.”</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[259,972,1165,521]]]'>Absent good cause, we will not condone Mr. Rossi’s deliberate misrepresentations to Sun concerning his work. Such misrepresentations constitute a willful disregard of Sun’s interests. The record is void of any evidence that other employees reported false locations on their reports or that this was a common practice at Sun. Mr. Rossi’s departure from expected standards is underscored by the fact that one of his duties as manager was to review the expense reports of lower-level employees. We therefore reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

On August 25, 1995, after Sun filed its brief in support of its appeal, Mr. Rossi petitioned this Court for permission to file a settlement agreement under seal which allegedly bars Sun from pursuing the appeal. On August 30, 1995, Mr. Rossi moved to quash Sun’s appeal based upon the settlement. Sun opposed Mr. Rossi’s motion to quash on September 8, 1995. On September 11, 1995 and September 13, 1995 respectively, the Unemployment Compensation Board opposed Mr. Rossi's petition to file the settlement agreement under seal and motion to quash. During oral argument on December 4, 1995, we granted Mr. Rossi’s petition to file the settlement agreement under seal and took his motion to quash under advisement.</p>

We find that Mr. Rossi justified the false entries on his June 1, 2, and 3, 1992 expense reports. On his June 1 report, Mr. Rossi reported mileage expenses for travel from his home office in Pittsburgh to Harrisburg. In fact, he traveled from Pittsburgh to Avalon, New Jersey for pleasure on May 29 and Avalon to Harrisburg for work on June 1. Mr. Rossi’s inclusion of only the business portion of his travel did not <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>disregard a standard that Sun had a right to expect. On June 2, Mr. Rossi reported mileage expenses for work in the Harrisburg area. He had also traveled from Harrisburg to Philadelphia to work, to Cherry Hill, New Jersey to have lunch with a relative, and back to Harrisburg for a meeting. Since Mr. Rossi was unsure whether this was primarily a business trip, his failure to include a partly personal trip on his report did not violate a standard that Sun had a right to expect. Similarly, on his June 3 report, Mr. Rossi recorded travel from Harrisburg to Philadelphia. In fact, Mr. Rossi made this trip and then went to Avalon. He did not report his travel to Avalon since it was for pleasure.</p>
