      <em>Belasco </em>involved a School Board’s dismissal of two teachers after the School Board found them guilty of charges including willful violation of the School Laws of Pennsylvania.

Pursuant to sections 1126 through 1129, a School Board notifies the tenured professional employe of the charges upon which his dismissal is based; the School Board then conducts an evidentiary hearing on these charges and determines whether dismissal is warranted.
