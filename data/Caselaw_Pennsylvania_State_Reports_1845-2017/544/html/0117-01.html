In reference to the characterization of appellant as the “David Duke of Chester County,” the court held that this comment was not defamatory because although it was typing a politician in what may be considered a crude manner it was nonetheless an opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 8-9.</p>

According to appellant, the superi- or court imposed adverse inferences on him rather than giving him the benefit of all inferences which could be drawn at the preliminary objection stage of the proceedings. Appellant asserts that the superior court avoided the fair inference that in addition to labeling him a racist, the article accused him of carrying out his official duties as the district attorney in a racist manner. Additionally, appellant claims that the superi- or court erred in concluding that there are no circumstances under which appellee’s statement could be considered defamatory. It is appellant’s position that the statement is defamatory because its effect is to “accuse MacElree of abusing his office, violating his sworn oath, and committing state and <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>federal offenses.” Brief for appellant at 13.

    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[208,549,1155,577]]]'>Appellant also argues that an accusation of racism should be actionable defamation, as it can cause damage to an individual’s reputation and career. Additionally, it is his position that the claim that a statement is merely an opinion will not protect a defendant from liability for defamation. Appellant’s argument is that because the statement attacked his actions as a public official, rather than being a metaphor as found by the superior court, the accusation can be verified as true or false and therefore is capable of being defamatory. Accordingly, appellant argues that the preliminary objections should have been denied.</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[206,1164,1157,477]]]'>Appellees, on the other hand, argue that the superior court properly applied the standard for reviewing the grant of preliminary objections and that the publication was not defamatory. They contend that appellant failed to meet his burden of establishing a claim of defamation. It is appellees’ position that it is not enough to allege that the publication is capable of any defamatory meaning. Rather, the court must be able to find that the defamatory meaning asserted by the complainant can be construed from the allegedly defamatory language.</p>

According to appellees, the language at issue amounted to nothing more than name calling and a charge of racism using hyperbole. It is their position that appellant’s claim relies on unsupported innuendo to state a cause of action for defamation. Appellees argue that the average reader would not interpret the language in appellees’ article to mean what appellant claims. Moreover, appellees argue, appellant takes the statement out of context with the remainder of the article in order to support his interpretation thereof. Appellees also argue that even if the statement were improperly attributed to Glanton, it would not support a defamation action <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>unless it were capable of causing reputational harm.

In other words, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the statement published by the Appellees amounted to a mere allegation of racism which would not be actionable. This decision is consonant with the standard of review at this juncture in the case. Appellees made preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer which the trial court granted. The standard of review for .preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is limited; “the question presented by the demurrer is whether, on the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible. Where a doubt exists as to whether a demurrer should be sustained, this doubt should be resolved in favor of overruling it.” <em>AM/PM Franchise v.

Indeed, because there is doubt as to the statement’s precise import, and as to whether reasonable minds could understand the statement to constitute a charge of abuse of public office, <em>i.e., </em>that the District Attorney was persecuting Lincoln in order to curry favor with the voters by playing to the voters’ supposed prejudice so as to advance his own political career, the demurrer should have been denied.
