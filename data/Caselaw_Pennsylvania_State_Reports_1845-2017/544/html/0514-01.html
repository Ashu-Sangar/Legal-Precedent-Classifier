First, in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, then outside of New Cumberland, the two men asked for directions. At approximately 10:30 a.m., Appellant and Anderson arrived in New Cumberland and parked their car in Maple Alley. Maple <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>Alley runs perpendicular to Fourth Street. Appellant walked across Fourth Street to the D &amp; S Coin Shop which was owned by Mr. Dale Rishel. The coin shop was a one-room building with storefront windows. Appellant knocked on the door to the coin shop and entered. A resident of Fourth Street, Mr. Vinh Tran, observed Appellant pass him on the street and noted that Appellant knocked on the coin shop door, since few people knocked before entering. Anderson followed and entered the coin shop shortly thereafter, carrying gloves and a bag. Again, Mr. Tran observed Anderson and found remarkable Anderson’s heavy clothing on such a warm summer’s morning.</p>
    <p id="b702-5" data-blocks='[["BL_702.5",702,[243,1007,1166,522]]]'>Once inside the coin shop, Appellant asked Mr. Rishel about specific gold coins. Mr. Rishel responded that he did not carry that inventory but suggested another dealer. Appellant then pulled a revolver from under his shirt and he and Anderson came across the counter onto Mr. Rishel to subdue him. The front window of the store was broken during this altercation. Mr. Rishel was taped across the face and around his legs, and his hands were tied behind his back with a cord. Appellant kicked Mr. Rishel in the head, while Anderson began to go through Mr. Rishel’s goods.</p>

Mr. Howie called 911. Officer Willis Cole of the New Cumberland Police Department ultimately responded to the 911 call. Officer Cole parked his squad car on Fourth Street in front of Mr. David Michael’s barbershop, which is on the same side of Fourth Street as the coin shop. As Officer Cole approached the coin shop, the perpetrators apparently became aware of his presence and, finding no rear escape, exited the front door, first Appellant, then Anderson.</p>

Officer Cole ordered Anderson to lie face down and prepared to handcuff him. Mr. Michaels watched as Appellant, with his back against a building and revolver drawn, reappeared from Maple Alley as if he had circled part of the block. Appellant then sprinted from <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the alley toward Officer Cole shooting at Officer Cole as he ran. Having been warned by individuals in the street, Officer Cole was able to return Appellant’s fire, hitting Appellant in the leg. However, Appellant continued shooting. Officer Cole staggered into the middle of Fourth Street and collapsed after receiving a bullet through his heart. These events, literally unfolding in front of them, were observed by various witnesses who lived and/or worked in the neighborhood, including Mr. Rishel, Mr. Tran, Mr. Howie, and Mr. Michaels.</p>

After a high speed chase, Appellant and Anderson lost control of the Suzuki which then came to a stop. The men abandoned the car, fleeing on foot. As Appellant exited the vehicle, he looked directly at Officer Smith. Anderson was found several blocks away and was arrested. Shortly thereafter, Appellant was arrested in an alley near the home of his girlfriend, Christina Reeves, while the two were walking her dog.</p>

    <p id="b705-4" data-blocks='[["BL_705.5",705,[185,457,1160,790]]]'>Appellant was arrested as part of the continuing chain of events on the morning of August 19,1994. Appellant’s accomplice, Anderson, was apprehended after the chase outside of Harrisburg immediately following the shooting. Anderson then led the police to Appellant. Appellant was thereafter arrested; however, his arrest was without a warrant. Following an initial appearance before a Dauphin County District Justice, Appellant was transferred to Cumberland County, and that evening, was preliminarily arraigned before District Justice Charles A. Clement, Jr. The police filed a complaint with an affidavit rider attached thereto. The rider purported to contain probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest for the Appellant; however, the affidavit failed to contain most of the information known to the police, and arguably failed to state probable cause.</p>

Evidently, prior to the introduction of evidence or the calling of witnesses, Appellant made a motion to dismiss the complaint citing the defects of the affidavit. The District Justice denied the motion. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 12). Pursuant to the preliminary hearing, District Justice Clement found that the Commonwealth had established a prima facie case and bound the charges over for trial.</p>

Additionally, the comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. No. 150 notes that the Commonwealth may amend a complaint, summons, or warrant or file a new complaint against the defendant upon the finding of a defect.

Moreover, <em>McLaughlin </em>speaks to the requirement of a prompt probable cause determination, but is silent as to the remedy for a violation thereof. Finally, we determine below in the body of the opinion that the eyewitness identifications of Appellant had a sufficient independent basis apart from any taint so as to render those identifications admissible. Thus, because Appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the delayed probable cause determination, and because <em>McLaughlin </em>did not mandate such a drastic remedy, Appellant's assertion that the proper remedy for such a delayed determination is suppression of the identifications is excessive and without merit.</p>

Our <em>Timko </em>decision stands for the proposition that absent exigent circumstances, a warrantless search of personal property in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy is not permissible. Appellant ignores Ms. Reeves’ consent to the search of her home which is an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>See Commonwealth v. Latshaw, </em><a href="/pa/481/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="481 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1747351" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0298-01">481 Pa. 298</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="481 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1747351" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0298-01">392 A.2d 1301</a> (1978). Likewise, in <em>Parker, </em>the owner of an automobile consented to the search of his car by police looking for “drugs or other contraband.” A cassette tape was confiscated and, based upon the contents of the tape, the owner was charged with violating Pennsylvania’s wiretapping and surveillance statute. With respect to the individual’s consent to search his automobile, the court found that the cassette tape was not within the scope of the consent to search for drugs, as drugs could not reasonably be stored in an audio cassette. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the police requested Ms. Reeves' consent to search her residence for a handgun and clothing. It- is beyond dispute that a briefcase is a logical receptacle for a weapon or clothing.</p>
