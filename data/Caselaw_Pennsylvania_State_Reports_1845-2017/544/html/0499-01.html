In the case of an original appointment, the training a veteran has received in the armed forces will, no doubt, make him more amenable to the following of orders, the observance of regulations and, in other ways, tend toward making him a desirable employe. But the advantages to the public of this training are not absolute and, as time passes, the proportional benefit accruing to the public from the employment in such a service of veterans in preference to non-veterans gradually diminishes as both become proficient in the performance of their duties. In determining who is to be awarded a promotion, the skill of the particular examinees in the performance of their tasks is the prime consideration and compared to it the training gained by veterans solely as a result of military service becomes of very little importance. To credit veteran examinees in examinations for successive promotions with the same total of gratuitous percentage points as in the instance of their original appointment to a public position is, therefore, a totally unjustified appraisal of the value of their military training and highly prejudicial to the public service.</blockquote>

Nor does the language of those provisions even suggest that the preferences are revocable. Plainly, the preferences are not conditioned upon any factor or event.

Thus, I respectfully disagree with the majority holding which upholds the constitutional distinction set forth in <em>O’Neill </em>between original appointments and promotional preferences for veterans. Accordingly, because I believe that these two veterans’ preference provisions relating to promotions are constitutional, I must dissent.</p>

The <em>O’Neill </em>court found that the ten point preference was permissible as to the original appointment setting because veterans are apt to bring more desirable positive attributes (experience, discipline, etc.) to public service than non-veterans. However, the <em>O’Neill </em>court declared that the same ten point preference in the promotional setting was unconstitutional since the General Assembly acted unreasonably and hence, unconstitutionally, by placing the same high value on the benefits of military training in the promotional setting as it did in the original appointment setting.</p>

Article III, Section 7 prohibited the General Assembly from “granting to any corporation, association or individual any special or exclusive privilege or immunity.” However, Article III, Section 7 was amended in 1967 and renumbered as Article III, Section 32. This amendment eliminated the above clause contained in the 1874 Constitution that prohibited laws granting special or exclusive privileges.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

    <p id="b688-4" data-blocks='[["BL_688.5",688,[242,920,1165,575]]]'>The Veterans’ Preference Act, which was declared unconstitutional by <em>O’Neill, </em>was ultimately repealed after the decision in <em>O’Neill </em>was rendered. However, in 1976, nine years after the amendments to the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Veterans’ Preference Act was reenacted in its present form. Because the amendment to our state constitution eliminated the provision on which <em>O’Neill </em>relied and Sections 7103(b) and 7104(b) were reenacted after the constitutional amendment, I believe that <em>O’Neill </em>no longer provides valid precedent for the majority’s holding that Sections 7103(b) and 7104(b) are unconstitutional as they relate to promotions.</p>
    <p id="b688-5" data-blocks='[["BL_688.6",688,[238,1520,1164,462]]]'>Recognizing that the repeal of Article III, Section 7 places O’Neill’s reasoning in jeopardy, the majority attempts to find analogous language in Article I, Section 17 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Article I, Section 17 prohibits the General Assembly from passing any law “making <em>irrevocable </em>any grant of special privileges or immunities ...” Thus, Sections 7103(b) and 7104(b) of the Veterans’ Preference Act, as they relate to promotions, will be constitutional as long as the preferences are not irrevocable.</p>

Here, the Veterans Preference Act entitles veterans to an additional ten points on his or her civil service exam grade for a promotion as well as a preference for a promotion. However, these benefits are conditioned upon veterans achieving a passing score on their exams and meeting the qualifications for the promotion. <em>See also </em>53 Pa.S. § 55637 (applicants, including veterans, can be rejected for promotion if person lacks the minimum physical and educational qualifications for the position or is generally unfit for the position because of either an alcohol or drug dependency or conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude). Moreover, the fact that veterans receive the preference for one promotion does not mean that the same preference applies to future promotions. Rather, veterans must meet the qualifying conditions of the future positions before they will be entitled to the veterans preferences. Since the preferences afforded to veterans by Sections 7103(b) and 7104(b) of the Veterans’ Preference Act are not irrevocable, these provisions cannot be found to run afoul of Article I, Section 17. <em>See Johnson v. Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, </em><a href="/pa/453/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="453 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="577575" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0329-01">453 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20528" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="309 A.2d 528">309 A.2d 528</a> (1973) (rights not irrevocable within meaning of Article I, Section 17 if they exist only under certain conditions or for a definite term).

In <em>O’Neill, </em>the majority of the Court held that while the ten points added to a veterans’ passing exam score is constitutional when applied to original appointments, that same provision somehow becomes unconstitutional when applied to promotions. However, Justice Stearne, joined by two other Justices, dissented in <em>O’Neill </em>because he believed that the distinction drawn by the majority between promotions and <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>original appointments was unreasonable since the same positive attributes veterans bring to their original appointments also apply equally to promotions. Thus, Justice Stearne believed that it was not unreasonable for the legislature to give veterans the same ten point credit for promotions that they received for original appointments. Therefore, Justice Stearne concluded that the ten point veterans’ preference scheme was constitutional as it related to both original appointments and promotions.</p>
    <p id="b690-4" data-blocks='[["BL_690.5",690,[216,801,1165,895]]]'>I agree with Justice Stearne’s dissent in <em>O’Neill </em>because I am also of the opinion that there should be no judicially recognized differences between original appointments and promotions for the purpose of bestowing veterans’ preferences. The Veterans’ Preference Act exists as a form of consideration for society’s recognition that (1) veterans bring highly valued skills conducive to the better performance of public duties; (2) veterans suffer from a comparative disadvantage relative to non-veterans because of their exclusion from the labor market during their period of military service for the nation; and, (3) veterans have rendered the greatest service a citizen can perform, the defense of our liberty. <em>Schmid, supra </em>at 573-74, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20701" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="3 A.2d 701">3 A.2d at 704</a> (1938).

The majority, however, ignores this fact, and by doing so, continues to promote the distinction first articulated in <em>O’Neill </em>between original appointments and promotions because the majority continues to believe that the attributes offered by veterans over non-veterans in the form of positive attributes diminish once veterans are appointed to public employment positions.</p>

Were this not so, it would indeed be difficult to justify preferential treatment for veterans in obtaining public employment positions in the first instance. How can the majority now say it was irrational and unreasonable for the General Assembly to find that those same qualities are still present when veterans become eligible for promotion and thus entitle him to preferential treatment?
