It submits that the Rehabilitator has refused to provide it with complete or accurate information to explain what it asserts has been a dramatic deterioration of the financial condition of Mutual Fire’s estate since the Insurance Department took control in 1986. Consequently, the Cedents Committee also complains that the Commonwealth Court erred by failing to order full financial disclosure, including submission to depositions and compliance with subpoenas, despite the claim that a showing was made that the Rehabilitator’s financial reports were grossly inadequate. Thus, the Cedents Committee concludes that lacking such necessary detailed information, the Commonwealth Court was effectively precluded from properly supervising the rehabilitation to the severe detriment of the rights of the cedents, which the Commonwealth Court is obligated to protect.</p>

First, the Rehabilitator argued that the order of the Commonwealth Court was not a final order because it provided any creditor with the opportunity to request supplemental or explanatory financial information. We disagree with this argument. While the <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>Commonwealth Court did allow any creditor to subsequently object to the Rehabilitator’s administration of the estate, it clearly ruled that certain requested information was not relevant and that the Act did not authorize the production of that additional information.</p>

      <p id="b575-6" data-blocks='[["BL_575.4",575,[243,1106,1125,386]]]'>In this case, the Commonwealth Court entered its order and opinion on February 26, 1991. The Cedents Committee then filed a motion for reconsideration. On March 25, 1991, the Commonwealth Court granted the Committee’s motion for reconsideration in part. The new order amended paragraph nine of the original order to require service of certain filings with counsel for the Cedents Committee, counsel for the Policyholders Committee, and all other interested parties who request them in writing. It also added paragraph eleven which ordered the Rehabilitator to file and serve on counsel for the Policyholders Committee Mutual Fire’s 1989 annual statement.</p>
      <p id="b575-7" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[241,1503,1126,551]]]'>On March 28, 1991, the Cedents Committee filed its notice of appeal and jurisdictional statement with this Court. In the notice of appeal, the Cedents Committee stated that it appeals from the memorandum and order entered in this matter on February 26, 1991, as amended by the order entered on March 25, 1991. The Committee attached a copy of the docket entry for the February 26, 1991, order but failed to attach the copy of the docket entry for the March 25, 1991, order. The Committee attached to the jurisdictional statement a copy of the docket entry for both orders; however, in the caption, it stated only that it was appealing from the February 26, 1991, order. The Rehabilitator argued that because the notice of appeal seeks review of the February 26, 1991, order, which had already been the subject of the reconsideration order of the Commonwealth Court, the notice of appeal was inoperative pursuant to Rule 1701(b)(3).</p>
      <p id="b575-8" data-blocks='[["BL_575.6",575,[241,2058,1124,313]]]'>We disagree. The notice of appeal was timely filed on March 28, 1991, and clearly states in the first sentence that the appeal was from the February 26, 1991, order as amended by the March 25, 1991, order. Additionally, the Committee attached to the jurisdictional statement copies of the docket entries for both orders. Thus, it is obvious that the Committee sought review of the resulting combination of both orders. The Committee gave timely notice of the orders and issues appealed from, and therefore, we will not quash this appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 902.</p>
