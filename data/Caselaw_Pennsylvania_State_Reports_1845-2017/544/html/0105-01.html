Following an extensive colloquy, appellant indicated that his waiver was knowing and voluntary and testified to the following: “I picked up Trista Eng on Route 15. Abducted her at gunpoint. Took her to the state game lands. At which point, when we got out of the car, I shot her three times intentionally.” (N.T. 10/11/94 at 66).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> When the Commonwealth asked appellant why he shot the victim, appellant stated that he thought that he had been unjustly accused of an unrelated rape charge in Lancaster County and stated, “...

The two aggravating circumstances presented by the Commonwealth were that: (1) the killing occurred during the perpetration of a felony, the felony of kidnapping, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); and (2) that appellant had a significant history of felony convictions, including an attempted armed robbery conviction in 1974 and a 1994 rape conviction in Lancaster County, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9).

Thereafter, appellant’s brother, along with several other members of appellant’s family, searched the area described by appellant and eventually found a badly decomposed body wearing the remnants of a Hardee’s restaurant uniform. Appellant’s family summoned the Pennsylvania State Police and the body was later identified as that of Trista Eng, the victim, who had been reported missing for approximately six weeks previously.

At some point thereafter, appellant pulled out a gun, threatened the victim and drove to a remote location in the State Game Lands in York County. Appellant then forced the victim out of the car and shot her with a .44 magnum: once in the chest, once in the back and once in the back of the head from a distance of five to six feet. Appellant then dragged the victim’s body approximately thirty feet into some weeds in order to hide it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> When asked why he shot the victim, <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>appellant stated that he had recently been unjustly accused of rape by a woman in an unrelated matter in Lancaster County and that, therefore, he wanted to vent his anger on the victim since she too was a woman. Finally, when asked whether it was his intention to shoot the victim, appellant stated, “Probably.” (N.T. 10/11/94 at 72).

The evidence that appellant picked up the victim by offering her a ride to work and then drove her to a remote location at gunpoint before shooting her three times at point blank range with a heavy caliber hand gun and that appellant was previously convicted of attempted armed robbery in 1974 and of rape in 1994, amply supports both aggravating circumstances. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Although appellant does not challenge his guilty plea, a review of the guilty plea colloquy establishes that the trial court questioned appellant at length regarding whether his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary including, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had discussed the matter carefully with his attorney, that he understood the charges against him including the charge of first degree murder, his right to a jury trial or bench trial, the presumption of innocence, the Commonwealth’s burden of proof, the right to confront the Commonwealth’s witnesses, his waiver of those rights, his limited rights upon pleading guilty, the voluntariness of his plea, the elements of first degree murder, that the penalty for first degree murder is either life imprisonment or death which would be determined at a separate hearing, that his rights at the sentencing hearing including the right to present any mitigating circumstances, and that he was satisfied with counsel.

Again the record reveals that the sentencing court conducted an extensive colloquy in order to make certain that appellant’s stipulation was knowing and voluntary. The sentencing court expressly questioned appellant regarding whether he understood his right to present mitigating circumstances, his right to be sentenced by a jury, and that the juty might sentence appellant to life imprisonment rather than death if mitigating circumstances were presented. Appellant, however, responded that he understood these rights and the benefits of having mitigating circumstances introduced at his sentencing hearing but declined his right to do so. He further stated that he was satisfied with counsel. (N.T. 3/20/95 at 2-16).</p>
