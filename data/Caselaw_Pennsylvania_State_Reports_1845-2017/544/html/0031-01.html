The college denied the request for information and Brown appealed to common pleas court. The college filed a motion to quash the appeal asserting that it was not subject to the Right to Know Act. The common pleas court held that the college was not an agency within the meaning of the Right to Know Act, and, therefore, quashed the appeal. An appeal was taken to Commonwealth Court, which reversed, holding that the college was an agency for purposes of the Right to Know Act, and that it was, therefore, subject to the terms of the act.</p>

Thus, there is no constitutional mandate for the services of <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>community colleges. Finally, it is not clear that in the absence of the services performed by community colleges, the survival of the Commonwealth would be in jeopardy.
