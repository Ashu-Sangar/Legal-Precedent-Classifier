On December 11, 1991, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (“PLRB”) certified the United Steelworkers of America, Local 3733, (“Steelworkers”) as the bargaining representative of all assistant district attorneys and assistant public defenders in Berks County (“County”). Thereafter, the Steelworkers and the County entered into a collective bargaining agreement covering the 1992 calendar year.</p>

On March 22, 1993, the Steelworkers filed an unfair labor practice charge with the PLRB alleging that the County failed to bargain with them as a representative of the certified bargaining unit. Also, Mark C. Baldwin (“Baldwin”), the District Attorney for the County of Berks, moved to intervene in the proceedings before the Board.</p>
    <p id="b725-7" data-blocks='[["BL_725.7",725,[199,1402,1156,413]]]'>The PLRB originally denied the County’s unit clarification petition. On April 15, 1993, the County filed exceptions to that decision. On June 8, 1993, the PLRB granted the exceptions and directed a hearing on the unit clarification petition. On June 11, 1993, in a hearing concerning the petition for unit clarification and the unfair labor practices charges, the PLRB hearing officer denied Baldwin’s motion to intervene.</p>

Count I alleges that the collective bargaining unit consisting, of assistant district attorneys and assistant public defenders violates criminal defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Count II alleges that application of the Public Employee Relations Act (“PERA”), 43 P.S. §§ 1101.101-1101.2301 to this matter violates the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania over the supervision of the conduct of attorneys and violates the rules of professional conduct. Count III alleges that assistant district attorneys and assistant public defenders are either management level or confidential employees who are not entitled to the protections afforded under PERA. Count IV alleges that the district attorney is a joint employer with the County and that the district attorney must therefore be permitted to intervene in the proceedings before the PLRB.</p>

Appellees demurred to Count IV claiming that Appellants failed to state a claim upon which the Commonwealth Court could grant relief because Baldwin, as a matter of law, is not entitled to intervene as a party in the proceedings before the PLRB.</p>

In Count IV, Appellants sought to have the Commonwealth Court order the PLRB to allow Baldwin to appear throughout the pending PERA proceedings as a “joint employer” of the assistant district attorneys. The Commonwealth Court ruled that Count IV fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted since 16 P.S. § 1620 clearly mandates that only the County shall appear in these proceedings before the PLRB.</p>

Appellants’ assertion that Baldwin is a “joint employer” is immaterial under 16 P.S. § 1620 for that section clearly dictates that the County is the sole managerial representative of the interests of county officers, appointed or elected, in regard to representation proceedings before the PLRB.</p>
    <p id="b728-5" data-blocks='[["BL_728.6",728,[236,1272,1165,735]]]'>Appellants contend that even if § 1620 mandates that the County represent Baldwin before the PLRB, forcing Baldwin to be represented by the County would violate Baldwin’s due process rights. This argument also must fail. In order for Baldwin to be entitled to due process, Appellants must show that he has a life, liberty or property interest which is being impacted by a determination of the PLRB. <em>See R. v. Com., Dept. of Public Welfare, </em><a href="/pa/535/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="535 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1841512" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0440-01">535 Pa. 440</a>, 450, <a href="/pa/535/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="636 A.2d 142" data-case-ids="1841512,7354007" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0440-01,/a2d/636/0142-01">636 A.2d 142</a>, 147 (1994). Appellants, however, have failed to identify what life, liberty or property interest Baldwin has in preventing assistant district attorneys and assistant public defenders from combining into one bargaining unit; this issue must therefore fail. Thus, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s disposition as to Count IV.</p>
    <p id="b728-6" data-blocks='[["BL_728.7",728,[234,2031,1165,363]],["BL_729.1",729,[190,353,1158,197]]]'>As to Counts I and II, Appellees raise two claims in support of their preliminary objections. Their first claim is that these counts are barred by res judicata. Appellees assert that the claims raised in Counts I and II were also presented in Appellants’ application for leave to file original process and for extraordinary relief filed with this court. Since this court issued an order on June 10,1993 granting Appellants’ petition <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>to file original process and denying the application for extraordinary relief, Appellees argue that the claims raised in Counts I and II have been previously litigated.

In resolving the County’s pending petition for unit clarification, the PLRB could, for example, divide the unit into two units, one consisting of assistant district attorneys and the other consisting of assistant public defenders. Such a remedy could fully address the County’s concerns raised in Count I that the combined bargaining unit could violate the Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants. Furthermore, the PLRB could accept the County’s contention that all members of the bargaining unit are managerial and/or confidential employees who are precluded from joining any bargaining unit under PERA. This would provide <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>the County with the remedy that PERA would not be applied to the assistant district attorneys or the assistant public defenders; such a remedy would render moot any concerns the County has over whether application of PERA to these parties infringes on this court’s exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of attorneys. Thus, because the County has, in the PLRB, a forum through which it could obtain the very relief it ultimately desires in this matter, we hold that the Commonwealth Court was correct in determining that the County had failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>
    <p id="b732-5" data-blocks='[["BL_732.5",732,[241,904,1172,995]]]'>Appellants also contend that requiring the County to submit itself to the PLRB would deny the County procedural and substantive due process because the PLRB is incapable of guaranteeing a fair decisional process. In support of this contention, Appellants refer to several matters where issues similar to the ones in the matter <em>sub judice </em>have been presented to the PLRB; Appellants focus on how the PLRB has either ruled in a manner which would be unfavorable to Appellants’ position or did not rule at all on the Sixth Amendment or professional ethics issues. <em>See, e.g., In the Matter of Employes of Butler County, </em>24 PPER ¶ 24030 (1993); <em>In the Matter of the Employes of City of Philadelphia, </em>25 PPER ¶ 25166 (1994); <em>Berks County Public Defenders Office, </em>15 PPER ¶ 15062 (1984). This argument fails. Simply because the weight of decisions from a forum are against a party, or they provide no guidance on issues concerning that party, does not mean that party will be denied due process by that forum. Therefore, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s disposition as to the County on Counts I and II.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Thus, the question here does not even rise to the level of determining whether Baldwin’s administrative remedies are “adequate” for he has <em>no </em>administrative remedies. Dismissing Counts I and II of Baldwin’s action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where it is impossible for Baldwin to engage in the administrative process was in error. Therefore, we reverse the Commonwealth Court’s determination as to Baldwin on Counts I and II.</p>

Furthermore, Appellants mention only in passing Count III in a footnote in their brief; in that footnote, they make a few concessions as to how the Commonwealth Court’s disposition of Count III could properly be affirmed, but provide no argument as to why it should be reversed. Appellants’ brief at 12. Thus, the issue of whether the Commonwealth Court properly sustained preliminary objections as to Count III is not before this court.</p>
