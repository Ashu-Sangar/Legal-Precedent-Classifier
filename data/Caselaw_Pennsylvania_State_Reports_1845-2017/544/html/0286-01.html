We granted allocatur in order to review the standard used by the lower courts in determining that Appellees, Alvin and Shirley Weinberg, met their burden of proving that they would suffer economic hardship as a result of the Commission’s action. Because we find that Appellees failed to demonstrate that they could not make any economic use of their property, we agree with the Commission’s decision to deny permission to demolish the structure, and therefore, reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

At the time of its designation as an historic structure, the Gateway House was owned by Greystone Associates (“Grey-stone”), the developer of a townhouse project in the area of the House. The City Planning Commission approved the Greystone project subject to conditions which, <em>inter alia, </em>required the developer to pursue designation of the Gateway House as a local historic structure and submit all plans for the renovation of the House to the Historic Review Commission for review and approval.</p>

In February 1988, within two years of designation of the Gateway House as an historic structure, the developer sold the property to Appellees. Appellees had entered into an agreement to purchase a new townhouse from Greystone. When Appellees became aware that there were drainage problems at the site of the townhouse, they wanted to be released from the transaction. Greystone was willing to release them if Appellees agreed to purchase the Gateway House. Greystone sold the house and lot to Appellees for $175,000. No mortgage was involved in the transaction. After Greystone sold the property to Appellees, the Gateway property was reassessed at $40,000, which represented an estimated fair market value of $160,000.</p>

Because they intended to use the House as their residence, Appellees obtained the Commission’s permission to have certain restoration work done.

At the first hearing, Appellees presented the testimony of Douglas Berryman, an architect, and Lee Goldblum, a realtor. Mr. Berryman testified that the Gateway House was in poor condition but not to the point that it could not be restored. (R.R. at 186a-191a). The contractor’s estimated cost of restoring the Gateway House was $567,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (R.R. at 193a).

(R.R. at 243a, 245a). He further testified that a new house built on the site of the Gateway House could be worth $800,000. (R.R. at 250a). Mr. Goldblum also recounted for the Commission his experience in trying to sell the Gateway property. He stated that there were many people who expressed interest in the property during the time that it was marketed by his firm; however, no one was willing to commit the resources necessary to restore the house to a suitable condition. (R.R. at 252a-253a). Finally, Mr. Goldblum speculated that the Gateway House could be sold in the two-hundred-thousand dollar range in unimproved condition, although he conceded that it would be impossible to know for sure “without trying to market it full tilt.” (R.R. at 253a, 272a-274a).</p>

At that time, the findings and recommendation of the Commission’s staff were submitted to the Commission for consideration. After deliberation, the Commission voted to accept the findings and recommendation of the staff. Specifically, the Commission found that the demolition of the Gateway House would destroy a structure of major historical and architectural significance; that the Gateway House was not structurally unsound; that Appellees knew of the historic designation of the house and the ramifications of such a designation; and that renovations would cost (excluding purchase price and interim expenses) approximately $650,000 for a single-family house with garage and $700,000 for a two-unit residence with two garages. (R.R. at 292a-294a, 296a-297a). The Commission also noted that “the purchase price should not be used as an <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>element of the hardship argument, since a mistakenly high payment for the building was a matter under the control of the owners.” (R.R. at 297a). The end result of the Commission’s deliberations was the denial of Appellees’ application for demolition of the Gateway House.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[206,652,1157,1065]]]'>Appellees appealed the Commission’s adjudication to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. The trial court reversed on the basis that the record did not support the Commission’s finding that Appellees failed to meet their burden of showing that the sale of the Gateway House was impracticable. <em>Weinberg v. City of Pittsburgh, Historic Review Comm’n, </em>No. SA981 of 1990, slip op. at 28 (C.P. Allegheny County Nov. 29, 1993). The court held that the Commission erred as a matter of law in concluding that Mr. Goldblum’s testimony concerning the fair market value of the house was equivocal and, thus, incompetent. <em>Id. </em>at 20. The common pleas court found nothing inherently unreliable in Mr. Goldblum’s testimony that the fair market value of the house after renovation would be less than the cost of renovation. <em>Id. </em>at 24. Based on its interpretation of Mr. Goldblum’s testimony, the court concluded that renovating the Gateway House was not economically feasible because the cost of renovations would be greater than the fair market value of the property after the house was renovated. <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>

In <em>Penn Central, </em>the Landmark Preservation Commission of New York City designated Grand Central Terminal as a landmark. The owner of the terminal subsequently entered into a contract with a company to construct a multi-story office tower over the terminal. The Preservation Commission rejected the plans for the office tower construction because it believed that the terminal’s historic and aesthetic features would have been adversely affected. The owner did not seek judicial review of that decision but instead filed suit in state court claiming that the historic designation constituted a taking of its property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The trial court agreed and held that the landmarks law, as applied to the owner, was unconstitutional. The New York Court of Appeals ultimately reversed that decision. The United States Supreme Court affirmed and held that the law did not constitute a taking of the owner’s property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Penn Central, </em><a href="/us/438/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="438 U.S. 104" data-case-ids="1769262" data-case-paths="/us/438/0104-01">438 U.S. at 138</a>, <a href="/us/438/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="438 U.S. 104" data-case-ids="1769262" data-case-paths="/us/438/0104-01">98 S.Ct. at 2666</a>, <a href="/us/438/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="438 U.S. 104" data-case-ids="1769262" data-case-paths="/us/438/0104-01">57 L.Ed.2d at 657</a>.</p>

Mr. Goldblum qualified these statements by indicating that it was impossible to know the price that the property would bring until it was put on the market and promoted “full tilt.” (R.R. at 70a, Finding No. 9).

We find this argument wholly unpersuasive. Any burden imposed on a subsequent purchaser does not affect Appellees after they receive valuable consideration for their property.

The Commonwealth Court is incorrect that Mr. Goldblum’s estimate of the property’s selling price was incompetent because of the lack of comparable properties. At the time that he testified, Mr. Goldblum had twenty-three years of experience in real estate with a particular emphasis on the area of Pittsburgh where the Gateway House is located as well as a strong interest in historic houses.

The Commission obviously gave greater deference to Mr. Goldblum’s experience than to the fact that there were no properties comparable to the Gateway House when Mr. Goldblum rendered his opinion.

Appellees purchased the Gateway House for $175,000 and spent approximately $36,000 on exterior repairs. The unrefuted testimony of their own expert suggests that the house could be sold for $200,000 to $300,000. That, together with the release from the obligation to purchase the townhouse from Greystone, suggests that Appellees could conceivably realize a profit if they sold the property.
