    <p id="b326-9" data-blocks='[["BL_326.10",326,[253,1153,1162,259]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Superi- or Court, <a href="/citations/?q=444%20Pa.%20Super.%20672" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="444 Pa.

    <p id="b326-10" data-blocks='[["BL_326.11",326,[252,1445,1161,206]]]'>In 1993, appellant was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol. To avoid facing trial on this charge, appellant requested admission to an ARD program. He completed an application which contained the following question:</p>
    <blockquote id="b326-11" data-blocks='[["BL_326.12",326,[290,1676,1125,365]]]'>Have you ever been arrésted, charged, cited (including Vehicle Code violations) or held by any law-enforcement or juvenile authorities in the United States regardless of whether the citation or charge was dropped or dismissed or you were found not guilty or whether the record has been “sealed,” expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court records on any occasion other than this arrest?</blockquote>
    <p id="b326-12" data-blocks='[["BL_326.13",326,[249,2071,1161,310]]]'>Appellant answered “no,” even though he had previously been arrested for a violation of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. § 780-101 et seq. He served a term of probation pursuant to 35 P.S. § 780-117 (probation without verdict for drug dependent first time offenders).</p>

      <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>Appellant’s application for ARD was denied by the district attorney. Appellant was notified that he was ineligible for the program because of his “prior record.” The present action challenging the district attorney’s decision ensued.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[192,564,1154,359]]]'>The court of common pleas held that appellant’s prior record had been expunged, and, hence, that there was no basis for the denial of ARD. The Superior Court reversed, reasoning that appellant prevaricated regarding his prior record and that this provided the district attorney with ample basis to conclude that appellant would not be susceptible to rehabilitation through ARD.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[192,954,1154,196]]]'>It is well established that admission to ARD rests with the discretion of the district attorney.

    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.8",327,[189,1703,1159,408]]]'>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Lutz </em>expressly recognizes, however, that the district attorney is not free to rely on “prohibited considerations” when deciding whether to submit a case to ARD. In a typical case, it would be proper to take into account an ARD applicant’s prior record, veracity, and other characteristics. In the present case, however, provisions of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act require that certain factors be excluded from consideration.</p>

The statute requires that expunged arrests and charges not be considered as arrests and charges for purposes of any questionnaire. Appellant’s negative response to the question about expunged arrests or charges was not, therefore, without basis. Clearly, too, it was consistent with the statute’s policy of shielding such records from disclosure. The ARD questionnaire effectively delved into matters, i.e., expunged records and probation without verdict, that were not proper for consideration in determining ARD eligibility. These were, in the words of <em>Lutz, </em>supra, “prohibited considerations.”</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[207,953,1154,466]]]'>Under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, probation without verdict is available only in cases involving nonviolent offenses of a relatively minor nature. 35 P.S. § 780-117. Expungement of the record is available as a matter of right to any person only once. 35 P.S. § 780-119. The legislature has made it clear that, in the limited realm of cases where probation without verdict and expungement apply, privacy must be maintained by shielding records from disclosure.</p>
    <p id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[205,1459,1157,585]]]'>By considering appellant’s probation without verdict and expunged record, the district attorney committed an abuse of discretion. The abuse was compounded by weighing negatively the fact that appellant denied having a prior record. The only way that the district attorney could have known of appellant’s record was to have had access to information that, by statute, should have been unavailable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Further, the intent of the probation without verdict and expungement statutes would be obviated if the district attorney could use the ARD questionnaire to force disclosure of matters that the legislature has made private.</p>
