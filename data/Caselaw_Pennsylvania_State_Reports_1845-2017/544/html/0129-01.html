The City also filed a notice of intervention on February 6, 1992. The Court of Common Pleas, in affirming the majority of the Gas Commission’s decision, concluded that PGWs required annual $18 million payment to the City did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution or Pennsylvania law. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Common Pleas noted that the $18,000,000 represented a reasonable return on the City’s equity in PGW as well as reasonable consideration for the economic benefits that ratepayers received from the City’s ownership of PGW, such as: PGW’s ability to issue debt through the City on which interest is exempt from taxation, which provided an estimated value of $10,500,000 for the 1991-92 fiscal year; PGW’s exemption from the state gross receipts tax on gas revenues, estimated benefit of $23,500,000 for fiscal year 1991-92; and, the fact that PGW is not subject to federal or state income tax, which provided an estimated benefit of $22,100,000 for the 1991-92 fiscal year.</p>

The Public Advocate alleged that the annual $18,000,000 payment to the City: (1) violated just and reasonable rate protections; (2) constituted an unlawful taking of customer’s property for public purposes; and, (3) was an illegal payment in lieu of taxes.</p>

The Commonwealth Court held that the annual $18,000,000 payment to the City should not be used in the rate calculation because it bore no rational relationship to PGW’s performance and use. The Commonwealth Court reasoned that since the annual $18,000,-000 payment was not proportionate to the ratepayers’ use of <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>PGW, the annual payment constituted a tax which was imposed without the City properly exercising its taxing powers, and thus, was arbitrary and unconstitutional. The Commonwealth Court also found that even though the City’s balance sheet showed a net equity of $201,951,000 in PGW, that amount did not justify the annual $18,000,000 payment because the net equity figure cannot be said to have come directly from the City’s own funding.

Therefore, since the $201,951,000 net equity figure balance sheet figure represents the City’s equity interest in PGW, the $18,000,000 payment to the City would represent a little less than a nine percent rate of return on equity.
