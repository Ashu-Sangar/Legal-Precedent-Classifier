In August, 1973, the Township passed an ordinance that rezoned Appellees’ tract of land into an R-20 Urban Residential District that permitted residential use on one-half acre lots.</p>

The 1977 Agreement deleted the 1973 Agreement’s requirement that Appellees construct on-site and off-site sewage facilities within then-subdivision and instead required payment to the Township of $1,000 per lot sold. The agreement indicated that these funds paid the Township were to be deposited into an escrow account “earmarked” by the Township to be used in the future and at its sole discretion for the purpose of sewage within the subdivision. The 1977 Agreement further required that the Buyers of the lots inform the Township in writing that they were aware of this agreement and that they understood that the Township was under no obligation to make improvements within the subdivision to maintain any roads within the subdivision including keeping the roads clear of ice, snow or debris.</p>
