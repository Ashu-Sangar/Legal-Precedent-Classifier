At about 12:30 a.m. that evening, Belsar called the victim, James Bohatch, and asked him to meet Belsar at a parking lot. He claimed that he had a fight with his wife and needed a ride to a girlfriend's house. When Bohatch arrived at the parking lot about 1:30 a.m. on October 9, Belsar told Bohatch he would have to retrieve his clothes from behind a fence. Belsar went behind the fence and instead retrieved the rifle he had earlier purchased. He then shot Bohatch at least five times, hitting him in the chest, pectoral area, stomach, upper arm and finger. The victim was seriously injured.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[256,1117,1162,312]]]'>Bohatch testified that after he was shot, he fell to the ground and pretended to be dead. He then heard Belsar, who was joined by a confederate, say: “Ronnie, we got to find his car keys. If we don’t find his car keys we are dead men” and “Ronnie, get his wallet.” As the two assailants were looking for the car keys, Bohatch testified:</p>

I didn’t want to yell and so I tried to wave them down—nobody stopped.

Applying this analysis to the facts of <em>Anderson, </em>we concluded that aggravated assault merges into attempted murder for purposes of sentencing. Thus, the rule which emerged from <em>Anderson </em>was that a single criminal act would supply the necessary elements for as many crimes as were applicable to that act, with the proviso that for sentencing purposes, the greater and lesser included offenses would merge, and that aggravated assault merges into attempted murder for sentencing purposes.</p>

In <em>Anderson </em>a single criminal act—shooting—produced the injury to the victim and the crimes applicable to that single act merged because they were greater and lesser included offenses; in the present case, although the shooting was an aggravated assault, an additional aggravated assault was committed. The additional assault was the kicking of a seriously injured man.</p>

But in Pennsylvania, there is a legally recognized difference between these two crimes.

This act was different from and in addition to the criminal’s earlier act of shooting, which was the factual basis for the convictions of attempted murder and aggravated assault. The aggravated assault based on shooting merged with attempted murder; but the aggravated assault which did not merge was based on the act of kicking him later. When a <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>criminal act has been committed, broken off, and then resumed, at least two crimes have occurred and sentences may be imposed for each.

In essence, this argument harks back to the old analysis in which the court was required to figure out how many offenses against the Commonwealth or how many “evils” had been committed in a criminal episode. If the criminal episode consisted of a series of criminal acts which were regarded as one injury to the Commonwealth, then the criminal could receive only one sentence.

For example, in the criminal complaint filed by Trooper Gary D. Brownfield with District Justice Rick Vernon, dated October 9, 1991, the Trooper lists <em>inter alia, </em>both (a)(1) and (a)(4) aggravated assaults as the crimes of which Appellant is accused and recites as the factual basis thereof that Appellant “did intentionally, knowingly or recklessly cause bodily injury to [the victim] with a .22 cal. rifle, a deadly weapon, in that the [Appellant] did shoot [the victim] five times in the upper body area with said rifle____” In addition, the District Attorney’s Criminal information charging Appellant with conspiracy to commit Criminal Homicide, Aggravated Assault and Robbery states as the overt acts which support the conspiracy charges as follows: “planning and executing the crimes of Criminal <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>Homicide, Aggravated Assault and Robbery. The [Appellant] obtained a .22 caliber rifle, made arrangements to meet the victim James Joseph Bohatch and pointed the weapon at the victim discharging the weapon____” Furthermore, at the guilty plea hearing held before the Honorable Gerald Solomon on April 6, 1992, the prosecutor summarized the factual basis for the crimes to which Appellant was expected to plead guilty. During that summary, the prosecutor stated that the Appellant “did commit the offenses charged. Again, criminal attempt to commit homicide in the shooting of James Bohatch.

Aggravated assault under (a)(1) requires that the actor attempt to cause or actually causes “serious bodily injury” to the victim. “Serious bodily injury” is defined as “[bjodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.” 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2301. Again, there is no evidence of record whatsoever that the kicking caused such injury or could have caused such serious bodily injury. The only medical testimony offered related solely to the injuries caused by the gunshot wounds. As the Commonwealth had the burden to prove every element of the crimes charged and failed to adduce evidence as to the significance of the kicking vis-a-vis serious bodily injury, the law requires a conclusion that the Commonwealth failed to prove aggravated assault-(a)(l) based upon the kicking.</p>

The first question to ask in a merger analysis is, “Whether the crimes charged are lesser and greater included <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>offenses?”, because the merger doctrine is concerned with <em>only </em>such kinds of crimes. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/521/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="521 Pa. 556" data-case-ids="1817451" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0556-01">521 Pa. 556</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="521 Pa. 556" data-case-ids="1817451" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0556-01">559 A.2d 25</a> (1989); <em>Commonwealth v. Ennis, </em><a href="/pa-super/394/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="394 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="879717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/394/0001-01">394 Pa.Super. 1</a>, <a href="/pa-super/394/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="394 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="879717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/394/0001-01">574 A.2d 1116</a> (1990). If the crimes charged are not lesser and greater included offenses then there is no question of merger, no matter upon which facts the offenses are based. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Anderson, </em><a href="/pa/538/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="538 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="475550" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0574-01">538 Pa. 574</a>, 579, <a href="/a2d/650/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="650 A.2d 20" data-case-ids="11311697,475550" data-case-paths="/a2d/650/0020-01,/pa/538/0574-01">650 A.2d 20</a>, 22 (1994) (“We now hold that in all criminal cases, the same facts may support multiple convictions and separate sentences for each conviction except in cases where the offenses are greater and lesser included offenses.”) Thus, shooting a gun one time which causes a single injury may support the force element required for convictions for aggravated assault, robbery and kidnapping and the sentences for those three crimes would not merge unless they were lesser and greater included offenses.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[238,1243,1166,640]]]'>If however the crimes are indeed lesser and greater included crimes, such as aggravated assault and attempted homicide, <em>Anderson, </em>then we must ask the second question of our merger analysis: Are the crimes which are charged based upon the same facts? If we answer that question no, then the sentences for those two crimes do not merge. For example, if on Sunday, Jones shot Smith in the chest and then ran away, but returned on Monday and began to beat Jones, Smith would be guilty of attempted murder for the Sunday shooting and of aggravated assault for the beating on Monday and the sentences for those two convictions would not merge despite the fact that they are lesser and greater included crimes.</p>

For example, in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the five shots fired by Appellant into the victim might be viewed as four aggravated assaults and one attempted murder or any combination thereof; nevertheless, to the extent that aggravated assault and attempted murder are greater and lesser included offenses, the sentences would merge. Mistakenly, some may say that this gives a volume discount to criminals, but no less is required by the doctrine of merger and by any concept of double jeopardy.</p>
    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[192,879,1156,939]]]'>Analytically, the difficult question in applying the doctrine of merger becomes, “What are ‘the same facts’?” The immediately preceding quote from <em>Anderson </em>perhaps overstates the case. If we were to take those words literally, then in the Smith-Jones example given earlier, we would be required to merge the sentences of the Sunday attempted murder with the Monday aggravated assault. Clearly that would not be a correct result. Reviewing the cases which deal with this question reveals a rule: the rule is that where there is a “break in the action” then the facts preceding the “break in the action” are not the “same facts” as the facts which follow the “break in the action”, for purposes of the merger doctrine. <em>See, e.g., </em>the majority Opinion at 634. “When a criminal act has been committed, broken off, and then resumed, at least two crimes have occurred and sentences may be imposed for each.” (emphasis added); <em>Commonwealth v.
