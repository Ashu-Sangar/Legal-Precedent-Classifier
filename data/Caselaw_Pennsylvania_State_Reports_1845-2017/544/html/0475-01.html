PURPA mandates that states create legal mechanisms to compel regulated electric utilities to purchase needed power from such sources instead of building additional capacity or acquiring power from other regulated utilities. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has promulgated regulations under PURPA. <a href="/citations/?q=18%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20292.101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 C.F.R. § 292.101">18 C.F.R. § 292.101</a> et seq.

    <p id="b658-5" data-blocks='[["BL_658.6",658,[217,835,1166,368]]]'>During 1992, extensive hearings were held by an administrative law judge on the question of PECO’s future energy needs. Needs during the ten-year period commencing with the spring of 1991 were examined.

    <p id="b658-6" data-blocks='[["BL_658.7",658,[216,1226,1165,637]]]'>The PUC assigned priorities to the competing QFs based on the extent of their development, the quality of existing utility service in their locales, the viability of the various proposals, and the sequence in which the QFs filed their petitions with the PUC. PECO was then directed to enter long-term purchase agreements with two of the QFs, namely LG &amp; E Energy Systems, Inc. (LG &amp; E) and American Power Corporation/CMS Generation Company (American/CMS). LG &amp; E and American/CMS were to provide eighty megawatts of capacity apiece. The PUC specified that if either of these QFs failed to enter agreements with PECO then a third QF, Cambria Partners, would be substituted.</p>

PECO further asserts that none of the peti<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>tioning QFs ever incurred such obligations.

For example, the PUC, in concluding that PECO would need at least one hundred sixty megawatts of additional capacity, relied on PECO’s 1991 Annual Resource Planning Report (ARP) estimate of capacity needs. PECO contends that developments after publication of the 1991 ARP substantially reduced or eliminated the need for additional capacity. Such developments were described in PECO’s 1992 ARP, which was filed in the spring of 1992 after proceedings to determine PECO’s energy needs had commenced. The PUC declined, however, to consider the 1992 ARP, reasoning that capacity needs were to be determined as of the time when proceedings were initiated, namely, the spring of 1991.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
