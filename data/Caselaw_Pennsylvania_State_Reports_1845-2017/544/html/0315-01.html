Under the facts of this case, we hold that the Harts have stated a cause of action, and therefore affirm the order of Superior Court, which reversed the common pleas court order granting O’Malley’s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer.</p>
    <p id="b497-12" data-blocks='[["BL_497.12",497,[206,1622,1155,748]]]'>David and Ann Hart own a parcel of land in Bridgewater Township, Susquehanna County, on which is located a mobile home park. In August of 1991, they desired to increase the number of units in the park, and submitted a plan to the Susquehanna County Planning Commission for the necessary approval. In October of 1991, the Commission accepted the plan as a preliminary plan contingent on receipt of favorable review of the erosion and sedimentation plan by the Soil Conservation District and approval of the sewer planning module by the Department of Environmental Resources (DER). The Commission’s letter advised that, “[w]hen this office receives those items ... another letter will be sent to you allowing you to begin construction/installation of the improvements at that time.”</p>

The Township Supervisors indicated that they had no objection to the expansion plan by letter dated March 2,1992.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[232,645,1164,740]]]'>On March 5, 1992, O’Malley, a resident of Montrose Borough, also in Susquehanna County, filed a complaint naming the Commission as defendant, requesting an injunction “restraining and enjoining the Defendant from granting approval of the Hart subdivision.” The complaint asserted that O’Malley’s property borders the Harts’ property along the Bridgewater-Montrose boundary. It further alleged that the Commission’s action was arbitrary and capricious, that the Commission violated the county subdivision and land development ordinance, and that unless the Commission was restrained from granting final approval O’Malley would suffer immediate and irreparable damage. The only specific damage alleged was that, “Commission approval would immediately devalue Plaintiff’s property.”</p>

THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION IS SUCH, THAT, if the injunction is dissolved because improperly granted, the Plaintiff shall pay to any person injured all damages sustained by reason of granting the injunction and all legally taxable costs and fees.... ”</p>

Vanston, President Judge of the Forty-Third Judicial District, Monroe County, be assigned to handle all matters in the case, stating “conflict of interest” as the reason for the request.

The court issued a rule to show cause why the petition should not be granted, returnable on May 11. Following a hearing on that date, the Petition to Intervene was granted. On May 13, the court scheduled a further hearing for July 10, 1992. On May 22, the hearing was rescheduled for July 17, and on June 15, pursuant to a request by the Commission, it was continued until October 16, 1992.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Examining the nature of an action for wrongful use of civil proceedings, the court found that it “suggests some type of involuntary participation on the part of the aggrieved party.” The court reasoned that because the Harts voluntarily intervened in O’Malley’s injunctive action against the Commission, they took the action as they found it, waiving any objection to the process by which the injunction and stipulation continuing it had been obtained before their intervention.</p>

We think it necessary, however, to allow an exception to that rule in recognition of the nature and effect of certain civil proceedings.
