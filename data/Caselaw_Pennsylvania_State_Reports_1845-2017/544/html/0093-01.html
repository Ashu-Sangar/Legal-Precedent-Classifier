This action has its origins in a news article published on June 30, 1985 by Appellant, the Patrioi&gt;-News Company (“Patriot-News”) concerning a prosecution conducted by Ertel while he was District Attorney for Lycoming County. This 1974 prosecution resulted in a conviction of Kim Lee Hubbard (“Hubbard”) of second degree murder for the death of twelve-year-old Jennifer Hill. Hubbard served ten years in prison for the Hill murder.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.8",276,[222,1172,1164,692]]]'>Since being accused of the murder, Hubbard has steadfastly asserted his innocence. After Hubbard was released from prison, he and his parents hired Appellant William C. Costopoulos (“Costopoulos”) to review the trial in an effort to clear Hubbard’s name. Costopoulos studied the case and wrote a twenty-seven page report (the “Costopoulos Report”). He then submitted this report to the Hubbards. The Hubbards, in turn, delivered a copy of the Costopoulos Report to Appellant, Dick Sarge (“Sarge”), a reporter for the Patriot-News who had written previous articles about the case. On June 30, 1985, an article written by Sarge about the Costopoulos Report (the “June 30th article”) was published in the Harrisburg <em>Sunday Patriot-News.</em>

The June 30th article stated that the Costopoulos Report had found the following aberrations in the 1974 prosecution:</p>

Police said the cast was taken from the <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>field near where the body was discovered, and that it matched a tire on Hubbard’s car. Yet evidence established that the tire, which was on Hubbard’s car when he was arrested, was purchased and installed after the murder. Moreover, the tire cast clearly reproduced lettering from the tire sidewall. A tire moving through a muddy field would not leave legible traces of sidewall lettering. From this, Costopoulos concluded that “[t]he only logical conclusion to be drawn is that [the tire cast in question] was fabricated.” R. 355a.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[263,875,1110,410]]]'>2. Different witnesses reported the body was found in different places in the farm field. One of the reported places was well away from the boot prints and the tire tracks which were the key pieces of evidence linking the crime to Hubbard. As reported in the June 30th article, Costopoulos believed that these inconsistencies made it possible that the tire and boot casts were fabricated. R. 354a-355a.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[263,1307,1113,203]]]'>3. The Costopoulos report posited that “numerous discrepancies relative to the victim’s clothing, together with the condition and location of the body, suggested that the body itself was tampered with.” (R. 355a).</blockquote>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.7",277,[222,1532,1153,366]]]'>The June 30th article also noted that the Hubbards’ claims had been rejected in proceedings through the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and the Third Circuit.

First, since Costopoulos agrees with Ertel’s account of Sarge’s statement, there is no issue of fact. Second, Costopoulos is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Taking Sarge’s statement in the light most favorable to Ertel as the non-moving party, this evidence at best shows that Costopoulos did not act to prevent Sarge from writing his article, and the <em>Patriot-News </em>from publishing it. This evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to show that Costopoulos procured the publication of the June 30th article. Costopoulos did not affirmatively act to direct or participate in the publication of the June 30th article; rather, he merely failed to hinder its publication.
