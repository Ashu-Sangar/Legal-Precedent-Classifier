Indeed, in response to Inky Man’s signal, appellant and three other men, Shannon Faison, Lamar Douglas and Cornell Bennet, also known as “Junior” (referred to collectively as “appellant’s group”), suddenly appeared at the corner and approached the group.

However, appellant’s mother told the officers that appellant was working in Baltimore and she did not know how to reach him. As a result, appellant was listed as a fugitive in the National Crime Information Computer network. Appellant was arrested on a fugitive warrant in Mansfield, Massachusetts on September 25, 1992.

Trial counsel was also aware that Scott had told police that there had been three assailants and he had identified one of those assailants, Junior, from a photographic array, but that, despite having a better view of the three assailants than the other witnesses, Scott had not given any description that matched appellant and had been unable to identify appellant either at two line-ups, the preliminary hearing or trial as one of the assailants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

A review of the sentencing information maintained by the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) on Lamar Douglas’ case shows that a life sentence was imposed because the jury was unable to agree on the appropriate sentence to be imposed. The jury in that case was presented with the same two aggravating circumstances as appellant’s jury. However, the mitigating circumstances presented to the jury in Lamar Douglas’ case were that the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); the defendant’s age at the time of the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(4); and any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Only one of those mitigating circumstances, appellant’s age, was found to exist in appellant’s case.
