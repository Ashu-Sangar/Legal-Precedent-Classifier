The jury found as an aggravating circumstance that the Appellant had been convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(ll). No mitigating circumstances were found. Appellant was convicted also of possession of an instrument of crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He was sentenced to a consecutive 2]/¿ to 5 year term of imprisonment on that charge.

Appellant fired several shots at Bethel with his .45 caliber revolver. Bethel fell to the ground and started crawling to his house.

    </p>
    <p id="b595-6" data-blocks='[["BL_595.6",595,[196,658,1158,362]]]'>Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in denying his pre-trial motion to suppress the identification made by Gloria Morgan during a photographic array shown to her prior to his arrest. He claims that the photographic array was unduly suggestive and the identification should not have been allowed since there was no other evidence of reliability of the witness’ identification.</p>
    <p id="b595-7" data-blocks='[["BL_595.7",595,[196,1057,1158,795]]]'>At the hearing on the suppression motion, Detective Michael Cahill testified that he contacted Gloria Morgan approximately two to three weeks after the incident to show her a photographic array that included a photograph of the Appellant. The array consisted of black and white photographs depicting front and side views of eight men. He testified that Morgan was not told that the person suspected of committing the crime was included in the array; nor was it suggested that she select any particular photograph. Morgan selected the Appellant’s photograph and told the detective that she was not one hundred percent sure but that the photograph looked like the man who killed her husband. Morgan had been shown a separate photographic array, which did not include the Appellant, within three days of the incident and had failed to make an identification.</p>
    <p id="b595-8" data-blocks='[["BL_595.8",595,[195,1891,1158,477]],["BL_596.1",596,[237,343,1159,96]]]'>Defense counsel argued that the photographs were not sufficiently similar and requested that the identification be suppressed. The trial judge examined the photographs and stated that six of the photographs depicted men with similar dark-skinned complexions. He indicated that only one photograph was of a male whose complexion was close to the Appellant’s and that the remainder had darker complexions. One person was wearing eyeglasses, but Morgan’s description of the perpetrator did not include that detail. The trial judge <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>denied the motion to suppress the identification based on his finding that the photographic array was not suggestive.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.5",596,[234,464,1165,472]]]'>At trial, Morgan testified that she had chosen the photograph of the Appellant from the array because she had a feeling that he was the one. She was unable to identify the Appellant at trial, however. She explained that she could not make a positive identification because the perpetrator wore a cap on his head and she could not see his eye area. She testified that the perpetrator shared several physical characteristics of the Appellant, including age, height, weight, and color of complexion.</p>
    <p id="b596-6" data-blocks='[["BL_596.6",596,[231,961,1164,625]]]'>We find that the trial judge properly denied the suppression motion because the record supports his findings that the photographic array was not suggestive and consisted of photographs sufficiently similar so as not to draw her attention to any particular photograph. Defense counsel was able to vigorously cross-examine Morgan to Appellant’s advantage about her inability to identify the Appellant at trial and her testimony that she was not free of any doubt when she selected his photograph from the array. Since the photographic array was not impermissibly suggestive, Morgan’s testimony regarding her selection of Appellant’s photograph was admissible into evidence.</p>
    <p id="b596-7" data-blocks='[["BL_596.7",596,[227,1628,1164,528]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial judge erred in ordering him to shave his beard before participating in a lineup. Appellant had requested the lineup, but withdrew his request when the trial judge imposed that condition at the request of the prosecutor. The prosecutor explained to the trial judge that the witnesses had described the perpetrator as clean shaven, that Appellant was clean shaven when arrested, and that he had begun to grow a beard before his preliminary hearing. Appellant’s decision to forego the lineup was contrary to the advice of his attorney.</p>

A jury may infer consciousness of guilt upon finding that a defendant intentionally altered his physical appearance for the purpose of avoiding identification. In this case, the trial court properly admitted evidence that Appellant did not have any facial hair prior to his arrest but began to grow a beard shortly thereafter.</p>

The record demonstrates that the remark was unsolicited. In fact, the prosecutor stated that he did not want to know what “the thought” was, but was asking the witness whether he ever saw Willie Dukes in the company of the Appellant.

This grossly overstates the effect of the prosecutor’s inquiry. When viewed in context of the direct examination, it becomes evident that the questioning was designed to demonstrate that the thoroughness of the investigation reflected the time available to devote to any particular homicide. The prosecutor should have heeded the trial court’s rulings and rephrased his questions to make this point. We find, however, that the prosecutor’s unartful questioning did not warrant a mistrial.</p>

We have determined that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of the aggravating circumstance and that the evidence of the convictions for criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault was admissible. <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>Therefore, defense counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to raise issues that have no arguable merit.</p>

No citation to the record is given in support of his claim. Review of the entire record discloses that defense counsel was held in contempt when she refused to accept rulings without comment. This did not occur in the jury’s presence, however, and did not prejudice the Appellant.</p>
