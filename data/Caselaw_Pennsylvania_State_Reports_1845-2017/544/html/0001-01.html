The investigation commenced in 1987 and culminated on October 12, 1989 with the arrest of Appellant and the search of his home. During the search, police seized 16 one-half gram packets and four “eight ball” packets of cocaine with a street value of $2,860.00, cash totalling $1,332.00, scales, baggies, triangular packets commonly used for packaging drugs, 50 doses of LSD, marijuana residue, a roach clip and large sun lamps commonly used in drying marijuana leaves.</p>

The trial court sentenced Appellant to a cumulative term of imprisonment of 8 to 33 years and fines totalling $85,000. The Superior Court affirmed the convictions but reversed in part the judgment of sentence for a determination of Appellant’s <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>ability to pay the fines imposed. This Court granted allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[241,466,1166,624]]]'>During the course of the trial, the Commonwealth presented a significant number of witnesses, many of whom were members of the drug trafficking network which operated from Appellant’s home. This testimony revealed a clearly defined operation wherein Appellant, and his primary conspirator, Douglas Woodward, had by specific agreement developed a business of distributing marijuana and cocaine. Woodward testified that he originally met Appellant in 1985 through a mutual acquaintance, Wayne Yohn, in order to purchase marijuana from Appellant. Yohn had previously supplied marijuana to Woodward, but as he had none available at the time, he referred Woodward to Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[239,1113,1162,727]]]'>Shortly after their initial meeting Appellant and Woodward decided to go into business together. Each man put up an equal amount of cash and purchased one-half pound of marijuana which they divided into smaller packets for resale. Each man made $300 profit from this initial investment which they used to continue the operation. According to Woodward, they had a series of regular customers, which included Wayne Yohn, Jeff Herbster and Charlie Miller. As business continued Woodward and Appellant decided to add cocaine to their inventory in order to increase their profits. They also had a regular chain of suppliers which included Anthony Dalton, Ken Norton, and Jeff Holland. Woodward also testified that the cocaine they bought was sold to their suppliers from one Garth Honsaker of Altoona.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

All sales took place from Appellant’s home, where Woodward used the extra bedroom for storage and packaging of controlled sub<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>stances (or merchandise). Woodward testified that he was a drug user but that Appellant was not. Woodward also testified that he usually took a portion of his profits in cocaine or marijuana. Business went on smoothly for Appellant and Woodward until the arrest of a regular customer, Charlie Miller in 1989.</p>
    <p id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[168,684,1153,585]]]'>Miller was introduced to Appellant by Jeff Herbster in order to purchase cocaine. Miller had a criminal record and often was short of funds for drug purchases. Miller, knowing that Appellant collected guns, offered to exchange guns for drugs. Appellant agreed to the exchange and Miller subsequently burglarized a residence of one of Miller’s own relatives and traded several of the stolen handguns with Appellant in exchange for cocaine. Miller was later arrested for the burglary and entered into an agreement with the prosecutor for a reduced penalty on the burglary and gun charges in exchange for his testimony against Appellant.</p>

    <p id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.7",185,[167,1597,1153,313]]]'>Ken Norton testified that Woodward introduced him to the Appellant. Norton was a regular supplier of cocaine to Appellant; all sales took place in Appellant’s home. Norton made deliveries to Appellant at least once a week. Norton’s profit from the enterprise was a portion of the cocaine for his personal use.</p>

    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[239,454,1164,362]]]'>Roy Marks testified that he was a regular customer of Miller and/or Yohn and on one occasion when neither of his regular suppliers had anything available they sent him to Appellant and he purchased marijuana. Marks also testified that he was in Appellant’s residence on one occasion when Yohn brought cocaine into the house. Marks observed Yohn put the cocaine in the basement unbeknownst to Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[237,840,1161,738]]]'>One of the most informative witnesses against Appellant was Dennis Knepp. Knepp was a regular cocaine user who had been arrested in 1986 for selling drugs for the notorious Honsaker. As a result of the Y986 arrest he entered into a plea agreement in federal court, agreeing to serve as an informant in exchange for probation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Knepp normally purchased his cocaine from Yohn. On one occasion when Yohn was unable to supply Knepp he introduced Knepp to Appellant. Knepp thereafter made all his drug purchases from Appellant. Knepp testified that he was in Appellant’s home and observed Yohn, Herbster, Moore and Zannino all buying drugs from the Appellant. Knepp also testified that Appellant referred to the above named individuals as “his group” and bragged that they never “talked on” each other.</p>

The enterprise functioned with Appellant’s home as the central location for buying, packaging for resale and then selling of cocaine and marijuana. Norton and Holland were regular suppliers to Appellant, who allegedly received their drugs from Honsaker. Knepp, Miller, Herbster, Yohn and Zannino were regular customers who often brought new customers into the network. Woodward was Appellant’s primary partner in trade. The entire enterprise existed for the purpose of buying and selling illegal drugs. Although Appellant did run an automobile repair shop out of his garage at the same location, there was no testimony offered that proceeds from the drug enterprise were invested into the car repair business. In fact, one witness testified that he believed that car repair was a hobby of Appellant, not an income producing business.</p>

It is clear that Appellant was a member of the “enterprise” and agreed to participate in all of the activities of that enterprise along with his fellow associates. It was also clearly estab<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>lished that the Appellant along with various members of the “enterprise” engaged in a “pattern of racketeering” activities, as that term is defined within Pa.C.O.A. at § 911(h)(4), such as individual acts of possession and/or sales of controlled substances, burglary and receiving stolen property.

The majority, in footnote 8 of its opinion, suggests that the Act can be distinguished from the federal statute because our statute has a “lengthy and specific preamble which clearly delineates the intended scope of the legislation.” Majority Opinion at 13 n. 8. However, the preambles to both statutes are substantially the same. This similarity reflects the fact that the Act “is based upon Chapter 96 of Title 18 of the United States Code, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961-1968" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968">18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-1968</a>, entitled Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO).” <em>Commonwealth v.

A closer examination of the two statutes reveals that four of the five findings of fact in the preamble to the Pennsylvania statute were taken almost <em>verbatim </em>from the federal statute, including finding (3) so heavily relied upon by the majority.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Thus, our statute simply does not contain <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>additional language outlining a more specific purpose as erroneously suggested by the majority.

In addition to the United States Supreme Court and numerous lower federal courts, our Superior Court rendered such an interpretation in <em>Commonwealth v.

Each time, the General Assembly failed to alter section 911 to limit its reach to only legitimate businesses. To me, this inaction on the part of the General Assembly is more revealing of its intent than the single sentence of the preamble quoted by the majority. In fact, the course suggested by the majority is so contrary to the generally accepted interpretation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statutes, that I believe the General Assembly would have clearly and strenuously indicated its departure from the norm.
