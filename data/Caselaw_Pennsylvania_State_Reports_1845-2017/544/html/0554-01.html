Appellant argues that “extensive inflammatory publicity regarding the verdict” and appellant’s prior record occurred during the weekend break which followed ten days of sequestration for the trial. Appellant submits three undated articles with his brief, one of which refers to the jury’s return of the death penalty and, thus, is not relevant to the inquiry. One of the remaining two articles summarized the trial evidence and jury’s verdict at the guilt phase. The other article stated appellant was on probation for a 1967 murder. Assuming any of the jurors saw this article, no taint occurred because <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>evidence of this murder was presented at the penalty phase. Appellant has failed to show that a prejudicial news article was published or that jurors read it in violation of the court’s instructions. He has thus failed to demonstrate, with regard to both claims, that counsel erred or prejudice resulted.</p>
    <p id="b754-5" data-blocks='[["BL_754.5",754,[230,658,1165,468]]]'>Appellant’s ninth claim is that counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the trial court’s jury instruction as to intoxication on the grounds it was ambiguous and shifted the burden to appellant. In reviewing a claim of error in jury instructions, this court considers the instruction as a whole. <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/538/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="538 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="475543" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0297-01">538 Pa. 297</a>, 307, <a href="/pa/538/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="648 A.2d 315" data-case-ids="475543,7867004" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0297-01,/a2d/648/0315-01">648 A.2d 315</a>, 320 (1994). Here, the challenged instruction properly sets forth the law on voluntary intoxication as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b754-6" data-blocks='[["BL_754.6",754,[270,1165,1121,368]]]'>Under Pennsylvania law, the general rule is that voluntary intoxication is not a defense to a criminal charge. Generally speaking, a person who voluntarily uses intoxicants cannot become so intoxicated that he is for that reason legally incapable of committing a crime. The general rule is subject to qualifications when the criminal charge is first degree murder.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b754-7" data-blocks='[["BL_754.7",754,[265,1565,1128,528]]]'>The defendant is permitted to claim as a defense that he was so intoxicated at the time of the killing that he did not have the specific intent to kill required for first degree murder. The Commonwealth has the burden of disproving this defense. Thus, you cannot find the defendant guilty of first degree murder unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant was not so intoxicated at the time of the killing that he was incapable of judging his acts and their consequences or incapable of forming a willful, deliberate, and premeditated design to kill.</blockquote>
    <p id="b754-8" data-blocks='[["BL_754.8",754,[223,2129,1165,258]]]'>Since the instruction states that the Commonwealth has the burden of disproving the defense of intoxication, the instruction read as a whole did not shift the burden to the appellant.

On rebuttal, he testified that, just after he had completed his testimony in the Commonwealth’s case in chief, he was sentenced to probation in all four of his outstanding drug cases. Thus, the jury was aware of the lenient treatment McDowell had received, notwithstanding his denial of a deal.

Our system of justice requires, however, that there be articulable standards for determining guilt and for determining when a trial comports with due process and other constitutional guarantees. Guilt is to be determined by the Commonwealth proving beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the crime charged, in a trial that is deemed to comply with the requisite constitutional guarantees, not by the defendant having to prove his innocence. Accordingly, if the Commonwealth proves all the elements of the crime charged, but there was a constitutional violation, perhaps because the Commonwealth, in proving those elements, admitted evidence which was unconstitutionally seized, can we say that the defendant has no recourse because he cannot prove his innocence?</p>
    <p id="b757-5" data-blocks='[["BL_757.5",757,[202,1165,1157,258]]]'>However, since I agree with the majority’s conclusion in the case <em>sub judice </em>that Appellant’s claim of a constitutional violation is without merit, the recitation of the “truth-determining process” standard, in this instance, is of no moment. Thus, I join the majority’s decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

I also note my disagreement with the majority’s statement at page 564 of its opinion that “[t]he accused has a constitutional right to counsel on direct appeal but not in state collateral proceedings.” Although this is a correct statement as a matter of federal constitutional law, as we noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Travaglia, </em><a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="541 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="470782" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01">541 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="661 A.2d 352" data-case-ids="470782,7870893" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0108-01,/a2d/661/0352-01">661 A.2d 352</a> (1995), this issue has not been resolved as a matter of Pennsylvania constitutional law.</p>

As such, I join in the reasoning offered by my colleague Justice Cappy in his concurring opinion wherein he disassociates from the following language in the Majority opinion: “so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place”. (See Majority opinion at p. 576). I do not believe that terminology <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>properly sets forth the standard for PCRA relief pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9548(a)(2)®.</p>
