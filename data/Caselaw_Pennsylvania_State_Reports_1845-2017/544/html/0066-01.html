Moreover, allowing Appellant to <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>collect under its insurance policy will not encourage others to intentionally engage in unlawful activity with the purpose of reaping a benefit from such activity through its insurance. Our holding today extends only to those statutory violations which are negligent.</p>
    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[223,611,1161,471]]]'>We also agree with Appellant’s argument that the purchase of insurance by a public entity for losses resulting from its negligent actions should be encouraged. Without such insurance, a public entity would be forced to satisfy its legal obligations with its own resources because it would be uninsurable for statutory violations whether intentional or not. It would be counterproductive to fund a public entity with taxpayer funds without allowing the entity to protect against the depletion of such funds through the purchase of insurance.</p>
    <p id="b254-5" data-blocks='[["BL_254.6",254,[222,1103,1160,356]]]'>We hold, therefore, that the Superior Court had no basis for finding that the trial courts had erred as a matter of law in enforcing Appellant’s obligation to indemnify Appellant for the loss it incurred as a result of its negligent but good faith violation of the Equal Pay Act. Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is reversed and the Orders of the trial courts are reinstated.</p>

Appellant’s insurance policy contained several exclusions from coverage including one for "any payment for loss in connection with any claim against the Assureds, and/or the School District ... [f]or any amounts due, under the terms of any contractual obligation....” (R.R. at 284a). Because the loss was found to have arisen as the result of a statutory rather than contractual obligation, this exclusion would not apply. Moreover, Appellee does not argue that it should not be required to indemnify Appellant based on an exclusion in the policy. Appellee argues before this Court only that public policy precludes indemnification.</p>
