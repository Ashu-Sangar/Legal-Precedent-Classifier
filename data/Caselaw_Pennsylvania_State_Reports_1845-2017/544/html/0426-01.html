The apartment was located on the second floor of 3854 Terrace Street in Philadelphia. Appellant, Zigmont Kolenda, along with his wife and children, lived in the first floor apartment of the building. Gibbs resided in the third floor apartment with his other sister, Anna Alvin, and her husband.</p>

Upon hearing the noises a second time, Gibbs proceeded to the back door and saw Appellant inside the apartment. When Gibbs asked Appellant what he was doing, Appellant mumbled an unintelligible answer. Appellant then lunged at Gibbs with a razor knife, inflicting several minor cuts. As Gibbs attempted to retreat, he tripped over a table and fell. Appellant jumped on top of Gibbs and threatened to cut his head off. Gibbs screamed for his sister Anna and Appellant fled.</p>
