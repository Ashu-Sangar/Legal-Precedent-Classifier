He had left the back door of the truck open. No attempt was made to retrieve the newspapers because the bundle had broken open. Guaracino called the company to report the loss and to request credit for the lost papers so that he would not have to pay for the papers himself. He asked to speak with a supervisor, but was informed that his supervisor was not there.</p>

Robert Palmo, the single copy sales supervisor for the South Philadelphia area, and Jim Rattigan, the suburban single copy sales manager and Palmo’s direct supervisor, were in a van at the site when Guaracino arrived. Because Guaracino was behind schedule, the truck driver who delivered the newspapers to the site had left the bundles on the ground. When the supervisors got out of the van, Guaracino asked them whether they had received a call about the lost bundle of newspapers. Guaracino testified that Rattigan responded, ‘"Yeah. But f— you. You’re not getting it.” Guaracino understood that to mean that he would not receive credit for the loss.</p>

This is my work and you’re not going to push me.” After rebuffing Palmo’s attempt to assist him, Guaracino started to load the bundles onto the truck. He testified that both supervisors started to curse him, calling him “motherf_,” among other things. Guaracino indicated that he then became very nervous and proceeded to the next stop after he had loaded his truck.</p>

He was questioned about complaints from other drivers in his district that he was pressuring them to request overtime in response to recent cutbacks in the number of delivery trucks. Guaracino responded that he did not know what they were talking about. He testified that Rattigan then called him “a f_idiot shop steward.”</p>

He felt unable to drive the truck safely, describing himself as “a nervous wreck” and “dizzy.” Another supervisor arrived with a driver to take the truck. Palmo and Rattigan appeared and took Guaracino to the company nurse’s office at his request after he declined their suggestion to call a hospital.</p>

He diagnosed Guaracino as suffering from major depression, <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>which he believed was attributable to the occurrence on May 1,1990.</p>

They underwent counseling and were able to work together and communicate freely. Mrs. Guaracino testified that her husband was less communicative after the employment incident than he was after their child’s death.</p>

Palmo drove to the site at which Guaracino was scheduled to pick up a load of newspapers. Guaracino immediately mentioned the lost bundle and Palmo stated that he would not be given credit for the loss. Palmo told Guaracino that he should have closed the truck door and it was his negligence that caused the loss. Palmo denied using obscene <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>language or calling Guaracino names. Palmo testified that he tried to assist Guaracino with loading thirty bundles of newspapers left at the site.

When asked whether he had harassed or talked to other drivers about overtime, Guaracino denied it. Guaracino attempted to cut the discussion short, but was told by Rattigan not to return to work until told to do so. Guaracino was then told to return to work. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Palmo and Rattigan received a radio call that Guaracino was unable to continue work. Rattigan testified that he did not curse at Guaracino or call him names.

In <em>Archer, </em>the claimant was employed at a General Motors’ warehouse. Her responsibilities included the use of an electric crane to gather parts from storage areas and place them on a conveyor belt. The claimant introduced evidence that her supervisor had repeatedly criticized her work performance and harassed her over the time period from October 1984 to March 1985. She testified that the supervisor reprimanded her for conduct that was typical among her peers and continually accused her of not working even when she had completed all assigned tasks. She also testified that the supervisor followed her around the <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>plant and watched her constantly.
