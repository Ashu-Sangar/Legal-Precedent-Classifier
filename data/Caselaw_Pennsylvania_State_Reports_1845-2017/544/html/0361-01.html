      <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>At trial, Commonwealth witness Sondee Harmon testified that on December 6, 1986, she met with appellant, Raul Serrano and appellant’s uncle to discuss with appellant a plan that appellant had for them to make some money. Appellant explained that he knew a man, whom he identified as Alvin Tyler, from whom they could steal a VCR and a substantial amount of money which Tyler had amassed from dealing drugs. Appellant cautioned Harmon that they would have to kill Tyler in order to steal the VCR and the money. Harmon testified that she would not agree to the murder of the targeted person and that appellant, therefore, had to agree that they would not kill the man or else she would not participate. Appellant explained to her that the plan was that appellant would get them all into the victim’s house by telling the victim that he was bringing a woman for the intended victim, appellant and Serrano to have sex with, and that while Harmon and the victim were upstairs in the victim’s house, appellant and Serrano would steal the VCR and search for money downstairs.</p>
    <p id="b549-5" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[174,1364,1159,842]]]'>After they agreed to appellant’s plan, the three of them proceeded to the house of Paulette Duncan, at which time appellant directed Serrano to retrieve a paper bag from the trunk of appellant’s car. Harmon observed appellant remove a knife from the bag and place it under his jacket. After visiting a local bar, the three proceeded across the street to the home of the intended victim. The unsuspecting victim invited the three cohorts into the house and offered them each a beer. While the victim was in the kitchen, appellant told Serrano and Harmon not to take the beer or touch anything in the house because they would leave fingerprints. However, appellant, who was wearing gloves, accepted a beer and the four then smoked some marijuana. The victim then asked Harmon to join him upstairs to finish smoking the marijuana cigarette and, after a nudge from appellant, Harmon went to the front bedroom on the second floor with the victim.</p>

At the same <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>time, appellant took the knife out from under his shirt and plunged it into the victim’s chest. Harmon ran from the room and Serrano followed her downstairs, where he found her hiding behind the couch. While downstairs, Serrano and Harmon heard sounds of a struggle upstairs. Shortly thereafter, appellant came to the top of the steps, yelled for Serrano to come back upstairs and asked if Serrano had found one of his gloves, which he had lost in the house. When Serrano returned to the second floor, Harmon noticed blood dripping from the ceiling.</p>

In the car, appellant joked that the deceased was a “tough dinosaur” who had to be stabbed repeatedly before he died. He also stated that the killing got his adrenaline flowing. The three returned to Duncan’s house, where appellant retrieved two plastic bags into which he placed his bloody jacket, his one remaining glove and his knife before disposing of them in a dumpster.</p>

Later that day, appellant again bragged about the murder while Brown drove with him to take Serrano to the airport. Appellant and Brown went to Duncan’s house later that evening and, upon sighting the police at the victim’s house, appellant <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>stated in Brown’s presence, “What, they’re just finding the body?” After making this remark, appellant told Brown not to tell Duncan, who was by then hysterical, that he had killed the victim.</p>

The officer proceeded to the second floor, where he observed the victim Tyler naked from the waist down lying in a pool of blood in the front bedroom. Officer Doherty also noticed a large gash behind the victim’s right ear.

He then successfully carried out his plan with the assistance of his two cohorts by stabbing the victim to death and stealing money and drugs from the victim’s residence. Such evidence clearly established that appellant intentionally murdered the victim with the malice aforethought required for first degree murder.

Dr. Robert Catherman, a deputy medical examiner in Philadelphia, testified that the victim had been stabbed three times in the upper left chest, three times in the left flank, twice in the back of the head and once in the hand. The two most significant wounds consisted of a five and three-eighths inch wound to the chest which punctured the lung and a wound to the head which ruptured the right vertebral artery. The wound in the hand was a defensive wound. Dr. Catherman testified that the death had resulted from the combined effect of the eight stab wounds to the body and the loss of blood from the two most serious blows.</p>
