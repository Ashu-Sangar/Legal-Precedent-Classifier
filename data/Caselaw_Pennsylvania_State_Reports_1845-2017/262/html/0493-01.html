Barbara <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Shaffer, who was the owner of a farm of 118 acres situated in what is now the town of Sykesville, Jefferson County, died in 1878, intestate, leaving a husband, Henry Shaffer, and five children. In 1882, said surviving husband, while the children were minors and without guardian, gave the predecessor of the defendant a deed for a right-of-way through the farm of the width of 100 feet, on which a railroad track was then constructed and has since been in continuous use. Plaintiff was the eldest child and became of age in 1884. By a partition in 1890 that part of the farm here in question, containing 9.68 acres, was allotted to plaintiff, subject to the life estate of her father, who died in 1913. Prom said allotment plaintiff conveyed to defendant 1.43 acres, not here in controversy, leaving her the owner of 8.25 acres,- of which 3.65 acres were embraced in said right-of-way. Barbara Shaffer’s deed for the farm was recorded in 1867. Prior to these proceedings, the railroad company never secured or sought to secure any title to said right-of-way except that conveyed by the Henry Shaffer deed. On plaintiff’s petition the court below, November 23, 1914, appointed viewers to assess the damages for the right-of-way through that part of the farm allotted to her; and, from the viewers’ report, she took an appeal to said court where an issue was framed and jury trial had resulting in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff; from which defendant brought this appeal.</p>

This did not introduce a new cause of action as plaintiff’s claim was still based on the appropriation of the same land, but corrected the pleadings so as to enable the jury to assess the damages on the true basis of the difference in the market value of the tract as <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>a whole before and after the appropriation. A finding of the viewers, submitted with their report, shows that they understood that to be the correct measure of damages.

Superior Ct. 506</a>. That is undoubtedly the true rule, but there is some lack of uniformity in the decisions. The owner’s right to compensation becomes a personal claim when his title to the land is divested. When plaintiff filed her petition for viewers, on November 23, 1914, it vested in the defendant a title to the right-of-way and in her the right to compensation therefor, to be assessed as of the date of filing her petition. The other heirs had then no interest in the 8.25 acres, nor she in their purparts, hence each must proceed separately. That this may cause additional expense to the defendant results from its predecessor’s neglect to acquire a permanent title at the inception. The railroad company might then have secured its right-of-way from the heirs of Barbara Shaffer by condemnation proceedings wherein a guardian would have been appointed for the minors; but that step was not taken and such right must now be paid for at its value when acquired. Therefore evidence as to the price of the land in 1882 was irrelevant.</p>
