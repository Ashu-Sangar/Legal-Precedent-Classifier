L. 447) subject to the tax, and to accomplish its collection has included it in the prescribed appraisement, and from which this appeal has been taken.</p>

It provides that only “clear value” of a decedent’s estate is taxable, and the clear value of an estate is only that which remains after all claims against it have been paid. A widow’s exemption is a “preferred claim,” and, therefore, must first be met. It is a “gift of the law prompted by considerations of public policy”: Beetem &amp; Co. v.

It does not come by either of these ways. It is neither a legacy or devise, nor an inheritance. Subject to a purchase-money lien it is preferred to all claims against an estate. By asserting it the amount of it ceases to be regarded as part of a decedent’s estate. Against it a decedent’s creditors, legatees, devisees or distributees cannot prevail: Peeble’s Est., supra.
