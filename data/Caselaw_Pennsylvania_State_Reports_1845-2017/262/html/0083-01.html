Such gas could not be reached by an air current from the fan and the only practicable method of removing it was by a bore hole from the surface to the high point of the strata. The owner of the coal entered upon the surface and prepared to drill a bore hole ten inches in diameter for the purpose of releasing gas 520 feet below. The lower court entered a preliminary injunction restraining him from so doing and subsequently dissolved same. <em>Held, </em>the injunction was properly dissolved.</p>

The current of air from the fan is distributed through the mine. A portion of the Hustead coal has been entirely mined, the supports removed, and falls from the overlying strata, called gob, loosely occupies the space from which the coal has been taken. Explosive gas endangering the mine and those working therein, caused by the removal of the coal, has accumulated over the gob.
