    <p class="summary" id="b128-7" data-blocks='[["BL_128.12",128,[260,1582,1145,756]]]'>From the record it appeared that plaintiff purchased his land in Lower Allen Township, Cumberland County, from the Hummel heirs' in three lots, all of which were adjoining; the first by deed in 1902, the second by deed in 1905 and the third by deed in February, 1913. The land was bought according to a plan of lots laid out, acknowledged and recorded prior to his purchase, by the Hummel heirs, the owners of the whole tract. The recorded plans showed a fifteen (15) foot alley running immediately north of the lots conveyed to the plaintiff and immediately south of the right of way of the defendant, and in each of the deeds to the plaintiff this alley was called for as the northern boundary of the various tracts Conveyed to him.</p>

It appeared that it had been so used by other persons called as witnesses in the trial of the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b129-3" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[146,708,1152,1183]]]'>From the time of the first purchase until the taking by the railroad' company, the alley was used as a means of access to plaintiff’s property by the plaintiff and by the public generally who chose to use it; it was the only regularly planned and plotted means of access to the first tract of land that he bought, and upon which his cement products factory was located. Plaintiff’s factory and property generally were planned and arranged so that the alley was a principal means of access. The alley was unobstructed for almost its entire length except that, through a mistake of the contractor, the factory building encroached between four and five feet thereon, ample space for travel however, being left north of said building. In 1912 a portion of the alley was obstructed by movable coal bins but Sufficient space for travel was left during the greater part of the time. In the latter part of 1913 the railroad company under its right of eminent domain condemned the entire alley and occupied it with a fill, upon which additional tracks were built, so that plaintiff was entirely excluded from the use of the alley and access to his property from the north.</p>
