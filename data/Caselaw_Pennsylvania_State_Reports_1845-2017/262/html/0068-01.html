The Harwood Electric Company, defendant, is a Pennsylvania public service corporation organized March 1,1912, by merger with ten other corporations. It has $3,000,000 of common stock and $688,000 of preferred stock. The certificates for the latter provide, inter alia: “The hold- - ers of the preferred stock shall be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of six per cent. per\ annum, which must be declared by tbe_bp.ard-af.,direct.oj'g,. | when earned, to the extent- oFancl only from the undi-' t vided net earnings of the Harwood Electric Company , remaining after the payment of all operating expenses I and fixed charges, in each and every fiscal year ancT which shall be in preference and priority to' any payment in or for such fiscal year, of any dividend on other stock. If, after providing for the payment of full dividends on the said preferred stock, for any fiscal year and all arrearages of dividends due thereon at not exceeding six per cent, per annum there shall remain any surplus net earnings, the board of directors of the Harwood Electric Company may declare, and out of such surplus net earnings may pay, dividends upon, any other stock of that company.” For the first two years, ending March 1, 1914, dividends on the preferred stock were paid as therein provided. Meantime by transfer of stock the company passed from the control of the plaintiffs, who organized it. No dividends were ever paid on the common sto'ck, and none since March 1, 1914, on the preferred stock, and the chancellor found both as a matter of fact and law that the evidence failed to show any net earnings available for that purpose. His findings were approved by the court below and the bill was dismissed; plaintiffs brought this appeal.</p>

The contract between defendant and its pre-. ferred stockholders is silent as to what shall constitute <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>✓operating expenses or by whom it shall be determined. ......That is primarily a question of fact and we find no error in the conclusion of the chancellor that: ‘ ‘The reserves set aside by the defendant company for the purpose of providing for bad debts, for depreciation of plant and property, for depreciation of the physical assets of subsidiary companies to cover the merger value in excess of the par value of the securities thereof, for depreciation of automobiles, for depreciation of waste coal, culm and slate banks, and for workmen’s compensation are all of them proper operating expenses for the protection and preservation of the capital of the company for the benefit of all the stockholders.” It is largely a matter of {/business practice and the above finding is based on the evidence. In the absence of an express stipulation, what ‘, shall constitute operating expenses is a matter primarily for the directors of the corporation. In fact, so- far as not regulated by contract, the question of dividends on corporate stock is committed largely to- the discretion of the directors; and while their action may be reviewed by the courts it will be set aside only in case of bad faith, or when arbitrary, or manifestly erroneous, or such as to constitute an abuse of discretion or disregard of official duty.

When defendant began business March 1, 1912, it had a surplus of $363,880.93. On December 31, 1916, its surplus was $342,254.38, showing a net loss of surplus capital of $21,626.55. This surplus, which had existed from the time of the merger, could not be regarded as net earnings, nor considered as such on the question of dividends to the holders of preferred stock.</p>

The property of the coal company, consisted largely of coal and culm that are being rapidly exhausted by the defendant company. This exhaustion depreciate^ the value of the coal company stock; to meet which, and the over valuation, defendant in 1916 set aside $146,000 as an amortization or a sinking fund, which covered the five years, 1912 to 1916, inclusive. The evidence shows this to be proper practice, otherwise, for example, when the property of the coal company is exhausted its stock will be worthless and defendant’s capital to that extent impaired. It seems to be a method which in effect ates a fund to make good the coal or other material that is consumed, the same as a fund may be set aside to replace machinery that wears out or becomes obsolete.
