It bears all the appearance of a building erected for use as a public garage. The plaintiffs have requested the court to conclude as a matter of law that, the buildings having been erected in violation of the terms of the injunction, the court should now require the same to be removed. With this view we <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>cannot concur. The character of the architecture of the building erected upon the tract of ground is one over which this court may not exercise supervision.
