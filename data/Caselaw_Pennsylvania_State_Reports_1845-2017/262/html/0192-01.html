In a suit by a married woman to compel her husband to re-convey to her certain property which she had conveyed to him just prior to her marriage, where it appeared that such conveyance was absolute in form, and where there was evidence that it was induced by false representations on the part of the husband as to the effect of the conveyance and that he had stated to her that it merely gave him control of the property so that he might manage it for her benefit; and where defendant admitted on the stand that it was not intended that he should have absolute control of the property, although, in his answer, he claimed absolute ownership thereof, the court properly entered a decree in favor of plaintiff.</p>

In short, defendant, in his answer, claims full ownership of all the property in question, by gift from his wife, under what he terms a deed absolute, executed immediately prior to their marriage.</p>

    <p id="b235-10" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[180,1441,1154,643]]]'>The decree appealed from orders defendant to reconvey to his wife, “free of all encumbrances, in fee simple, all of the land and property described in said deed, subject, however, to such conveyances as......[had been] made to third persons,” and, reciting that defendant “has by an accounting......been found to have in his hands $32,275.89......, property of plaintiff, which he, the defendant, holds for her as trustee ex maleficio,” directs him “to pay over the said amount to her,” judgment for the sum named being thereby ordered against defendant; this is accompanied by an injunction, to insure a proper reconveyance.</p>

L. 14. As to this, without regard to the question of the legal effect of the deed, it is sufficient to say that, when the purpose of the act relied upon is considered, it is apparent the term “separate property,” is not used therein in any technical, but in a broad and comprehensive, sense. We conclude that, in this action against her husband, the wife is fully competent as a witness “to protect or recover” what she alleges' to be her separate, or individual, property.</p>
    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[259,990,1156,1409]],["BL_237.1",237,[155,322,1149,262]]]'>Appellant further contends that, since this was a proceeding in equity to set aside a conveyance, absolute in form, it could be done only by the testimony of two witnesses, or one with corroborating circumstances; and that this rule had not been met in the present instance. The learned court below found the testimony of the wife had been sufficiently corroborated by certain of her own witnesses to meet the requirements of the rule in question ; but, under the circumstances of this case, it is not necessary to go into a discussion of the merits of that conclusion, for, notwithstanding defendant’s claim that the deed under attack conveyed to him an absolute title, and was intended so to do, when Mr. Monish appeared as a witness in his own behalf, he admitted not only that no consideration had passed from him, but that the deed, although absolute in form, was made upon the understanding that he was to take over and handle the property thereby conveyed in order to protect his wife’s interests and facilitate a settlement of the estate of her father, from whom the property had been inherited, and to invest the coal royalties and other income therefrom — such “property to be kept for our children, if we had any in the future, and that the coal royalty I should invest where it wouldn’t be squandered or spent.” He further testified the understanding between him and plaintiff, at the execution of the deed, was that the property, and <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>royalties therefrom, should be kept safely invested by him, for his wife and possible children, so that, if his wife “needed it in the future she could use it.” On this state of the record, it is clear the two-witness rule has no controlling force.</p>
    <p id="b237-5" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[151,597,1152,911]]]'>The averments of both bill and answer are somewhat loos'ely drawn, and must be judged accordingly; but it is plain the material allegations of the former are (1), that the paper under attack was never intended to take effect as a deed absolute, and (2) that defendant purposely deceived plaintiff as to the form and character of this document, when he induced her to sign it. The answer denies both allegations; but, as just shown, defendant, at trial, practically admitted the first and most material of them, although not the second. Under these circumstances, it requires no citation of authority to show that defendant cannot in good faith assert against his wife that the property in controversy now belongs to him; nor can his counsel successfully argue that plaintiff’s case must fall because she was the sole witness on her side who gave direct testimony as to what occurred at the time the deed was made.</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[151,1528,1150,856]],["BL_238.1",238,[284,335,1149,480]]]'>The two-witness rule does not require that every detail of one witness’s testimony must be verified by the direct evidence of another, but only that a litigant’s material, or controlling, allegations must be sustained by either one other witness or equivalent corroborating circumstances (Miller v. Pearce, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 97" data-case-ids="480076" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0097-01">6 W. &amp; S. 97</a>, 99, 100; Lingenfelter v.

L. 546); and these requirements were sufficiently met in the present instance. No point as to the rule in question was raised at the close of plaintiff’s case, and, when defendant by his own testimony destroyed the absolute character of the deed in controversy, such rule had no further application; for it would be absurd to hold that, when a defendant in equity appears as a witness for himself and in effect admits the deed under which he claims was not intended to <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>be an absolute conveyance, its form as such can be overthrown only by the testimony of two witnesses, produced by his opponent, as to what actually had happened at the execution of the instrument, yet such is the essence of defendant’s contention on this branch of the case. No matter what rule of evidence originally applied, after defendant’s testimony the deed could no longer stand between the parties thereto as an absolute conveyance, for he, himself, had overthrown it.</p>
    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[281,826,1151,1571]]]'>In addition to urging that the two-witness rule has been complied with, plaintiff (citing Kline v.

It is not necessary to discuss or determine this contention, however, for we agree with the court below that, from every standpoint, when viewed as a whole, the evidence at bar is amply sufficient to justify the findings in plaintiff’s favor. In concluding our discussion of the branch of the case at present under consideration, it may be remarked that the children of plaintiff and defendant, who appeared as witnesses for their mother, joined with her in desiring the trust terminated; and since, under defendant’s own testimony, as given at the trial and credited by the chancellor, the deed in question has served its real purpose (no third parties being affected), on this ground alone plaintiff would be entitled to a return of her property; but other defenses are interposed, which call for examination.</p>

      <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>Defendant claims that Section 6 of the Act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 532-3, is a bar to plaintiff’s action, and, in addition, that the latter has been guilty of such laches as puts her out of court. In connection with these defenses, it is important to keep in mind that the present caseisnot simply an action by a married woman, but one between husband and wife; that, according to testimony on both sides, there was a continuous recognition by defendant of his wife’s equitable estate; and finally that, although it is alleged in the bill and found by the chancellor there was duplicity on the part of defendant in procuring the deed, the consummation of his attempted fraud did not occur until the latter, in this suit, formally set up his claim of absolute ownership.</p>

Shultz, <a href="/pa/183/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="183 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="896163" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0469-01">183 Pa. 469</a>, 479, and 21 Cyc. 1414, where, in the latter, it is said: “The possession of the husband as trustee is not adverse to the wife except after an open and explicit disclaimer of a holding under the wife’s title, brought to the wife’s knowledge.” We conclude that plaintiff’s action is not barred either by laches or the statute.</p>

In disposing of these contentions, adversely to the plaintiff, the court below finds the income in question was spent by defendant for family maintenance; that this was done with “full knowledge on the part of his wife, and without protest [from her] during all these years.” In view of this finding, and the general rule that ordinarily a husband will not be required to pay interest to his wife, we see no merit in plaintiff’s contentions: Kittel’s Est., <a href="/pa/156/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="156 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="844944" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0445-01">156 Pa. 445</a>, 454.</p>
