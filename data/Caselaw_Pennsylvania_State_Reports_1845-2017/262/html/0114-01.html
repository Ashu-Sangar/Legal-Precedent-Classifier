    <p class="summary" id="b153-8" data-blocks='[["BL_153.12",153,[172,1155,1151,426]]]'>That Hannah Morris was prostrated with grief and shock by the death of her sister, Adelaide, and for a few days thereafter took little interest in, or notice of relatives, friends or other worldly matters, is proved, but there is an entire absence of any proof that would support a finding that the purported will was the product of undue influence, or that Hannah Morris lacked testamentary capacity when she executed it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[266,443,1148,743]]]'>Starting out with the law’s presumption that she possessed testamentary capacity, and in the evidence finding proof of nothing substantially challenging her possession of such capacity — facts, not opinions control: Browne v.

    <p class="summary" id="b154-6" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[262,1207,1148,585]]]'>If, as contended, but under a review of the evidence not apparent we think, the provisions of the will are unnatural, different from what would have been expected, this in itself would afford no ground for finding the absence of testamentary capacity or presence of undue influence. The very office of a will is to effectuate as the law of his property, as the guide to its descent, the testator’s particular preference and desires, and it matters not if she shocks the common sense of the community: Johnson’s Est., <a href="/pa/159/0630-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="159 Pa. 630" data-case-ids="850178" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0630-01">159 Pa. 630</a> (see opinion of lower court); Bitner v.

The undisputed proof is that the chief beneficiary was peculiarly close and useful to the deceased for some years prior to her death, that she had good reason to feel grateful to him, that, in his absence, without his knowledge, aided only by her physician, who took the instructions directly from her, she had the paper prepared, executed it and arranged that it should appear among her effects upon her death. The conclusion follows, that it is her will, disposing of her <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>property as she wished, and its validity is not challenged to the point where an issue should be granted, either by the evidence, relied upon to directly prove lack of capacity, or by the circumstance that the provisions of her will might surprise those who did not know of her inclination and preference: Morgan’s Est., <a href="/pa/219/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="219 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1002696" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0355-01">219 Pa. 355</a>.</p>
