    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[264,389,1160,1778]]]'>Plaintiffs bill seeks to restrain defendants from tbe removal of certain culm banks, and also asks for an accounting as to culm previously removed. Tbe bill in brief avers plaintiff’s ownership and possession of culm banks containing between 170,000 and 190,000 tons and located on tbe surface of certified lot No. 38 in tbe Second Division of Certified Pittston Township, Luzerne County; that defendants and tbeir employees have wrongfully and forcibly entered upon said premises and removed over $2,000 worth of said culm and despite plaintiff’s notice and protest are still removing tbe culm and threaten to continue to do so and to forcibly eject plaintiff and bis servants therefrom, to bis great and irreparable damage. Tbe bill also avers tbe want of an adequate legal remedy; tbe multiplicity of suits at law that would be required and tbe defendants’ financial inability to respond in damages. Tbe prayer is for an injunction, accounting and general relief. Injunction affidavits and bond having been filed, tbe court below awarded a preliminary injunction as prayed for, and, on motion to continue same, testimony was taken on behalf of plaintiff. Defendants filed an answer denying material allegations of tbe bill, and claiming title and possession of tbe culm in controversy, also questioning tbe jurisdiction of tbe court and averring that tbe suit -should have been brought at law, but submitted no testimony. Tbe court made an order continuing tbe injunction until final bearing, and declined, at least for tbe present, to certify tbe case to tbe law side of tbe court. Defendants brought this appeal and assign as error the granting of tbe preliminary injunction, the order continuing tbe same and tbe refusal to certify tbe case to tbe law side of tbe court.</p>
