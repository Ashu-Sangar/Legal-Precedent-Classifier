    <p id="b346-7" data-blocks='[["BL_346.9",346,[260,791,1146,426]]]'>This suit was brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for the death of her husband, who was killed at a grade crossing of the defendant company at Linfield, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, on the first day of May, 1915. At the time of the accident Howard S. Benner, the husband of the appellee, was driving across the tracks of the railroad company in a one-horse buggy about half-past five in the afternoon.</p>
    <p id="b346-8" data-blocks='[["BL_346.10",346,[255,1229,1150,1184]]]'>The public road over this crossing is forty-eight feet wide, and is an old, well-defined road. Just before the public road crosses the railroad tracks, at the right-hand approaching the crossing from the east, there is a spur or side-track, leading from the freight station, which ends at the road with a bumper. At the time of the accident two or more box cars were standing close to the bumper, and this, with the freight house and freight shed, obscured the view at that point in the direction from which the train approached. The public highway crosses over five tracks. The first track is another siding, which is known as the Cold Storage Company siding, and runs in front of the station and down to the plant of the Cold Storage Company. The next track is the slow speed, northbound track. The third track is the fast speed, northbound track. The fourth track is the fast speed, southbound track. The fifth track is the slow speed, southbound track. At the time of the accident, according to the testimony, there were several box cars also on the cold storage siding; but the witnesses differ as to the precise location of these cars and the extent of the obstruction of the view.</p>
    <p id="b347-2" data-blocks='[["BL_347.3",347,[150,309,1149,869]]]'>
      <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>John I. Riegel, a civil engineer called by the plaintiff, testifies, from accurate measurements, as to the condition's existing at the point of crossing. He says that in addition to the box cars which were on the cold storage siding there was some obstruction of the view by reason of the station and its baywindow, the telegraph office, and a tree in front of the telegraph office, as well as some other buildings. The testimony of Mr. Riegel is that if there were no cars on the cold storage siding a view of the tracks to the south can first be obtained at a point sixteen and one-half feet from the first rail of the cold storage siding, and that a train on the northbound, slow track could be seen six hundred and fifty feet away from the center of the crossing, and five hundred and fifty feet away on the northbound, fast track, on .which the train which caused the accident was approaching.</p>
    <p id="b347-3" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[147,1186,1151,416]]]'>If, therefore, Benner had stopped at a point sixteen and one-half feet from the first track he would have had some view of the track on which the train approached. The fact that his view was impeded by cars on the cold storage siding did not relieve him from the obligation to stop. It imposed a further duty to proceed with due care; but stopping in the first instance was absolutely essential.</p>
    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[143,1622,1154,745]]]'>Two witnesses were produced by the plaintiff, who saw the accident and the action of Benner as he approached the crossing. One, John Seeler, an intending passenger, was waiting on the station platform, on the southern end. This witness says that Benner drove up to the first track or siding, and that at a point actually on the tracks, with the horse’s front feet between the first track and the slow, northbound track, he stopped for a few seconds. The top of the buggy was up. The witness could not tell just what Benner did after he drove on the track. After stopping for a few seconds he drove on at a slow walk; immediately after he started a fast express train came around the curve, and Benner was struck and killed.</p>
    <p id="b348-3" data-blocks='[["BL_348.3",348,[244,313,1148,639]]]'>
      <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>The other witness, James Boyle, was coming from the direction opposite to Benner, and was about ninety feet from the first track on the other side of the railway, facing Benner. He saw Benner drive up on the track and stop, lean forward, look first to the south and then to the north, and, after a few seconds’ pause, start to drive towards the witness. The testimony of both these witnesses concurs as to what actually happened. Neither of the witnesses heard any signal given by the train, nor did they hear the noise of the train until the engineer blew several short whistles, indicating the emergency that had arisen.</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[243,969,1148,257]]]'>It is perfectly clear, therefore, from the' testimony offered by the plaintiff that Benner did not stop, look and listen before he crossed any of the tracks. It is true that he stopped on the tracks, but that is not a compliance with the rule.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[242,1245,1149,1027]]]'>The learned judge of the court below submitted the case to the jury and entered judgment on the verdict, assigning as. a reason therefor that as the accident did not happen on the cold storage siding the failure of Benner to stop before he entered on this track was not negligence. He further held that the question of whether or not he was negligent, as he was injured on one of the other tracks, under all the circumstances was to be submitted to the jury and determined by them. This is not the law. It is an absolute and unbending rule that a tráveler upon the public highway must stop, look and listen at a point before he crosses any tracks. If he has done this and then proceeds, the question whether or not he has exercised proper care in crossing the railroad as he proceeds and whether it is necessary for him to stop again is a question for the jury. But if he fails to stop, look and listen before he goes on any track he is thereby convicted of negligence, and, no matter what the other circumstances, he cannot recover.</p>

That this proposition cannot be sustained under the decisions is clear. There is no break nor wavering in the line of cases extending back nearly forty years, which hold that the rule is inflexible and admits of no exceptions and that a failure to observe it is not merely evidence of negligence but is negligence per se. There has been no clearer statement of the rule than that made by the present Chief Justice in Aiken v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/130/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="130 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="568967" data-case-paths="/pa/130/0380-01">130 Pa. 380</a>: ‘It is not a rule of evidence but a rule of law, peremptory, absolute and unbending; and the jury can never be permitted to ignore it, to evade it, or to pare it away by distinctions and exceptions.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b349-3" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[124,1260,1149,854]]]'>What the appellee asks us to do in the present case is to make an exception of this case and to say that because Benner was not injured on the first track his failure to stop before crossing it did not produce the accident. This is bending the rule which has been declared to be unbending. No one can say that if he had stopped at a point before crossing the first track a sufficient length of time to make proper observation he would not have discovered the approach of the train, or if he had stopped and proceeded would have reached the scene of the accident soon enough to collide with the train that killed him. The fact that the first track was a siding did not relieve Benner from the obligation of the rule. This is clearly pointed out by the late Mr. Justice Potter in Peoples v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/251/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="251 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1019816" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0275-01">251 Pa. 275</a>.</p>

Viewed in this light, and leaving out of consideration for the present the presumption of law hereinafter considered, the relevant facts of the case are as follows:</p>
    <p id="b350-8" data-blocks='[["BL_350.12",350,[268,2004,1147,372]],["BL_351.1",351,[146,310,1152,1459]]]'>At Linfield, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a public road crosses the railroad tracks of the defendant company. At the time of the accident no safety gates, automatic bells, flagmen, or other devices were there to warn those about to cross the tracks. There were six tracks running, approximately north and south. Looking from east to west, the first was a siding, which <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>did not cross the road. The second was also a siding, which ran to a near-by private cold storage plant. The other four were the regular railroad tracks, upon which defendant transported passengers and freight to distant points. The second of these four tracks was the fast northbound passenger track. Not far to the south of the crossing the tracks curved to the west, and were soon lost to view. At the distance of 1,254 feet south, was a whistle-board, opposite which it was the duty of defendant’s engineers traveling northwardly to give warning of the approach of their trains, to those about to cross the tracks at said public road. At the time of the accident there were freight cars upon both sidings, not then being moved, and so placed by defendant as, with buildings, trees, etc., to render it impossible, for those traveling on the road towards the west, to see up and down the four regular tracks, at any place until a point on or beyond the cold storage siding was reached. The southward view from that point was about five hundred feet; and the distance from that point to the nearest rail of the fast northbound passenger track was about twenty feet. The space between the tracks was seven feet four inches, and between the two rails of the same track, four feet eight and one-half inches. At the time of the accident there was a strong wind blowing from the north, tending to render obscure, if not prevent, the hearing of sounds from the south.</p>
    <p id="b351-3" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[142,1790,1152,590]],["BL_352.1",352,[240,326,1150,1079]]]'>At that time plaintiff’s husband was driving westwardly on said road. He was alone in a buggy. The distance from the nose of the horse to the buggy was approximately nine to ten feet. No witness saw him stop before he reached and was on or partly over the cold storage siding. Some witnesses say he did not stop before then, some that he did not stop at all, but one said he might have so stopped, but the witness did not see it. His supposed failure to stop before reaching the cold storage siding, constitutes the contributory negligence alleged against him. When he reached <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>the point on or partly over the cold storage siding, which was the first point where, as above stated, he could in fact see up and down the tracks, he stopped, looked and listened, but, seeing and hearing nothing, drove forward, and was struck and killed by an express train on the fast northbound passenger track. No whistle was blown or bell rung at the whistle-board or thereafter, or any warning given until the train was about 150 feet from the crossing, when, according to the engineer, he “opened the whistle, gave an awful shriek and applied the emergency brakes,” scaring the horse, (which was then upon the fast northbound passenger tracks,) causing it to rear and plunge without going forward. He also says the train was traveling at the rate of 59 miles an hour. It struck the horse and buggy midway, throwing the horse to the westward 100 feet north of the crossing, and entirely clear of the tracks; and deceased to the eastward 132 feet north of the crossing into a ditch between the two sidings. When the train itself was stopped, its last coach was 450 feet north of the crossing.</p>

In effect it holds that a man may be adjudged guilty of contributory negligence, and the defendant who has injured him relieved of all liability, although in fact he was guilty of no negligence which contributed to his injury. The utmost point to which the majority opinion is willing to go, is in the statement that “no one can say that, if he had stopped at a point before crossing the first track [thereby meaning the cold storage siding] a sufficient length of time to make proper observation, he would not have discovered the approach of the train, or, if he had stopped and proceeded, would have reached the scene of the <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>accident soon enough, to collide with the train that killed him.” But if “no one can say” whether or not he was guilty of contributory negligence, the law can and does say that he was not; for “he who avers a fact in excuse of his own misfeasance must prove it”: Beatty v. Gilmore, <a href="/pa/16/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="410163" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0463-01">16 Pa. 463</a>; Coolbroth v. Penna. R. R.

Since that rule was first adopted and published, the members of thirty-one legislatures and one constitutional convention have been elected, met and adjourned, leaving it still in force, and because thereof, despite doubts as to the wisdom of <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>making it arbitrary, stare decisis compels our adherence to it now, however much plaintiff may suffer by reason thereof. In these later days when our people have been learning anew to respect the rights and liberties of others, and thereby to preserve their own, we ought not to extend that rule beyond its reason and spirit, to the injury of any one. In the interests of justice the courts are1 swift to confine acts of assembly within their reason and spirit. A fortiori should they do so with their own arbitrary and unbending rules; lest those selected to administer justice may be the means of wholly defeating it.</p>

But to extend it as now proposed would not aid in accomplishing this purpose, for it would run counter to the habits and customs of our people, and a rule which does that would not in practice obtain even a passing currency. He little knows our American people who imagines that they will obey a rule which uselessly attempts to delay them in the ends they seek to accomplish. Tell them they must not cross a siding wherever cars are, or are soon liable, to be shifted, and they will understand and recognize that they should obey it. But tell them that they must not do so though there is no motive power on the siding with which to move the cars, and they will neither understand nor obey. Over a siding, in the condition the cold storage siding was at the time of this accident, even the proverbial tortise could have passed in safety. Every one who then saw the siding knew that was so; and every one, even all those who adopted and those who enforce the rule of “stop, look and listen,” in all human probability would have acted just as plaintiff’s husband did. To say then that plaintiff cannot recover because <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>it is alleged that her husband did not do a useless thing, which no one else ever does, is to punish her, though •both she and her husband were innocent, and benefit no one but the defendant, which, the jury has found, did her a most grievous wrong.</p>

To justify that conclusion the majority opinion says that if he “had stopped at a point sixteen and one-half feet from the first track [the cold storage siding] he would have had some view .of the track on which the train approached,” overlooking the fact that the witness relied on for that conclusion had said, as indeed quoted in the majority opinion itself, that this would have been so only “if there were no cars on the cold storage siding,” where in fact there were then such cars; and overlooking also, as testified to by three witnesses, that no view could be obtained anywhere short of the cold storage siding.

If he had had a flying start and driven his horse at a speed of five miles an hour, it would have required over 6% seconds to have traversed the distance to the point where he was struck, and during all that time, until too late to avoid the accident, he would have had no view of the oncoming train.</p>

This was on or partly over the cold storage siding. If it be that he took the risk of an injury from a train on that siding, the answer is he received no such injury, and that act in no way contributed to the injury he did receive. If he had stopped, where the majority opinion says he should have stopped, or at any point short of the cold storage siding, in view of the fact that he could see nothing, the only thing he could have done would have been to tie his horse or get some one to hold it, — for he would have been guilty of negligence had he left it unfastened and unattended on the public highway, — alight from his buggy, and go forward, risking the imaginary danger of the cold storage siding, and stop, look and listen at the very place he actually did, then return, untie the horse, enter the buggy, and drive over the same ground he had walked over, and then beyond and across the tracks. Thus to do would have occupied at least three times that required for a train, traveling as this one was, to reach the point <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>where he was killed, even though it was at the furthest visible distance away when he started back.</p>

Moreover, the opinion of the majority is in direct antagonism to the reason and spirit of the rule itself. It will hardly be contended that a failure to stop, look and listen would relieve a negligent defendant from liability, if, for instance, plaintiff would have gotten safely across but for a defect in the crossing itself. At any rate, we held in Baughman v. Shenango <em>&amp; </em>Allegheny R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/92/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="92 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="491034" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0335-01">92 Pa. 335</a>, that such a contention is of no avail. What then is the reason for the rule? In North Penna. R. R. Co. v. Heileman, <a href="/pa/49/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="49 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="998459" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0060-01">49 Pa. 60</a>, 64, it is said that the reason is “because movement upon such a road is more speedy, and the consequences of a collision are usually so disastrous.” As those disastrous consequences are the result of the rapid movement, it follows that the reason of the rule is the necessary rapidity of railroad travel. It is for that very reason that we have not required those crossing trolley tracks to stop before so doing, despite the very high speed with which the trolleys run: Carson v. <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>Federal St. &amp; P.

Trains move slowly thereover, much slower than the trolley cars on their tracks; and the movement of cars on such sidings is much less frequent than those on trolley tracks. Consequently, a no more stringent rule should be applied, and no case suggests otherwise unless it be Peoples v. Penna. R. R., <a href="/pa/251/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="251 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1019816" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0275-01">251 Pa. 275</a>, cited in the opinion of the majority. If that case applied a more stringent rule, I would be in favor of so modifying it as to conform to reasonable requirements. But it does not do so. There the plaintiff was injured on the siding itself, which was “in frequent and daily use by the railroad company.” Had he looked he would have seen that the cars on that siding were then being shifted, but he did not, and his automobile was struck “immediately upon its getting upon the railroad track.” In the present case there was no injury upon the siding. That was crossed in safety, as it was plainly to be seen it could be; and stopping on it, in order to look and listen, was the only safe and sensible thing to do before attempting to cross the dangerous main tracks.</p>
