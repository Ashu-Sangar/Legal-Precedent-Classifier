There was drinking, in which the deceased and defendant joined; the latter, however, says he knew what he was doing. During the evening, angry words passed between them, and the deceased spoke of the defendant as “a pig,” to them a deeply offensive epithet. About 11 o’clock, the proprietor suggested that those not boarding at his house should depart; the deceased, with a companion, named Paunik, left and the defendant followed and caught up with them and the three walked along the street for some distance when, according to the Commonwealth’s evidence, the defendant shook hands with them, bade them good night and immediately drew his revolver and fired two fatal shots through the body of Zinaic, while he was standing quietly on the street. Defendant returned to his boarding house, admitted the shooting and was going away when he was arrested. After attempting to shoot the officer, defendant threw his revolver into a coal box where it was found loaded with three cartridges and two empty shells. At the same time, while trying to escape, he was shot by the Officer. This resulted in the amputation of his left leg and kept him in the hospital until near the time of his trial the following June. A loaded revolver was found in the hip pocket of the deceased, and the defendant, who offered no testimony but his own, said, inter alia, that the deceased assaulted him at the boarding house and again as they were about to part on the street, at which time he saw a revolver in Zinaic’s pocket and saw him make a motion as if to draw it, and through fear he (defendant) fired the two shots in the air.</p>

The case was not called for trial until nearly eight months after the homicide, meantime defendant was confined in a hospital. Fifteen days, before the trial, at his request, the court appointed counsel to defend him. The reason urged for the continuance was inability to procure witnesses; yet counsel continued zealously their search for additional evidence for nine months after the trial and only found one witness and all she claims to have seen, was the trouble at the boarding house, although she makes the incompetent assertion that defendant informed her that his brother had been murdered by the deceased twelve years before, in the old country. Manifestly the discretion of the court was not abused in refusing a new trial on that ground.

They had words, deceased calling defendant a pig, probably the most opprobious epithet applied by these people. They were ordered out of the house, and met again in the street, where, apparently, a reconciliation took place, deceased withdrawing the epithet, the parties shaking hands, and, with a friend of deceased, walking down the street together. When they were parting, deceased shook hands with his friend, and, turning to shake hands with defendant, disclosed a loaded revolver in his (deceased’s) pocket, which defendant says, deceased made a motion as if to draw; whereupon defendant shot him twice, killing him instantly. Defendant then ran to his boarding house, intending to leave the place, but a policeman came up, and the defendant, refusing to stop when ordered so to do, was shot in the leg, resulting later in an amputation thereof.</p>

On account of his poverty the court, fifteen days before the trial, assigned counsel to defend him. An interpreter was required to enable them to understand each other, and it is said that that fact greatly restricted the preparation of the defense. At the trial defendant asked for a continuance upon the ground of inability to locate certain material witnesses during the short time since he had had counsel. The district attorney stated that he also had unsuccessfully tried to find those witnesses, whereupon the court refused the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>continuance. After the trial one of them was located at Steubenville, Ohio. She made a statement to the effect that she knew of the above-mentioned threat, and that defendant had told her of the killing of his brother by the deceased. This statement was made the basis of a motion for a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence, particular stress being laid on the fact that this evidence would have strongly corroborated the defendant, who was the only witness for himself at the trial. The new trial was refused.</p>

That is undoubtedly true; but extenuating circumstances are a very vitál factor in a murder case, and not unusually reduce the grade of the offense below that of murder in the first degree. Moreover, it is equally true that such a verdict is generally, if not always, a compromise, entered into for the purpose of overcoming the doubts of one or more of the jury regarding the guilt of the prisoner. But such doubts, if reasonable, especially in a murder case, ought to result either in an acquittal or in a reduction of the grade of the offense; and when we remember how difficult it is for the average juryman to draw a distinction between that which is wilful, deliberate and premeditated, and that which is only wilful and ■ deliberate, it is evident that a verdict, containing a recommendation to mercy, may well have been reached because of a misunderstanding regarding the charge of the court. When a human life is at stake it ought to be made certain that no such misunderstanding exists; and, in my opinion, therefore, the trial judge should have re<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>fused to receive the verdict rendered, should have recharged the jury as to the grades of murder, and should have told them that if they believed the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree they should so find, without any addendum to their verdict.</p>

Indeed, the suggestion itself emphasizes the fact that there is a doubt as to what the jury did mean, and as I share in that doubt I dissent from the opinion and judgment entered in this case.</p>

E. 886</a> (South Carolina), have been added to the opinion of the majority, as bearing out the claim that the words “but recommend to the mercy of the court” may be treated as surplusage. In the former the verdict was “Guilty as charged in the indictment and plead the mercy of the court.” After that the opinion shows that “The jury was polled and each juror declared the verdict his. This was after the judge had announced that he could show no mercy. Surely if the subject of punishment and a desire to save the prisoner from the penalty of death had occupied the minds of the jurors, some of them would have made it known.” The court there did what the court below here should have done, and the polling was, of course, a verdict without the recommendation.</p>

It was dismissed because “in a court having jurisdiction only for the correction of errors of law, such recommendations can have <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>no effect upon the verdict regularly and solemnly rendered.” As a refusal of a new trial is discretionary and not an ei*ror of law, the assignment of course was had.</p>
