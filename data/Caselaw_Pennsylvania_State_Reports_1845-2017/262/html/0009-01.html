Miller,” in the grantor’s handwriting, and put in a safe in the doctor’s office; from childhood on, the defendant had access to this safe, knew the combination, and frequently opened it; in 1905, Dr. Kanawell called upon a nephew, with whom he was intimate, and told the latter that, if anything happened to him (the doctor), “at any time,” the nephew and Miller “should open his safe, and in there we would find papers, one addressed to myself [the nephew] and one to Charley [Miller] ; the first he gave me to understand was Charley’s deed, and the other was a will”; at the time of this interview, the doctor said “the deed was Charley’s,” that the latter had the combination of the safe, and when the safe was opened the deed was to be “handed to Charley”; in 1909, Dr. Kanawell made a will purporting to dispose of his entire estate, real and personal; several pieces of real property are mentioned in this will, but the farm here in question is entirely omitted therefrom, as it is from two subsequent codicils executed February 28, 1914, and November 8, 1915, respectively, on which latter date the <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>doctor died; the executor was obliged to obtain tbe services of Miller to open decedent’s safe, and, when this was accomplished, tbe deed was found therein, endorsed as already stated; tbe executor placed tbe instrument upon record.</p>

Tbis offer was rejected; and, for present purposes, should be considered as much out of tbe case as though never made. Therefore, defendant must point to other, competent, evidence sufficient to sustain tbe verdict and judgment in bis favor. To meet this burden, be stands, first, upon tbe duly executed, acknowledged and recorded deed itself, which, on its face, purports to have been “delivered”; next, be points to tbe evidence in support of tbe facts which we have already recited, and, in addition, to repeated declarations by tbe grantor, at intervals extending over many years (some in tbe presence and bearing of tbe grantee, and others in bis absence), to tbe effect that be bought the farm for Miller, that it belonged to tbe latter, that be, tbe doctor, did not own it, but was only the overseer for defendant, and, finally, to many acts indicating ownership by Miller and acquiescence therein by decedent. Moreover, defendant directs attention to tbe fact that tbe testimony shows, not a mere direction of tbe grantor that tbe deed should be delivered after bis death, with a statement or intimation that be would retain title during bis own life (as in some of tbe cited cases), but rather what can justifiably be found to be an acknowledgment that tbe property then belonged to tbe grantee, and that, if “anything” happened to him, tbe grantor, tbe deed was to be taken by tbe grantee, not as a delivery at that time, but because it already was bis; that is to say, tbe grantor’s several declarations are not simply to tbe effect that tbe land and tbe <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>deed were to be, but that they, respectively, actually “were,” the grantee’s property.</p>
