The devise to him does not take effect until “after the death” of testator’s wid<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>ow, who is still alive and who receives, during her lifetime, all the income of the estate. When he gets the farm he gets it “subject to the Widow Dower,” but not before. Consequently the trustees, who collect the income of the estate for the benefit of the widow, should pay the interest accruing on the mortgages during her lifetime, unless she elects to surrender her life interest therein. Any difficulty which might otherwise arise, is met by the offer of appellee to pay the mortgagees and take assignments of the mortgages, if it is decided that he is entitled to receive the interest thereon during the widow’s life. Our decree will, therefore, so provide. '</p>

Shaffer, deceased, of his real estate, known as the Stoltzfus farm, to his half brother Charles Grant Shaffer, is expressly subject to the nine mortgages of $á00 each, now thereon, but the same is not payable by him or out of his interest in said property until the death of Angeline Shaffer, widow of said John W. Shaffer, unless she elects to surrender her life interest therein ; that the said Charles Grant Shaffer may purchase or cause to be purchased the said nine mortgages, obtain assignments thereof, and hold the same against said property, with all the rights and remedies incident thereto to be enforced, if the widow does not surrender her life interest in said property, and if the accruing interest on said mortgages is not paid during the lifetime of said widow; and upon her surrender of all interest in said property, or upon her decease, whichever shall happen first, said mortgages shall be satisfied of record. The costs in the court below and in this court shall be borne equally by appellants and appellee.</p>
