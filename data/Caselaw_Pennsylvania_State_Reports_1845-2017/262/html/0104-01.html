Be this, however, as it may, as the contract thus narrated by the plaintiff contains nothing as to the quality of the acid or the amount of the commission to be paid, I think it can fairly be assumed that the original proposition and the modification as thus made formed, according to the plaintiff’s own understanding, a continuous transaction. If this proposition is not correct, then none of the letters or the nego<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>tiations which preceded October 9,1915, had anything to do with the case, and the plaintiff would not have presented them for the consideration of the jury. I do1 not intend to insinuate that they were improperly presented. On the contrary, I believe they formed part of the general transaction, and, as a consequence, were properly offered in evidence to elucidate the truth of the contention of the partios. The question before the jury was, whether or not there was a modification of the original contract. This was fully explained to the jury in the charge, and the evidence upon this subject was fully adverted to. It was stated that, if Hess did not modify his original proposition, then he was not liable to the plaintiff for commissions, for that proposition was admittedly different from the terms contained in the sale to Harrison Brothers, and that, if the plaintiff had no right to make a sale except on the terms originally stipulated, he could not, if he made a different sale, claim commissions from the defendant, even though the defendant refused to comply with the unauthorized sale. The jury were, however, also told: “But, on the contrary, if he did modify that agreement, if he agreed to the conditions as alleged by Ehrenstrom, then, of course, he is bound by them, and he could not then, after a bona fide offer had been made for the acid, nullify and refuse to fulfill it, without being liable to the plaintiff for the amount of commissions which he had contracted to pay on a sale being made.” This was a submission to the jury of the exact question upon which the plaintiff now rests his case, and, taking the charge as a whole, I think it was a fair presentation of the claims of both the parties, and the jury were left to decide the point at issue between them.</p>

Hosack, a witness called for the plaintiff, to testify as to a telephone conversation alleged to have been had between the plaintiff and the defendant on October 9, 1915. The witness stated that he was in Mr. Ehrenstrom’s office on that day, and that he heard Mr. Ehrenstrom talk to someone. He was not at the telephone himself, and it was not alleged that he knew who was at the other end of the line. He was asked what Mr. Ehrenstrom said, and an objection to the question being made by the defendant, he was not permitted to testify on this subject. A similar question arose on the part of the defendant. It was testified by Miss Eby that a telephone call came to the office of the defendant; that she answered the call, and the exchange girl talked to her and said, “Philadelphia is calling A. B. Hess;” that she called Mr. Hess to the ’phone, and that she heard Mr. Hess say, “Mr. Ehrenstrom,” apparently addressing him, and that Mr. Hess said “he wouldn’t accept the proposition unless they advanced 25 per cent, of the money,” and repeated that twice; that then the other party said something, and Mr. Hess said, “Well, then, you can’t have the acid,” and, also, “I will not change those terms.” This evidence was objected to, <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>but admitted. The plaintiff now claims that, if one conversation was admissible, the other was, and that the admission of the one and the exclusion of the other show manifest error.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[179,564,1150,1019]]]'>It has been decided in a number of cases that telephone conversations are generally admitted in evidence though the general rule has to some extent been modified in this State. Thus, in Swing v. Walker, supra, it appeared that the plaintiff offered to prove a conversation with one of the defendants, in order to show admissions on his part. It appeared, from the testimony of the witness, that he was not acquainted with this defendant’s voice and could not identify it. The Superior Court said: “The offer to prove a conversation over the telephone was clearly inadmissible......No discussion is necessary to show that a declaration or admission is not admissible unless the party making it is identified as the person sought to be charged. The introduction of the telephone has not changed the rule of evidence on that subject. If the witness had been in the presence of the person at the other end of the line, the declarations that person would not have been admissible without evidence that he was one of the defendants.”</p>

That question, however, has been determined in other jurisdictions. Thus, in McCarthy v. Peach, <a href="/mass/186/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="186 Mass. 67" data-case-ids="831526" data-case-paths="/mass/186/0067-01">186 Mass. 67</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=70%20N.E.%201029" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="70 N.E. 1029">70 N.

Whether it did take place as alleged, or was fictitious, was a question of fact for the jury.” In Miles v. Andrews, <a href="/ill/153/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="153 Ill. 262" data-case-ids="3026935" data-case-paths="/ill/153/0262-01">153 Ill. 262</a> (<a href="/citations/?q=38%20N.E.%20644" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="38 N.E. 644">38 N. E. Rep. 644</a>), it is held that, “where it is admitted that plaintiff and defendant conversed by telephone at a certain time, a witness who heard one side of the conversation may testify to it, though he could not hear the replies, and does not know of his own knowledge with whom the conversation was held; “and in Dannemiller &amp; Sons v. Leonard, 16 Ohio Cir. Ct. Rep. 686, that, where a conversation by telephone is carried on by parties to an action about the subject-matter of the action, a witness who heard one of them talking into the telephone may testify to what he heard. There are also other cases to the same effect. Under these cases, and also under Swing v. Walker, the court was evidently right in admitting the testimony of Miss Eby; but should it not also- have allowed Mr. Hosack to testify? If the situation of both the witnesses was the same, the principle should certainly be applied to both alike; but, as a matter of fact, the record shows that the exclusion of the testimony of Hosack was placed upon a different ground. It appears in plaintiff’s case that, after the conversation held by Ehrenstrom with Hess on October 9, 1915, Ehrenstrom sent the following letter to Hess:</p>

If, therefore, Mr. Ehrenstrom’,s- contention is correct, he put in writing the terms on which he desired the defendant to close the contract with Harrison Brothers on the succeeding Monday morning, and distinctly stated that that was the basis “on which they avIII Avant to close.” The writing of itself does not signify a closed agreement. If, then, Ehrenstrom put in Avriting the terms confirming his telephone conversation with Hess, what difference could it make what Hosack’s version of the telephone conversation on the part of Ehrenstrom was? If it was the same as is set forth in the writing, no harm was suffered by the plaintiff. If it was different, it could not be effective, because it was superseded by the writing.
