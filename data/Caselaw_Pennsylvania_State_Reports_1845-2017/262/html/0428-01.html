When the defendant arrived, Suggs, Scott and Stewart were in the shanty and the door was fastened on the inside. The defendant knocked at the door and after some words, the door was opened by Suggs and the defendant entered. The defendant and George Suggs had some <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>words about profane language that was used by the defendant in relation to the door not being unlocked or opened as quickly as the defendant thought it should have been when he first came to the door. The defendant continued teasing Suggs, although told to stop, until finally Suggs got out of his bunk and struck him and knocked him down. The defendant then went out and the door was fastened on the inside. In from three to five minutes afterwards the defendant returned and requested that the door be opened. After a little while the door was opened and it was discovered that defendant had a double barreled shot gun. The gun was discharged and the shot struck Suggs about the right shoulder and the right side of the neck while he was in his bunk. A second shot penetrated the bed clothing on the bunk from which Suggs had removed after the first shot. The evidence on the part of the Commonwealth further showed that Scott ten or fifteen minutes later had a scuffle with the defendant and in that scuffle succeeded in taking the gun away from him. The defendant then went away from the place of the shooting and later on that night he was arrested. He testified that he had bought the gun for hunting purposes, and that the gun went off accidentally, at the time of the shooting in the scuffle with Scott who had grabbed the gun, and that both barrels of the shot gun must have gone off at the same time.</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">[4]</a> “If you should find, from all the evidence, that there was no intention to kill, or that no intention to kill can be reasonably inferred from all the evidence in this case, then the killing would be murder in the second degree.”</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">[5]</a> “The Commonwealth contends that in view of the preparation of the gun, the entire absence of provocation at the time of inflicting the wound, the deadly nature of the weapon, and the vital part of the body at which it was aimed, all tend to prove that the killing was wilful, that there was time to deliberate, that the blow was premeditated, that there was no sufficient ground of provocation and no rage or passion. That is the contention of the Commonwealth, and if you find it to be true, it would constitute murder of the first degree. But on the other hand, the contention of the defendant is that the weapon was not procured or prepared for the purpose of killing the deceased. The defendant says that he had it for an innocent purpose, that he got it for hunting purposes. You will recollect that testimony. Of course if you believe that testimony, if you believe that he fired the shot without a wilful purpose and without the intention of killing, that would constitute murder in the second degree.”</p>

      <a class="bracketnum">[8]</a> “Now, gentlemen, as I have stated to you, it is a well-settled doctrine of our criminal law that in order to find a defendant guilty in any criminal case the jury must be convinced by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of the offense charged against him. If the jury entertained a reasonable doubt as to which of the two degrees of the crime charged in this indictment the defendant is guilty, that is, whether of murder in the first degree, or murder in the second degree, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of that doubt, and can only be convicted of the lower degree, that is of murder in the second degree. This reasonable doubt, gentlemen, must be a doubt rising out of the evidence, out of a consideration of all the evidence. It must not be a fanciful doubt raised up in your mind simply to enable you to escape an unpleasant duty. But it must be a doubt that is founded upon reason and arising out of the evidence. If you have such a doubt, after hearing all the evidence and considering it carefully, then the defendant is entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt, and you would have to acquit him.”</p>
