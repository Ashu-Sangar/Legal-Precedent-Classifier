L. 736, to begin after the expiration of the three hundred weeks during which the widow receives compensation, and to continue until each child reaches the age of sixteen years? The referee, the Workmen’s Compensation Board, the Court of Common Pleas, No. 3, of Philadelphia County, and the Superior Court, (Irvin v.
