L. 315, the fee to the lot vested in the husband upon the death of his daughter. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

Miller, the appellee, acquired title by deed to the lot of ground involved in this controversy. She died intestate May 16, 1902, leaving to survive her her husband and a child, Inez Irene Miller, to whom the said lot descended subject to the husband’s curtesy. The child died a month later, in her minority, unmarried and without issue. Two brothers of her mother claimed the fee in the lot on the ground that it had not passed from her to her father because he was not of the blood of her mother, the first purchaser, and this issue was framed, under the Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, to determine the title to the fee.</p>
