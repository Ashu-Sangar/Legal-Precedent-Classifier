    <p class="summary" id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[176,598,1152,1304]]]'>The defendant is a manufacturing corporation chartered under the laws of this State and is and has been engaged in doing business and in carrying on manufacturing not only in this State but also in several of the other states, in some of which it owns and operates manufacturing plants. On September 24, 1914, the accounting officers of the Commonwealth settled an account against it for the capital stock tax for the year 1913, and subsequently, on December 29, 1914, made a resettlement valuing the proportion of its capital stock in this State at $1,201,566, and charging it with the sum of $6,007.83. In this valuation were included the company’s bank deposits in banks in the other states in which it did business in connection with which the deposits were used, and $3,027.73 cash in the hands of its superintendents in those states, aggregating $208,262.04, its bills receivable amounting to the sum of $874,476.38 for services rendered and for goods sold and payable outside of this State and $20,000 known as bond commissions. The defendant objecting to the taxation of so much of its capital stock as was represented by these several kinds of property took this appeal. At the hearing the Commonwealth disclaimed any recovery on account of the $20,000 commissions.</p>

Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420; Act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 229. Whatever contributes to the value of the stock is in effect taxed. Hence the bank deposits and accounts receivable representing the capital stock taxed have been subjected to the tax. Capital stock represented by tangible personal property located <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>permanently outside of the State is not taxable here, but this is not so touching intangible personal property. Whatever may be the law of the other states it is the law of this State that the situs of such property for taxation is the domicile of the owner. The fact that the bank deposits in the present instance were in the banks of the other states and were there used in connection with the defendant’s business and operations, or that the accounts receivable were derived from services performed and goods sold and payable outside of this State did not change their situs for taxation. Whether taxable directly or through the capital stock, their taxable situs was the domicile of the defendant regardless of their source or place of use: Commonwealth v.

It, is true that in a few of the states it has been modified; and such property has been treated as having the same taxable situs as that of the tangible personal property permanently located outside of the domicile of the owner from which it is derived or with which it is used, but those decisions are exceptions to the general doctrine.</p>

      <em>^ </em>The objection is not well taken, that if the property in question is taxed here through its capital stock and also taxed directly in the other states, it will amount to double taxation. “Double taxation obnoxious to the rule is where the second or additional burden is imposed by the same sovereignty which imposed the first.” “Double taxation in a legal sense does not exist unless the double tax is levied upon the same property within the same jurisdiction.” Judy v.
