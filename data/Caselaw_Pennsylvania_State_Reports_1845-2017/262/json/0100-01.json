It bears all the appearance of a building erected for use as a public garage. The plaintiffs have requested the court to conclude as a matter of law that, the buildings having been erected in violation of the terms of the injunction, the court should now require the same to be removed. With this view we cannot concur. The character of the architecture of the building erected upon the tract of ground is one over which this court may not exercise supervision. It is only when the use to which the building is put becomes offensive that this court may act.\u201d\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs.",

T., 1917, by plaintiffs, from decree of C. P. No. 3, Philadelphia Co., June T., 1916, No. 1758, refusing prayer of bill in equity for removal of building in case of James H. Penniman, Josiah H.

J., Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to restrain the erection of garage building. Before Ferguson, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that plaintiffs and defendants held their respective properties subject to the following covenant and restriction: \u201cAnd subject also to the express condition and agreement that no slaughter house, skin-dressing establishment, hose or engine house, blacksmith shop, carpenter shop, glue, starch, soap or candle manufactory, livery stable or other building for offensive occupation shall at any time hereafter be erected or used upon any part of the aforesaid lot of ground.\u201d\nThe lower court found that the neighborhood immediately surrounding the property upon which the building was erected was exclusively residential in character. The defendants\u2019 premises were Nos. 4317 and 4319 Walnut street, Philadelphia. The plaintiffs were owners of property in the same block.\nJuly 17, 1918:\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court further states the case.\nThe lower court entered a decree perpetually restraining defendants from using or permitting others to use the buildings on the lots in question for the purpose of a public garage or storage house for automobiles. Thereafter the defendants continued the erection of the building having such appearance. The lower court refused to decree the removal of the building. Plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nIra J. Williams, of Brown & Williams, with him Charles L. Cuerin, for appellants.\nNo argument was made in behalf of the appellee."
