        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nPlaintiff was an employee of defendant. On March 29, 1915, while in the performance of his work, he had occasion to use a certain traveling-way, built by defendant for the use of its employees. It was at an angle of some thirty-five degrees, and its round wooden steps were held in place by props on one side and by being inserted into the adjoining walls of coal on the other. There was conflicting evidence as to whether or not this original construction of the steps was proper, in view of the character of the coal, plaintiff\u2019s witnesses asserting that at the place of the accident they were five feet apart, that they should have been inserted eight to ten inches into the coal which at that point was soft, and that in fact this particular step was inserted only about two inches. Defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that the traveling-way was properly constructed, that the coal was hard, the steps from eighteen inches to two feet apart, except in one place where they were five feet apart, and that they were inserted in the coal from four to six inches, which was a sufficient depth. The evidence was conflicting also as to the way the injury happened, plaintiff and his witness asserting that as he trod upon one of the steps the coal under it broke away because of the shallowness of the hole, causing the step to slip out of the coal, which it would not have done had it been inserted a proper distance, and that by reason thereof he suffered the injuries of which he complains. Defendant\u2019s witnesses asserted that the accident was caused by plaintiff slipping on a hole in the rock and falling, wholly or partly because of a prior injury to his leg, for which defendant was not responsible. The verdict and judgment were for defendant,, and plaintiff appeals.\nThe first and second assignments of error cannot be considered for the reason that they each contain more than one exceptions, in direct violation of Rule 26 of our rules of court.\nThe third, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth and eleventh assignments of error have no exception to support them, and for that reason cannot be considered. They contain excerpts from the general charge, regarding which the only exception is \u201cplaintiff excepts to the charge of the court,\u201d without any reason being \u201calleged regarding the same in the hearing of the court.\u201d This is required by Section 2 of the Act of 11th May, 1911, P. L. 279, and we so pointed out in Sikorski v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co., 260 Pa. 243.\nThe fourth and eighth assignments of error cannot be considered because while proper exceptions were taken to the answers to the points which are assigned as error, the points themselves are not embodied in the assignments as required by Rule 27 of our rules of court.\nThe twelfth assignment complains because the trial judge told the jury, in answer to defendant\u2019s first point, that \u201cplaintiff was fully acquainted with......the steps, and the manner that they were fastened and secured.\u201d In view of the conclusion we have reached, it is only necessary to call attention to the fact that the word \u201cmanner\u201d in that connection is susceptible of two meanings, one referring simply to the general construction of the steps, and the other including also the depth of their insertion into the coal. If given the former meaning the point would be accurate, but, if given the latter, it would be inaccurate, for there was no admission by plaintiff that he knew how deep they were inserted into the coal.\nSo, too, on the retrial, the answer to defendant\u2019s second point, if renewed, ought to be qualified to show that the obvious character of the defect would not relieve the defendant merely by reason of there being a mine foreman in the mine, if the defect was due tb original construction and not to want of repair.\nThe fourteenth assignment complains of the trial judge\u2019s affirmance of defendant\u2019s ninth point, viz:\n\u201cNinth. If the traveling-way in question was unsafe as complained of in the plaintiff\u2019s statement, it was the statutory duty of the mine foreman to correct it and make it safe and his neglect or failure so to do cannot be held to convict the defendant mine owner of negligence or make it liable for the mine foreman\u2019s negligence.\u201d\nWhen the trial judge\u2019s attention was called to the fact that the affirmance of that point \u201cwould be equivalent to directing a verdict for the defendant\u201d he replied: \u201cWell, we affirm that as a legal proposition without regard to the plaintiff\u2019s statement. We have not read the plaintiff\u2019s statement.\u201d Aside from the obvious mistake in affirming a point which construed a paper which had not been offered in evidence, which contained a number of allegations of negligence, and which had not been read by the court, those answers were most confusing as well as serious error, for the gravamen of the point was that \u201cif the traveling-way in question was unsafe as complained of in plaintiff\u2019s statement, it was the statutory duty of the mine foreman to correct it\u201d and the defendant could not be held for negligence; but it was especially erroneous in view of the fact that the mine foreman,' as an employee of defendant, had supervised the original construction of the steps. Generally speaking, the trial judge had accurately held that if the original construction was faulty, and the injury was caused thereby, the defendant was liable, but if the fault grew out of want of repair due to the mine foreman\u2019s neglect, the defendant was not liable. In affirming the above point, however, he wholly overlooked that distinction, which has been repeatedly pointed out by us: Simmons v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 240 Pa. 354; Watson v. Monongahela River Consolidated Coal & Coke Co., 247 Pa. 469; Dobra v. Lehigh Valley Coal Co., 250 Pa. 313.\nWe have, moreover, read all the evidence bearing on the cause of the accident, for the purpose of determining whether or not the trial judge could properly have given binding instructions for the defendant, and find ourselves in accord with his ruling that there was sufficient evidence to carry the case to the jury, especially as the distance the steps were apart, and the depth of their insertion into the coal, were necessarily a part of the work of original construction of the traveling-way. It is not necessary here to repeat that evidence; the trial judge has in his charge summarized it with substantial accuracy.\nThe judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.",
