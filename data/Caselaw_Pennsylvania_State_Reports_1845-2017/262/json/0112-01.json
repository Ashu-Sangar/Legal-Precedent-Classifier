    "head_matter": "Hildebrand\u2019s Estate.\nDecedents\u2019 estates \u2014 Widow\u2019s exemption \u2014 Direct inheritance tax \u2014 - Act of June 7,1917, P. L. M7, Sec. 12, and July 11,1917, P. L. 882.\nThe $500 widow\u2019s exemption granted by the Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 447, is not subject to the direct inheritance tax imposed by the Act of July 11, 1917, P. L. 832, providing that \u201cAll estates ......passing from any person......either by will or under the intestate laws......are subject to the tax of $2 on every hundred dollars of the clear value of such estate.\u201d\nArgued June 11, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 17, Jan. T., 1918, by Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from decree of O. C. Lancaster Co., October T., 1917, No. 7, sustaining appeal from appraisement in Estate of Isaac W. Hildebrand, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from direct inheritance tax appraisement.\nThe facts appear from the following opinion by Smith, P. J.:\n\u201cFor the imposition and collection of certain inheritance taxes\u201d an enactment was approved July 11, 1917, (P. L. 832). Concisely, it provides that, \u201cAll estates ......passing from any person......either by will or under the intestate laws of this Commonwealth...... are......subject to the tax of two ($2) dollars on every hundred dollars of the clear value of such estates.\u201d Because of this enactment the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania contends that the five-hundred-dollar exemption reserved for a widow by Section 12 of the Fiduciaries\u2019 Act of 1917, (P. L. 447) subject to the tax, and to accomplish its collection has included it in the prescribed appraisement, and from which this appeal has been taken.\nExemption acts have been conceived in a spirit favorable to widows and have received an interpretation consistent with their conception: Lyman v. Byam, 38 Pa. 475; Peeble\u2019s Est., 157 Pa. 605. Such an act creates an independent bounty, and is of no kin to one of distribution: Compher v. Compher, 25 Pa. 31; Nevins\u2019s App., 47 Pa. 230; King\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 345; Gilbert\u2019s Est., 227 Pa. 648; Buckland\u2019s Est., 239 Pa. 608.\nThe Commonwealth cannot prevail because the inheritance tax act does not authorize its action. It provides that only \u201cclear value\u201d of a decedent\u2019s estate is taxable, and the clear value of an estate is only that which remains after all claims against it have been paid. A widow\u2019s exemption is a \u201cpreferred claim,\u201d and, therefore, must first be met. It is a \u201cgift of the law prompted by considerations of public policy\u201d: Beetem & Co. v. Getz, 5 Sup. Ct. 71; Peeble\u2019s Est., supra.\nAn estate that passes \u201ceither by will or under the intestate laws\u201d is subject to the tax, but a widow\u2019s exemption is not such an estate. It does not come by either of these ways. It is neither a legacy or devise, nor an inheritance. Subject to a purchase-money lien it is preferred to all claims against an estate. By asserting it the amount of it ceases to be regarded as part of a decedent\u2019s estate. Against it a decedent\u2019s creditors, legatees, devisees or distributees cannot prevail: Peeble\u2019s Est., supra. The action of a widow properly claiming it distinguishes it as her estate; which had been held in abeyance by her husband during his life. The act says it is something which she may \u201cretain,\u201d thus pointedly implying ownership.\nJuly 17, 1918:\nSuch exemption is a wife\u2019s inchoate property right in a husband\u2019s estate, which becomes complete when as his widow she sustains her claim for it. It is not subject to the tax imposed on the estate passing from a deceased husband, therefore, the appeal is sustained and the appraisement for inheritance tax purposes is reformed by striking five hundred dollars from it. Costs to be paid by the Commonwealth.\nThe lower court sustained the appeal and reformed the appraisement by striking the sum of $500 therefrom. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed.\nError assigned was decree of court.\nWilliam E. Keller, First Deputy Attorney General, with him Francis Shunk Brown, Attorney General, and M. E. Musser, for appellant.\nF. Lyman Windolph, O. 8. Schaeff-er and J. R. Kinder, for appellee, were relieved from argument by the court."
