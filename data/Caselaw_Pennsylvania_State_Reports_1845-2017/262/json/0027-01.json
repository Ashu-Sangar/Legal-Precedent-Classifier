Pa. W. & P. Co., 259 Pa. 104). The prayers are so drafted that the court is asked to make such orders and decrees as would only pertain to the physical construction of the dam which exists in York County, yet it is quite obvious that any such order or decree would necessarily affect the entire dam of the defendant, the largest portion of which is outside the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d",
