        "text": "Per Curiam,\nOn May 8,1899, Anna Lenora Grimes Miller, the wife of Colley J. Miller, the appellee, acquired title by deed to the lot of ground involved in this controversy. She died intestate May 16, 1902, leaving to survive her her husband and a child, Inez Irene Miller, to whom the said lot descended subject to the husband\u2019s curtesy. The child died a month later, in her minority, unmarried and without issue. Two brothers of her mother claimed the fee in the lot on the ground that it had not passed from her to her father because he was not of the blood of her mother, the first purchaser, and this issue was framed, under the Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, to determine the title to the fee.\nThe appellee and his wife were both descendants of Caleb Johnson, and were related to him in the same degree of consanguinity, the husband as a great-grandson and the wife as a great-granddaughter, and the learned court below correctly held that the husband was of the blood of his wife, the perquisitor of the lot: Hart\u2019s App., 8 Pa. 32. \u201cA person is with the most strict propriety of language affirmed to be of the blood of another who has any, however small a portion, of the same blood derived from a common ancestor\u201d : Story, J., in Gardner v.

A person is with the most strict propriety of language affirmed to be of the blood of another who has any, however small a portion, of the same blood derived from a common ancestor.\n2. A married woman having purchased a lot of land died, survived by her husband and minor daughter. The lot descended to the daughter, subject to the husband\u2019s curtesy. The daughter subse-\n' quently died, unmarried and without issue. Two brothers of the mother claimed the fee in the lot, alleging that the father could not inherit the lot from the daughter because he was not of the blood of his wife who was the first purchaser. It appeared that the husband and wife were related to a common great-grandfather in the same degree of consanguinity. The lower court decided that under Section 5 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315, the fee to the lot vested in the husband upon the death of his daughter. Held, no error.\nArgued June 3, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 284, Jan. T., 1917, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Fayette Co., June T., 1915, No. 792, in ease of Colley J. Miller v. William Grimes and Lee Grimes.\nBefore Brown, C.
