T., 1917, by plaintiff, from decree of O. C. Lancaster Co., Jan. T., 1915, No. 51, sustaining exceptions to adjudication in case of Anna S. Wohlsen, Executrix of Peter N. Wohlsen, deceased, v. The Northern Trust and Savings Company, of Lancaster, Pa., Trustee for creditors in Estate of Peter N. Wohlsen, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before Smith, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Peter N. Wohlsen died on January 3, 1915, leaving no personal property but seized of two tracts of real estate. The one, No. 310 College avenue (in the City of Lancaster), was encumbered by a mortgage of $5,000.\nThe other was a lot on South Marshall street (in said city), on which were erected ten dwelling houses. This lot was encumbered by two' mortgages for $15,000 and $3,000, respectively.\nFollowing all these mortgages was a judgment for $12,857 confessed by the decedent to the Northern Trust and Savings Co., Trustee, in trust for his creditors existing at the time the judgment was confessed.\nThe decedent left no personal property.\nOn January 28, 1915, the executrix, Anna S. Wohlsen, presented her petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court asking for the sale of property No. 340 College avenue, for the payment of the debts of the decedent.\nNo debts were scheduled except funeral expenses and doctor bills and the judgment in trust for creditors above referred to.\nThe sale was ordered and was held in pursuance thereof on February 18, 1915, and the property, No. 340 College avenue, was sold, subject to the mortgage of $5,000 encumbering it, for $2,375, and the money paid to the executrix. It is this money which forms the subject-matter in dispute.\nThe South Marshall street properties were not sold at the same time owing to a pending equity suit as to the decedent\u2019s title. \\\nThe executrix, who was also the sole legatee under the will, collected the rents. She applied the proceeds of sale of the property No. 340 College avenue, to the payment of the taxes, repairs and mortgage interest on the South Marshall street properties accruing after the College avenue house was sold.\nThe lower court surcharged the defendant to the extent of payments so made. Anna S. Wohlsen, Executrix, appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.\nEdwin M. Gilbert, for appellant.\nJuly 17, 1918:\nWilliam E. Keller, with him M. G. Schaeffer and John A. Ooyle, for appellee."
