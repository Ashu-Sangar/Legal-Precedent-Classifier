    "head_matter": "Slife v. Borough of Dorranceton, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Municipalities\u2014SidewalJcs\u2014 Accumulation of ice \u2014Contributory negligence \u2014 Case for jury.\nIn an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff, in consequence of a fall caused by ice, which had accumulated on a sidewalk, where plaintiff, in his direct examination, made out a ease free from contributory negligence, the case was properly submitted to the jury, although plaintiff, on cross-examination, was confused and contradictory, .leaving a doubt as to whether he really recognized the ridges of ice before he stepped upon them or afterwards, and a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff was sustained.\nArgued May 28, 1918.\nAppeal, No. 117, Jan. Term, 1917, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., Oct. T., 1914, No. 552, on verdict for plaintiff, in case of Anthony L. Slife v. Borough of Dorranceton.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion of the court below sur defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v.:\nThe plaintiff while on his way to work, stepped and fell upon certain ice which had accumulated on the sidewalk, and he brought this action against the borough for the resulting damages of personal injury.\nHe asserted as the foundation of municipal liability, that the ice lay in mounds and ridges, and the verdict of the jury in his favor has established that fact on sufficient evidence.\nThe defendant does not ask for a new trial, and makes no complaint in any respect, except our refusal to give binding instructions in its favor, on the single proposition of the contributory negligence.\nWe could not have done this, however, without a plain invasion of the jury\u2019s province.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s direct examination made out a case \u25a0quite clear of negligence on his part. He was walking,in an ordinary, reasonable manner. He had no previous knowledge of the condition. His ability to see the obstruction was materially affected by a covering of snow, and perhaps also by the partial light of an early hour on a winter morning. He could only have avoided the ice by going into the roadway, which might not have diminished the danger, or by turning back on a long detour, which would have been a rather harsh alternative for a laboring man on his way to work.\nDefendant\u2019s contention is based entirely upon what it designates the \u201cnet result\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination, in which, indeed, he was confused and contradictory, leaving a doubt whether he really recognized the ridges before he stepped upon them or afterward.\nWe might concede a marked leaning towards the former, but only the jury could draw the conclusion, resolve the doubt, determine the net results, and say in the light of all the evidence whether this man was exercising the ordinary reasonable care obligatory upon a pedestrian.\nThe judges are all agreed that binding instructions on the question of contributory negligence were properly refused, and, therefore, in the absence of any other complaint, the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto', is denied, with exception granted to the defendant in this regard.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $1,800 and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed.\nJuly 17, 1918:\nErrors assigned were in refusing to direct a verdict for defendant and in refusing to enter judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nEvan O. Jones, with him B. W. Davis and H. A. Gordon, for appellant.\nO. B. Lenahan, J. F. McOabe and E: A. Lynch, for appellee."
