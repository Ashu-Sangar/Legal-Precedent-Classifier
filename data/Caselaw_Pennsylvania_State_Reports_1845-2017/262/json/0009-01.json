        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThis is an action of ejectment; judgment was entered on a verdict for defendants, and plaintiffs have appealed.\nPlaintiffs are the legal heirs of Dr. J. F. Kanawell, deceased; Charles A. Miller (hereinafter called the defendant) claims the real estate in suit as the grantee of decedent; the other defendant, Fred. Musser, is a tenant under Miller.\nIn view of the verdict, the following facts may be accepted as established: In 1893, Dr. Kanawell purchased the farm sought to be recovered in this action; the defendant, a nephew of decedent\u2019s first wife, lived in the household of the doctor, and was treated by him as though he were a son; in 1897, Dr. Kanawell, in consideration of \u201cone dollar and natural love and affection,\u201d executed and acknowledged a deed for the farm to Miller, when the latter was but six years old; subsequently this document was enclosed in an unsealed envelope, endorsed \u201cCharles A. Miller,\u201d in the grantor\u2019s handwriting, and put in a safe in the doctor\u2019s office; from childhood on, the defendant had access to this safe, knew the combination, and frequently opened it; in 1905, Dr. Kanawell called upon a nephew, with whom he was intimate, and told the latter that, if anything happened to him (the doctor), \u201cat any time,\u201d the nephew and Miller \u201cshould open his safe, and in there we would find papers, one addressed to myself [the nephew] and one to Charley [Miller] ; the first he gave me to understand was Charley\u2019s deed, and the other was a will\u201d; at the time of this interview, the doctor said \u201cthe deed was Charley\u2019s,\u201d that the latter had the combination of the safe, and when the safe was opened the deed was to be \u201chanded to Charley\u201d; in 1909, Dr. Kanawell made a will purporting to dispose of his entire estate, real and personal; several pieces of real property are mentioned in this will, but the farm here in question is entirely omitted therefrom, as it is from two subsequent codicils executed February 28, 1914, and November 8, 1915, respectively, on which latter date the doctor died; the executor was obliged to obtain tbe services of Miller to open decedent\u2019s safe, and, when this was accomplished, tbe deed was found therein, endorsed as already stated; tbe executor placed tbe instrument upon record.\nDefendant offered to prove tbe deed bad been actually delivered to him by Dr. Kanawell during tbe latter\u2019s life, and bad been banded back to tbe grantor with tbe request that be keep it in bis safe as custodian for tbe grantee. Tbis offer was rejected; and, for present purposes, should be considered as much out of tbe case as though never made. Therefore, defendant must point to other, competent, evidence sufficient to sustain tbe verdict and judgment in bis favor. To meet this burden, be stands, first, upon tbe duly executed, acknowledged and recorded deed itself, which, on its face, purports to have been \u201cdelivered\u201d; next, be points to tbe evidence in support of tbe facts which we have already recited, and, in addition, to repeated declarations by tbe grantor, at intervals extending over many years (some in tbe presence and bearing of tbe grantee, and others in bis absence), to tbe effect that be bought the farm for Miller, that it belonged to tbe latter, that be, tbe doctor, did not own it, but was only the overseer for defendant, and, finally, to many acts indicating ownership by Miller and acquiescence therein by decedent. Moreover, defendant directs attention to tbe fact that tbe testimony shows, not a mere direction of tbe grantor that tbe deed should be delivered after bis death, with a statement or intimation that be would retain title during bis own life (as in some of tbe cited cases), but rather what can justifiably be found to be an acknowledgment that tbe property then belonged to tbe grantee, and that, if \u201canything\u201d happened to him, tbe grantor, tbe deed was to be taken by tbe grantee, not as a delivery at that time, but because it already was bis; that is to say, tbe grantor\u2019s several declarations are not simply to tbe effect that tbe land and tbe deed were to be, but that they, respectively, actually \u201cwere,\u201d the grantee\u2019s property.\nAppellants correctly state the question involved thus: \u201cWas there any evidence in the case showing that said deed was delivered to the grantee named therein in the grantor\u2019s lifetime?\u201d In view of the foregoing facts, this determining question must be answered in the affirmative.\nThere are two lines of cases dealing with the delivery of deeds, duly executed, but found apparently in the unqualified possession of the grantor at time of his death. In one, the delivery is held to have been sufficiently proved: Stinger v. Commonwealth, 26 Pa. 422, 428; Stephens v. Huss, 54 Pa. 20, 22, 26; Stephens v. Rinehart, 72 Pa. 434, 440, 441; Holt\u2019s App., 98 Pa. 257, 270; Turner v. Warren, 160 Pa. 336, 343; Cummings v. Glass, 162 Pa. 241, 251 et seq.; Wagoner\u2019s Est., 174 Pa. 558, 564; Kern v. Howell, 180 Pa. 315, 321-2; Chase v. Clearfield Lumber Co., 213 Pa. 46, 48; Clymer v. Groff, 220 Pa. 580, 584; also see what is said upon the subject in hand by Sharswood, J., in Pa. Co., Etc., v. Dovey, 64 Pa. 260, 266-7; and by Thompson, J., in Diehl v. Emig, 65 Pa. 320, 327, citing Blight v. Schenk, 10 Pa. 285. In the other, delivery is held not to have been sufficiently proved: Critchfield v. Critchfield, 24 Pa. 100, 103; Duraind\u2019s App., 116 Pa. 93, 102; Benedick v. Benedick, 187 Pa. 351, 355; Cameron v. Gray, 202 Pa. 566, 567, 569; Sears v. Scranton Trust Co., 228 Pa. 126, 134, 138 et seq.; Harroun v. Graham, 258 Pa. 245. Albeit, owing to differences of fact, none of the authorities cited can be held to rule the present case, yet relevant general principles are stated and discussed in all of them.\nWhile \u201cthe crowning fact\u201d in the execution of a deed is delivery, yet it is not necessary to prove \u201cactual manual investiture,\u201d since \u201cdelivery may be inferred or presumed from circumstances\u201d: Rigler v. Cloud, 14 Pa. 361, 364. \u201cDelivery may be made by words alone, or by acts alone, or by both together, but there must be sufficient to show an intention to pass the title\u201d: Dayton v. Newman, 19 Pa. 194, 199.\nWhen the deed to defendant, duly acknowledged and recorded, was proved, this, prima facie, placed the title and right of possession in him (Kern v. Howell, supra, 316-17; Clymer v. Groff, supra, 583-4; Diehl v. Emig, supra); then, when it was shown that, after Dr. KanawelPs death, the deed, unrecorded, was found in the latter\u2019s safe, the burden shifted, and it became the duty of defendant to establish a delivery in the lifetime of the grantor; but, as indicated by the authorities already cited, to do this it was not necessary for the grantee to prove the actual handing of the deed to him by the grant- or, so long as sufficient circumstances were shown, by the weight of clear and satisfactory evidence, reasonably to justify the conclusion that a delivery had, in fact, taken place.\nIn the present instance, it cannot justifiably be said that the burden resting upon the defendants was not fully sustained within the requirements of our decisions upon the subject; the question of delivery was for the jury (Steel v. Tuttle, 15 S. & R. 210, 217-18; Galbraith v. Zimmerman, 100 Pa. 374, 377), and it was found against plaintiffs. The judgment entered on the verdict will not be disturbed.\nWe have determined the sole point called to our attention by the statement of \u201cquestion involved,\u201d which is all that is required of us (Kennedy v. Rothrock, 261 Pa. 580, and cases there cited); all the assignments have been examined, however, and, while they will not be discussed specifically, nothing appears therein which, considering the record as a whole, demonstrates reversible error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Miller et al.\nReal estate \u2014 Deeds\u2014Delivery\u2014Presumed from circumstance \u2014 \u25a0 Absence of manual delivery\u25a0 \u2014 \u2022Placing deed in grantor\u2019s safe \u2014 Grantor\u2019s declarations \u2014 Burden of proof \u2014 Case for jury.\n1. Delivery of a deed may be inferred from circumstances and it is not necessary to prove actual manual investiture. Delivery may be made by words alone, or acts alone, or by both together, but there must be sufficient to show an intention to pass title.\n2. In an action of ejectment where the controlling question was whether there had been a delivery of a deed of the premises to defendant during the lifetime of a decedent under whom plaintiff claimed as heir, the case was for the jury and a verdict and judgment for defendant will be sustained where it appeared that defendant, a nephew of decedent\u2019s wife, lived with decedent and was treated by him as a son; that four years after the purchase of the property by decedent he executed and acknowledged a deed to defendant, who was then six years old, in consideration of \u201cone dollar and natural love and affection\u201d; that subsequently the deed was enclosed in an envelope endorsed in grantor\u2019s handwriting with defendant\u2019s name; that, from childhood on, defendant had access to the safe and frequently opened it; that deceased told a relative that in case anything happened such relative and defendant should open the safe and that defendant\u2019s deed and decedent\u2019s will were therein; and that decedent on numerous occasions during his life, sometimes in the presence of defendant and on other occasions in his absence, stated that the farm was defendant\u2019s and that decedent did not own it but was only overseer for defendant; and, although decedent disposed of other real estate by will, neither in his will nor in the codicils thereto did he mention the farm in question.\n3. Proof of the deed to the defendant, duly acknowledged and recorded, placed the title and right of possession prima facie in the defendant, but the burden of proof shifted to the defendant to show a delivery in grantor\u2019s lifetime when it appeared that the deed was found in decedent\u2019s safe, unrecorded, after- grantor\u2019s death.\nSupreme Court practice \u2014 Statement of questions involved.\n4.
