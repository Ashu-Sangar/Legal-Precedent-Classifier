        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nIt was admitted that the death of plaintiff\u2019s minor son resulted from asphyxia caused by inhaling illuminating gas, which, as the testimony tends to show, escaped from defendant\u2019s broken gas pipe in the street at the corner of Diamond and Palethorp streets. Without referring in detail to the uncontradicted testimony tending to prove that the proper city authorities were duly notified of the fact that gas was escaping at that point, and that they neglected for several days to locate the leak and replace the broken pipe,\u2018etc., it is sufficient to say that the evidence introduced by the plaintiff, if believed by the jury, presented a case of inexcusable and protracted neglect of duty, on the part of defendant, resulting, as the jury would have been warranted in finding, in the death of plaintiff\u2019s son. The duty of promptly locating and stopping the leak was one that devolved solely on the proper authorities of the city. No one else had any right to interfere with the gas pipe, or open the street for the purpose of locating or stopping the leak. That this was their duty, and theirs alone, is a proposition too plain to need either argument or citation of authorities. It cannot be seriously contended that there was any lack of competent and sufficient proof of defendant\u2019s negligence, as the proximate cause of the boy\u2019s death, etc., to carry the case to the jury on that question of fact.\nBut it is contended that plaintiff and her son were both guilty of contributory negligence, and on that ground, if no other, the learned court was warranted in refusing to take off the judgment.of nonsuit. We cannot assent to this proposition. Conceding, for the sake of argument only, that there is some evidence of such contributory negligence, an examination of the testimony has satisfied us that it is not of such a character as warranted the court in virtually declaring, as matter of law, that either the plaintiff or her son was guilty of negligence which contributed to the death of the latter. In view of all the evidence, we think the case involved questions of fact which were clearly for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and to them it should have been submitted with proper instructions as to the law applicable thereto.\nJudgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Ottersbach, Appellant, v. Philadelphia.\nNegligence \u2014 Municipality\u2014Death by inhalation of gas \u2014 Contributory negligence.\nIn an action against a city to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s son caused by inhaling gas which escaped from a broken pipe in the street and flowed into plainLiff\u2019s house, it is proper to submit the case to the jury where the evidence shows that the proper city authorities were duly notified of the fact that gas was escaping, and that they neglected for several days to locate the leak, and replace the broken pipe.\nPlaintiff\u2019s son, a boy fifteen years of age, was asphyxiated by illuminating gas escaping from a broken pipe in the street into an outbuilding.\nThe owner of the premises was an uncle of the boy, and the evidence was uncontradicted that for two weeks prior to the accident the uncle knew of the presence of gas in the outbuilding. The evidence was uncertain as to plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the leak and the character of it. Held, that the question of contributory negligence was for the jury.\nArgued March 21, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 173, Jan. T., 1894, by plaintiff, Margaret Ottersbach, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Philadelphia Co., March T., 1893, No. 162, entering nonsuit.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nTrespass for death of plaintiff\u2019s son.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on Jan. 24,1893, plaintiff\u2019s son, a boy about fifteen years old, was asphyxiated by illuminating gas escaping from a broken pipe into an outbuilding. The boy and his mother lived with the boy\u2019s uncle at the corner of Diamond and Palethorp streets. The uncle was the owner of the premises.\nIt was proven that, for about two weeks before the accident, a smell of gas, at times greater than at others, had been noticed by the uncle in this backhouse, in which there was no window.\nThe door was closed when the boy was found.\nThe uncle testified that he had noticed the smell over two weeks before the accident; that on the Sunday previous thereto he and his wife had been affected by it. No complaint was made by him, however, to the city authorities. He thus testified concerning a call at the house, by a man named Gibson, employed by the gas department of the city: \u201c On Jan. 19, on Tuesday, and between nine and ten o\u2019clock, was my time to go out collecting, and as I was going out I met him; I seen him open the street in two different places. The first I noticed of it they were smelling round the vents in the neighborhood. They were smelling there to trace it, and as I came out I told the gentleman. I says, \u2018 Just go in that water-closet and you will find plenty of gas,\u2019 and he followed suit, and when he was in there he used those words; he says, \u2018 Don\u2019t strike no match and don\u2019t take no candle in there or it will blow up,\u2019 and I called my wife out at the same time and I gave her notice then what the gentleman had said, and he told her the same thing, and then I says to him \u2014 I explained the case to him, because the odor was more than bearable ; I could hardly stand it. I wouldn\u2019t have complained, but he just happened to come up there. I told him then to follow it up; he saj's, \u2018 I haven\u2019t got the time; I have got to go some-wheres else ; but,\u2019 he says, \u2018 there will be a tracing gang sent here to-morrow \u2019 \u2014 that was on Wednesday \u2014 \u2018 and they will follow that up until they find it.\u2019 I then said, \u2018 I wish you would.\u2019 Q. You were going on to tell us what took place between you and Mr. Gibson? A. Yes, sir. I related the affair at home\u2014 that is, my wife and myself \u2014 and then I told him, I think, three times to attend to it. I asked them how soon it would be attended to. He said, \u2018 I won\u2019t be in before four o\u2019clock, but there will be a tracing gang round here to-morrow morning, because there is lots of gas around here that ought to be attended to,\u2019 and I asked him then if he thought it was illuminating gas, and he said yes. By Mr. Johnson. Q. Did the-tracing gang come ? A. No.\u201d\nThe aunt was present when Gibson called, and testified that all he said was, \u201cWe should not strike a match in the closet nor put no paper in, because it would set on fire and explode.\u201d\nPlaintiff testified that she had never heard that any notice-had been given not to go into the water-closet. She also testified as follows: \u201c Q. Did you notice aiij*- odor around that place at the time? A. The gas? Q. Yes. A. Yes, sir. Q. What sort of smell was it ? A. It wasn\u2019t sewer gas; it was burning gas. Q. Tell us about the smell you noticed \u2014 how great it was and sb forth? A. Well, it was for two weeks, about,that we had the smell in the water-closet, but certainly we didn\u2019t think it would do the damage that it did do, but then it was sometimes greater than other times. . . . Q. Had you noticed the smell anywhere excepting in the outhouse? A. No, only in the outhouse.\u201d\nApril 9, 1894:\nThe court entered a compulsory nonsuit and subsequently refused to take it off.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJohn G. Johnson, for appellant.\nThe city was negligent in its action, after complaint had reached the proper authorities of the fact of an escape of illuminating gas.\nThere was no evidence of contributory negligence which justified the taking of the case from the jury: Rapho Twp. v. Moore, 68 Pa. 406; Allentown v. Kramer, 73 Pa. 408; Vanderslice v. City, 103 Pa. 107; McLaughlin v. Corry, 77 Pa. 109 ; Smith v. Boston Gas Light Co., 129 Mass. 318; Holly v.
