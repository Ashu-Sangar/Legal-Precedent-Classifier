We cannot go into the merits of the contention upon such a motion. Presumably that subject was duly considered by the court below before the judgment was entered. Under the procedure act of 1887 it is a grave question whether an affidavit of defence may not be required after the proceeding by foreign attachment has been converted into an action of assumpsit by a general appearance for the defendant. But whether it is or not the remedy is by appeal. Motions to strike off a judgment ordinarily are not allowed unless the record shows that the judgment was irregular or void.\nThe refusal of the court below to set aside the return to the writ of foreign attachment and to quash the writ is not a final judgment and is therefore not the subject of an appeal. The truthfulness of the sheriff\u2019s return of service of the writ of foreign attachment cannot be inquired into in this proceeding' when the return is regular on its face as it is here. If the return was false the remedy is by an action for a false return.\nAppeal quashed.",

T., 1894, by defendant, William H. Snowdon, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1893, No. 10, discharging rule to quash return in foreign attachment, and to set aside judgment.\nBefore Gkeen, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAppeal quashed.\nRule to quash return and set aside judgment in foreign attachment.\nFrom the record it appeared that, on Dec. 13,1892, the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Co. commenced an action in C. P. No. 1, of March T., 1893, No. 10, against W. H. Snowdon, to recover the amount of a debt of Snowdon & Rau, by issuing a writ of foreign attachment against certain real estate of the .said W. H. Snowdon, he being a resident of New Jersey. To this writ the sheriff made the following return: \u201c Attached as within commanded, Dec. 17, 1892, at 10 A. M., certain real estate, described in a certain paper hereto annexed and marked \u2018A,\u2019 by going to Dillwyn and Willow streets, and then and there, in the presence of R. Henry, a creditable person of the neighborhood, attaching and declaring that I attached the said real estate and also all the goods and chattels, moneys, credits, legacies, and interests of the within named defendant, in the .hands, possession or control of Frank C. Schaefer, and summoned on the same day, and at the same time, the said Frank C. Schaefer as garnishee, by giving to him a true and attested copy of the within writ and making known to him the contents thereof, said Frank C. Schaefer being the tenant in possession of premises described in said paper as No. 1 and 2, and holding-under the defendant.\n\u201c A description I have filed in the office of the prothonotary,. December 21, 1892, and nihil habet as to defendant, also nihil habet as to Sarah R. Snowdon, \u2018 garnishee,\u2019 so answers,\u201d etc.\nOn Feb. 22, 1893, defendant therein entered a rule on plaintiff to show cause of action and why the foreign attachment should not be dissolved. On March 2d, an affidavit of the cause of action was filed, and after argument the rule was, on March 10th, discharged. On May 27th, a general appearance was entered for defendant, and on July 6th plaintiff filed his statement of claim. On July 15th, defendant entered' a rule to set aside and quash the foreign attachment, which rule was, on July 22d, revoked, and defendant on the same day filed an affidavit of defence. On Sept. 18th, a rule was taken for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which was-made absolute Sept. 23d, and damages assessed. On Nov. 20th,. a fi. fa. was issued against the real estate attached, and the garnishee, on Dec. 1st, entered a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be set aside and the fi. fa. quashed. On the hearing of the rule, Dec. 23, 1893, the court permitted the-rule to be amended by adding \u201cforeign attachment quashed and return set aside,\u201d and the rule as thus amended was, on Dec. 28, 1893, discharged. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was discharge of rule (a) to quash \u2019 return to-foreign attachment; (T) to set aside and quash foreign attachment ; (c) to set aside judgment entered for want of sufficient affidavit of defence; (ci) to quash fi. fa.\nJames Rich Grrier, for appellant.\nA scire facias should have-been issued, and the amount of damages ascertained by a jury: Strock v.
