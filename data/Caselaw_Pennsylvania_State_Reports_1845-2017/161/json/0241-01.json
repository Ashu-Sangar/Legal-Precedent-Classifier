        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nTo entitle a plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidavit of defence, or for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, the statement of his demand under the act of May 25, 1887, must be self-sustaining; that is to say, it must set forth in clear and concise terms a good cause of action, by which is meant such averments of fact as, if not controverted, would entitle him to a verdict for the amount of his claim. In that respect, there is no substantial difference between a special count in a declaration, under the time-honored system of pleading, and its legislative substitute, \u2014 \u201ca concise statement of the plaintiff\u2019s demand,\u201d etc, as required by the act of 1887. All the essential ingredients of a complete cause of action must affirmatively appear in the statement and exhibits which are made part thereof.\nAs was said in McKinney v. Crawford, 8 S. & R. 351: \u201c In an action by the indorsee against the indorser of a note, the declaration must aver that the note, on becoming due, was duly presented to the maker and that he refused to pa}*-, of which the defendant had notice.\u201d The liability of the drawer or indorser of a bill of exchange or the indorser of a promissory note is only secondary. It depends on due presentation to the maker, demand of payment at the proper time and place, and notice of dishonor. These are necessary conditions or ingredients of an indorser\u2019s absolute liability, unless waived by him; and a distinct averment of one or the other is essential to a good statement of \u201c demand \u201d under the act. The statement in this case contains neither. True, it speaks of \u201c costs of protest two dollars and five cents,\u201d from which it might be inferred that the note in suit was protested for nonpayment; but when or how it was protested, whether at maturity or on the eve of bringing suit, etc., we are not informed. Averments that are essential to a complete, self-sustaining statement of demand must be so clear, distinct and positive that resort to anything like mere inference will be unnecessary.\nIt follows that the plaintiff\u2019s statement in this case is fatally defective; and without reference to any of the averments of the affidavit of defence, it is not in a position to demand judgment.\nBut, waiving all that, the defendant in his affidavit avers in substance that no consideration was paid either by the maker of the note in suit, or by the plaintiff bank; that the latter \u201c paid nothing either for or on account of said note to any one,\u201d but is a mere transferee without value, and holds the same merely for collection for account of De Saville, the maker, who is indebted to defendant \u201cin large sums of money much in excess of the amount of said note.\u201d For present purposes, we must assume that these averments of fact are true. If so, they constitute a good prima facie defence to the note in the hands of plaintiff bank.\nJudgment reversed, and record remitted with a procedendo.",

J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nReversed.\nAssumpsit by indorsee against indorser.\nPlaintiff\u2019s statement was as follows:\n\u201cThe above action is brought to recover the sum of two thousand and five hundred dollars, being the amount of a certain promissory note dated May 1, 1893, and payable ninety days after date, made by one W. W. De Seville to the order of himself and by the said W. W. De Saville and the defendant indorsed, together with interest thereon from August 2, 1893, and costs of protest two dollars and five cents. Said note was received by the plaintiff in the regular course of business before maturity and for a valuable consideration. [Here follows copy of note with indorsements.]\n\u201c Plaintiff further avers that the above amount, to wit, two thousand and five hundred dollars, with interest and costs of protest as stated, is justly due and payable to the plaintiff from and by the defendant.\u201d\nThe affidavit of defence averred :\n\u201c That the said note sued upon grew out of the following transaction : One W. W. De Saville made his certain promissory note, dated January 28, 1893, payable three months after date to the order of himself, and procured this deponent\u2019s indorsement of the same, without any consideration therefor, and placed the same at The Chestnut Street National Bank, the plaintiff in this suit, for collection. \u25a0 That when the said note matured, the said De Saville having no means of his own to pay the same, requested affiant to pay it, whereupon affiant not being in a position to pay that amount, paid one half of the said note which was delivered to him, affiant, and another note, to wit, the one sued upon, was given by the said De Saville and indorsed by this affiant. That no consideration was paid either by the said De Saville or by the said bank to affiant for this note. That the said plaintiffs paid nothing either for or on account of said note to any one, and they are mere transferees without value, and hold the same merely for collection of the said De Saville, who is indebted to affiant in large sums of money, much in excess of the amount of said note.\n\u201c That for a further defence this affiant alleges that no notice of protest was given him by plaintiffs or their agent of the nonpayment of said note, at the time of its maturity, nor did he receive any notice at the time of said maturity of its nonpayment, although a' resident of the city of Philadelphia, having an office within seven or eight squares of said Chestnut Street Bank, to wit: at No. 1414 South Penn square in the city aforesaid.\u201d\nRule for judgment absolute.
