    "head_matter": "Citizens Passenger Ry. v. East Harrisburg Passenger Ry., Appellant.\nAppeals \u2014 Supersedeas\u2014Railroads\u2014Grossings.\nWhere an appeal has been regularly taken from a decree of the court of common pleas, regulating the crossing of one railroad by another, without any special order of the lower court, and recognizance conditioned to prosecute the appeal with effect has been given by appellant, and approved by the court, the appeal operates as a supersedeas of all proceedings by the plaintiff company.\nArgued March 31, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 17, May T., 1894, by defendant, from decree of C. P. Dauphin Co., No. 178, Equity Docket.\nBefore Stebbett, C. J., Gbeen,. Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nMotion for rule to show cause why appeal should not be declared supersedeas, and restraining order be issued.\nFrom the record it appeared that on Aug. 28, 1893, plaintiff company filed a bill in equity praying the court for a decree to permit them to construct a crossing over the tracks of defendant company. After answer filed, and submission to a master, the court entered a decree permitting the crossing to be made. Defendant company took its appeal Feb. 24,1894, entered into recognizance in the sum of $8,000, which was the amount fixed by the court, \u201c conditioned to prosecute its appeal with effect, and, if the decree be affirmed or the appeal be discontinued or nonprossed, to pay all debts, damages and costs adjudged accruing upon such appeal, and all other damages and costs that might be awarded upon such appeal,\u201d and a writ of certiorari was duly issued thereon from the Supreme Court.\nOn March 2, 1894, notice of the talcing of that appeal and the entering of said recognizance was given in writing to plaintiff company. On March 5, 1894, plaintiff company gave notice that it would on March 15, 1894, proceed to construct its crossing over the lines of tracks of defendant company on Front street, at Adams street, in the borough of Steelton, and, to prevent this, defendant company filed its petition for an order, declaring the appeal in the case to be a supersedeas, and to restrain plaintiff company from proceeding to construct said crossing until defendant\u2019s appeal should be decided and the record remitted to the lower court.\nLyman D. Gilbert and Louis M. Hall, John H. Weiss, F. Jordan and Wolfe & Bailey with them, for appellant.\nAn appeal lies to this court from the decree of the court of common pleas of Dauphin county sitting in equity: Acts of June 16, 1836, P. L. 789; Feb. 14, 1857, P. L. 39; April 21, 1846, P. L. 432; Pittsburg & Connellsville R. R. v. South West P. Ry., 77 Pa. 173 ; Cornwall & Lebanon R. R., 125 Pa. 232; Perry Co. R. R. v. R. R., 150 Pa. 193; Pa. R. R. v. Braddock El. Ry., 152 Pa. 116.\nThe appeal taken is a supersedeas: New Brighton R. R. Co.\u2019s Ap., 105 Pa. 13; Acts of March 29, 1832, P. L. 213; May 19, 1874, P. L. 207; March 17, 1845, P. L. 158.\nEven if the appeal was not a supersedeas the special circumstances of this case justify the granting of the order prayed for by appellant: Acts of June 16, 1836, P. L. 787; May 14, 1889, P. L. 211; Perry Co. R. R. v. R. R., 150 Pa. 193; Pa. R. R. v. Braddock El. Ry., 152 Pa. 115.\nC. H. Bergner, J. C. Durbin with him, for appellee,\ncited: Acts of June 19, 1871, P.
