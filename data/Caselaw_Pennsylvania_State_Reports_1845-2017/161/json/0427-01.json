J., Green, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nThe auditor, W. Trickett, Esq., reported as follows:\n\u201c1. George Klippinger died Feb. 22, 1843, testate, seized of certain real estate. Two children survived him, and, but for the will, would have been his only heirs, viz.: Sophia, intermarried with Joseph Cressler, and Elizabeth, intermarried with John H.' Cressler.\n\u201c 2. The will of George Klippinger directed, inter alia, that his executors should, within five years from his death, cause the real estate of which he died seized to be divided into two equal parts by the appointment for that purpose of five or seven suitable men, and ordered that the purparts should be allotted by them to the devisees, and declared that the \u201c division, valuation and allotment \u201d should be final.\n\u201c 3. Pursuant to this direction of the will, five persons were appointed on March 12,1844; and on March 23,1844, the persons so appointed made a division of the land into two parts, one containing 237 acres and 144^ perches, which they allotted to Elizabeth Cressler, the other containing 297 acres and 144^ perches, which they allotted to Joseph Cressler and Sophia, his wife. They valued each of these purparts at $7,600.\n\u201c 4. Elizabeth Cressler took possession of her purpart, retaining it without alienation till her death, which occurred on Monday, Feb. 20,1888. She died testate, and there survived her, of nine children who had been born to her, Daniel Cressler, George W. Cressler, Susan E., wife of H. C. Bomberger. Her daughter Victoria, married to David Griffith, had died Aug. 24,1870, leaving to survive her a son John, who is still alive, and her husband, David.\n\u201c5. At the time of the writing and. probate of George Klippinger\u2019s will, his daughter Elizabeth had four children [three of them since deceased]. After the death of George Klippinger there were born to Elizabeth [four more children, three of them since deceased].\n\u201c 6. On Oct. 20,1885, an inquisition finding Mrs. Elizabeth Cressler a lunatic was confirmed by the court of common pleas of Cumberland county, and Alexander Bishop was appointed her committee. At this time Alexander Bishop occupied the land of Elizabeth Cressler, derived from her father George Klippinger, and he has remained a tenant thereof to this time, farming on shares since her death.\n\u201c 7. The will of George Klippinger contains the following:\n\u20181 give and devise unto my daughter Elizabeth (intermarried with John H. Cressler) for the support of herself and her children, one moiety of my plantation and tract of land situate in Southampton township above mentioned, with the appurtenances, containing about 500 acres of land.\u2019 Immediately following is a devise \u2018 unto my son-in-law, Joseph Cressler and to my daughter, Sophia, his wife, and to their heirs, the other moiety of my plantation and tract of land above mentioned.\u2019 Then follows a direction that, while the real estate remains undivided, and undisposed of, \u2018my executors, hereinafter named, shall, in each and every year from the time of my decease, pay unto my said daughter Elizabeth, or, in the event of her death, to the use of her children, the one half of the clear yearly proceeds of my said real estate above mentioned.\u2019 Then follows a direction to the executors to have the real estate divided within five years from the testator\u2019s death into two equal parts, the appraisers to \u2018 allot to each their respective part or share.\u2019 Following this is: \u2018I desire further, that should my said exec-' utors think it advisable and for the interest of my said daughter Elizabeth and her children to dispose of her share or part of my said tract of land, with the other moiety of the same or separately, I do hereby authorize and empower them so to do, either at public or private sale and in part or in whole, and to execute and deliver such conveyance as will be necessary to pass the title to such purchaser or purchasers for the same, and the proceeds of such sale or sales to be by them, my said executors, safely invested in other real property, or loaned out upon interest, where the same will he safe, and the yearly interest thereof be punctually applied to the use of my said daughter Elizabeth and her children.\u2019 After this comes: \u2018and as touching all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, of whatever kind or nature soever the same may be, I give and devise the same unto my daughter Elizabeth and to her children, and to my son-in-law Joseph Cressler and his wife Sophia and their children share and share alike.\u2019\n\u201c 8. The will of Elizabeth Cressler provides: \u2018 First. I direct that all proper privileges, rights and claims honestly and justly belonging to my said husband John H. Cressler shall be duly respected and allowed so far as they affect my estate. Subject to this, I direct that all my estate of whatsoever kind or description shall he divided equally between my children share and share alike, subject however to the after provisions of this my will. The lineal descendants of any child, however, either now dead or who may hereafter die in my lifetime, always to stand in the place of the parent and to receive the proper proportion.\n\u201c \u2018 Second. I direct, at the death of my said husband, that my real estate of every kind and description and however held and wherever situated, shall be sold and the proceeds divided as I have above directed.\n\u201c \u2018 Third. As to any interest and estate which my son Daniel may take under this my will, I direct the same to be held by my executor .... in trust, the interest and income thereof to be paid to said Daniel. . . .\n\u201c\u2018Fourth. As to the share of my grandson, John M. Griffith\u2019 ... .\n\u201cThe will appointed the testatrix\u2019s husband, John H. Cressler, executor. He dying before his wife the present administrators c. t. a. were appointed.\n\u201c9. To No. 11 Jan. T., 1867, F. Grove & Co. recovered a judgment in the court of common pleas of Cumberland county against Daniel Cressler & Co. for $447.04. On an alias.fi. fa. issued Aug. 23, 1871, upon this judgment, a levy was made upon the interest of Daniel Cressler and, on an alias venditioni exponas, issued Jan. 24, 1872, the sheriff sold this interest to Charles E. Maglaughlin for $10.00. P. New, formerly of the firm of F. Grove & Co., had, as a new firm of P. New & Co., become owner of the property of F. Grove & Co. (Grove retiring), and Charles E. Maglaughlin, as attorney for P. New & Co., caused the executions aforesaid to issue and purchased the interest of Daniel Cressler for them, holding it as a trustee for them. P. New & Co. paid the costs of the execution and sheriff\u2019s sale and also the purchase money bid at the sale. Ample and distinct admission by Mr. Maglaughlin that he had bought the interest and was holding it for P. New & Co. is in writing signed by Mr. Maglaughlin. In a letter dated May 14, 1873, to P. New & Co., Mr. Maglaughlin says: \u2018 Then I levied upon what I believe to be an interest of Cressler in a valuable farm left by his grandfather. This interest (if it is an interest in the land) is worth several thousand dollars. After some negotiation about arranging the claim, which Cressler subsequently declined to make any effort to fix, I sold this interest in land at sheriff\u2019s sale and bought it in myself for ten dollars. . . . Whatever title this sheriff\u2019s sale conveyed is held by me for your benefit, and 1 really believe that the sale did convey a substantial title to an interest which will bq worth at the death of Cressler\u2019s mother (an old and feeble woman) $1,500 or $2,000. . . . Of course the costs arising on the suit and from the executions are a legal claim against you as the plaintiff in the case, and as having been incurred on your behalf.\u2019 On May 20, 1873, P. New & Co. drew and sent their check payable to the order of J. K. Foreman for $71.36, on which the sheriff, Foreman, ob-. tained the money. On March 27, 1885, P. New, trading as P. New & Co., Peter New and Regina his wife, by deed conveyed to Christian Long'of Shippensburg all the undivided interest of Daniel Cressler, which Charles E. Maglaughlin as the attorney of P. New & Co. had purchased for them. Charles E. Maglaughlin, married Feb. 24,1863, and had two children: Wilmer K., born Dec. 25, 1864, and Maud L., bom Feb. 20, 1867. Mr. Maglaughlin died intestate April 29, 1874, leaving to survive him these two children and a widow, all of whom are still alive. . . .\n\u201c 24. There are exceptions to the account of the administrators c. t. a. of Elizabeth Cressler. The first alleges that certain debits should not appear in the account because they are not proper charges, \u2018 being the proceeds of grain raised on real estate not belonging to Elizabeth Cressler,\u2019 which the said administrators had no right to receive and which belonged to other parties under the will of George Klippinger, deceased. The second exception denies the right of the administrators to \u2018meddle \u2019 with the real estate or its proceeds. The third exception denies the right to credits in so far as they consume the amounts with which the administrators are debited, to which debits the first raises exception.\n\u201c It was agreed however, before the auditor, that he should consider the question of title to the land and award the proceeds of it to the persons found to be its owners.\n\u201c CONCLUSIONS OB\u2019 LAW.\n\u201c 1. Under the will of George Klippinger, Elizabeth Cressler took a fee in the land devised ; Elizabeth continuing to own it till her death, it passed by her will.\n\u201c 2. The sheriff\u2019s sale of Daniel\u2019s hypothetical interest as land, in 1872, sixteen years before Elizabeth Cressler\u2019s death, passed no interest. If it had, the ostensible purchaser, Charles E. Maglaughlin, would have held the interest as trustee for P. New & Co. and then for Christian Long, grantee of P. New & Co., and this trust would have been enforceable.\n\u201cDISCUSSION OB' LAW.\n\u201c 1. The estate of Elizabeth Cressler under the will of George Klippinger: If the provision in George Klippiuger\u2019s will first quoted stood alone, unqualified by the dispositions in other parts of the will, what estate would it give to Elizabeth ?\n\u201c This will was written in 1843, and is therefore subject to the operation of \u00a7 9 of the act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, that \u2018 all devises of real estate shall pass the whole estate of the testator in the premises devised, although there be no words of inheritance or of perpetuity, unless it appear by a devise over, or by words of limitation, or otherwise, in the will, that the testator intended to devise a less estate : \u2019 2 Bright. Purd. 1711, pi. 10. The testator having a fee, he would be considered as disposing of it in this clause. To whom ? The gift is \u2018 to my daughter Elizabeth.\u2019 Prima facie, then, the fee is given to her. Does the testator\u2019s expression of the inducement to make the devise, of the end which he believed and desired the devisee to be able to accomplish by it, reduce or qualify the estate ? This end is \u2018 the shpport of herself and her children.\u2019 The purpose in almost every devise is that the land shall contribute to the support of the devisee, and, if he or she has children, to the support of such children. Will the expression of this purpose or expectation diminish or modify the estate which, but for it, would unquestionably have passed ? We cannot think so. When a life estate is given to a widow for the \u2018 support of herself and my daughter \u2019 it is not reduced nor affected with a trust for the daughter by this expression of the purpose : Dale v. Dale, 18 Pa. 446 ; Paisley\u2019s Ap., 70 Pa. 153 ; Mazurie\u2019s Est., 132 Pa. 157; Haskins v. Tate, 25 Pa. 249. \u2018We think,\u2019 says Shauswood, J., in 70 Pa. 153, \u2018that the words which express the object for which the devise of the entire property was made to the wife for life, meant to repose that discretion in her, did not vest any present interest in the children as cestuis que trust of any particular share or shares, and in that respect the principles of construction adopted in Pennock\u2019s Estate, 8 Harris, 268, are applicable.\u2019\n\u201c If the bestowal of a life estate upon a mother for the support of the children creates no trust affecting that life estate, it is impossible to see how the bestowal of what would, but for the expression of the purpose to provide a support for children, be a fee, becomes a trust because of such expression. In one case the life estate is given to the mother for the support of herself and her children, but the children do not thus become equitable or legal co-owners ; in the other case the fee is given to the mother for the support of herself and her children ; how do they become legal or equitable co-owners ? If it is possible to give an estate of a certain magnitude (e. g., a life estate) for such purpose without making the designed beneficiaries co-owners, is it not possible to give a still larger estate (e. g., a fee) for a similar purpose with a similar exclusion of co-ownership? The expression of a desire or expectation will not convert a devise into a trust unless ic appears that the testator intended not to commit the estate to the discretion of the devisee : Good v. Fichthorn, 144 Pa. 289 ; Burt v. Herron, 66 Pa. 400; Hopkins v. Glunt, 111 Pa. 287; Bowlby v. Thunder, 105 Pa. 173.\n\u201c Nor are we able to persuade ourselves that a legal life estate was given to Elizabeth Cressler and a legal remainder to her children. Had the devise been to Elizabeth and her children and had she had no children, the rule in Will\u2019s Case might have operated, Elizabeth taking a fee tail converted by statute into a fee simple : Will\u2019s Case, 6 Rep. IT; see Cote v. Bonnhorst, 41 Pa. 243 ; 2 Jarman, Wills, 39 (Little, Brown & Co.\u2019s ed. of 1881). But as Elizabeth had children this rule is not applicable. The principle has been recognized that a devise to a mother and her children, of whom she has some when the devise is made, constitutes them tenants in common : Will\u2019s Case, 6 Rep. 17 ; Graham v. Flower^ 13 S. & R. 439 ; McKeehan v. Wilson, 53 Pa. 74. Similarly a conveyance between W. and S. \u2018 in trust for herself and her children,\u2019 granting unto the said S. \u2018 in trust for herself and her children and unto their heirs and assigns,\u2019 made the ten children and S. tenants in common, each taking an eleventh : Shirloek v. Shirlock, 5 Pa. 367. But as the devise of George Klippinger is not to Elizabeth and her children, nor to Elizabeth in trust for her children, the words \u2018 for the support,\u2019 etc., not making a trust, the hypothesis of a cotenancy between Elizabeth and the children is excluded. That successive estates were given to them finds no warrant in the testamentary language already cited.\n\u201c Following the devise already quoted, the testator\u2019s words are: \u2018 I give and devise unto my son-in-law, Joseph Cressler, and to my daughter Sophia, his wife and to their heirs the other moiety of my plantation and tract of land above mentioned.\u2019 The testator then orders that so long as his real estate remains undivided and undisposed of, \u2018my executors . . . . shall in each and every year from the time of my decease pay unto my said daughter Elizabeth, or in the event of her death to the use of her children, the one half of the clear yearly proceeds of my said real estate above mentioned.\u2019\n\u201c\u2018In the' event of her death\u2019 may possibly refer to death before the testator, Caldwell v. Skilton, 13 Pa. 152; Fahrney v. Holsinger, 65 Pa. 388; Stevenson v. Fox, 125 Pa. 568; King v. Frick, 135 Pa. 575; McCullough v. Fenton, 65 Pa. 418, 428; Karker\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 141; Mickley\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 514; or it may mean death before the division of the estate. If the latter, it may have been predicated on the assumption that Elizabeth would not before that time have aliened the land or that she should not have the power to alien it. A restraint on alienation during life after a fee is given is void: Williams v. Leech, 28 Pa. 89; Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 33 Pa. 89; Jauretche v. Proctor, 48 Pa. 466; McWilliams v. Nisly, 2 S. & R. 513. Even if we infer an intended restraint on alienation during the five years, we cannot find in this provision, operative in fact for slightly more than one year only, in favor of children, sufficient to justify the construction that only a life estate is given to Elizabeth.\nAfter the clause just commented upon, is a direction to the executors to cause a partition of the land into two equal parts. This power of partition by arbiters is not inconsistent with the existence of a fee in the devisees. Lebling\u2019s Estate, 27 W. N. 161. It operates upon the interest of Joseph Cressler and his wife Sophia, and their heirs, which is unquestionably a fee simple.\nThe clause following the provision for partition contains (1) a power of sale in the executors; (2) a power and duty to invest the proceeds of Elizabeth\u2019s half. Do these or either of them coerce the conclusion that Elizabeth takes but a life estate ?\n\u201c The power to sell is not limited to Elizabeth\u2019s part. The executors may sell her half \u2018 with the other moiety of the same or separately.\u2019 This could not have meant that, after the partition already provided for, the part allotted to Joseph and his wife could be sold along with that allotted to Elizabeth. But prior to such partition the power extended to the sale of both purparts. Now it is undisputed and we think indisputable that Joseph and wife take a fee. If then the power to sell is not inconsistent with their fee it- is not inconsistent with a fee in Elizabeth. Besides the presence of a power of sale is no more consonant with a fee in remainder (e. g., in Elizabeth\u2019s children) than with a fee in possession in Elizabeth.\n\u201c The trust in the executors is a trust affecting the proceeds. It begins to operate only in ease the power to sell is exercised. On conversion the executors are to safely invest the proceeds in other land or loan them out upon interest. When the proceeds are reinvested in land the trust ipso facto terminates. It continues only when they are put out at interest. In that case the yearly interest is to be punctually applied to \u2018 the use of my said daughter Elizabeth and her children.\u2019 How long ? Dur\u25a0ing Elizabeth\u2019s life ? During the children\u2019s lives ? It does not appear that it is to last during Elizabeth\u2019s life only. Yet it cannot go on indefinitely. Some of the children of Elizabeth were not born when this will went into effect. Is a trust created, despite the principle of the rule against perpetuities, for these lives not in being ?\n\u201c At all events we do not feel warranted in deducing, from the creation of a trust for Elizabeth and her children whose duration is vague, under which the relative rights of Elizabeth and her children are obscure, and whose rise into operation is dependent on a discretion of the executors which has never been exercised, the inference that the Klippinger will created in Elizabeth an estate less than a fee simple.\n\u201c It may be worth while to note that in the last quoted clause the share of which the executors are authorized to dispose is termed \u2018 her \u2019 (Elizabeth\u2019s) share. In the residuary clause of the will the testator gives the remainder of his estate \u2018 unto my daughter Elizabeth and to her children and to my son-in-law Joseph Cressler and his wife Sophia and their children, share and share alike.\u2019 He surely intended not a per capita division between all these persons, but a division into two parts, one for Elizabeth and her children, the other for Joseph Cressler and wife and their children. It is difficult to suppose, in the absence of conceivable motive, that the testator intended to make the children tenants in common with the parents of the residuary property or to restrict the interest of the parents in this property to a life estate and limit upon it a remainder to the children, while he plainly gave the fee to Joseph Cressler and his wife Sophia in the clause above quoted. The grouping of the children with the parents seems to have been loosely done with no intention to give them a legal interest in the property.\n\u201c In a case of doubt as to the estate given it is necessary to remember the rules concerning the bias of the courts in the construction of wills. \u2018 In ease of doubtful construction,\u2019 says LowrIe, J., \u2018 the law leans in favor of an absolute, rather than a defeasible estate; .... of the first rather than the second taker as the principal object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and of a distribution as nearly conformed to the general rules of inheritance as possible: \u2019 Smith\u2019s Ap., 28 Pa. 9. \u2018 The first taker is always,\u2019 says Sharswood, C. J., \u2018 the first object of the testator\u2019s bounty and his absolute estate is not to be cut down to an estate for life .... without clear evidence of such an intent: \u2019 Mickley\u2019s Ap., 92 Pa. 514; King v. Frick, 135 Pa. 575; Stevenson v. Fox, 125 Pa. 568; Fitzwater\u2019s Ap., 94 Pa. 141.\n\u201c Elizabeth Cressler was the daughter of the testator. Though she had at his death four children, of whom two died after-wards, before her and without issue, she had several born after his death, whom he had consequently never seen. There is an appreciable presumption against the testator\u2019s intending to give the fee to these children, born and unborn, in preference to his own daughter.\n\u201cWe conclude that Elizabeth Cressler takes a fee in the land devised to her.\nDaniel Cressler\u2019s Interest: \u201c The sheriff\u2019s sale of Daniel Cressler\u2019s share in the land, on an alias venditioni exponas, conveyed to the purchaser, Charles Maglaughlin or his cestui que trust, no title. When that sale occurred Daniel had. no title in the land. It was his mother\u2019s. Even had it taken place after his mother\u2019s death it would have conveyed no interest, for her will converted the land into personalty and gave Daniel the interest of his share of the principal for his life, so as not to be liable for his debts. Had a title been acquired by Charles Maglaughlin it would have been simply as trustee for his client, P. New & Co. The purchase money was, at Mr. Maglaughlin\u2019s request, and on his assertion in writing that he had bought for the client, paid to the sheriff by the latter. The act of April 22, 1856, \u00a7 6, P. L. 533, forbids the enforcing of any resulting trust (which this was) beyond five years from the accruing of such trust \u2018 with the right of entry.\u2019 But as, if Mrs. Cressler had only a life estate, the right of entry did not accrue to P. New & Co. or to Maglaughlin till her death in 1888, this limitation would not apply. Charles Maglaughlin was not in possession nor was he otherwise enforcing any pretended rights as against Daniel Cressler or P. New & Co. until 1888. The latter could not have maintained ejectment. Even under the act of 1856 we think P. New & Co. could enforce the trust as against Charles Maglaughlin, but the act of 1856 is repealed with respect to attorneys at law by that of March 27,1865, P. L. 56. Though this act does not apply to a purchaser from an attorney having no notice of the trust, Barret v. Bamber, 81 Pa. 247, an heir or devisee of such attorney, not being a purchaser for value, would be incapable of claiming the immunity of a purchaser. The trust in Charles Maglaughlin, which is' clearly enough admitted by him in writing, is enforceable against him and his widow and heirs. But for reasons stated above, no title passed to Charles Maglaughlin, or to P. New & Co. or to C. Long, P. New & Co.\u2019s grantee.\u201d\nExceptions 'filed by both parties appellants were dismissed by the court in the following opinion by Sadler, P. J.:\n\u201cWe find no just reason to complain of the findings of fact made by the auditor nor of the conclusions of law at which he has arrived. If the devise of land by George Klippinger to his daughter is uncertain as to its meaning, it was proper for the auditor to determine as he did. The devise of the one moiety of the land of the testator was to his \u2018 daughter Elizabeth.\u2019 One half of his residuary estate was bequeathed to her; and the same manner is used as in the bequest of the other half to his daughter Sophia and her husband, Joseph Cressler. Provision was made for the partition of the land, in which contingency \u2018 each \u2019 was to be allotted a \u2018 part or share.\u2019\n\u201c In so far as the distribution of the balance in the hands of the accountants is concerned, there can be no doubt about the jurisdiction of the court or the authority of the auditor appointed by it to determine who are entitled to it. To do this according to law, it became necessary to find in whom the title of the land was. All parties were before the auditor in person or by counsel and made claim to participate in the distribution. It does not appear that any objection was made during the hearings before the auditor that there was no power in the orphans\u2019 court to dispose of the questions which arose before the auditor.\n\u201cWe are well satisfied that the purchase made by C. E. Maglaughlin, Esq., now deceased, was for his clients, and that he took and held the same in trust for them, to wit, P. New & Co. The determination of the auditor is in accordance with the facts and the law applicable thereto.\u201d\nErrors assigned were dismissal of exceptions to auditor\u2019s report, quoting them.\nE. W.
