L. 777, is equivalent to a notice to the sheriff.\nIf the assignee agrees to protect the landlord \u201c to the same extent as he could be protected by a landlord\u2019s warrant,\u201d the landlord can be preferred only to the extent of one year\u2019s rent.\nArgued April 25, 1894.\nAppeals, No. 346, Jan. T., 1894, and No. 44, July T., 1894, by A. P. Leidich and S. M. Leidich, individually, and as trustees of M. G. Leidich, and by John Irvine, from decree of C. P. Cumberland Co., Nov. T., 1889, No. 85, dismissing exceptions to report of auditor appointed to distribute the assigned estate of D. J. Leidich and Upton Birnie, trading as Leidich & Birnie.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report'of E. B. Watts, Esq., auditor.\nThe following opinion was filed by Sadler, P. J.:\n\u201c Leidich & Birnie were engaged in the dry goods business in the borough of Carlisle for some years prior to Feb. 10,1888. They occupied as tenants a storeroom belonging to John Irvine, Esq. On the day and year aforesaid a judgment was recovered against the defendants for $16,890, and an execution issued thereon, and the stock of merchandise belonging to the said firm levied upon. On two other judgments recovered on the same day writs of fieri facias were also issued and levies made.\n\u201c An assignment was then made by the firm aforesaid for the benefit of creditors. The annual rent of the storeroom was $650, and there was due Mr. Irvine on the day the executions issued a balance of $1,006.64. The assignees, the execution creditors and the sheriff entered into an agreement by which it was provided that the assignees should sell the property levied upon and turn over the proceeds to the sheriff.\n\u201c Mr. Irvine was not a party to this arrangement, nor does it appear that he had made any claim to the sheriff for rent under the act of 1836.\n\u201c The assignees agreed with Mr. Irvine that they \u2018 would protect him to the same extent as he could be protected by a landlord\u2019s warrant.\u2019 The auditor came to the conclusion that the arrangement between the sheriff, the execution creditors and the assignees was, \u2018 in so far as the landlord was concerned, a stay of proceedings upon the executions, and placed the landlord in a position to distrain for all the rent.\u2019\n\u201c There was no finding that the arrangement aforesaid was done to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. It does not appear to have even been contended before him that the utmost good faith was not intended. The manifest desire of the parties was to dispose of the property levied upon to the best advantage and realize from it the largest sum possible. That this was a lawful and proper agreement and did not release the lien as to subsequent execution or other creditors, has been settled in Kent, Santee & Co.\u2019s Ap., 87 Pa. 165, and other cases.\n\u201c As a matter of course, under the act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 777, the landlord could have notified the sheriff of his claim for rent, and the execution then could not be stayed without his consent in writing, but he did not give such notice nor was there any stay of the execution.\n\u201c The assignees became the agents of the sheriff to sell the property taken in execution, but the lien of the levy remained. The property was not the subject of distress for rent. \"The landlord could be preferred to the extent of one year\u2019s rent bjr giving notice to the sheriff or his agents before the sale, but to no greater extent. The goods not being the subject of distress, the assignees could not interfere with the rights of the execution creditors by promising to pay Mr. Irvine a greater sum of rent than accrued in one year. They stood in the place of the sheriff as to the disposition of the property levied upon. It was held in Osborne\u2019s Estate, 5 Wharton, p. 266, that the promise of assignees t\u00ae secure a landlord for rent, \u2018 if he would waive his right to distrain and permit the removal of the goods,\u2019 was valid and binding. But that case is not analogous to the one under consideration. The goods had not been seized in execution. The landlord was free to issue his warrant and distrain the property. To induce him to refrain, the agreement was made and properly enforced. In Work\u2019s Appeal, 92 Pa. 258, there was a stay of the writ by the plaintiff and possession given to the defendant to sell the goods levied upon. The sheriff received no part of the proceeds of sale except the costs on the suit. He treated the directions given him by the plaintiff in the execution as a stay of the writ and so acted.\n\u201cWe are well satisfied that in the present case the landlord cannot take more than one year\u2019s rent out of the proceeds of the sale.\n\u201c Ca,n he take this sum ? His right to do so is denied by the execution creditors on the ground that he made no demand upon the sheriff. But the sheriff had delegated the sale of the goods to the assignees. They acted for him. They were in effect his\nMay 7, 1894:\ndeputies or agents. Notice to them would be as effective as a notice to him. Mr. Irvine evidently did make a demand upon them for the rent due him, and acquainted them with the amount of his claim. They paid him two hundred dollars on account of the same. They promised to protect him as to the balance to the same extent that he could be by a landlord\u2019s warrant. The fact that he demanded more than the rent for one year did not debar him from recovering what he was entitled to under the act of assembly. The goods in the hands of the sheriff or his representatives were liable first to the payment of one year\u2019s rental, and this amount must be appropriated to the landlord out of the proceeds realized from the sale thereof.\u201d\nErrors assigned by A. M. Leidich, appellant, were dismissing their exceptions, and allowing landlord any rent whatever.\nError assigned by John Irvine, appellant, was decree of court, modifying auditor\u2019s report.\nS.
