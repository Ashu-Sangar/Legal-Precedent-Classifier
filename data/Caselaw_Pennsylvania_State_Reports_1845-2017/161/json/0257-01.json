        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThomas Anderson obtained insurance upon his own life in the company defendant in 1890. In 1891 he transferred his policies to Anthony J. Clifford as collateral security for certain debts due by him to Clifford. A few months later Anderson died. Letters of administration upon his estate were obtained by Clifford, his creditor, who thereupon brought this suit. The defence taken is that Clifford holds these policies as the assignee of the decedent and not as his administrator, and for this reason we are asked to overturn the judgment.\nThe court below had, as we now have, ample power to allow such amendment as may be necessary to protect the defendant from further liability on this policy. We are by no means sure that any amendment is needed, but as the plaintiff asks to be allowed to describe himself as also the assignee of Anderson, and as such amendment will remove any possible objection to the judgment, we will allow the amendment and affirm the judgment.",

T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., March T., 1893, No. 32, on verdict for plaintiff, Anthony J. Clifford, administrator of Thomas Anderson, deceased.\nBefore Willtams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.'\nAssumpsit on policy of life insurance. Before Lynch, J.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nDefendant\u2019s points were as follows :\n\u201c 1. Thomas Anderson having assigned and set over unto Anthony J. Clifford, by assignment dated Oct. 29,1891, all his right, title and interest in and to the policies offered in evidence, as collateral security for the payment of the judgment No. 227, Dee. term, 1891, and the testimony showing that said judgment remains open and unpaid, the estate of Thomas Anderson had no interest in said policies at the time of his death; and the debt remaining unpaid the estate has acquired none since, it not having been shown that the estate is solvent; therefore the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: Refused, but if you believe the evidence, the verdict should be for plaintiff.\u201d [1]\nApril 23, 1894:\n2. Request for binding instructions. Refused as above. [2]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2) above instructions, quoting them.\nThe court gave appellee permission to file of record a statement of the fact that the assignee and the administrator were one and the same person.\nE.
