    "head_matter": "Ritter, Appellant, v. Getz.\nSheriff's sale \u2014 Setting aside sale \u2014 Discretion of court.\nWhere an application to set aside a sheriff\u2019s sale is made immediately after the sale, and before the acknowledgment of the deed, and the price is grossly inadequate, the court is at liberty to seize upon any other circumstance in order to give relief.\nIn such a case the court is justified in taking into consideration the fact that a rule to stay the writ was pending, and that the defendant and certain persons who expected to bid, by reason of the rule, either did not attend the sale, or did not prepare themselves to bid.\nArgued May 9, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 454, Jan. T., 1894, by plaintiff, James R. Ritter, from order of C. P. Union Co., March T., 1892, No. 133, making absolute rule to set aside sheriff\u2019s sale.\nBefore Green, Williams, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to set aside sheriff\u2019s sale.\nThe following opinion was filed by McClure, P. J.:\n\u201c Justice Woodward in Swires v. Brotherline et al., 41 Pa. 135, says that \u2018 courts having control of writs of execution do sometimes treat gross inadequacy of price as a reason for setting aside sales of real estate.\u2019 We know of no case wherein it is held that mere inadequacy of price is sufficient cause for setting aside a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate otherwise regular. See Weaver v. Lyon, 5 Atl. R. 782, where the question was squarely raised. In that case the application was not made until after the acknowledgment of the deed. The rule, however, seems to be the same whether the application be made before or after the acknowledgment. \u2018Property lawfully exposed to public sale must take the chances:\u2019 Justice Woodward in Swires v. Brotherline, supra; and Chancellor Green in Cummins v. Little, 16 N. J. Eq. 48, says: \u2018 If mere inadequacy of price were a ground of relief, the principle would act as a stay law.\u2019\n\u201c Where, however,- the price is grossly inadequate, the courts seize hold of any irregularity, misapprehension or circumstance connected with the sale which may tend to diminish the value of the property or to prevent competition among bidders and which, together with the inadequacy, will make a sufficient reason for a resale: Twells v. Conrad, 2 W. N. 80; Ellis v. Bleim, 2 W. N. 290; Whitaker v. Birkey, 2 W. N. 476.\n\u201c The depositions show $100 to be a grossly inadequate price for this property. Subject to the life estate of the widow, now 68 years of age, it is worth probably at a low estimate $1,000. There was a rule pending to stay the writ, issued at the defendant\u2019s instance, on a petition alleging that sufficient funds had been realized from the sale of his father\u2019s property to pay the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and contending that by reason thereof there was no necessity for the sacrifice of his real estate. The argument on this rule, during my absence, was not heard until \u25a0an hour or two before the time fixed for the sale. It was decided immediately against the defendant, the rule was discharged and the sheriff was ordered by the plaintiff to proceed with his writ. The property was struck down to the plaintiff on his bid of $100, the only one made. The depositions show that owing to the pending rule several responsible parties who intended to bid on the property were misled and did not attend the sale, and the defendant himself, no doubt depending upon the success of his application to stay the writ, was not in a position to protect his interests on account of the very brief period between the decision against him and the sale.\n\u201cWe think there was such a misapprehension of the status of the case on the part of the defendant and would-be bidders for the property, and surprise at the result of the application to stay, as, taken in connection with the fact that the price was ridiculously low and grossly inadequate, to warrant our ordering a resale.\n\u201c It is objected on the part of the plaintiff that no bond has been tendered that the property will bring a better price when again put up by the sheriff. A bond is only demanded when there is a doubt as to the price being inadequate : Whitaker v. Pratt, Dist. Ct., Phila., Sept. 16,1848; Troubat & Haley, vol. 1, p. 728, note. If we had any doubts as to the inadequacy or that the property would not bring a greatly enhanced price upon a resale, we could make the decree conditioned upon the filing of a bond. But we have none.\u201d\n\u201c January 26, 1894. Rule absolute at defendant\u2019s costs.\u201d\nJSrror assigned was above order.\nMay 21, 1894:\nJ. C. Bucher, E. M. Beale with him, for appellant,\ncited: Cake v. Cake, 156 Pa. 47; Weaver v. Lyon, 5 Atl. R. 782; Bank v. Bertolet, 1 Woodward, 88; Schwartz v. Weinsheimer, 2 Northampton R. 210; Woods v.
