Rossman et al., Appellants.\nJudgment \u2014 Opening judgment \u2014 Evidence\u2014Practice.\nWhere several persons join in purchasing the contents of a store, and, by direction of the vendor and as part consideration of the sale, give a judgment note to a creditor of the vendor, certain of the persons signing the judgment note cannot allege as a ground for opening the judgment that they joined in the purchase for the purpose of helping a third party who formerly owned the store, and who agreed to run it, and pay the debt represented by the judgment note.\nArgued April 17, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 184, July T., 1894, by defendants, John Rossman et al., from order of C. P. Centre Co., April T., 1888, No. 222, discharging a rule to open judgment entered in favor of Wm. B. Mingle, cashier of the Penns Valley Banking Co.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nRule to open judgment. Before Furst, P. J.\nThe evidence was to the following effect: The Penns Valley Banking Co. purchased the store property of I. J. Grenoble at sheriff\u2019s sale, and afterwards sold it to Henry Krumrine. The latter sold the property to defendants, they agreeing to pay the purchase money due from Krumrine to the bank. Defendants accordingly gave to the bank their judgment note for $6,000, being the note in suit, and the bank received it and credited it on Krumrine\u2019s indebtedness. Judgment was entered upon this note. The petition to open the judgment averred that Grenoble, acting as plaintiff\u2019s agent, procured the transfer of the property to defendants with the agreement that, after the payment of the indebtedness to the bank out of the business, Grenoble should have whatever was left. Plaintiff denied this; and the agreement of sale, which was in writing, showed no such arrangement. The court found that Grenoble acted as agent for defendants in the purchase of the store, and that the bank took the note and applied it to Krumrine\u2019s debt in good faith. The rule was accordingly discharged.\nError assigned was above order.\nApril 30, 1894:\nO. P. PLewes, John Q-. Love with him, for appellants.\nEllis L. Orvis and O. M. Bower, for appellee, not heard."
