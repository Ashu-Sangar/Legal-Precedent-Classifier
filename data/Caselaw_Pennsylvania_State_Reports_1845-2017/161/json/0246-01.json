Wilkes-Barre, Appellant.\nRoad law \u2014 Ghange of grade of Street-Remedy \u2014 Amendment\u2014Act of May 16, 1891 \u2014 Pending actions.\nPlaintiff owned a corner lot. The grade of both adjoining streets was changed in 1887. In 1888, a common law action was brought to recover damages for the change of grade, but only one street was mentioned in the declaration. In 1892, an amendment was allowed so as to include the other street in the declaration. Held, that the act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, which provides that the remedy in such a case shall be by a jury of view, did not prevent the amendment or deprive the court of jurisdiction in this ease.\nArgued April 9, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 1,. Jan. T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., May T., 1888, No. 543, on verdict for plaintiff, John Brady, executor of Margaret Brady, deceased.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for damages caused by a change of grade of streets adjoining plaintiff\u2019s property.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff owned a lot at the corner of Chestnut and Main streets, in the city of Wilkes-Barre. In 1887, the grade of both streets was changed, suit was brought to May term, 1888, and the statement was filed May 28, 1889, claiming damages for change of grade on Chestnut street only. On Jan. 12, 1892, the original statement was amended, extending the claim for damages also for change of grade on Main street.\nVerdict for plaintiff. The defendant filed the following reason in arrest of judgment:\n\u201c That the court and jury had no jurisdiction over the question of damages for change of grade on Main street, because at the time of amendment the only remedy, in the first instance, for the recovery of damages for change of grade on Main street was by proceeding before a jury of view, under the provisions of the act of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75, and that therefore the court and juiy had no jurisdiction over \u2022 the question of damages done by change of grade oh Main street in front of the plaintiff\u2019s premises.\u201d\nJudgment on verdict. Defendant appealed.\nJError assigned was above order.\nWilliam S. McLean, for appellant,\ncited: Acts of May 16, 1891, P. L. 75; March 21, 1806, \u00a7 19, Purd. 59; Koch v.
