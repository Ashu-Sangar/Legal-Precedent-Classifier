    "head_matter": "Andrews v. Fishing Creek Lumber Co. Keeler\u2019s Appeal.\nLoss of auditor's report \u2014 Record\u2014Practice, G. P.\nWhere the report of an auditor, distributing the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale, has been lost after confirmation nisi, the court may inquire into the nature of the report, and determine the validity of the exceptions taken to the distribution proposed, without recommitting the case to the auditor.\nSheriff's sale \u2014 Distribution\u2014Impounding fund \u2014 Practice.\nWhere the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate is in court for distribution, it is not proper practice to impound a portion of the fund to await the trial of a sci. fa. sur mechanic\u2019s lien at some future time.\nArgued April 10, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 223, Jan. T., 1894, by E. Keeler Co., from order of C. P. Columbia Co., Feb. T., 1890, No. 7, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report distributing proceeds of sheriff\u2019s sale of realty.\nThe opinion of court below was as follows by Ikeleb, P. J.:\n\u201c By a number of decisions of the Supreme Court of this state, we are led to the conclusion that the auditor was right in disallowing the claim, or right, of E. Keeler & Co. to have any portion of the fund impounded.\n\u201c Had we the auditor\u2019s report before us, which, on account of its loss, seems impossible at this time, we, no doubt, would be relieved from writing out our reasons, and could simply confirm his report; but, as it is, aud in order to spread the whole ease again upon the record, for consideration of a higher court,, if desired by either party, we briefly cite our reasons and authority for approving the report of the auditor.\n\u201c It is admitted that nothing but the record evidence of the claim was offered before the auditor, and that upon such evidence he was asked to impound, out of the fund for distribution, the sum of eight hundred dollars, which sum was to be held by the court until the final disposition of the said sci. fa. on the mechanic\u2019s lien, by trial in court. Hence, the only question in the case before the auditor, and now before the court, is the right of E. Keeler & Co. to have the said portion of the fund impounded. The fund for distribution arose from a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate, and was paid into court to await distribution through an auditor, to and among lien creditors. The fund in court then stood as to creditors, in the place of the property. Such sale divested all liens. It became the duty of E. Keeler & Co. to make the same proof before the auditor, of their right to preference, or priority of lien, and payment out of, the fund, as they would be required to make on a trial in court on the scire facias sur mechanic\u2019s lien, in order to entitle them to-a judgment there, and in such case in an issue before the auditor, every lien creditor would then and there have had the right to controvert the validity of the lien and claim : See Denkel\u2019sEstate, 1 Pearson, 213; Norris\u2019s Ap., 30 Pa. 122; McCay\u2019s Ap., 37 Pa. 128; Hahn\u2019s Ap., 39 Pa. 413; Field v.Oberteuffer, 2 Phila. 271, and other cases to the same purport. It is even held in the case of McLaughlin v. Smith, 2 Wharton, 122, that where property has been sold upon a judgment before recovered, further proceedings on a scire facias on a mechanic\u2019s lien would be stayed. From the foregoing line of decisions it follows that E. Keeler & Co., not having asked for, or shown cause before the auditor for an issue, and having failed to make, before him, the necessary proof to entitle them to recover anything on their claim, it must fall. Their day in court was the day of the audit. It is not the proper or approved practice to impound a portion of the fund in the situation that this fund was, to await the trial in court on a sci. fa. at some future time. The place and time for the issue to be tried was before the auditor on the day of the audit, and that opportunity having been voluntarily passed by the mechanic\u2019s lien claimant, E. Keeler & Co., the auditor was clearly right in refusing to impound eight hundred dollars of the fund to await the future trial in court of the scire facias on the lien.\nApril 16, 1894:\n\u201c And now, Dec. 4, 1893, the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report are dismissed, and \u00abhis distribution, as testified to and admitted by the parties to have been made by him in his report, is approved, and his report is confirmed absolutely.\u201d\n. Errors assigned were (1) in refusing to refer the case to the auditor for a hearing to enable him to supply the lost record, to wit, the auditor\u2019s report and exceptions thereto, (2) in requiring and directing the argument of the case in the absence of the auditor\u2019s report and exceptions, without having first given parties in interest an opportunity to reproduce the same in a proper manner; (3) in dismissing the exceptions and confirming what the court believed, from the imperfect testimony and brief admissions, to be the auditor\u2019s report.\nC. W. Miller, Candor & Munson with him, for appellant.\nGrant Herring, Henry C. McCormick and Seth T. McCormick for appellee, not heard."
