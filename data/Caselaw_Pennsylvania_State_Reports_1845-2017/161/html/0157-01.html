With the exception of a few trifling provisions, the rights, duties, powers and responsibilities of the officers are left to be defined by the by-laws; in like manner, to them all matters regulating the methods of dealing with the public are confided; and your auditor is clearly of the opinion that such by-laws, when enacted, in so far as they toucli upon the same or kindred matters, become written into the charter: and not only define and limit the rights, duties and powers of the officers inter nos, but so far as those with whom such corporation has dealings are concerned, put such parties upon notice in treating with such officers, as to the extent of their power and agency, whether the specific by-law has been brought home to them or not.</p>

But common sense and reason fortify such conclusions as well. Were this not the case, all stockholders in corporations would be at the mercy and whim of their officers, and those with whom such officers dealt. Necessarily, the corporation must act through its officers. Is the extent of their powers to bind the corporation to be a matter of implication at the will of those who deal with them, ostensibly for the corporation? The question seems to contain its own answer; and to also answer the second position of the claimants, viz.: .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[130,1976,1169,450]]]'>(2) “ That there was implied in the right and duties of the treasurer of a corporation, the right and duty to execute and deliver obligations binding upon the corporation, virtute officii. Your auditor has searched the books in vain for any decided case sustaining such a proposition, and he does not believe that it is sustainable. Not only do the customs of corporations differ radically as to the execution of obligations, but there does not even seem to be anything in the position occupied by a treasurer to give a color of warrant for such a contention.</p>

Such power may be expressly conferred upon him by his constituents, but, until that is done, it should not impliedly extend so far. It is an executive act, and if any implication could carry such power, it should be vested only by implication in the executive head, the president.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[255,1414,1167,758]]]'>“ The fact that, with many corporations, the treasurer creates such obligations, without express authority, and that the public accepts the same as valid, does not strengthen the argument in favor of the implication, but only serves to emphasize the thought that the conduct of corporations is apt to be eminently careless and lawless, and to point the conclusion that the hour has come when a halt should be called upon practices such as these, and the officers of corporations and the public both be made to understand that stockholders, and others interested in corporation existence, have some rights and powers of limitations ; that an officer of a corporation is but an agent with limited authority, and that, in dealing with him as such, the public is bound to inquire into and be guided by the reasonable scope of such authority as defined in the law of his constitution, and as in the case of any other principal or agent.</p>

Upon its face, and at first <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>blush, the position has some strength, but when closely examined, such strength fades away. As before found, none of the claimants, excepting the Spring Garden Bank, had had previous dealings upon similar notes with this corporation, so that the principle of estoppel, which might be invoked under such circumstances, has no application here. As to rights of the Spring Garden Bank, under the facts, they will be considered hereafter.</p>

Such contention appears to the auditor as most specious. It seems to him that it would be as sound an argument to claim that title would pass to an article stolen from one, who had been systematically robbed for years in a similar way and had made no outcry, either ignorantly or willfully, the person claiming having had no previous dealings with the thief or the owner.</p>

That might or might not have been the result. If inquiry had been made, the truth might have come out. But the fact remains that not one of them did make inquiry, or endeavor to ascertain the extent of this agent’s authority to bind his principals. They assumed that he had such authority, and, in your auditor’s opinion, in so assuming, also assumed all the risks attendant thereon, and have no one to blame but themselves.</p>

Its inception and whole existence is technical, and the only protection which its incorporators have consists in the strict and technical enforcement of the laws of the corporation, which are as open to those who choose to deal with it as they are to the stockholders and officers.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[265,945,1176,915]]]'>“ As remarked at the commencement of this discussion, the corporation is purely a statutory creature, with its powers and limitations strictly defined, and this fact is or should be as patent to outsiders dealing with it and its officers, as to the incorporators themselves. In the ordinary business transactions of every day, no one would dream of charging a personal principal with the act of an agent, where his authority was not either expressed or clearly implied from the character of his agency. And where it was or should be known from the nature of his employment that the extent of the agent’s authority must have certain defined limitations, the law casts the burden upon the party seeking to charge the principal of proving the scope of this authority. Such your auditor takes to be the position here. The very fact that the agent is an officer of a corporation, which is required by the statute to have by-laws expressing the extent of his powers, should put all persons dealing with him upon their guard in investigating the extent of his powers. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat.</p>

They dealt, or are considered at law to have dealt, with these officers with their eyes open. They were charged by law with knowledge of this by-law and its consequences, and are' presumed to have known that the notes, to be valid against the corporation, require the president’s countersignature.

That such by-law was valid and subsisting at the time that each of the notes in question was executed, and was not abrogated by the secret practice of such officers in executing obligations in a different manner. [There was no apparent authority conferred upon the treasurer by such secret practice to execute obligations in any other manner which would be binding upon the corporation.] [14] That there is no implied authority in the treasurer of a corporation to execute any obligation binding upon the corporation. And that in this particular case, the parties claimant accepted their notes charged with the notice that the obligations of this corporation, to be valid, required execution in a particular way, and that none of the notes presented were so executed.</p>

[Under such circumstances, the assignor would clearly be estopped from contesting the bank’s claim, were it not for the other controlling fact, that the president of the bank, in accepting these notes for discount, knew them to have been executed in fraud of the assignor, and, indeed, procured their execution for his own purposes mainly.] [10]</p>

Such doctrine would, moreover, open an easy method to defeat honest debts, for a corporation need simply to pass a by-law, then ignore it for years, and then resurrect it against innocent holders of corporate obligations. Such is not the law, and it is well settled:</p>

He held that where the corporation received the <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>benefits of the unauthorized action of its officers it was bound. Also that where a previous course of dealing of the same irregular character had been carried on, a liability arose notwithstanding the unlawful character of the paper, but that where there was no such previous course of dealing no liability arose as to the particular paper in question. And he held that in the case of the Spring Garden National Bank the fraud of its president, in contriving and negotiating the fraudulent paper for his own personal use, was with knowledge of the bank, imputed it is true, but correctly imputed, to his bank, and the paper thus held created no liability on the part of the Cracker Company. In these several findings we concur. None of the authorities cited for the- appellant conflict with these findings where the facts were similar. Without engaging in a protracted discussion, which we think unnecessary, we affirm the decree of the court below substantially for the reasons stated in the report of the auditor.</p>
