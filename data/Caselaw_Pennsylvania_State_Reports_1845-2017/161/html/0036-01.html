I saw a car coming, and I hailed the car and tried to board it. It gave a jerk and I slipped. I went to save myself and caught ahold of the handle, and the step pulled me under, and I hurt my shoulder, and arm, and side, and hip, and my knee. . . . Q. Did you, or did you not, say that the car stopped? A. It did stop. Q. The car stopped? A. It stopped, and when I fell off the conductor pulled me on again.”</p>

The presumption is that every witness who appears <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>upon the stand intends to tell the truth, but it does not always follow that, because a witness intends to tell the truth, he does tell the truth. Very much depends upon the position that he occupies in relation to the case in which he is called upon to testify, and therefore, even when it appears in the case that witnesses contradict each other, positively and flatly contradict each other, you should be cautious in arriving at the conclusion that either has committed perjury, or intended to commit perjury. [The jury should, at all times where testimony is conflicting, endeavor to reconcile it, and, if possible, come to the conclusion that the witnesses intend at least to tell the truth, although there is evidence of such a character as to impress the jury unfavorably.] [1]</p>
