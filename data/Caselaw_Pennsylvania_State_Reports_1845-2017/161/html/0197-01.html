The whole of the structure was cemented together and constituted a solid mass. The entire work, including the curbing, was built by the cemetery company for the ornamentation of the grounds and manifestly was intended to be a permanent part of the cemetery property. In no sense can it be regarded as a trade fixture. As this subject was the controlling feature of the contest its determination ends the case.</p>
