The general rule is well settled that where there is no distinct gift, but such only as is inferable from a direction to pay, the legacy is contingent.

If his wife had not been living there would doubtless have been an immediate distribution to his children, the testator intending postponement of payment of the legacies as stated, ‘ if she survive me,’ and this postponement was only on account of, and for the benefit of the widow. The distribution after death of his wife was not directed on account of the age or character of the legatees, but for the advantage and benefit of his widow.</p>

I further direct that the value of this property, to wit: $600, so bequeathed to my daughter shall be deducted from her share of the real estate when sold; that is, that this sum of $600 shall be part of her share, but that she shall not have more including it than any other children received.’ Testator here speaks of one of his children, naming her in connection with her share of the other real estate. It tends to lead to the conclusion that it was the testator’s intention that she should, in any event whatever, receive a poi’tion of the proceeds of the sale of the farm, and that the legacies should vest at his death; and in the same connection he speaks of his other children.</p>
