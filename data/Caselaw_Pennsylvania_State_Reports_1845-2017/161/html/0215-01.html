Ryan, Esq., it appeared that, on Nov. 4,1885, decedent executed two promissory notes under seal, one to Annie Riland and the other to Emma Dietrich. They were the daughters of a deceased sister of decedent’s first wife, and had resided with him as members of his family from their childhood till their marriage. On June 2, 1888, decedent executed three other promissory notes under seal, two of them to nephews, and the other to a niece of the obligor, the three notes being delivered to one of the nephews to be delivered to the other nephew and to the niece after decedent’s death; and they were so delivered. The aggregate amount of these notes was $4,000, and all were made payable after his death. Decedent was twice married, but left no issue by either wife. His will, which was probated Oct. 5, 1890, devised to his wife a house “ as long as she lives, or as long as she shall bear my name,” etc. The balance of his estate, which was nearly the whole of it, was not disposed of. His widow refused to accept the provisions of the will. She, together with two of the collateral heirs, contested the payment of these notes out of decedent’s estate.</p>

The personal estate amounted to $4,933.80 ; from this the auditor deducted the costs, $256.83, leaving a balance of $4,676.97 ; deducted widow’s share of one half, leaving a balance of personal estate of $2,338.48; added real estate fund, $3,057.90, making a balance for distribution, $5,386.39; deducted notes, $4,000, leaving balance for distribution among heirs of $1,386.39.</p>
