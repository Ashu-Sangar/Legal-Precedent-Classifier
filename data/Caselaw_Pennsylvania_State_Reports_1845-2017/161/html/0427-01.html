Ample and distinct admission by Mr. Maglaughlin that he had bought the interest and was holding it for P. New &amp; Co. is in writing signed by Mr. Maglaughlin. In a letter dated May 14, 1873, to P. New &amp; Co., Mr. Maglaughlin says: ‘ Then I levied upon what I believe to be an interest of Cressler in a valuable farm left by his grandfather. This interest (if it is an interest in the land) is worth several thousand dollars.

Whatever title this sheriff’s sale conveyed is held by me for your benefit, and 1 really believe that the sale did convey a substantial title to an interest which will bq worth at the death of Cressler’s mother (an old and feeble woman) $1,500 or $2,000. . . . Of course the costs arising on the suit and from the executions are a legal claim against you as the plaintiff in the case, and as having been incurred on your behalf.’ On May 20, 1873, P. New &amp; Co. drew and sent their check payable to the order of J. K. Foreman for $71.36, on which the sheriff, Foreman, ob-. tained the money. On March 27, 1885, P. New, trading as P.

Even had it taken place after his mother’s death it would have conveyed no interest, for her will converted the land into personalty and gave Daniel the interest of his share of the principal for his life, so as not to be liable for his debts. Had a title been acquired by Charles Maglaughlin it would have been simply as trustee for his client, P. New &amp; Co. The purchase money was, at Mr. Maglaughlin’s request, and on his assertion in writing that he had bought for the client, paid to the sheriff by the latter. The act of April 22, 1856, § 6, P. L. 533, forbids the enforcing of any resulting trust (which this was) beyond five years from the accruing of such trust ‘ with the right of entry.’ But as, if Mrs. Cressler had only a life estate, the right of entry did not accrue to P. New &amp; Co. or to Maglaughlin till her death in 1888, this limitation would not apply. Charles Maglaughlin was not in possession nor was he otherwise enforcing any pretended rights as against Daniel Cressler or P. New &amp; Co. until 1888.
