Subject to the life estate of the widow, now 68 years of age, it is worth probably at a low estimate $1,000. There was a rule pending to stay the writ, issued at the defendant’s instance, on a petition alleging that sufficient funds had been realized from the sale of his father’s property to pay the plaintiff’s judgment, and contending that by reason thereof there was no necessity for the sacrifice of his real estate. The argument on this rule, during my absence, was not heard until ■an hour or two before the time fixed for the sale. It was decided immediately against the defendant, the rule was discharged and the sheriff was ordered by the plaintiff to proceed with his writ. The property was struck down to the plaintiff on his bid of $100, the only one made. The depositions show that owing to the pending rule several responsible parties who intended to bid on the property were misled and did not attend the sale, and the defendant himself, no doubt depending upon the success of his application to stay the writ, was not in a position to protect his interests on account of the very brief period between the decision against him and the sale.</p>
