That the company, for a valuable consideration, executed and delivered to Samuel K. Nester an assignment, in writing, of the amount which might be due the company from the association on the expiration of the year limited by the agreement, which assignment was delivered to and remains with the association. That on April 4, 1887, “ The Enterprise Brewing Company ” succeeded to the property, rights and credits of the limited company, including its membership in the association, and was recognized by the association as a member. That by further statements of account, rendered monthly to the company and tire corporation, it appeared that from January, 1887, to and including May, 1887, the further sum of $3,387.13 was due from the association. That in March, 1887, the company notified the association in writing of its intention to withdraw from the association on June 30, 1887. That on September 21, 1887, the corporation made an assignment for the benefit of creditors in writing, duly recorded, to Benjamin F. Fisher, Esq., one of the plaintiffs. That by virtue of the aforesaid two assignments, Samuel K. Nester and Benjamin F. Fisher have succeeded to all rights of the said company and corporation. That there was due from the association, as above set forth, a total of $17,822.90, with interest on the respective monthly installments, but the association is entitled to deduct $4,620, and also the share of expenses which should be borne by the company and corporation, the amount of which share is unknown to the plaintiffs; that the whole of the aforesaid sums, with interest, notwithstanding repeated demands for an account and payment, still remain due and owing to plaintiffs.

J. It certainly is a combination in restraint of <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>trade, tending to destroy competition and create a monopoly in an article of daily consumption.”</p>

But, in the present case, there is no purchase or sale of any business, nor any other analogous circumstances giving to one party a just right to be protected against competition from the other. All the members of the association are engaged in the same business within the same territory, and the object of the association is purely and simply to silence and stifle all competition as between its members. No equitable reason for such restraint exists: ” More v. Bennett, <a href="/ill/140/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="140 Ill. 69" data-case-ids="5806072" data-case-paths="/ill/140/0069-01">140 Ill. 69</a>.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[152,1390,1162,297]]]'>The test question, in every case like the present, is whether or not a contract in restraint of trade exists which is injurious to the public interests. If injurious, it is void as against public polic}^. Courts will not stop to inquire as to the degree of injury inflicted. It is enough to know that the natural tendel^' of such contracts is injurious.</p>

The application of the rule does not depend upon the number of those who may be implicated, nor the extent of space included, in the <em>combination; </em>but upon the existence of injury to the public. One combination, consisting of but part of those engaged in a given branch of trade, may amount to a practical monopoly; while another, less extensive in its scope, may, as well, bring disaster in its train. The difference lies onty in degree, but equally forbids the aid of courts. In More v. Bennett, <a href="/ill/140/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="140 Ill. 69" data-case-ids="5806072" data-case-paths="/ill/140/0069-01">140 Ill. 69</a>, where a combination had been formed among some of the stenographers in the city of Chicago, Mr. Justice Baily said: “True, the restraint is not so far-reaching as it would have been if all the stenographers in the city had joined the association; but, so far as it goes, it is of <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>precisely the same character, produces the same results, and is subject to the same legal objection. ... We can see no legal difference between the restraint on competition which it now exercises, and that which it will exercise when it is in a position to dictate terms to all who are engaged in the business, and to all who may wish to obtain the services of stenographic reporters.” So, no one can for a moment doubt that more serious injury would result to densely settled, than to a much larger district with scattered population. Thus a combination to raise the price of bread-stuffs would cause serious loss in a city, while it would be comparatively harmless in an agricultural state. “We can scarcely conceive,” said Mr. Justice Marr, in Standard Cotton Oil Co. v. Adoue, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20S.W.%20274" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="19 S.W. 274">19 S. W. Rep. 274</a>, “ how mere territorial limits can be the controlling test in all instances of the legality of the restraints imposed upon the ordinary course of trade. The criterion may do very well when applied to the occupation or profession of one man or even a few individuals; for neither their labor, industry, business nor services may be so necessary to the public as not to be dispensed with without inconvenience or injmy. It appears to us, however, that the case is very different in regard to trade in articles of prime necessity, or even of very frequent use, among a large number of persons in a given locality: ” Hooker v.

No standard has been furnished by which to ascertain what constitute these with reference to the general public. But, assuming that beer is not among them, it is equally within the reach of the rule. The law recognizes it as a commodity, regulates its sale, it is “ an article of daily consumption,” and the court should refuse to aid in any attempted imposition upon the public by means of illegal combinations. The fact that coal was “an article of prime necessity” was not mentioned as essential to the illegality of the combination which was involved in Coal Co. v. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/68/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="68 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1024543" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0173-01">68 Pa. 173</a>, but was suggested, arguendo, as an aggravation of the injury done the public.

Scott, 11 S. &amp; R. 164; Coal Co. v. Coal Co., supra.” “ The objection,” said Lord Mansfield in Holman v. Johnson, Cowp. 343, “ that a contract is immoral or illegal, as between plaintiff and defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed, but it is founded in general principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real justice as between him and the plaintiff — by accident, if I may so say. The principle of public policy is this: Ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No court will lend its aid to a man who founds his cause of ac<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>tion upon an immoral or an illegal act. If from the plaintiff’s own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the transgression of the law of this country, there the court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes, not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff. So, if the plaintiff and defendant were to change sides, and the defendant were to bring his action against the plaintiff, the latter would have the advantage of it, for where both are equally at fault, potior est conditio defendentis.” As the bill here bears upon its face the evidence of the turpitude of the transaction out of which the plaintiffs’ demand arises, it is plain upon this principle that the court must have refused its aid had the Enterprise Brewing Company itself been the beneficial claimant; and its assignees stand in no higher right. Notice of the character of the combination was in the channel of the assignees’ title, and hence they are not “innocent of participation in, or knowledge of, the illegality ” of the combination, and must be treated as having taken subject to the disabilities of their assignor : Chamberlain v.
