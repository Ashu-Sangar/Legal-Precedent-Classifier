There was no evidence to show the length of the cut. The engineer further testified : “ Q. What in addition was taken ? A. In addition we have ■taken, as the ground is favorable at this point, an additional width for the necessary sidings and turnouts for station purposes, in reasonable anticipation of the uses of the railroad -.in the future. Q. That would be 24 feet more? A. Yes. .. . . . Q. Will you enumerate the uses to which that is to be applied ? The purposes ? A. For sidings, for the possibility of accumulation of cars there in case of mishaps. There <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>has been a very large tonnage on that road, from 900 to 1000 cars a day, taking in each direction, and that 4200 feet is of good direction and trackage with light grading, and these are an advantage to put sidings at that point which will accommodate two or three trains. Q. Then, as I understand you, your taking there is, first, the statutory allowance of four'rods, the additional allowance for cutting and filling, and the rest is for sidings and turnouts, and station purposes ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And that covers the 140 feet taken ? A. That covers the 140 feet taken; yes, sir. Q. Is there a public road which crosses Moncure Robinson’s property? A. Yes, we carry our tracks over that road, over the road known as the Paoli road, which goes close to his house. We cut the road and pass it under our tracks." Q. Is that amount of land necessary for the operation of this road ? That amount of land is required for the operation of this road, for the construction of the road, for embankments, and for the additional amount? A. Yes. It was taken in reasonable expectation of the uses of the road in the immediate future. . . . Cross-examined : Q. You are talking about the terminal in Philadelphia, and I am talking about a road that runs through a county in the state. You knew it would be many years before six tracks would be there. A. I simply said that with the traffic of 1000 cars daily in each direction, anything that congested the traffic would immediately require ample siding facilities, and these siding facilities can only be established at certain points, according to grade, according to alignment, and according to the reasonable cost for grading these sidings. ... I say that from the east end to the west end of the Robinson property we took 70 feet on each side of the center line, and we took that for the reason that it invited us to go there, with an expectation of the future uses of this road. It invited us, above all other points on that line, to establish sidings at that point. If you ask me if at a level point we took 70 feet on each side of the center line, I saj we did. We do not wish to take a serrated, indented line for our right of way boundary. It would be a damage to everybody concerned to do that, and it is not customary. Q. You took just as much land as you thought you would want for the future uses of the railroad? A. We were governed in taking our widths by the grades, the cutting and filling of the rail<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>road through the Robinson property, and other property. Q. Having found that, you made that the width yon took through the whole ? A. Yes, the average width. Q. The greatest fill on the Robinson property is 13 feet, multiply that by 3 gives you practically 40 feet, add 10 gives you 50 feet, and add 66 gives you 116 feet? A. Yes.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[278,744,1168,1576]]]'>“Mr. Crawford tells you that he directed this route to be run ; to be located; and to be marked upon a map. That map was submitted to Mr. DuBarry, the vice president of the road ; that he subsequently saw that map, and it bore the signature of the secretary of the company, as well as the corporate seal of the company. Was that the act of the company? Did it adopt the route which Mr. Crawford had directed to be run, and had located? Of course an engineer must be the first officer to point out where the road should go, in his judgment. He marks it, not exactly upon the ground, but upon a map, for the use of the company; <em>to </em>show the <em>officers where, in his </em>judgment, the road should be located. But, in our opinion, this would not be sufficient, even if it was approved by the vice president of the road. In our judgment, it would require the action of the company. There must be some action on the part of those who represent the company; and the chief engineer and the vice president, you will understand, do not represent a railroad company in its corporate capacity. It must be recognized through the officers of the company, they who constitute the corporation itself, and these are the president and its board of directors. But the question for our consideration is, whether or not you can say here that this route, from the evidence which is submitted (and it is all in what Mr. Crawford has said), was adopted by the railroad company as a corporation. If you are satisfied from the testimony that the company acted upon it, then that is sufficient, in my judgment, to locate the road. In the opinion of the court it is not required that the corporate officers shall fix the width of the route, or the amount of land taken. They are called upon, by the act, to designate and point out the route, and the act itself fixes the width which that shall be, unless they see fit to limit it in extent.</p>

Has it taken more ground in the construction of this road than the act of assembly warrants ?] [1] .... [In the opinion of the court this company is limited in its taking of ground to sixty-six feet. The act itself prescribes the amount of land to be taken. It authorizes it, in locating the line, not to take more than sixty-six feet, except where certain contingencies exist, such as deep cuts, or high embankments, or where, in the judgment of its officers, it is necessary to locate sidings, or stations, or water tanks, or something of that kind, and there they are authorized to take more. Is there any evidence in this case showing that such a thing was necessary on the property of Mr. Robinson ? I fail to discover it if there is.] [2] It is true, Mr. Crawford says that they have thought that it might be necessary, some time in the future — this is about the substance, as I gather it, of his testimony — that it might be necessary some tim.e in the future to locate sidings on Mr. Robinson’s ground; that it might be necessary to locate stations there, or buildings of some kind, for the use of the road. When, he does not know. He is not able to tell, and nobody else can. It may never be necessarj' to do so. If the road increases in tonnage, in business, then it may become necessary. But if such a thing should not occur, then it might not be necessary to locate them. The act seems to contemplate, in the estimation of the court, that that necessity is to be determined at or about the time the road is located. That is, the company must select where it will locate its sidings, where it is necessary to have these turnouts, where it is necessary to have switches, where it is necessary to erect its stations, water tanks, and things of that kind; and, having done so, it is at liberty, if necessary, to exceed sixty-six feet in width. [If you can find any testimony in the cause which would justify jou in concluding that a width of more than sixt3-six feet was necessary in the location of this road through Mr. Robinson’s ground, it is a question for you. I can only say to you that I have not been able to discover it, and I recall nothing in the case at this time which leads me to entertain that belief.] [3] ....</p>

    <p id="b597-8" data-blocks='[["BL_597.9",597,[142,1261,1176,1219]]]'>Prima facie the authority of the railroad company defendant to take land for its right of way is limited to a width of sixty-six feet. Any greater right must depend on the existence of one or more of the exceptional circumstances specified in the charter, and such circumstances must be shown. The learned judge below was quite within bounds in saying to the jury that they might consider that matter, but that he recollected no evidence of any necessity for additional width. He would have been justified in telling them positively that there was no such evidence in the case. It is true that Mr. Crawford, the engineer who located the line, testifies that there was a cut on plaintiff’s farm of thirteen feet, and an embankment of the same height, and that by the ordinary rule of engineering forty-nine additional feet would be required at such points. This would only justify a width of one hundred and fifteen feet, not the one hundred and forty taken, but even as to this width there was no effort to show the length of the cut, or its location. A necessaiy cut or embankment one thousand feet long would not justify taking the requisite additional width for the whole four thousand feet that the road runs through plaintiff’s land, nor would the cut at one side of the farm justify the taking at the other. The burden of proof of the necessity both as to extent and location was upon the defendant, and was not met by any evidence in the case.</p>

      <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>The same view applies to the other necessity claimed, that of space for stations, sidings, turnouts, etc. There was no effort to show that any particular location was made of any of the appurtenances to the line, specified in the statute as giving occasion for additional width of appropriation. In fact the substance of the whole evidence on the subject is contained in a few lines of the testimony of the engineer, “ from the east end to the west end of the Robinson property we took seventy feet on each side of the center line .... with an expectation of the future uses of this road. ... If you ask me if at a level point we took seventy feet on each side of the center line, I say we did. We do not wish to take a serrated indented line for our right of way boundary.” It is very clear from this testimony that an extra width of thirty-seven feet on each side of the centerline, more than double the width the law allows, was taken, not for cuts or banks, nor for stations or sidings etc. but for the general purposes of the road. This was in plain excess of the statutory authority.</p>

But the exercise of both must be in good faith for the purposes the statute permits, and the necessity, extent and location of extra appropriations for such purposes must be definí tel y shown. The charter limitation of sixty-six feet is mandatory, except in the cases the charter itself specifies, and it cannot be set aside or evaded at mere will. While the discretion is in the corporation, its exercise, when challenged in a court of law, must like every other right be sustained by showing the existence of the circumstances under which the charter authorizes it.</p>
