    <p class="summary" id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[163,432,1170,446]]]'>From the record it appeared that on Feb. 9, 1891, plaintiff began an action by capias in trespass for slander against defendant, and upon the trial of the cause recovered a verdict for $350, upon which judgment was entered. A fi. fa. and ca. sa. were issued, and defendant was taken into custody by the sheriff. The defendant and his counsel denied the authority of the sheriff, and so defied him that the sheriff was intimidated, and permitted defendant to go free. Subsequently an alias ca. sa. was issued. This rule was then taken.</p>

Wintersteen came and threatened me with the law if I did not leave the defendant go ; he said we had issued before twenty days were up. Mr. Wintersteen persuaded me to let the defendant go on the ground that the writ had been issued too soon. In the prosecution of this case I did not act for my daughter, the plaintiff. I do not know that I asked plaintiff’s counsel to issue this writ or any subsequent writ. I recollect that I asked plaintiff’s counsel what was to be done with this writ after we had let him go, and they said, stay it. Mr. Wintersteen was counsel for the defendant at the trial and at this time, and all this happened in the presence of defendant and his counsel. I did not have the defendant in jail at the time. I simply let Mr. Cherington go that day to see whether I was right or wrong.”</p>

Thomas, and brought from his home in Roaringcreek township to the town of Bloomsburg, where, at the defendant’s request, he was taken to the law office of lawyer Wintersteen, from whence the latter accompanied the said deputy and defendant to the sheriff’s office. There, in the presence of the sheriff, Mr. Wintersteen challenged the right of the sheriff to make the arrest and defied his authority to hold the defendant, because, as he alleged, the capias ad satisfaciendum had been prematurely issued. The sheriff says he then let the defendant go, to see whether he was right or wrong. Subsequently it <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>appears that the plaintiff’s attorney marked the writ of ca. sa. ‘ stayed,’ or directed it to be so returned by the sheriff, which was done, and this alias issued. Now, the single question is, whether the defendant can be arrested and held upon the alias writ of ca. sa. ? We are unable to find any adjudicated cases exactly in point. Those cited by counsel for defendant, as follows, viz.: <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Howard%20281" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="15 Howard 281">15 Howard, 281</a>, and 3d Clark, 457, occurred and were decided under the common law, prior to the act of June 16, 1836. The case of Bamford v. Keefer, <a href="/pa/68/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="68 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1024567" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0389-01">68 Pa. 389</a>, plainly decides that the exception made to the foregoing cases, which hold that the judgment is satisfied and that the defendant cannot be held, by the 31st section of the act of June 16, 1836, only applies where the discharge is at the request of the defendant. The exception is ‘ that if the defendant die, escape, or be discharged by reason of any privilege, or at hi's own request, the party entitled to the benefit of the judgment may have such remedies at law for the recovery thereof as he would have been entitled to if such capias ad satisfaciendum had not been issued.’ Surely, if the defendant had forcibly made his escape he could have been rearrested, and effecting it in the manner in which he did is, perhaps, more cunning but little less culpable. It is evident, to say the least, that the defendant’s discharge, by the sheriff, was obtained at his own request, through the defiant attitude of his counsel, Mr. Wintersteen.</p>

If the defendant had been released at the request of the plaintiff or with her consent and approval, then we should hold the alias ca. sa. void, but being permitted to go, by the sheriff, at the urgent and threatening attitude of the defendant’s counsel, in the absence of the plaintiff, or her attorney, and the mere order of the plaintiff’s attorney staying the first writ in order to issue another in the regular manner, was not such consent and discharge by the plaintiff as would prevent him from issuing and executing an alias writ of ca. sa. The action of the sheriff was without authority and a deviation from his regular <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>duty. In fact the defendant was freed by the unlawful and unfair advantage taken of the sheriff by the defendant himself and his counsel, and the plaintiff, in simply staying the first writ to cure an irregularity, or in order to pass over the first return day after its issue, is not concluded thereby.</p>
