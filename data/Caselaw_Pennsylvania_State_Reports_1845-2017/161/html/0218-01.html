At the special request of the Security Company, principal administrator of decedent, the register of wills of Berks county, Pa., granted ancillary letters of administration to Wm. J. Young.

At the time the orphans’ court of Berks county filed its first adjudication, all parties were under the impression that Mrs. Susan M. Welles at the time of her death left but one son, viz., Hubert G.

The Security Company, administrator, filed exceptions,, introduced proof of the fact that Mrs. Welles, at her death, left two sons, viz., Hubert G. and John M. H. Welles.
