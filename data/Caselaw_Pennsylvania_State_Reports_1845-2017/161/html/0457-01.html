In this account, the trustee charges itself with $379,940.23, prin: cipal, and $58,831.57 income, of which last sum, $486.64 was derived from real estate, the rest from securities. The $379,940.23 contains the amount of $27,301.06 ‘ cash from undivided securities.’ This $27,301.06 was a part of one third of the amount of undivided securities amounting at par to $32,673.04 that were in the hands of the executors of the will of James W. Bosler, and that none of the parties in interest would accept in specie from the executors, agreeing that they should be placed with the Commonwealth Guarantee, etc., Company for collection and distribution. The whole amount of these undivided securities, $98,019.12, was divisible into three parts, one third payable to Mrs. Helen Bosler, widow; one third to the guardian of the children, and one third to the trustee. The company collected $81,903.18 of them as agent, paying to itself, as trustee, the share coming to it in that capacity, and handing the other shares over to the parties thereto entitled. For services as agent, the company charged five per cent on the amount collected. The remainder of the corpus of the estate with which the accountant charges itself was made up of $234,000 U. S. registered bonds at 4 per cent, becoming due in 1907, a judgment of $1,000 against D. S.

The sale of the $164,000 was made in two parcels, $40,000 on October 3, 1889, for $50,800, and $124,000 on March 19, 1890, for $151,280.

The Northern Central Railroad' bonds were sold on Jan. 18,1889, for $23,500. These sales did not take place by order of the court. Whether any commissions were paid for any of these sales does not distinctly appear. (Col. Jennings says, ‘ Can’t say, now, whether Drexel, the agent for selling the securities, remitted the whole amount, or deducted his commission as agent.’ In a paper marked N, subsequently sent to the auditor, it is said, ‘ No brokerage commissions were paid.’)</p>
