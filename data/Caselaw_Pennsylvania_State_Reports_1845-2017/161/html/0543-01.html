After her husband’s death, with the insurance money which she received from a policy upon his life, she offered to repay her father, but he told her to “ keep it for the children.” She then invested the money in her own name, and continued to live with her father, who supported herself and her two young children. She subsequently married again, and her father then began to make inquiries about the money. The daughter answered these inquiries by saying: “ I can fix that by a will.” A few days before the daughter’s death the father prepared her will, which left everything which she owned to her children. At the same time she gave her husband a check for two hundred and fifty dollars which he accepted. 'The will was read to him, and he expressed himself satisfied with it in his wife’s presence before she executed it. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the evidence was sufficient to establish a trust in the wife for her children; and (2) that the husband was estopped from claiming against the will.</p>

About the time it was finished Doctor Phillips died, and she sold the property at a sacrifice and came to her father’s house to live with her two children. She received $4,500 of life insurance on her husband’s life, with which she offered to pay her father the amount of her indebtedness which was represented by promissory notes given to him from <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>time to time.

His daughter had come to live with him with her children after her first husband’s death. She had nothing to live upon but her husband’s life insurance, which she offered to her father in payment of her indebtedness to him, but he told her to keep it for her children. It was a gift to her to enable her to maintain her children. That it was the intention of Mr. Rhoades that this was to be a gift and not a trust is shown by his testimony. If <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>it had been the intention of her father to create a trust for her children he would have had no concern about them on her second marriage. The money would have been theirs and nothing their mother could do would deprive them of it. It would have vested in them, and her death or marriage could make no difference to the trust fund. The money was loaned in the name of Laura H. P. Osmond individually. Mr. Rhoades knew this. She did not loan the money as trustee. It was the anxiety which her father felt for the children upon her second marriage that satisfied your auditor that Mr. Rhoades had no intention of creating a trust for them. The fear that her husband might acquire this money shows that he considered it as belonging to his daughter, for there was no opportunity or likelihood of his. inheriting it from them, or getting it in his possession, if it was in trust. But her delicate health indicated that she would not live long, and her husband would then inherit his share of the money. Her father knowing this, and feeling he had given her this money as a gift and anxious that the children should acquire it all, went to her, upon hearing of her second marriage, and said, ‘ How about the children now.’ Why should he have made such an inquiry if it was already theirs ? Why should he have felt any concern, unless he had given it to her absolutely ? Her reply to this inquiry was, ‘ I can fix that by making a will.’ She could, in her judgment, bequeath it all to her children by her will, and thus deprive her husband of any part of it, according to the wishes of her father. If she had been trustee, for her children she could not have disposed of it by will — she would only have been the conduit through which it passed to her children. Your auditor is of the opinion that the gift to the decedent was absolute; that her father’s intention was that she was to receive the money as hers. The children were the motive of the gift. They were the motive which led to the absolute gift to their mother. Her father gave her the money as her own, so that she might have something to live on, as well as maintain and educate her children. Your auditor finds from the testimony of Anna E. Rhoades, a sister of the decedent, and Mrs. Sallie E. Boardman, that Mrs. Osmond considered the money as a gift to herself; that she did not consider herself a trustee for her children. Miss Rhoades knew all about the arrangement between Mrs. Osmond and her father <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>as to this money, and upon her sister’s second marriage she told her she was much concerned about this money. ‘ What about the children if anything should happen to you?’ She said Mrs. Osmond told her that she should have no concern, that the money was to educate the children and that her husband would not touch it, for he told her he did not want her money.</p>

Upon her second marriage her father and sister became concerned about the money. Fearing that her husband, in some way, might get it in his possession, Mrs. Osmond assures them that he had promised her that he would not touch it — showing that she too felt it was hers absolutely, and that she would keep it safely for the children by making a will and leaving him no part of her estate.</p>

Board-man testified that ‘ she was in the room when the will was signed: that Osmond was asked whether he was satisfied with its provisions and he said if that was Laura’s will he was satisfied, that he did not want her money; that he did not marry her for her money.’ Osmond himself testified: ‘ Mr. Rhoades brought it (the will) in. He took me into another room away from my wife. He said this was Laura’s will, and wanted me to read it and asked if I was satisfied.

There is no doubt that at the time of his wife’s death he did make certain declarations to Mr. Rhoades and Mrs. Boardman that he was satisfied with- his wife’s will. There is no testimony, however, that he had any conversation with his wife in reference to her making this will. He did not tell her that he was satisfied. Nor was it shown that she prepared this will relying on his promise to her that he did not want her money. If the estate had been settled other than in the ordinary and usual way, or if a distribution of the estate had been made equally between the two children by the executor, relying on the statements made by Osmond, perhaps this would be sufficient to estop him from controverting them. His language is more in the nature of a promise to release, but there is no consideration to support the promise. It is nudum pactum. If for a valuable consideration he had promised to release his interest in his wife’s estate, or for a consideration had agreed that the will should be drawn as it was, then he would be estopped from claiming any part of her estate.

The father knew that the money was not being spent by his daughter, but was invested in mortgages for accumulation, while she and her children lived with and were supported by him, and she took in sewing to provide in part for the current expenses of living. Matters remained in this condition until her second marriage, when the father immediately showed his anxiety about the children’s money. The learned auditor treats this as an indication that the father knew the money had been given to her and not to the children, but it appears to us to tend more to the other view that he considered it the children’s but knew it was not formally secured to them, and this is further confirmed by the answer of the daughter, “ I can fix that by a will.” Regarding it as a trust for the chil<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>dren, the father might reasonably have been satisfied that it could and would be properly eared for by a will, but regarding it as her own, he would hardly have been put off with that answer, for few people are ignorant of the law that surviving husbands have interests in their wives’ estates which cannot be interfered with by will. The conduct of the father appears to us to show that he intended and considered his gift of the money as to the children.</p>

She put it out immediately as an investment separate from the rest of hex-money, expressed her purpose not to touch it as it was for the children’s education, and, atone time entertaiixing the intention of buying a farm with it, wanted the title put in the name of her soix, the oldest child. And, finally, her confidence, both when asked by her father after her second mai-riage, and upoix her deathbed, that she could take care of the childrexx’s interest by a will, is only explainable on the ground that she regarded it as a trust, or the much less probable view that she was ignorant of the law as to the rights of a surviving husband.</p>

Neither she nor her father who wrote the will was learned in the law, but they seem to have known enough of the husband’s rights to inform him of the contents of the will. If he had not said he -was satisfied with it, it is only reasonable to suppose that she might have called in counsel and put the title to the money in more satisfactory shape. Her husband’s assent prevented her from realizing the necessity of anything more than making the will.
