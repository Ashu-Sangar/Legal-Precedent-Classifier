They also offered the record of the proceedings under a mortgage made by plaintiff upon the property in question. These proceedings showed a sheriff’s sale of plaintiff’s title to defendant. There was evidence that the will executed in 1886 had been set aside on an issue devisavit vel non. It appeared that in the will contest defendants had testified that the testatrix was non compos in 1886, and for several years before. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the question for the jury was whether the decedent was of sound mind when she executed the deed; and (2) that there was no element of estoppel or res judicata in the case.</p>

He then rested. By her will testatrix devised the houses in question to plaintiff, in trust for the use and benefit of his children. Defendants offered in evidence a will executed by Catharine Eichert Feb. 10,1886, by which she made a different disposition of her property. Defendants also offered in evidence a deed executed by Catharine Eichert to David R. Eichert dated Aug. 26,1885. They also showed that a mortgage on the property had been executed by David R. Eichert to raise money to carry on litigation between these parties, and that, on a sale under this mortgage, defendants had bought in Eichert’s title. Plaintiff offered testimony in rebuttal showing a previous ejectment by defendants against plaintiff for the same premises, and that the will of 1886 had been set aside by the orphans’ court on petition of defendants. He also offered evidence which tended to show that in the previous ejectment and in the will contest defendants had testified that testatrix was non compos mentis in February, 1886, and for several years before. Also that defendants, as purchasers at sheriff’s sale, had notice of .the defence.</p>

Having thus made out a prima facie title in himself as trustee, he rested. Defendants then put in evidence the will of Catharine Eiehert of 1886, the deed by her to plaintiff in 1885, and the record of the proceedings upon the mortgage, showing the purchase of plaintiff’s title under the deed of 1885 by the defendants. From this statement of the case, stripped of superfluous and irrelevant matters, it is apparent that the turning point was the deed of 1885. If testatrix during her lifetime and while of sound mind, had conveyed the houses to plaintiff, then neither of her wills was material to the case, and this the learned judge told the jury, in terms of which plaintiff certainly had no right to com<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>plain, for, disregarding all the complications of the probates and contest over the wills, the jury were instructed that plaintiff was entitled to recover, unless the deed by which the testatrix conveyed the houses to him was a good and valid deed.

But contradictory statements are not estoppels without other accompanying circumstances, and usually go to the jury merely on the credibility of the witnesses.
