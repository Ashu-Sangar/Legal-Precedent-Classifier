Further, for the reason that Eliza Flint, at the time of the making of the alleged will was incompetent to make a will and had no mental power to dispose of her property, and that she never did dispose of it by will to anybody.

But we will admit the deed and you can argue that afterwards. I do not see any elements of estoppel in this offer at all. The offer as made is overruled. There is no principle that I know of by which you can raise the doctrine of estoppel in this way. In order to invoke the doctrine of estoppel, the party must show that the act of the other party has misled him to his prejudice and injury and loss, and there is no such element in this offer, and the evidence offered is therefore immaterial and is excluded.

But you have proposed to show nothing here by which you were misled to your injury. Her capacity at the time she made the deed is entirely immaterial, without the further offer on the part of the plaintiff to show that she was incapable of making the will at the time she made that.
