There is no certain rule for the determining of such a question nor any appropriate words, the use or disuse of which is decisive. The same words may import a condition precedent in one will and subsequent in another, being controlled by the context. The question always is whether, taking the whole will together, it was the intention of the testator that no estate should vest in a devisee until the terms of the condition were performed, or whether he intended the nonperformance of the condition to defeat an estate previously vested.</p>

Joseph was the only child at home; he had returned at his father’s request; the testator desired him to remain during the lives of his parents; and to him he gives the whole estate at his mother’s death, subject to the payment of the pecuniary legacies and provided he does remain ‘ until our decease.’ The language of the devise to Joseph is not present, but future. It does not say, ‘ I give ’ or ‘ devise,’ nor use any other term importing an immediate estate, but the words are ‘shall, after her death, revert to and become the property of my son Joseph,’ etc. The terms of the condition require that Joseph shall remain with the testator until his death as well as with his wife until her death. To this extent at least the condition must be precedent, since no estate can vest until the testator’s death, and if the condition be then broken it can never vest. Den v. Messenger, supra.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b443-3" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[142,1199,1173,710]]]'>“ At the time of writing the will the testator could not know whether he would survive his wife or his wife survive him. Had the wife died first, the condition must necessarily have been performed, if <em>ever, </em>before the vesting of the estate in Joseph. Moreover, it is in any event required to be performed before the estate can vest in enjoyment according to the literal language of the devise, for this cannot happen until the testator and his wife are dead. The devise appears to be in consideration of the performance of the condition, that is to say, the motive for the devise appears to be to reward Joseph for remaining with his parents during their lives, and this circumstance is one of those which have been held to be indicative of an intention to make the condition precedent rather than subsequent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[141,1918,1172,504]],["BL_444.1",444,[268,379,1170,300]]]'>“ On the other hand, the nature of the condition favors the more liberal construction. It requires for its performance the entire lives of the testator and his wife. It depends not only upon the devisee, but his mother also, for he could not remain with her, whether upon the farm or elsewhere, without her consent. At the time the will was drawn Joseph was in the act of performing the condition — he was living with his parents —‘ remaining ’ with them. The condition requires nothing to be done, but simply the continuation of an act in progress at the time the testator penned his will. Again, the absence of <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>any limitation over indicates an intention to make a present and positive disposition rather than a future conditional one. The phraseology of the devise to the widow indicates that the testator regarded her interest as a use in the popular sense, rather than a vested property, and it points to his intention to vest the ownership in Joseph.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[263,688,1172,1523]]]'>“ Moreover, while the condition must of necessity be performed in part in testator’s lifetime, and hence before the estate could vest, the possibility of its vesting before the full performance of the condition appears to be present and may be presumed to have been in the mind of the testator. The limitation to the widow is for life or widowhood, and hence her estate would terminate at her remarriage, if such an event occurred, and at her death at all events. The estate is devised to Joseph after her death without any express mention of the marriage of his mother, but, as was said in Burd v. Burd, <a href="/pa/40/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="478205" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0182-01">40 Pa. 182</a>, the life estate and the remainder naturally go together in the mind of a testator, and, having limited the duration of the particular estate, he must be presumed to refer to that in fixing the commencement of the estate in remainder though he mentions only one of two events upon which the termination of the particular estate depends. This reasoning we think is stronger in the case in hand, where the estate in remainder is expressly limited to take effect at the death of the tenant durante viduitate, than in the English cases of Luxford v. Cheeke, 3 Lev. 125, and Gordon v. Adolphus, 3 Bro. P. C. 306, cited in 1 Jarman, 414, in which the limitation was upon remarriage only. And these cases seem to be founded on better reason than Augustus v. Seabolt, 3 Mete. 156, also cited by the same author, where the rule, that courts will not provide by construction for a contingency overlooked by the testator, was applied to produce a contrary result. It is precisely because the contingency of death or marriage, as the case may be, was not overlooked, as is shown by the devise of the particular estate, but it was merely omitted in the penning of the devise in remainder by manifest inadvertence, that the words are supplied by intendment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[264,2220,1164,196]],["BL_445.1",445,[160,397,1167,864]]]'>“We must, of course, in searching for the testator’s intention, put ourselves as far as possible in his shoes at the time the will was drawn. The possibility of Joseph dying before his mother does not appear to have been in his mind, but if he lim<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>ited the estate to Joseph so that it might vest in him in possession and enjoyment in the lifetime of his mother upon her remarriage, this strongly points to an intention that the devise to Joseph should not await full performance of the condition for its vesting. The fact that another condition plainly subsequent is written in immediate connection with the one in question, without more clearly marking a distinction between them, is another straw pointing the same way. None of the considerations which we have mentioned are, however, conclusive on either side. Weighing them together the matter continues doubtful. In' such a case the considerations of public convenience which cause courts to lean in favor of vested rather than contingent devises ; to avoid if possible any construction which will leave the fee in abeyance; and, where the words are capable of carrying the whole.estate, to refuse to presume that the testator intended a partial intestacy, are decisive. Putting these into the scale the beam turns in favor of the plaintiffs.”</p>
