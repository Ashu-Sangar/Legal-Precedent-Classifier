A distinction has always been made however between facts going to the jurisdiction of the court, and those relating to the merits, and the tendency has been strong to open the door to evidence upon the former. The earlier view was that the mere presumption in favor of jurisdiction might be contradicted, but that evidence could not be <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>received against the affirmative recitals of jurisdictional facts in the record. In Hampton v. McConnell, 3 Wheaton, 234, Chief Justice Marshall said, “ whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and <em>none </em>others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States.” And a similar view is indicated by the decisions in Mills v.

Thompson Oil Co., <a href="/pa/79/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="79 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="438394" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0354-01">79 Pa. 354</a>, however, it was held that notwithstanding the recital in the record of an attachment in rem in New York, it might be shown that the property was not there and the court therefore acquired no jurisdiction. And in Guthrie v. Lowry, <a href="/pa/84/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="84 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="1053512" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0533-01">84 Pa. 533</a>, it was distinctly held that “ whatever doubts may have been at one time entertained, it is now an incontrovertible position . . . that the record may be contradicted by evidence of facts impeaching the jurisdiction of the court,” citing among others the cases in 85 and 86 U. S., supra, though in the particular case the foreign court was held as a matter of law to have had jurisdiction. This would seem to be a formal recognition and adoption, even if partially obiter, of the later and presently prevailing doctrine. But in Lance v. Dugan, 22 W. N. 132, the court again reverted in a brief per curiam to the old rule, saying that as the record showed a service on defendants the judgment was conclusive notwithstanding an affidavit in denial.</p>
    <p id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[145,1413,1161,807]]]'>In this condition of the law we have the point in the present case for final settlement. Whatever our individual views upon the true spirit of the constitutional provision, we have no hesitation in conforming to the prevailing rule. It would be sufficient to say that it is now the established rule in the Supreme Court which is the ultimate authority on all questions depending on the constitution and statutes of the United States. But, in addition to that, the same rule now prevails in the courts of a majority of the states, and it is a question on which uniformity is desirable. It would be contrary to sound policy to deny to our own citizens a defence against judgments obtained in other states, out of a comity which such states refused to us. An apt illustration is afforded by the present case, in which it appears that the court of chancery in Maryland denied the appellant relief against the original judgment on the ground that the same defence would be open to him here.</p>
