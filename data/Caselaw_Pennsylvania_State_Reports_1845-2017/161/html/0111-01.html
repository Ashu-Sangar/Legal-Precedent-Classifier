The first I noticed of it they were smelling round the vents in the neighborhood. They were smelling there to trace it, and as I came out I told the gentleman. I says, ‘ Just go in that water-closet and you will find plenty of gas,’ and he followed suit, and when he was in there he used those words; he says, ‘ Don’t strike no match and don’t take no candle in there or it will blow up,’ and I called my wife out at the same time and I gave her notice then what the gentleman had said, and he told her the same thing, and then I says to him — I explained the case to him, because the odor was more than bearable ; I could hardly stand it. I wouldn’t have complained, but he just happened to come up there. I told him then to follow it up; he saj's, ‘ I haven’t got the time; I have got to go some-wheres else ; but,’ he says, ‘ there will be a tracing gang sent here to-morrow ’ — that was on Wednesday — ‘ and they will follow that up until they find it.’ I then said, ‘ I wish you would.’ Q. You were going on to tell us what took place between you and Mr. Gibson? A. Yes, sir. I related the affair at home— that is, my wife and myself — and then I told him, I think, three times to attend to it. I asked them how soon it would be attended to. He said, ‘ I won’t be in before four o’clock, but there will be a tracing gang round here to-morrow morning, because there is lots of gas around here that ought to be attended to,’ and I asked him then if he thought it was illuminating gas, and he said yes. By Mr. Johnson. Q. Did the-tracing gang come ? A. No.”</p>

The duty of promptly locating and stopping the leak was one that devolved solely on the proper authorities of the city. No one else had any right to interfere with the gas pipe, or open the street for the purpose of locating or stopping the leak. That this was their duty, and theirs alone, is a proposition too plain to need either argument or citation of authorities. It cannot be seriously contended that there was any lack of competent and sufficient proof of defendant’s negligence, as the proximate cause of the boy’s death, etc., to carry the case to the jury on that question of fact.</p>

We cannot assent to this proposition. Conceding, for the sake of argument only, that there is some evidence of such contributory negligence, an examination of the testimony has satisfied us that it is not of such a character as warranted the court in virtually declaring, as matter of law, that either the plaintiff or her son was guilty of negligence which contributed to the death of the latter. In view of all the evidence, we think the case involved questions of fact which were clearly for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and to them it should have been submitted with proper instructions as to the law applicable thereto.</p>
