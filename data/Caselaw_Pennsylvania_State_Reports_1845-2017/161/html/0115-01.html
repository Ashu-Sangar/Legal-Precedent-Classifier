There was evidence that when the case was before an auditor a compromise was reached, by which the life-tenant was to convey all of her interest in the estate to the remainder-men in consideration of their paying to her $11,000 and to her attorney, the plaintiff, $1,000. A deed was subsequently made to the remainder-men in which the consideration was mentioned as .$12,000. Defendant received the whole sum of $12,000, but refused to pay plaintiff, alleging that she had not employed him, and that the settlement had not been made on the terms stated by him.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[260,689,1170,605]]]'>“ 1. To entitle the plaintiff to recover in this case, he must establish a privity of contract between himself and the defendant. If the plaintiff fails in this, the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>As I have said to you, if a man goes and does a piece of work for another man, without authority, and then sues you, you are not obliged to pay that. You say, there is no contract between us; why do you ask me to pay it ? That is not applicable to a case where you yourself know that a person has engaged j'our services, and is appearing before you and signing affidavits of defence and all the other papers necessary to carry on this lawsuit; then you can’t say you did not engage the lawyer.” [2]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-7" data-blocks='[["BL_144.6",144,[262,1303,1170,656]]]'>“ 2. The contract of June 19, 1884, being silent as to any undertaking or contract on the part of defendant to pay any money to the plaintiff, the plaintiff cannot now reform said contract by incorporating therein an agreement to bind the defendant, otherwise than said contract stipulates, and under the terms of said contract the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. <em>Answer: </em>As I have said in regard to that, there is no doubt the contract was that these remainder people were to pay $12,000. Nobody disputes that; but they were to pay $11,000 to this lady, according to Mr. Taxis’s statement, and $1,000 to Mr. Smith. It is not put down in the conti’act any more than what the remainder-men should pay. They were to pay $12,000. The only question is, who the money ought to go to.” [3]</p>

If the jury find from the evidence that there was an • agreement on the part of the remainder people to pay the plaintiff for services rendered, as alleged in his statement of claim, that fact rebuts any contract, express or implied, on the part of the defendant to be responsible to the plaintiff, and the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant. <em>Answer : </em>All that has been explained by the testimony, that this $12,000 included the amount that they were to receive for that.” [4]</p>

Defendant not only refused to pay plaintiff said sum which he alleged she had received to his use as aforesaid, but she denied that he had been her attorney in said litigation and compromise thereof. Hence this suit to recover said one thousand dollars and interest. The burden was, of course, on plaintiff to prove the allegations on which his claim is grounded, and testimony was accordingly introduced for that purpose, and thus questions of fact were presented and properly submitted to the jury. Their verdict for plaintiff necessarily im<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>plies a finding of said facts in his favor. So far, therefore, as the controlling facts are concerned, they have been definitely settled by the verdict; and, unless there is some error in the ruling or instructions of the learned trial judge complained of, the judgment entered on the verdict should not be disturbed.</p>
