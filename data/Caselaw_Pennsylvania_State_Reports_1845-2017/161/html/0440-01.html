Stephenson, a married woman, was the owner of the land in dispute. On Sept. 17,1873, she joined her husband in executing a mortgage on the land, but her separate acknowledgment was not taken. On March 1, 1876, a sci. fa. (121 April T., 1876) was issued on the mortgage, and both Mrs. Stephenson and her husband were personally served. The return was: “ Served personally on the within named defendants by true and attested copy.” Judgment was duly obtained and a writ of levari facias was issued. The land was sold by the sheriff to John Benninghoff, to whom a sheriff’s deed was subsequently delivered. Benninghoff went into possession of the premises, from which he was ejected by Mrs. Stephenson by virtue of a writ of habere possessionem under a judgment in ejectment which she had obtained against him. Both Mrs. Stephenson and Benninghoff subsequently died. Plaintiffs were Benninghoff’s heirs and defendants were Mrs. Stephenson’s heirs.</p>
