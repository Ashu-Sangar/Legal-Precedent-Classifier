It is also averred in the said bill that the Susquehanna river, the stream <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>from which the company desires to take its supply of water, runs along and forms the eastern boundary of Lower Allen township, and there is therefore no necessity to go outside of said township to secure water therefrom.

The present location of the said company’s reservoir is on the highest point of Fort Washington, which is the only place near the town of Riverton suitable for that purpose, and the pipe now running from the said river at the point where it is proposed to erect the pumping station to the reservoir is almost straight, and pursues the best possible route that could be followed in order to reach the river. To locate the pumping station at the Susquehanna river, in Lower Allen township, opposite to Riverton, no direct line for the laying of pipe to the reservoir, as now located, is possible, because of the deep cut of the Northern Central Railroad both in East Pennsboro and Lower Allen townships, and because of the lines of the <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>Northern Central Railway and of the Cumberland Valley Railroad at Bridgeport, and a circuitous route would have to be made through solid rock and at such an enormous expense as to make it impossible for the said company to so construct its works.’</p>

It does not provide that it must be acquired by purchase. It does provide how the damage done shall be ascertained, recovered and paid when an agreement cannot be made with the owner or owners thereof. The same certainly must have been the legislative intent as to any land necessarily occupied by any buildings or machinery required for raising and introducing water into a town. It is not reasonable that legislative provision should be made for the erection of the same and yet not contemplated that necessary ground to place them upon was being provided for. However strictly the chartered power of corporations must be construed no construction is demanded which would defeat the manifest intent of an act of assembly.</p>

Suffice it to say that in the present case it appears that unless permission is given to take the water from without the township of Lower Allen and also to change the pumping station it will be impossible for the company to continue its operations. The case of Monongahela Water Company, 9 Pa. C. C. K,., 57, called to our attention, determines that a water company will not be incorporated to supply more than a single municipality, nor will an amendment be permitted to its charter giving it greater powers. What led to this legislation is therein discussed, but the case has no bearing upon the matter in contention before us.”</p>
