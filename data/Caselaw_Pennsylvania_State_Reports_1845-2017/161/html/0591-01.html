Three witnesses for the commonwealth, Peter Carey and the Farrells, testified positively that they saw the prisoner stab Gallagher.

On the part of the commonwealth the averment is of a killing by the prisoner in plain sight of the witnesses, and their testimony as to it is direct and positive. Nothing is left to inference or to deductions from circumstantial evidence. On the other hand the denial is equally direct, explicit and emphatic, and the defence charges rank perjury, and supports the charge by direct and positive testimony as to declarations made by the commonwealth’s witnesses at the time of the occurrence, absolutely irreconcilable with their testimony at the trial.</p>

The evidence was excluded as too remote in time or place, or both, to form part of the res gestae. These declarations were by the person best qualified to know the facts, and with the least inducement to distort them in any way. It is manifest that unless too remote they' were not only admissible but were of the very highest importance in the case. No fixed measure of time or distance from the main occurrence can be established as a rule to determine what shall be part of the res gestee. Each case must necessarily depend on its own circumstances to determine whether the facts offered are really part of the same continuous transaction. In the notable case of Hunter v. State, <a href="/njl/40/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="40 N.J.L. 495" data-case-ids="356087" data-case-paths="/njl/40/0495-01">40 N. J. Law, 495</a>, 538, Beasley, C.

These incidents may be separated from the act by a lapse of time more or less appreciable. . . . Their sole distinguishing feature is that they should be the necessary incidents of the litigated act; necessary in this sense, that they are part of the immediate preparations for, or emanations of such act, and are not produced by the calculated policy of the actors.” And with regard to declarations, the rule is well stated in 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 102, that if they “are made under such circumstances as will raise the reasonable presumption that they are the spontaneous utterances of thought created by or springing out of the transaction itself, and so soon thereafter as to exclude the presumption that they are the result of premeditation and design, they will be admissible as part of the res gestte.”</p>

The most specific offer was in the case of Dr. Birney. This witness was the police surgeon of the district, was at the polls and saw part at least of the occurrence. He testified that -’while he was at the door outside of the shed in which the fight took place, he heard a voice inside, which he recognized as that of Gallagher, the injured man, saying “the coon did it; ” that when Gallagher was brought out of the shed he repeated the same thing; and that witness followed him to the barber shop where he was carried, on the other side of the street and across a lot, and there dressed his wound. Witness was then asked whether Gallagher while lying on the floor of the shop had made the same or a similar declaration. This was excluded as too remote. The interval of time from the stabbing and the distance of the barber shop from the shed, do not appear with exactness, nor are they material, for it is apparent that they were not great, and that the continuity of the events was not broken. The declarations were by the party best informed and most interested, and were made at a time and place, to a person, and under circumstances, which effectually exclude the presumption that they were the result of premeditation and design. If such declarations were in fact made by Gallagher, they were the most material evidence in the case, and should have been admitted. <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>The defence renewed the same offer in connection with other witnesses.

As already said there was nothing left to inference or circumstantial evidence. If the commonwealth’s witnesses were to be believed the prisoner’s guilt was directly and conclusively proved. But if it were shown that at the time of the occurrence they had made declarations which required the jury to disbelieve or even to seriously doubt their testimony' at the trial, then there was no case at all against the prisoner.
