Or, within thirty days from the filing of any report in court, any party whose property has been taken, injured or destroyed, may appeal and demand a trial by jury, and any party interested in any assessment of damages or benefits may, within thirty days after final decree, have an appeal to the Supreme Court.” It will be noticed that the right to file exceptions to the report is given to “ any party ” — meaning, of course, any party interested in the proceeding — while the right to appeal and demand a jury trial is restricted to “ any party whose property is taken, injured or destroyed,” and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court is given to “ any party interested in any assessment of damages or benefits; ” but this right of appeal to the Supreme Court must be exercised within thirty days after final decree.

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>As it had an undoubted right to do, the Pennsylvania Steel Company, within the thirty days prescribed by the act, filed exceptions to the report of the viewers, and also within the same time appealed from said report and demanded a trial by jury. That appeal is still pending and undetermined in the court below. It involves, among other things, the determination by jury trial of the amount of damages to which the Steel Company is entitled for property taken, injured or destroyed. Unless the proceeding should pzuve to be so fatally defective as to require dismissal without consideration of the case on its mei’its, there cannot, in the nature of things, be a final decree in the case until the question of damages is first settled by the verdict of a jury, etc. The action of the court below ozi the exceptions to the viewers’ report is clearly not a final decree within the meaning of the act; and the appeal to this court has nothing else upon which it can rest. It is clearly insufficient for the reason that it does not amount to a final decree. When the questions involved in this appeal are settled and the exceptions to the award are finally disposed of by the court below, we will have a final decree, and an appeal therefrom will bring up for review the entire' case. No judgment or decree is final that does not terminate the litigation, between the parties to the suit, in that jurisdiction: St Clair County v.
