These balls are in commercial use for the purpose of protecting clothing and furs from destruction by moths. The balls are about a half inch in diameter, and as a merchantable article should be pure white; but they easily become discolored by waiting for a market, and, when in this shop-worn condition, in order to fit them for the market, they are melted down, and either again molded in balls, or the vapor from the liquid is permitted to escape into a chilled chamber called the sublime-house where it falls on the floor in pure white flakes, all the impurities remaining in the pan, and it is then ready for the market in the form of white flakes. On Aug. 3, 1892, plaintiff and four other men were engaged in pouring camphor balls out of barrels in the customary manner. They had emptied one barrel, and had about half emptied a second barrel, when, about three minutes after the first barrel had been dumped, there was an explosion, and flames burst out of the aperture into which the contents of the second barrel were being emptied, and the plaintiff was injured by the flame. The barrels of camphor <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>balls which were being emptied had been bought from another chemical company, and were in such good condition that defendants at first hesitated about melting them, but subsequently made up their minds to do so. The evidence further showed that napthaline as customarily used is absolutely nonexplosive. There was no proof as to what actually caused the explosion.</p>
