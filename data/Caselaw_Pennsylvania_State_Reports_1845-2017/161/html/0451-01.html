On two other judgments recovered on the same day writs of fieri facias were also issued and levies made.</p>

"The landlord could be preferred to the extent of one year’s rent bjr giving notice to the sheriff or his agents before the sale, but to no greater extent. The goods not being the subject of distress, the assignees could not interfere with the rights of the execution creditors by promising to pay Mr. Irvine a greater sum of rent than accrued in one year. They stood in the place of the sheriff as to the disposition of the property levied upon. It was held in Osborne’s Estate, 5 Wharton, p. 266, that the promise of assignees t® secure a landlord for rent, ‘ if he would waive his right to distrain and permit the removal of the goods,’ was valid and binding. But that case is not analogous to the one under consideration. The goods had not been seized in execution. The landlord was free to issue his warrant and distrain the property. To induce him to refrain, the agreement was made and properly enforced. In Work’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="491042" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0258-01">92 Pa. 258</a>, there was a stay of the writ by the plaintiff and possession given to the defendant to sell the goods levied upon.

Mr. Irvine evidently did make a demand upon them for the rent due him, and acquainted them with the amount of his claim. They paid him two hundred dollars on account of the same. They promised to protect him as to the balance to the same extent that he could be by a landlord’s warrant. The fact that he demanded more than the rent for one year did not debar him from recovering what he was entitled to under the act of assembly. The goods in the hands of the sheriff or his representatives were liable first to the payment of one year’s rental, and this amount must be appropriated to the landlord out of the proceeds realized from the sale thereof.”</p>
