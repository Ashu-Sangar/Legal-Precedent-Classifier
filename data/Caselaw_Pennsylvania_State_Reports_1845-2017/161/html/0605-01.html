Plaintiffs’ evidence tended to establish that defendant was employed to collect the whole claim. Defendant testified that he was employed to collect only certain matured bonds. Before the whole debt was collected, the lands were sold at a tax sale, at a price insufficient to cover the mortgage. It appeared that the attorney was present at the tax sale, and that the lands had been advertised by their warrantee names in a number of different newspapers of the county. Several members of the bar testified that when claims secured by mortgage upon unseated lands were sent to them, they regarded it as their duty to look for unpaid taxes, and watch the sales and thereupon to notify their clients of these facts. <em>Meld, </em>that the case was for the jury, and that a verdict 'for plaintiffs should be sustained.</p>

These bonds were secured by a purchase money mortgage upon the said lands, which was duly recorded on April 8, 1881, and was then and thereafter a lien upon all the tracts of land. In 1884, eight of these bonds came into the possession of the plaintiffs, and it was then their duty to use all proper means to secure the payment, and if the}'’ failed in the discharge of this duty, they would have been personally liable for any loss which might arise therefrom.</p>

Nothing, however, was done until 1891, and what was then done was fruitless, because the land had been sold in August, 1886, for taxes, and Ardell was insolvent. . . .</p>

They knew that after two years a tax sale would divest the lien of this mortgage. They took the newspapers in which all the tax sales were published. One of them was at the sale and purchased other lands for another client. They have testified that tax sales were a frequent occurrence, and that a large portion of that section of the state had been, and is, sold for taxes. And the correspondence shows that the plaintiffs urged them more than once to do something to secure the claim. They had access to the mortgage, which was of record near their office, which showed who-first derived title from the commonwealth for each of the tracts of land; and they knew that in all tax sales the land is sold as the land of the person who first derived title from the commonwealth. It is for the jury to say, upon these circumstances, and from all the evidence in the case, whether or not the defendants should have known of the sale of this land for taxes.

The defendants represented to the plaintiffs that Mr. Ardell was an enterprising business man, so honest that he paid a claim which he was not bound in law to pay; that he considered the-lands worth more than $30,000, and growing in value, and that he was going to keep them in reserve for twenty years. General Beaver, as a witness here, told you that Ardell' was a man of great energy and that he was paid his debt; and yet Ardell permitted his interest in this valuable property to be sold at sheriff’s sale for a small debt due his brother-iu-law, who became the purchaser; and there is no explanation of the necessity which compelled him to make this great sacrifice, although he was examined as a witness in this case. What is perhaps more singular is the fact the purchaser permitted this property to be sold and sacrificed for a few dollars of taxes;. <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>and there is no explanation of this transaction,- and no evidence of its necessity. It was certainly Ardell’s interest to keep this property, and there can be no doubt from the evidence that it was ample not only to pay the debt due his brother-in-law, but also ample to pay the debts due by him to the plaintiffs, and leave a considerable margin for himself. The result has been that Ardell’s interest has been lost; his brother-in-law’s interest has been lost, and there is nothing left of property said by the defendants to be worth more than $30,000 to pay the claim of the estate of the man who sold the property to Ardell. No one has profited by these transactions except the lawyer who purchased at the tax sale; and in the absence of his or other evidence the presumption is that he purchased for himself. But if this transaction was not honest it is evident that either Ardell or the purchaser at sheriff’s sale could have profited by the tax sale, as it wiped away from the property the mortgage and claim for $4,500. It is true that the jury must decide this case upon the law and the evidence, and not upon suspicious; but if the circumstances of the case, as exhibited by the evidence, impressed the jury with the honesty or dishonesty of a transaction, it is evidence for their consideration.] [8]</p>

The question at issue was eminently one of fact only and necessarily had to be submitted to the jury. The facts necessary to be established on the part of the plaintiff were clearly explained <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>to the jury and carefully submitted with proper instructions, and the jury found the facts in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[251,493,1172,1872]]]'>We think the testimony of Mr. Wain that he gave the defendants positive instructions as early as October, 1885, to bring a suit on the overdue bonds, to bring an ejectment on the mortgage in order to get possession of the lands and to obtain a writ of estrepment to stay waste, is fully borne out by the letters passing between the parties during that month. This was long before the sale of the lands for taxes, and its effect upon the matter in controversy was necessarily for the jury. Even if a nonsuit had been asked for, which was not the .case, it could not have been granted. The facts, that Mr. Gephart was present at the very tax sale at which these lands were sold, that previously to that time he had been furnished bj^ the plaintiffs with a full list of the tracts and their warrantee names, and that these identical tracts by the same warrantee names were duly advertised for sale by the treasurer of the county for unpaid taxes, in a number of different newspapers of the county, bore directly upon the very subject of the controversy and could in no circumstances be withheld from the jury. Gentlemen of the bar were examined who testified that when claims secured by mortgage upon unseated lands were sent to them they regarded it as their duty to look for unpaid taxes, and watch the sales, and thereupon to notify their clients of these facts. Nothing of the kind was done in the present case, although the defendants knew of ArdelPs insolvency before the claim was sent to them, and while they had it in charge, and they had constant difficulty in collecting the few small notes that were given by him for one of the bonds. The correspondence shows that the plaintiffs were constantly urging the collection of the notes and bonds, and the obtaining of security for their debt, and this fact also, and the inferences from it, were all for the consideration of the jury. It is not necessary to engage in a full discussion of the testimony; it is sufficient to say that it was for the exclusive determination of the jury and could not be withdrawn from them. Having carefully read the whole of it we are constrained to say that we can find no error in the manner of its submission to the jury. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
