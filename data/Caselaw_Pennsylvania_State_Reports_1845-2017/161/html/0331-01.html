It was prepared by Mr. Yail, who was one of the subscribing witnesses. She had intended to give $1,000 to St. John’s Lutheran Church, but concluded afterwards that her whole estate should go to her sister-in-law. What occurred after the signing of the will is thus narrated by Mrs. Colladay, an intimate friend, whose testimony was not contradicted in any particular: ' Mr. Yail was there; after he went away Miss Elizabeth felt very despondent, and Prudence asked her what the matter was. She said, “ I am sorry for what I have done.” Mrs. Hoffner said, “ What are you sorry about?” She said, “I wanted that to go to the Church.” Prudence said, “ Elizabeth, I give you my word, if you tell me what you want done with that, I will put it where you want it,” for, she said, “ I will never use it.” Those two ladies just lived together. Prudence assured her she would carry out her wishes in regard to St. John’s Lutheran Church, and also to the Lutheran Home, and the Lutheran Seminary.’</p>

At that time it was not known, I think, how much she had, and she -gave in that codicil $1,000 to St. John’s Church, $300 to the Lutheran Home, and $300 to the Seminaiy, she thinking that Elizabeth had left her <em>$1,600, </em>besides the house and her interest during life to Rachel Anderson, and after her death, if she left no children, to St. John’s Lutheran Church. When I came to find out for Mrs. Hoffner how much property Elizabeth had left her, I found there were two bonds; one of $700 and the other of $600. The $600 was paid off, and I don’t know who came with her, I don’t know whether it was Mrs. Colladay or not, who came to my office and directed me, for her, to pay that $600 to the Lutheran Seminary, and that was given ; so that she then had from Elizabeth Hoffner’s estate only the $700 bond, and all she had received from Elizabeth Hoffner’s estate is the $700 bond. She also got the house. You will find that I just scratched off the receipt received from the treasurers of the Home, that it was received by them during her lifetime. Q. In performance of her obligation to Elizabeth, she made a codicil of that sort and subsequently paid, during her lifetime, two of the legacies ? A. Two of them. But the only trouble was there was not enough of Elizabeth’s estate to pay the whole of $1,600. She always told me she intended giving all of Elizabeth’s estate to the Lutheran charities, but she gave $300 more than she got from Elizabeth’s estate. But the real estate also belonged to Elizabeth’s estate. Prudence has given that in her will to her niece during life, and after her niece’s death, to her children if any, and if not to St. John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church. The will makes no change, but it really abrogates a lot of legacies which had not been in her own will. She also makes a change in her residuary legatee. She had given to Rebecca W. Sparks; now she gives it to Rebecca W. Sparks’ daughter. She had very little property of her own, outside of what she got from Elizabeth. She ought to have had more, but when I came to look for it, I could not find it.’</p>

But here the gifts in the will, so far as they relate to the charity, are in the very words of the codicil to the original will. There is simply a republication, and the actual gift takes effect, so far as the question of validity as affected by the act of 1855 is concerned, as of the date of the execution of the codicil.'

Hoffner, who died some time before the year 1882. After his death, the widow and her husband’s sister, Elizabeth B. Hoffner, lived together. The sister was <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>possessed of a small estate consisting of a house and lot in Germantown, worth about $1,400, and personal securities of about the same value ; she was much older than her brother’s widow, being at her death in 1888 in her 95th year. On May 80, 1883, Elizabeth made her will, in which she gave her whole estate to her sister-in-law, this testatrix, and after her death in 1888, on probate of the will, Prudence took the estate devised and bequeathed to her. Elizabeth had intended to give $1,000 to St. John’s Lutheran Church, and $300 to each of two other church institutions, but, when she came to execute her will, bequeathed her entire estate to Prudence; then she apparently regretted the neglect of her church, and was troubled in mind because of it; on this becoming known to Prudence, she more than once assured Elizabeth, in most significant language, that she would carry out her wishes with regard to the bequest to the church, and also as to two smaller gifts of $300 each to the Lutheran Home and Lutheran Seminary. The orphans’ court finds as a fact that: “ It cannot be doubted in this ease that, but for the assurances on the part of Mrs. Hoffner, the sister-in-law would have changed the will giving everything to her, and' have thus carried out her original intention of giving directly to the charity.” Although Elizabeth survived nearly five years, no change was made in her will, and about all the property Prudence had at her death came to her under this will. After the death of Elizabeth in 1888, Prudence manifested, by a codicil to a will already made by her, an intention to fulfill her promise to Elizabeth by bequeathing $1,000 to St. John’s Church, and $300 each to the Lutheran Home and Lutheran Seminary; then follow a number of other bequests, concluding with this declaration : “ All of the above and foregoing bequests are to be in memory of my sister-in-law, Elizabeth B. Hoffner, who died- February 12,1888, in the 95th year of her age.” On May 20 and May 21, 1889, she paid the intended legacies of $300 each to the Home and Seminary. She made no change, however, in the disposition of her estate as directed in the codicil until two days before her death, on May 24,1892, when a new will was executed, disposing of her whole estate, only the second, third and sixth items of which will are important in this contention. The second is as follows :</p>

Vail, Esq., was appointed executor of the will, and filed his account, showing a balance for distribution to legatees of $1,028.49. On distribution by Penrose, auditing judge, the residuary legatee, Rachel C. Anderson, contended that the bequest of $1,000 in the second item having been made for a religious use “ within one calendar month before the decease of testator,” it was avoided by the act of 26th of April, 1855, and by the same act went to her as residuary legatee. Her claim was disallowed. The auditing judge was of opinion that, as the will of May 24, 1892, contained no words of revocation, it only revoked the codicil of April 12, 1888, so far as its provisions were inconsistent with those of the codicil; and that the latter will, so far as concerned the legacy in the second item, being identical with those words making the same gift in the codicil, as to that part, was only a republication of the codicil, and the actual gift took effect as of the date of the codicil, therefore is not avoided by the act of 1855. He further held that, on the facts as found by him, the gift was good, because made in fulfillment of a promise to the original owner, Elizabeth Hoffner, through which promise testatrix acquired the property ; that thereby she incurred an obligation which equity <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>would have enforced, had she not voluntarily performed it. He therefore directed the payment of $1,000, as bequeathed in the second item of the will, subject to the collateral inheritance tax, and the remainder, if any, to the residuary legatee. On exceptions being filed by this appellant, they were overruled by the orphans’ court, and the report of the auditing judge confirmed for the reasons given by him. From that decree, the residuary legatee appeals to this court.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[186,794,1174,1075]]]'>We think the orphans’ court was in error in holding that as the legacy in the second item was identical with that in the codicil, the will as to that bequest was a mere republication of the codicil, and as the bequest in the will was inoperative only because of the act of 1855, the' codicil was effective. While not questioning the rule that a second will which fails because of defective execution, does not revoke a legacy in a former will, in harmony with that in the one which fails, yet here in the codicil containing the bequest in supposed harmony, there was no residuary clause; the residuary legatee in the will of 1882, to which the codicil was appended, was another than the one named in the will before us. The first will and codicil were, therefore, fatally inconsistent with the last one. But, independent of any rule of construction, the act of 1855 does not permit us to seek for a legatee under some former will made more than a calendar month before death. If the bequest here is invalid, it is because tbe statute so declares, and for no other reason; if for that reason, then the same statute declares where it shall go, “ to the residuary legatee or devisee.” That would give it to this appellant, the residuary legatee, unless the claim of the church can be sustained independent of the void will.</p>

Although there was an absence of all fraud on the part of Prudence Hoffner in obtaining this estate, it was none the less a trust.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[259,1105,1173,969]]]'>The court has found as a fact that the entire property of Elizabeth was obtained by Prudence, upon an express promise to give this $1,000 to the church. Without such promise, Elizabeth, having full power so to do, would herself have directed the disposition of it. There is no exception to this finding of fact by appellant. If equity would declare and enforce a trust thus created, as the authorities from Hoge v.

The fund for distribution is the same that passed from Elizabeth to Prudence on the faith of the promise; the promise was recognized by Prudence in the codicil of April 12, 1888, made soon after the death of Elizabeth; she again acknowledged it in this will, which fails of effect through no fault of hers. She acknowledged it in the payments during life to the Home and Seminary. But the promise remains in respect to the $1,000 in all its binding moral and legal force, although this particular method of performing it is invalid.</p>

The two wills cannot stand together, and the prior one was therefore revoked. The mere fact of the identity of the bequest in contention here with that in the codicil of 1888, will not save the latter, nor give it a present standing as of the date when it was written. The codicil was revoked with the rest of the will, and the bequest must stand or fall with the will of 1892. As a part of that, it is clearly in violation of the act of 1855. Such I understand to be the opinion of the court.</p>

This is putting it in the strongest possible way, a way'that I do not think the evidence justifies, and that I could not concede except as a mere step in the argument. But so conceding it, the conclusion does not seem to me to follow, because the statute plainly and peremptorily prohibits the payment of moral obligations in that way. It is probable that very few bequests are made to churches or religious uses except under a feeling of moral obligation for benefits received, either spiritual or temporal or both. The law recognizes such bequests as valid, but requires them to be made when the judgment is clear, and the obligation is not sharpened or exaggerated by the terrors of impending death. To allow such a <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>bequest, made within the prohibited time, to be sustained by calling it an obligation which equity would have enforced, is simply to evade the statute. I do not understand that equity, even under the benign administration of the longest footed chancellor, undertakes to enforce moral obligations in the length and breadth of the Golden Rule, and it is important that we should keep its boundaries carefully marked. The bequest of Prudence Hoffner to the church was either a voluntary gift, or the performance of a legal obligation. It was put in the form of a gift, and in that form it was peremptorily made void by statute. If it was to be enforced as an obligation, the church should be required to file its bill, prove the consideration, the contract or trust, and the failure to perform, as in other cases. Then we should have the case freed from the confusion of moral and legal obligations, and without the danger of sanctioning a violation of the statute under the guise of enforcing a duty.</p>
