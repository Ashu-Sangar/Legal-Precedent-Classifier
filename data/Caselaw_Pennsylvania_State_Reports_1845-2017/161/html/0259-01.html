The general doctrine regarding the right to follow trust funds is thus stated in 2 Stoiy, Eq. Jur. §§ 1258, 1259, 13th ed.: ‘ The general proposition which is maintained both at law and in equity upon this subject is, that if any property in its original state and form is covered with a trust in favor of the principal, no change of that state and form can divest it of such trust or give the agent or trustee converting it, or those who represent him in right (not being purchasers for value without notice), any more valid claim in respect to it than they respectively had before such change. ... It matters not in the slightest degree into whatever other form different from the original the change may have been made, whether it be that of promissory notes, or of goods, or of stock; for the product of the substitute for the original thing still follows the nature of the thing itself, so long as it can be ascertained to be such. The right ceases only when the means of ascertainment fails.’ See also Bisph. Eq. § 86; Farmers etc. Bank v. King, <a href="/pa/57/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="57 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1010455" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0202-01">57 Pa. 202</a>; Sadler’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/87/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="87 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1057889" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0154-01">87 Pa. 154</a>; Sheetz v.

Dyer, 1 L. C. in Eq. *250, Bl. ed. If, therefore, when these drafts were accepted, F. V. Rockafellow had withdrawn so much money from the general funds of the bank and had invested it in other property, this would have been a very plain ease for the application of the rule' above stated. So, also, there would be no difficulty, if he had placed the money in an envelope, or had otherwise set it apart and designated it; and, in that case, the fact that some of the bills or coins were taken out and others put in their place would not destroy the substantial identity of the fund, so as to prevent the cestui que trust from following and recovering it. ‘In regard to money, substantial identity is not oneness of pieces of coin or of bank bills. If an agent to collect money puts the money collected into a chest where he has money of his own, he does not thereby make it all his own, and convert himself into a mere debtor to his principal. The principal may, by the <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>law, claim out of the chest the sum which belonged to him before the admixture: ’ Pennell v. Deffell, 4 De G., M. &amp; G. 372, quoted with approval in Farmers Bank v. King, <a href="/pa/57/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="57 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="1010455" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0202-01">57 Pa. 202</a>. But in this case no money was added to the assets of the bank, and no part of the money in bank was separated or set apart or in any way appropriated to the payment of the drafts, and, so far as appears, the assignor did nothing to indicate an intention on his part to treat any portion of the funds in bank as different from the remaining deposits. Assuming that, at the time the drafts were accepted and the accounts of the drawees were charged therewith, he had on hand sufficient money which he could rightfully apply to their payment (a fact, which, by the way, does not affirmatively appear), his failure to remit the amount to the drawers was a breach of duty, but it does not necessarily follow that the funds in bank, much less subsequent deposits, became impressed with a trust or charge in favor of the drawers which would give them a preference on distribution. A trust creditor is not entitled to preference over general creditors of the insolvent merely on the ground of the nature of the claim. To authorize such a preference, some specific recognized equity founded on agreement or relation of the debt to the assigned property must be shown, which entitles the claimant, according to equitable principles, to preferential payment: Matter of Cavin v. Gleason, 105 N. T. 256. The plaintiffs therefore must show something more than a breach of duty on the part of their agent in order to put their claim in relation to the fund which went into the hands of the assignee on a different footing from those of other depositors. In determining whether they have shown such title to the portion of the cash assets claimed by them as entitles them to the relief prayed for, it should be remembered that this is not the case of a trustee mingling trust money with his own, and therefore we are of opinion that the decisions relating to a charge or lien on the whole fuud in such a case do not apply.</p>

These as well as the other cases belonging to the same class are elaborately considered in Phila. Nat’l Bank v. Dowd, 2 L. R. An. 480, where it was held that if a bank, on receiving from another bank commercial paper ‘ for collection and immediate return,’ makes the collection and mingles the money collected with its general funds, and thereafter becomes insolvent, having cash on hand sufficient to cover such collection, the fund collected must be held to have so lost its identity that the cash on hand will not be impressed with a trust lien in favor of the bank for which the collection was made as against general creditors. We are not required to go so far as that in this case, but we cannot escape the conclusion that the doctrine of the Wisconsin cases is a departure from the rule laid down in Story, which has thus far been adhered to by the courts of our own state, and goes beyond anything actually decided in the celebrated case of Knatchbull v. Hallett, 13 Ch. Div. 696. In Thompson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/22/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="22 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="413720" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0016-01">22 Pa. 16</a>, it appeared that an individual, as executor, received, moneys which he used in his own business, and, also being otherwise indebted, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The court below held that the heirs of the decedent were entitled to a preference. The Supreme Court, after quoting the rule laid down in Story, said: ‘ It is impossible for a chancellor to lay his hand upon a single article of property, or on a single dollar of money included in the assignment and say that any particular thing or sum of money is either the original property of Seth Matthews’s heirs or the product of it. The decree below was therefore erroneous.’ This case and the principle upon which it was decided were recognized in People’s Bank’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/93/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="93 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="442037" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0107-01">93 Pa. 107</a>; and in Hopkins’s Appeal, 8 Cent. R. 860; the point expressly decided was that where there is a failure <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>to trace trust funds into any specific property of the trustee, they are not entitled to priority of payment over the claims of other creditors. In Cavin v. Gleason, <a href="/ny/105/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="105 N.Y. 256" data-case-ids="2208698" data-case-paths="/ny/105/0256-01">105 N. Y. 256</a>, it was decided that the use of the funds to pay debts does not entitle the principal or cestui que trust to such preference. See also Milligan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/82/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="82 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1047959" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0389-01">82 Pa. 389</a>; Cross’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="97 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="444768" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0471-01">97 Pa. 471</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[245,694,1173,1577]]]'>“ The case we have supposed for the purpose of illustration is not more unfavorable to the plaintiffs than the case at bar. When the assignor charged these drafts against the accounts of the drawees he canceled so much of his indebtedness to them, but did not add a dollar to the fund in bank. It is true his estate was benefited by the transaction, because his indebtedness was thereby reduced, but as he was insolvent at the time such benefit to the estate only equaled the pro rata shares which would have been awarded to the drawees on distribution. If a preferred lien or charge upon the fund in bank is to be recognized upon the ground of the benefit received by the estate or fund through the transaction, such lien or charge ought to be measured by the benefit actually received, and not by the benefit which it would have received, if the fund had been increased by a deposit of an amount equivalent to the amount of the drafts. But if we hold to the rule that, to entitle one claiming to be a trust creditor to preference, he must trace the ■trust money into some specific property, or into some particular fund or account of the assignor with which the latter has mingled it, we think the plaintiffs have failed, because they have not'shown that the assignor received any money as the proceeds of the drafts which he added to and mingled with the general mass of deposits in bank, or that any part of the money in bank was ever set apart, or in any manner appropriated to the payment of the drafts.

Y. 269</a>, is so closely analogous to this case that we think it maj be referred to as sustaining this conclusion.

If at the time of the assignment the plaintiffs’ notes had been found by the assignee uncollected, he should have returned them. If a draft or bond or a specific package of money received in paj^ment of the notes had been found among the assets coming into his hands, it should have been turned over to the plaintiffs. But neither the notes, nor any security nor sum of money received in payment of them came into his hands. He holds nothing which he or the plaintiffs can identify with the notes or trace as a payment of them. This is clearly pointed out in the opinion of the learned judge of the court below, and we think the case may very properly be affirmed upon his opinion.</p>
