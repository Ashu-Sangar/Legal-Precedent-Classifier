The district attorney, with the consent of the court, has withdrawn the charge of murder of the first degree and asks only for conviction of murder of the second degree or of voluntary manslaughter, either of which you may find if the evidence warrants it. The unlawful killing of a person otherwise than by means of poison or of lying in wait or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing — but with malice suddenly produced —is murder of the second degree. Manslaughter is the unlawful and felonious killing of another without malice either express or implied. Where, upon a sudden quarrel, two persons fight and one kills the other, it is manslaughter; so if a man be greatly provoked by gross indignity and immediately upon the first transport of passion kills his aggressor, it is manslaughter. In these and such like cases, the law kindly appreciating the infirmities of human nature, extenuates the offence committed and mercifully hesitates to put upon the same footing of guilt the cool, deliberate act and the result of hasty passion and action. Manslaughter lies where the injury producing death was inflicted with a design and purpose to kill. But only in the heat of passion or without malice. It also lies where death results unintentionally, so far as the defendant is concerned, from an unlawful act on his part. The law of this state punishes the'first offence of murder of the second degree with imprisonment by separate and solitary confinement at labor not exceeding twenty years, and voluntary manslaughter by imprisonment by separate and solitary confinement at labor (or by simple imprisonment) not exceeding twelve years — in the discretion of the court — and by a fine not exceeding one. thousand dollars, and demands security for good behavior during life or for any less time, according to the nature and enormity of the offence.</p>

That Gallagher and Silcox drank together. That at one place drink was refused Silcox, who offered in payment bread tickets ; but that he subsequently procured a pint of liquor, a portion of which — if we recollect aright — and if we mis-reeite any part of the testimony, we ask to be corrected — was drunk and the rest taken by Silcox to his <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>house, whither he was accompanied by the deceased; that upon the afternoon or evening of that day the report of a gun was heard by the neighbors or by persons being at the time near the house of Silcox; that Gallagher came out of Silcox’s house and went into the house (adjoining) of Edward — Ted or Teddy as the witnesses say — Lewis, where he said that he had been shot or that he was hurt; that persons, upon hearing that report, approached, saw that the deceased was wounded, helped him to a chair or in a position to have his leg washed; and that a physician was sent for. Hollister testifies to washing the leg and Mrs. Beddoeta that she brought water for that purpose. These witnesses (and others) testify as to their care for the wounded man, and the physicians who attended him describe his condition. Dr. Kimmerer, who dressed the wound and had charge of the patient till his death, and who was present at the autopsy or post-mortem examination of the body of the deceased, underwent a thorough examination in chief and an especially searching cross-examination as to the wound, his treatment of the patient, the progress of the disease, septicaemia or blood poisoning, and the state of the thoracic and of the abdominal viscera after death. Drs. Thompson and Voorhees also described these matters, or some of them. Dr. Curry was called, but he merely acted as recorder of the autopsy. All the physicians who took part in the actual post-mortem examination of the remains had also been in consultation on the patient’s case before his death; and they practically agree that he died from septicaemia, that is, blood poisoning, superinduced by this gunshot wound, or this wound as they describe it — as if made by shot or some round bodies from a gun. In fact the witnesses for the defense''have proved to you, and counsel on behalf of the defendant admit, that it was a gunshot wound that was received by the deceased. They prove the kind of gun — a single-barrel, breech-loading shot-gun. No doubt the missile discharged from the gun was shot. The gun had been loaned at some time previous to a stepbrother or half-brother; who, after he was done using it, carried it (loaded with a shell) to his home, and whose mother carried it to the house of Silcox a few days or a short time before this unfortunate occurrence took place. The defendant’s evidence, if believed, shows that the gun was placed, still loaded, in the back part of his house, and we think between the cupboard and the stairway.</p>

When a person apprehends that he is thus at the point of death, when every motive to falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth, the law in its wisdom considers such situations as creating an obligation equal to that imposed by a positive oath administered in a court of justice.</p>

All the specifications except the first and twelfth allege error in the instructions. The first specification complains that the record prior to the amendment of February 17,1894, did not show the presence of the defendant at every stage of the proceedings which resulted in his conviction. That he was present during the trial and when the sentence was pronounced, and that full opportunity for the exercise of all his rights in relation to both was accorded to him, is not denied. The^specification therefore rests on the common law doctrine that in capital cases the record must show affirmatively that the prisoner was present at every stage of- the proceedings against him. The contention of the defendant based thereon is that although he was actually present he is entitled to a new trial because the clerk neglected to note his presence on the record. In the light of the undisputed facts there is no real merit in this contention; it is purety technical and it ought not to prevail unless the amendment which made the record conform to the fact was unauthorized. We think the amendment was clearly within and a proper exercise of the power of the court. It simply supplied a clerical omission and placed the record in this particular in harmony with the fact. It excluded the possibility of an inference from the record opposed to the truth of the case, but it did not deprive the defendant of any substantial right. What right had he to require that a defect in the record arising from an oversight of the clerk in keeping it and which left room for an inference hostile to the undisputed facts, should be perpetuated for his benefit? He neither lost nor acquired anything by the defect which prevented the correction of it in accordance with these facts. There was nothing in the nature or character of the defect or in the circumstances of the case which placed <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>it beyond the power of amendment. This power was. not taken away or impaired by the appeal to this court. Dougherty v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/69/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="69 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1026544" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0286-01">69 Pa. 286</a> ; Brown v.

    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[165,624,1162,710]]]'>The twelfth specification alleges error in the admission of the dying declarations of the deceased. These declarations were objected to on the ground that the commonwealth had not laid sufficient ground for introducing them. It appeared t-o the court from the testimony of the witness to-whom they were made that the deceased “ was in his right mind,” and conscious that his death was imminent at the time he made them. It would have been more satisfactory perhaps if stronger and clearer evidence of the mental capacity of the deceased had preceded their admission. But no suggestion came from the defendant’s counsel that the deceased was not “in his right mind” when the declarations were made, and as there was a prima facie showing that they were competent, we cannot convict the learned court of error in admitting them.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[160,1341,1168,1117]],["BL_526.1",526,[303,407,1162,343]]]'>The eighth specification is founded upon the refusal of the court to affirm without qualification the defendant’s first point, which was as follows: “If the jury believe the testimony of Mrs. Bedow, of Nelson Hollister, Alexander Zendall, Robert Reese, William Shultze, Henry Magill and Lafayette Van Gilder, that the deceased made declarations, at the time of the shooting and subsequently thereto, that the shooting was accidental, and contradictory of his dying declarations, such declarations are to be taken into consideration by the jury, and if true then there should be an acquittal.” In answer to this point the learned judge said: “We affirm the point so far— their testimony to such declarations should be carefully considered. But the further part of the point proceeding thus, ‘ and if true there should be an acquittal,’ we cannot affirm.” He then proceeded to explain to the jury why it could not be affirmed, and from his explanation it is obvious that he misapprehended the point. The declarations referred to were that the shooting was accidental, and he was asked to say that if they were true then there should be an acquittal. If the declarations were true the shooting was accidental, and if it was, we cannot conceive upon rvhat theory of or evidence in the case there could be a conviction of murder or voluntary man<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>slaughter. The answer to the point in question amounted to an instruction that, although the jury were satisfied from the evidence in the case that the shooting was accidental, they might convict the defendant of the cz'ime charged in the indictment. We are clearly satisfied that the instruction complained of in the eighth specification was erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[304,766,1162,659]]]'>The second, third, fourth, ninth, tenth and eleventh specifications need not be separately considered or discussed in this opinion. We discover nothing in them which calls for a reversal of the judgment. In some respects at least the rights of the commonwealth and the accused were mutual; they were jointly and severally entitled to have a fair trial of the issue between them, and a decision of it upon the evidence elicited on such trial. A denial of this right is a wrong done to the party deprived of it. A verdict which disregards the evidence and is founded upon the prejudices or the sympathies of the jurors is such a wrong, and we should not be astute to discover defects in an instruction obviously intended to prevent the perpetration of it.</p>

We do not discover in this review any positive misstatement of the evidence, but we do think that while the learned judge gave due prominence to the evidence on the part of the commonwealth, he inadvertently failed to bring to the attention of the jury, as he should have done, the testimony relied on by the defendant to establish his claim that the occurrence under investigation was purely accidental. It showed the existence of intimate and friendly relations between the deceased and the accused, and their declarations and conduct immediately after the shooting, which tended to negative an inference of ill will or a quarrel between them at the time of it. These were important matters which should have been clearly and distinctly presented in the charge, so that the jury in their deliberations might give to them such consideration and weight as they deserved. But they were not so presented. At no place in the charge was there anything more than a perfunctory reference to them, and then it was obscured by a prominent presentation in immediate connection therewith of some part of the commonwealth’s testimony. In other words, the manner and connection in which the reference was made was quite likely to lead the jury to infer that the defendant’s evidence was comparatively unimportant in the decision of the issue they were sworn to try.</p>
