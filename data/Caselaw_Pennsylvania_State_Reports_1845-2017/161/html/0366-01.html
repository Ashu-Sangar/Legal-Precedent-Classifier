    <p class="summary" id="b394-8" data-blocks='[["BL_394.14",394,[256,1352,1171,911]]]'>The evidence was to the following effect: The Penns Valley Banking Co. purchased the store property of I. J. Grenoble at sheriff’s sale, and afterwards sold it to Henry Krumrine. The latter sold the property to defendants, they agreeing to pay the purchase money due from Krumrine to the bank. Defendants accordingly gave to the bank their judgment note for $6,000, being the note in suit, and the bank received it and credited it on Krumrine’s indebtedness. Judgment was entered upon this note. The petition to open the judgment averred that Grenoble, acting as plaintiff’s agent, procured the transfer of the property to defendants with the agreement that, after the payment of the indebtedness to the bank out of the business, Grenoble should have whatever was left. Plaintiff denied this; and the agreement of sale, which was in writing, showed no such arrangement. The court found that Grenoble acted as agent for defendants in the purchase of the store, and that the bank took the note and applied it to Krumrine’s debt in good faith. The rule was accordingly discharged.</p>
