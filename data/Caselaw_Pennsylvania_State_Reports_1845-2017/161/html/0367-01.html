They gave a mortgage for part of the purchase money. One of the partners became insolvent and his interest in the firm was sold at sheriff’s sale, and bought by his wife. The object of the partnership was to make railroad ties from the timber on the land held in common. The purchaser at the sheriff’s sale and the other two partners continued this business. Subsequently the interest of the insolvent partner in the land was sold at sheriff’s sale, and bought in by one of the original partners. The two original partners then used the firm’s money to pay off the mortgage on the land, and subsequently sold the land and divided the proceeds. <em>Held, </em>that the application of the firm’s money for the payment of the mortgage was improper, and that the purchaser of the insolvent’s interest in the firm was entitled to share in the proceeds of the sale of the land.</p>

About the same time the said parties entered into an agreement in writing, forming a copartnership under the firm name of Harris, Gage &amp; Co., for the purpose of engaging in buying and selling white oak and rock oak, railroad cross- and switch-ties along the line of the Bedford division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Huntingdon. &amp; Broadtop Railroad, and to cut, saw and manufacture into lumber, chestnut wood, paper wood, cord wood, bark and ties, all timber on said “ Cove ” tract.

The articles of. copartnership are only binding in so far as the conditions, relations and rights of the partners remain unchanged. The'provision that the profits of the business should be applied to the payment of the debts of the real estate was based on the consideration that it was the joint property of all the partners; when the interest in the partnership became the property of one person, while the title to the real estate vested in another, this provision was no longer applicable. The provisions in an article of copartnership, however worded, must be so construed, if possible, as to defeat any attempt of one or more of the partners to avail themselves of it for the purpose of advancing their own interests at the expense of their copartner. The utmost good faith is due from every member of a partnership toward every other member.</p>

Gage and F. Rosenberg, but at that time was the property of Carl M. Gage and F. Rosenberg alone. The money belonged to the firm of Harris, Gage &amp; Co., and we think could not be applied to the payment of a debt against the real estate belonging to but two members of that firm; at least that part of it which belonged to Mrs. Harris could not.

The copartnership was formed for the express purpose <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>of manufacturing the timber into lumber by the partnership. It was thus severed from the land and converted to the uses of the firm. Hence when Mrs. Harris purchased her husband’s interest in the partnership, she obtained his interest as a partner, or his partnership interest in the timber, and this was so recognized by both Rosenberg and Gage, in continuing the lumbering business with her as a partner after the sale, and converting the lumber into money, and covering the same into the common treasury of the firm.
