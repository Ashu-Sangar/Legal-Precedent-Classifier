The foregoing offers were objected to for the following reasons: (1) Because the inquest held upon this petition is illegal, void and without any authority of law, for the reason that the inquest was held by an associate judge, without any ground appearing in the proceedings therefor. (2) Because the return of the jury of inquest is insufficient in law, inasmuch as it fails to set forth how long the said Rebecca J. Royer was a lunatic; and also fails to set forth what estate or property she was possessed or seized of; and further fails to set forth the names of her next of kin, as is required by the act of June 13,1836. (3) Because there does not appear in this proceeding any appraisement of the estate of Rebecca J. Royer or interest of Rebecca J. Royer in the estate of her deceased father, John W. Royer; and if the proceedings adjudging her a lunatic were otherwise legal and valid, the bond filed in this case is insufficient and amounts to no security whatever for any particular estate belonging to the said Rebecca J.

This decree is conclusive in this proceeding. If there were errors in that proceeding, they might have been taken advantage of by an appeal; but no appeal having been taken and the court having competent jurisdiction both of the person and the subject-matter, we cannot set aside that decree at this day.

    <p class="summary" id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.5",382,[257,901,1175,1528]]]'>Plaintiff objected to the various items of the offer as follows : (1) Because the first petition was not the petition of Rebecca J. Royer, whose interest is in controversy in this suit, nor any one for her or on her behalf, nor any one interested legally in her estate. (2) Because the petition for citation was not filed by Rebecca J. Royer, nor any one for her or on her behalf, nor any one legally entitled to receive her estate. (3) Because Rebecca J. Royer was not a party to the petition for additional security, neither was any one a party to those proceedings who was legally entitled to recover the same at that time. (4) Because at the time of filing the account Henry Royer, the accountant, had disregarded an order of the court, inasmuch as he had neglected to file the bond as required by the court in its order of August 24, <em>1891; </em>and for the further reason that the accountant failed and neglected to include in said account all the moneys embraced in said recognizance upon which this suit is founded, particularly the share of Rebecca J. Royer in the ■dower fund. (5) Because the auditor’s report nowhere shows how or when Henry Royer, one of the defendants in this suit, received the share of Rebecca J. Royer in the dower fund included in the recognizance upon which this suit is founded, and because Henry Royer in no way admits that he received the ■said fund, the auditor’s report amounting simply to an admission on the part of his counsel. It is further objected to because such admission on the part of his counsel is made after Henry Royer had made default, and failed to file the bond in accordance with the decree of the court. Lastly, the whole •offer is objected to because all the items thereof are transactions between Henry Royer and other persons than Rebecca J. Royer, and they can in no manner estop her or her estate.</p>

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>By the Court: The petition of certain counsel for a rule on the committee to file new security in 1891, and the decree of the court thereon not having been complied with by the committee, is immaterial in this case; and therefore, by reason of the failure of the committee to comply therewith, we cannot see its pertinence to this issue. We therefore exclude that portion of the offer. The evidence already received by the court shows that when the committee was appointed he gave bond in the sum of $4,000, and he seems to have given a new bond in 1886, as stated in the offer. With the exception of the portion just rejected, we receive the evidence as evidence in the settlement of the estate of Rebecca J. Royer, by her committee, Henry Royer, in pursuance of his appointment as her committee. To which ruling the plaintiff excepts and a bill is sealed. [2]</p>
