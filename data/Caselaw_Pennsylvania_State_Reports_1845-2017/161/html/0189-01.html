Considerable sums of money were paid to her for her support directly by the firm, weekly or monthly, as her necessities required. Other large amounts were paid out by the trustees for taxes, etc., but, according to the will, charged to the income to which the widow was entitled. Other large amounts were paid by the •firm, and deducted from the profits or income to which she was entitled, and expended by the trustees for the benefit of the residuary estate, by investing the same in completing the two large dwelling houses which were commenced by her husband previous to his death.

Ten accounts covering a period of twenty-two years had so considered it, and the contrary had never been alleged by any one. Besides, Mrs. Levj^ must be presumed to have been familiar with the terms of her husband’s will, as she was ,not only an executrix and trustee thereof, but the principal beneficiary under its provisions. She knew that while her husband had provided for her liberally, .and placed no limit upon the amount of the income she might use during her life, yet he had provided in his will that she •should not have power to dispose of any part or portion thereof <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>by any last will and testament sbe might make, but that so much thereof as was not consumed by her was to be considered as a part of his residuary estate. Now, while it is true that this provision has since been declared inoperative, yet the fact remains that it was accepted as a valid provision of the will of Mr. Levy by all concerned for upwards of twenty .years. Mrs. Levy, therefore, must have understood that while she had the right to use all the income if she desired, she had no right to dispose of any portion of it not so used by any last will and testament. Is it probable then, that in the face of this prohibition, which she regarded as valid, she meant by her will to deliberately violate the provisions of her husband’s will, and do that which, as she understood his will, she had no right to do ?</p>

It is his opinion that all she intended by her will was to dispose of her household furniture, horses, carriages, etc., which were absolutely her own property under her husband’s will, and whatever money she might have in the house or otherwise about her. That this was her intention is evident from several considerations.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[256,1387,1168,711]]]'>“ She had been in the habit of dividing the money which she received from the firm with her three daughters, and if at the time of her death there was any on hand she meant that it should be so divided. To dispose of this money and her household furniture was the purpose of her will. In speaking of Edward she said: “ I do not mention anything further for him as I know he would not care for any of my furniture.” She does not say that he would not care for any of her money or estate, as she would have said if she had thought that she had any to dispose of, and intended to exclude him from participation therein. All that the testatrix was thinking about was her household furniture and cash on hand. The language of the will is such as to preclude the idea that she thought she had any other estate or that she meant to dispose of any other.</p>

If any money not disposed of ’ is the first one, and ‘ any sum of money I <em>may have </em>by me ’ in the other two. This can hardly be the language of a person who is disposing of an estate of |160,000, particularly an old lady, 'not in business, and with no possibility of creditors. She would not be likely to write her will so as to throw a doubt over the question as to whether any estate might be left for division.</p>

But this, idea is negatived by the fact that there was no surplus income to her credit, it was to the credit of her husband’s residuary estate, and if it had been to her credit she was prevented by the terms of his will from making any testamentary disposition of it. Besides, the bequest is limited to money ‘by me.’ This must mean the money she had in her hands or possession. She uses the words ‘ to my credit ’ the first time, but in all three subsequent references to the money it is the money ‘ by me.’ We must use words according to their generally accepted meaning, and the word ‘by’ generally means ‘near,’ ‘close to,’ etc. While it may have other meanings in other connections, yet in this case it seems to the auditing judge it can mean nothing else than the money she had in her possession.</p>

This is true. But in this case the testatrix did by her will dispose of all the estate that she supposed that she possessed. The portion thereof that is the subject of this present account fell into the hands of her administratrix three years after her death. The ownership of this property or the right to dispose of the same by will was something that the testatrix never dreamed of. It is fair to presume that if she had thought she was disposing of this large estate she would have had her will prepared in a more formal manner. Be that as it may, the fact remains that the testatrix thought she had <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>disposed of all she possessed, and therefore the rule above invoked can hardly have any application to the present case.</p>

She did not give him any of her furniture because she said he did not want any, but in the very first line of her will she speaks of. her dear children, and expresses her confidence in them, and there is no reason to believe anything else than that they were all equally dear to her, and that she had the same affection for each.”</p>

She does not even declare that the papers which she signs compose her last will, but says, simply, that, to the extent mentioned in them, ‘ These few lines will make my wishes known, and I feel sure my dear children will be agreeable to them and see that they are faithfully earned out ’ — a feeling she would scarcely have entertained if she intended that one of her children should have no share in the most considerable part of her estate.</p>

Those words did not purport to include anything but money, and the immediate context in each instance is of such a character as to preclude the possibility of attributing to her any other intent than to make a gift of money <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>distinctively as such. The great bulk of the estate to which she was entitled at the time of her death had in it no money at all. It consisted of a number of items of property, not one of which was money in any sense. While it is perfectly true that the word money may, when so intended by the testator, include any kind of property, even land, it can never have that effect when the text of the testament clearly shows it was not so intended. We concur with, the opinion of the majority of the court below, and, substantially for the reasons there expressed, we affirm the decree.</p>
