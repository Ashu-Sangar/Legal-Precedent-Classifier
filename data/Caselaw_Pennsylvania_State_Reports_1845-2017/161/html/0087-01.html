He is only to make ordinary repairs, but so far as the barn and the pig pen are concerned I say to you that there is nothing before you which would justify you in deducting anything from the rent by reason of the defective roof or by reason of having the pig pen in an improper condition.” [7]</p>

But I cannot say that he either said that she should go or should not go, but she was there, and so far as this testimony goes there is no evidence that he requested her to go or that he demanded of her that she should vacate those rooms.
