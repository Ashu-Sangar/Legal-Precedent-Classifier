There was also evidence that the father had stated to defendants that he had transferred his store to his son in order to prevent other creditors from levying upon it. There was testimony for defendants that they had consulted counsel, and had been advised to issue the execution. <em>Held, </em>that the ease was for the jury.</p>

Birch, who kept a store on Frankford avenue, Phila. Early in March, S. R. Birch transferred his store and its contents to plaintiff, who was his son. There was evidence that the father notified defendants that he had sold out to his son, and had no further connection with the business. Plaintiff testified that in response to a postal card he had called upon defendants after the sale, and that he had been requested by them to assume his father’s indebtedness. It was not denied that after the sale defendants sold and delivered to plaintiff various goods. Under objection and exception by plaintiff, one of the Conrow Brothers testified that, after they had received the letter from the father, the father called at their store, “ and he said that he made this transfer to the son simply to prevent a creditor pushing him, and to close him out to protect the other creditors; and that he would have some money for us the next day our young man would call.”</p>

The only inference that can be fairly drawn from the verdict is that the controlling facts were found in plaintiff’s favor. It follows, therefore, that the judgment entered on the verdict should not be disturbed unless there is error in the instructions complained of in the specifications.
