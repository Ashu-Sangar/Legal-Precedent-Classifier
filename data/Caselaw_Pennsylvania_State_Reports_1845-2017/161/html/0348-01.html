An offer of evidence has been made by the defendant to show a composition or agreement between creditors — not an agreement between defendant and creditors but an agreement between creditors themselves — by the offer of a circular letter dated May 26, 1892, together with a letter signed by this plaintiff dated July 16, 1892. The evidence fails to show that there is any consideration for the circular letter of May 26, 1892; and the evidence further fails to show that all creditors or mortgage bondholders assented thereto. The evidence further fails to show that The Iron Car Equipment Co. ever did any act securing or issuing preferred stock according to the proposition contained in the circular letter. We therefore think that this offer neither shows composition or demand, nor is it a bar to plain<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>tiff’s right to recover judgment, which is but the liquidation of the amount due on his coupons. If the defendant company, who is not a party to this circular letter, has an equity arising out of any composition between creditors, it is an equity which would appeal to the equitable powers of this court, which could be properly enforced in restraining execution upon the judgment ; but in no event would it prevent the plaintiff from having the amount of accrued interest liquidated by a verdict of the jury. We therefore overrule this offer of evidence and seal a bill for the defendant. [2]</p>
