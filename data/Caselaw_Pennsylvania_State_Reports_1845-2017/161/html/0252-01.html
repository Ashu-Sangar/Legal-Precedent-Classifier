    <p class="summary" id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[156,1393,1166,1013]],["BL_284.1",284,[262,372,1162,493]]]'>“ In Com. v. Wilson, the court, by Read, J., says, p. 69 : ‘ The sale (sheriff’s sale) in this case under the junior judgment was subject to the lien of the first mortgage and of the whole debt secured by it, and no part of the proceeds of that sale should have been applied to the payment of the judgments on the mortgage bonds.’ But to us it seems clear that the death of the debtor here gave these claimants a lien on any fund secured by the administrator independent of his record lien. In the Penn Square case the court says ‘ that the mortgagee whose title is unaffected has no right to come upon the fund produced bj’' the sale, is too clear for 'argument.’ In the report of that case there is no mention of any bond, and in the absence of a bond we can see how the collection of the debt might have been restricted to the land, or at least how the debt was not a general one. With this' explanation the cases cited will not be in conflict. If Benscoters had proceeded against the land upon the mortgage since the orphans’ court sale, and had realized from a sheriff’s sale of it less than the whole debt, with interest and costs, we think it would not he seriously contended that they had no claim on this fund, for the balance, especially as the <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>only contestant is an heir of the decedent. So the real contest seems to be whether the mortgage creditor or the heir (or, if you please, an unsecured creditor) of the decedent shall be obliged to pursue the land. This question seems to have been settled in New Jersey by statute : Building and Loan Association v. Stockton, <a href="/pa/148/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="148 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="981801" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0146-01">148 Pa. 146</a>. Under the equity powers of this court we might have ordered the Benscoters to sell on their mortgage, but this has not been demanded, so they have their option as to the mode of procedure: Morris v. Olwine, <a href="/pa/22/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="22 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="413689" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0441-01">22 Pa. 441</a>.</p>

But as to general debts of a decedent, not of record, the death alone creates a lien. Having a lien by mortgage and also by death, why are the Benscoters not entitled to the whole value of the land, if necessary to satisfy their debt ? The orphans’ court sale was not under their control, and it ought not to be allowed to work them any injury.</p>
