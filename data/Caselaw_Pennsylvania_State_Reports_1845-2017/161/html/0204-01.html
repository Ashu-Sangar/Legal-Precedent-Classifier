Hence, the only question in the case before the auditor, and now before the court, is the right of E. Keeler &amp; Co. to have the said portion of the fund impounded. The fund for distribution arose from a sheriff’s sale of real estate, and was paid into court to await distribution through an auditor, to and among lien creditors. The fund in court then stood as to creditors, in the place of the property. Such sale divested all liens. It became the duty of E. Keeler &amp; Co. to make the same proof before the auditor, of their right to preference, or priority of lien, and payment out of, the fund, as they would be required to make on a trial in court on the scire facias sur mechanic’s lien, in order to entitle them to-a judgment there, and in such case in an issue before the auditor, every lien creditor would then and there have had the right to controvert the validity of the lien and claim : See Denkel’sEstate, 1 Pearson, 213; Norris’s Ap., <a href="/pa/30/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="415572" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0122-01">30 Pa. 122</a>; McCay’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20128" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 Pa. 128">37 Pa. 128</a>; Hahn’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Pa.%20413" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="39 Pa. 413">39 Pa. 413</a>; Field v.Oberteuffer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phila.%20271" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Phila. 271">2 Phila. 271</a>, and other cases to the same purport. It is even held in the case of McLaughlin v. Smith, <a href="/whart/2/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Whart. 122" data-case-ids="1830579" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0122-01">2 Wharton, 122</a>, that where property has been sold upon a judgment before recovered, further proceedings on a scire facias on a mechanic’s lien would be stayed. From the foregoing line of decisions it follows that E. Keeler &amp; Co., not having asked for, or shown cause before the auditor for an issue, and having failed to make, before him, the necessary proof to entitle them to recover anything on their claim, it must fall. Their day in court was the day of the audit. It is not the proper or approved practice to impound a portion of the fund in the situation that this fund was, to await the trial in court on a sci. fa. at some future time. The place and time for the issue to be tried was before the auditor on the day of the audit, and that opportunity having been <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>voluntarily passed by the mechanic’s lien claimant, E. Keeler &amp; Co., the auditor was clearly right in refusing to impound eight hundred dollars of the fund to await the future trial in court of the scire facias on the lien.</p>
