Whether this principle should have any application where the supplies must be furnished upon the demand of the pauper, is not so clear. Why should the recipient of the supplies under such circumstances escape payment when in funds ? If he is compelled to pay he simply does that which in good morals he ought to do voluntarily. His payment enables the county to enlarge its liberality in other needy cases. It is said that such repayment is in conflict with the policy of our poor laws and our idea of charity. But it seems to us there is some<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>thing radically wrong with the theory that a patient may lea vean institution with a large estate of his own in his pocket without any legal obligation resting upon him to pay for the food he consumed. Such treatment of the patient is not calculated to stimulate his honesty or improve his citizenship. Nor does the demand for reimbursement under such circumstances detract from the charity. If the pauper receives the maintenance-upon the condition that he shall pay when able, it answers his needs just as much as if there were no obligation to pay under any conditions.</p>

The act declares, ‘it.shall be lawful for the directors of the poor of any county and for the overseers of any district, as the case may be, in which any person shall have become chargeable, to sue for and recover any real and personal estate belonging to such person, and to sell or otherwise dispose of the personal property, and to collect and receive the rents and profits of the real estate, and to-apply the proceeds or so much thereof as may be necessary to defray the expenses incurred in the support and funeral of such person.’</p>

The man who has an estate sufficient to provide for his maintenance at the time he makes application for charity, is not in fact a pauper, and the authorities are not obliged to furnish the support. If he gains admission through false statements his estate is liable without any statutory provision. Stow v.

Nolis there anything in the act limiting them to the property which the pauper had at the time the expenses were incurred. The act seems to contemplate a case similar to the one before us. <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>The ‘person shall have become chargeable,’ that is, he was •chargeable at the time he was admitted because he had no estate ; the estate is to be applied to expenses incurred, not the ■estate which he had when the supplies were furnished, because then he had no estate at all and by reason of that fact became a charge.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-5" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[143,685,1175,762]]]'>“ An act was passed in Massachusetts Feb. 24, 1818, wherein it was provided ‘ that the inhabitants of any town or district within this commonwealth, who have incurred expenses for the support of any pauper, whether he was legally chargeable to them by means of his settlement or not, may recover the same ■against such person, his executors or administrators in an action of assumpsit, for money paid, laid out and expended for his use.’ Under this law the pauper was liable, and it does not appear that any exception was made in his hehalf if he happened to be without estate at the time the relief was furnished: Gfroveland v. Medford, <a href="/mass/83/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Allen 23" data-case-ids="2095150" data-case-paths="/mass/83/0023-01">1 Allen, 23</a>; Medford v.

Our act is as broad as the law just cited. It is true, under our law the directors of the poor can only sue for the property which belongs to the person chargeable, but the power to sue where there is no property is of little value.</p>

And where, in such case, suit is brought for past maintenance, the present ability of the relative to pay seems to be the limit of the inquiry. We know of no case where the ability to pay at the time the relief was furnished was made the test of liability. It would certainly be a hardship to relieve the person under such circumstances who received the aid, and compel the relative to pay who may be less able at the time than the pauper himself.</p>
