There is no intention manifested of disposing of such estate. There is no provision in the will, which could, by any possibility, be construed into a conditional devise or disposition of the real estate of Nancy Meek. The complainant bases her claim on the pro vision made for her by the testator in the codicil to his will. This right cannot be enlarged by an immaterial recital in a transaction to which she was no party, which occurred ten years <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>after the will was probated and in which she had no interest.

Meek, Sr., deceased, was trustee for Nancy Meek of the undivided three fourths of the one hundred and sixteen acres of land purchased from Mrs. Probasco, Mrs. Hutchinson and Win. Y. Meek, is not tenable. It is assumed by respondents that the mere fact of using the wife’s property to purchase land, the title to which is taken in the name of the husband, is sufficient to constitute the husband a trustee. This is not so: Benedict v. Montgomery, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 238" data-case-ids="481754" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0238-01">7 W. &amp; S. 238</a>. There is no evidence to show that Geo. Y. Meek, Sr., ever considered himself a trustee; he never executed a declaration of trust, and never acknowledged the trust now set up. The trust, if any, arose in 1836, 1837 and 1839, when these deeds respectively were made. The act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 532, applies to an ordinary case of a trust resulting to one who furnishes the money to another to purchase land, the title to which is taken in the name of that other: Miller V.

From a careful examination of both reports of the case, it would appear that a suit to enforce the charge was commenced Jan. 25, 1881. The further fact appears in the pleadings and is found in the opinion of the Supreme Court, that after Feb. 8, 1861, the claim was known to the respondents in that case, that demands were made by the person for whom the charge was made that she needed such yearly payments for maintenance. The case clearly shows that these demands were made within twenty years of the time of the bringing of the suit, and therefore the act of 1855 could have no possible application.</p>

    <p id="b393-5" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[189,537,1166,556]]]'>Appellant’s right, if any she had. against the appellees, was under the following codicil to her husband’s will: “ Since making the foregoing will, I have married a wife, and being desirous of making suitable provisions for her, I hereby give and devise to my present wife Maria, the one third of the yearly income of any real estate of which I may die possessed and one third of my personal estate belonging to me at my death absolutely, in lieu of her dower at law. Should any of my real estate be sold, as provided in my will, she is to have the interest of the one third thereof during her life. In all other respects my will to remain as written on this page and the preceding.”</p>
    <p id="b393-6" data-blocks='[["BL_393.6",393,[187,1102,1167,1166]]]'>This gave her no estate in the lands which he had devised to his sons in fee. It is expressly declared to be “ in lieu of her dower at law.” At most it created a charge upon said lands, in her favor, to the extent of “ one third of the clear yearly income ” thereof. As found by the learned auditor, she received from appellees her full share of said income from the decease of her husband to July, 1860; since which time she has neither received nor demanded from them or either of them anything on account of income, nor have they or either of them since acknowledged their liability therefor, or in any manner recognized her right to claim or receive anything out of said lands. On the other hand, appellant herself testified that in July, 1860, she was notified by George Y. Meek, Jr., one of the appellees, that they (meaning himself and his brothers) would not give her anything more unless the law would give it to her. Notwithstanding this notice, she never commenced any proceedings or took any steps to enforce a recognition of her right until October, 1891, when her attorney notified appellees of her claim. Under these and other corroborating facts and circumstances, there was no error in holding that, according to the provisions of the seventh section of the act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 369, appellant was not entitled to recover: 1 Purd. 752, P. L. 18 (ed. 1873).</p>
    <p id="b393-7" data-blocks='[["BL_393.7",393,[186,2277,1167,194]]]'>We find nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires a reversal or modification of the decree dismissing appellant’s petition. Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>
