    <p class="summary" id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[150,558,1175,1588]]]'>“ If you find the defendant was guilty of negligence, then you will come to the next question, which is, was the mother reasonably careful of that little child when it got out on this day ? Because the law of our state, the law of civilization and the law in this case is, that any mother, whether she is poor or rich, or high or low, must not, voluntarily, let a little child five years old go out into danger on a street. That will never do, because if we do that voluntarily we are committing a sin against ourselves, against our children and against God. [Now, the question is whether or not this lady negligently let the child escape from the house. It had no business out on the tracks of the traction company. A little five year old child ought not to be allowed to go there. The mother says she did not allow it; that she was washing the little baby, and the door was open, and this child went into the hall; that she told him not to go away, and in a few moments, or a short time, she heard the child was killed. It is contended that this was not exercising due care. You will say whether it was or not. She was bound to use reasonable care, such as a prudent woman under the circumstances would use, to prevent the child from getting out. It is contended, because the door was open and the mother did no more than just say, ‘ Don’t go out,’ that that was negligence. You will determine from the evidence in the case whether she did or did not exercise reasonable care in protecting her child. If she did not she cannot recover.] [1] It is a well settled rule that if a person allows a little child to run into the street and go where there is danger, and where they know there is danger from the cars, and the child is injured, they cannot recover. If you think the mother used all the care that was proper under the circumstances, then she could recover, provided it was not an unavoidable accident in the first place.”</p>

The trial in the court below resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $699. If there was evidence sufficient to justify a finding that the boy’s death was caused by the negligence of the appellant company, and the learned court below did not err in refusing to hold that the negligence of the parents contributed thereto, the company cannot reasonably complain of the verdict, because the amount of it does not indicate that the jury were affected by sympathy or prejudice in rendering it. In a clear and concise charge the learned judge carefully limited the jury to such matters as were proper for their consideration in ascertaining the damages, and the verdict in this particular fairly conformed to the instructions. We turn, then, <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>the evidence to see if it was sufficient to support the plaintiff’s contention that the death of their child was due, wholly or partially, to the company’s negligence, and if we conclude that it was, to inquire whether there was anything in it which would have justified the learned judge in holding that their own negligence in caring for the child was responsible in some degree for the sad occurrence.</p>
    <p id="b157-3" data-blocks='[["BL_157.4",157,[163,739,1175,1687]]]'>It appears from the evidence produced by the plaintiffs that at the time of the accident the car was running at a high rate of speed and that the brake was not applied to check its progress nor the bell rung to give notice of its approach, until the boy was struck by it. Mrs. Hartman testified that she was standing about twenty-five feet from the place where he was struck, and that when she first saw the car it was a square and a half away from her, and “coming very fast;” that the brake was applied and the bell rung after, but not before, he was struck. In her statement respecting the speed of the car and the ringing of the bell she was fully corroborated by the testimony of M. C. Golden and Mrs. Owsten. The latter said: “ I saw the car coming down very rapidly, as though it had broke away or something; it looked to me like it had broke away and was uncontrollable, the way it went.” These witnesses either resided upon or in plain view of the street on which the railway track was located, and were accustomed to seeing the cars running upon it; the speed of this car was so great that their attention was particularly attracted by it before the occurrence of the accident, and it ran about thirty-five feet after the boy was struck by it before it could be stopped. Their testimony in relation to the speed of the car and the distance it ran after the boy was struck by it was corroborated by that of McClelland, the company’s only witness, who testified, inter alia, that he was standing in the car and saw the accident; that it was crowded and “ seemed to be going pretty rapidly, eight or nine miles an hour; ” that it struck the boy at or near the crossing and that after it struck him it “ slid along thirty-five feet ” before the motorman could stop it. Surely this evidence authorized an inference that the car was running at an unusual and dangerous rate of speed at the time of the accident, and required that the question of the company’s negligence in connection with it should be submitted to the jury.</p>

It is contended by the appellant company that the boy was on the street by permission of his parents, or that they failed to take proper precautions to prevent his going there, and it bases its contention in this particular on the testimony of his mother and Miss Algeo. It is not necessary to include their testimony or any portion of it in this opinion. We have carefully read and considered the whole of it and are clearly satisfied that the question of the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiffs was for the jury and not for the court to decide.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[229,1102,1185,955]]]'>It seems to us that there is a striking resemblance between this case and Long et ux. v. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/75/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="75 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1036765" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0257-01">75 Pa. 257</a>. In that case, as in this, the plaintiffs claimed that their child’s death was attributable to the , company’s negligence, while the latter contended there was no negligence on its part and that there was contributory negligence on the part of the parents. In that case Chief Justice Agnew, delivering the opinion of this court, said: “ To suffer a child to wander on the street has the sense of <em>permit. </em>If such permission or sufferance exist it is negligence. This is the assertion of a principle. But whether the mother did suffer the child to wander is a matter of fact and is the subject of evidence, and this must depend upon the care she took of her child. Such care must be <em>reasonable </em>care dependent on the circumstances. This is a fact for the jury.” The resemblance between the two cases in respect to the questions involved and .the evidence relied on to decide them is so close that the language we have quoted applies to this case with the same pertinency and force as to the case in which it was used.</p>
