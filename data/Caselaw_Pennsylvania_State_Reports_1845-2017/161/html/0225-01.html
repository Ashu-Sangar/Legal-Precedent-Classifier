    <p class="syllabus" id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[171,672,1168,557]]]'>On a bill in equity to declare void an assignment for the benefit of creditors by a beneficial association, the court below found that the assignment was illegal, although made by the persons who appeared to be the real representatives of the association. At the time of the assignment there were two opposing sets of officers. On appeal by plaintiffs, the Supreme Court found that the evidence was so conflicting, and the confusion and irregularities of the proceedings under contested and disputed by-laws and regulations so great, that it was impossible for the court to arrive at any conclusion with entire confidence. It was accordingly decreed that the whole matter should remain in statu quo until the next meeting of the Supreme Lodge then near at hand, when new officers could be regularly elected by the body which was acknowledged by both parties to be the rightful governing head of the order.</p>

Order of Solon, <a href="/pa/157/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="157 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="846590" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0588-01">157 Pa. 588</a>) all that was decided was that, on the ease then before the court on bill and answer, the injunction and appointment of a receiver could not be sustained as matter of law, though they might have been, as in fact appears probable from subsequent events, for the best interests of the order itself, and of all the parties concerned. Subsequently to that decision the difficulties in the affairs of the order appear to have increased, and an assignment for the benefit of creditors was made to one of the present defendants. We have now before <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>us two parties, each claiming to be the rightful officers and true governing body of the order. The master and the court below have found and decreed that the assignment was illegal and must be set aside, though the party which made and favors it are the true representatives of the order. The evidence is so conflicting, and the confusion and irregularities of the proceedings, under contested and disputed by-laws and regulations, so great, that it is impossible for any court to arrive at a conclusion with entire confidence. We are not without serious doubt whether we should, on original examination, have reached the same result as the master and the learned court below, but we are not able to say that they have fallen into error. In this position of affairs we think the suggestion of the learned court below is eminently wise and equitable, that the whole matter should remain substantially in statu quo until the session of the Supreme Lodge in May, when new officers should be regularly elected by the body which is acknowledged by both parties to be the rightful governing head of the order.</p>
