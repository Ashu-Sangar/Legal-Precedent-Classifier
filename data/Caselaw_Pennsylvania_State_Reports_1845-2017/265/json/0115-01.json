Before Rossiter, J.\nFrom the record it appeared that plaintiffs claimed under clause 3 of the will of Lucinda W. Hartley. The defendant claimed under clause 2 of the same will.\nThe material portions of the will are as follows:\n\u201cItem 2. I give and devise unto my son, Joseph Charles Hartley, my farm of about eighty-five acres situate in Greenfield Township, County and State aforesaid, bounded and described as follows, to-wit: On the north by the Rich Hill Road, on the west by land of Ed. Smith, on the south by land of G. S.

Hartley shall furnish a home for my adopted daughter, Jessie May Hartley, until she is 18 years old.\u201d\nBy subsequent'items of the will certain specific articles were bequeathed.\nThe court discharged the rule for judgment for plaintiffs on the pleadings. Plaintiffs appealed.\nError assigned was order discharging the rule for judgment.\nS. Y. Rossiter, with him A. A. Freeman, for appellants.\nWhere there are two clauses in a will which are so inconsistent with each other that it is impossible to give effect to both, the former must give way to the latter: Strickle\u2019s App., 29 Pa. 234; Simpson\u2019s Est., 245 Pa. 244.\nMonroe Echols and Charles A.
