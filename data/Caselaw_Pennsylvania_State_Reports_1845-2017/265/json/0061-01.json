    "head_matter": "Sparr et al. v. Kidder, Appellant.\nWill \u2014 Gift in fee \u2014 Restriction on alienation \u2014 Family name of testatrix.\nAn absolute devise of land in fee cannot be modified or cut down, so as to affect the estate of the devisee\u2019s children and heirs at law, by a subsequent provision, which directs that \u201cthe land shall be kept in the name\u201d of the family of testatrix forever.\nSubmitted April 22, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 309, Jan. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Centre Co., Dec. T., 1918, No. 51, for plaintiffs in case of Harvey C. Sparr et al. v. L. E. Kidder.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Moschzisker, Frazer, Wauling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated to determine marketability of title to real estate.\nQuigley, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThis is a case stated for the opinion of the court growing out of an action of assumpsit brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant. The only question raised thereby is: Have the plaintiffs a good, sufficient and marketable title in fee to the premises which they agreed to convey to the defendant, free from all conditions or limitations, which the defendant is bound to accept?\nFrom the case stated it appears that one Nancy H. Sparr, was, at the time of her death, the owner in fee, inter alia, of a certain messuage and tract of land situate in Harris Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, containing about two hundred forty-five acres, more or less, according to its modified boundaries, and being known as the \u201cSparr Homestead Farm,\u201d and particularly described in said case stated.\nNancy H. Sparr died June 19, 1900, testate. Under the sixth item of her will, which was dated August 8, 1891, and duly probated after her death, she disposed of the \u201cHomestead\u201d farm, being the premises in question, in the following language: \u201cIn case my sister Margaret dies before me, I devise whatever interest I may possess at the date of my death in said \u2018Homestead\u2019 farm (according to its modified boundaries) unto Jacob Sparr, son of Peter Sparr of Lake County, Ohio, subject to a charge of One Hundred Dollars to be paid annually to my nephew, Jacob Reed, during his lifetime. And my will is that said \u2018Homestead\u2019 farm shall be kept in the name of the Sparr family forever\u201d?\nIn the seventh item of her will the said Nancy H. Sparr disposed of her residuary estate; and also gave her executor authority to sell any real estate (other than said \u201cHomestead\u201d farm as enlarged) which she might possess, and to execute and deliver proper deeds therefor.\nUnder section nine of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 219, and the decisions of our appellate courts construing the same, the devise of the \u201cHomestead\u201d farm as originally made to Jacob Sparr was clearly an absolute devise thereof, in fee, subject only to an annual charge of one hundred dollars payable to the testatrix\u2019s nephew, Jacob Reed, during the latter\u2019s lifetime: Huber v. Hamilton, 211 Pa. 289; Robinson v. Jones, 222 Pa. 56.\nAnd the fact that there was no limitation over, and also that said devise to Jacob Sparr was subject to the payment of the above-mentioned annuity to Jacob Reed, strengthen this conclusion.\nThere having been an absolute devise of the \u201cHomestead\u201d farm to Jacob Sparr in the first instance, was the same modified or cut down so as to affect the estate therein of his children and heirs at law (he having died intestate about March 5,1916,) by the latter sentence in the sixth item of testator\u2019s will, viz: \u201cAnd my will is that said \u2018Homestead\u2019 farm shall be kept in the name of the Sparr family forever\u201d?\nWe do not think so. In our opinion these words are, first, either merely precatory, expressing a wish or desire which the original devisee, Jacob Sparr, during his lifetime apparently complied with, or, second, an attempt to devise unto Jacob Sparr an estate tail made in said \u201cHomestead\u201d farm, which, under section one of the Act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, is enlarged into an estate in fee simple; or, third, a devise of said \u201cHomestead\u201d farm unto Jacob Sparr in fee, coupled with a perpetual and unqualified restraint against the alienation thereof, which is clearly void both at common law and under the decisions of our appellate courts: Gray \u2014 Restraints on Alienation, 2d Ed., Sections 12,13,19 and 105; Foulke \u2014 \u25a0 Treatise on the Rules against Perpetuities, etc., Sections 187 and 188, etc.; Reifsnyder v. Hunter, 19 Pa. 41; Walker v. Vincent, 19 Pa. 369; Brock v. Penna. Steel Company, 203 Pa. 219; Grubb v. Penna. Steel Company, 203 Pa. 255; Sanders v. Mamolen, 213 Pa. 359.\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion, under the facts of this case, and the law applicable thereto, that the \u201cHomestead\u201d farm devised by Nancy H. Sparr to Jacob Sparr, father of these plaintiffs, is vested absolutely and in fee simple in said plaintiffs, that they have a good and marketable title in fee thereto, which the defendant, under his agreement, is bound to accept, and further that judgment should be entered on the case stated in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of twelve thousand dollars (being the balance of the purchase money due under the agreement and deed between the parties), and costs.\nAnd now, February 10, 1919, judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiffs on the case stated for twelve thousand dollars and costs. To which the defendant excepts and bill sealed.\nDefendant appealed.\nEitot assigned was the judgment of the court.\nJ. Thomas Mitchell, for appellant.\nHarry Keller, for appellees.\nMay 12, 1919:"
