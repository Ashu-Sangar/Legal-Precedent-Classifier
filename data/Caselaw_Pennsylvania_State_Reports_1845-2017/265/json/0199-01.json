        "text": "Opinion bv\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nIn this case the court below enjoined appellant from diverting the waters of Pine creek to the prejudice of the Palmer Water Company, the latter having appropriated the waters of Big creek, of which Pine creek is a tributary. An examination of the record discloses numerous inconsistent findings of fact, some of which, have a tendency to sustain the decree, while others are adverse to it. It is the duty of the court below to make its findings clear and consistent, and we are compelled to remit the record that this duty may be properly performed. As illustrative thereof, we may point to the following, leaving to counsel for the respective parties the task of calling attention to any others which may seem imperfect to them:\n(A) Compare finding of fact No. 5, p. 13: \u201cBig Creek is a mountain stream whose minimum yield is approximately 14,000,000 gallons per day,\u201d with finding No. 17, p. 26: \u201cThe continuous minimum flow of Big Creek...... is 24,000,000 gallons every 24 hours, and the maximum flow has been as high as 41,000,000 gallons every 24 hours\u201d; and finding No. 26, p. 27: \u201cThe average daily flow......of 29,000,000 gallons per day is 2.5 times the capacity of the pipe used by the Palmer Water Company to convey water to the New Jersey Zinc Company.\u201d What is the minimum flow?\n(B) Compare finding No. 10, p. 53: \u201cThe Palmer Water Company has not condemned more water than its present and future needs require,\u201d being (finding No. 2, p. 13) \u201call the water of Big Creek at and above the Parryville dam,\u201d in order to deliver it to its \u201cone consumer, the New Jersey Zinc Company\u201d (see finding No. 21, p. 26), and its needs measure the appellee\u2019s requirements, and finding No. 8, p. 14: \u201cThe New Jersey Zinc Company [of Pennsylvania] requires for its manufacturing uses at the present time 16,000,000 gallons of water per day,\u201d and (finding No. 9, p. 14) \u201cits probable requirements [will be] twenty million gallons per day at the expiration of four years,\u201d with finding No. 25, p. 27: \u201cThe maximum capacity of the pipe-line leading from the Parryville dam of the Palmer Water Company to the plant of the New Jersey Zinc Company of Pennsylvania is 11,500,000 gallons per day,\u201d and with paragraph (A) above.\n(C) Also compare findings Nos. 29, 30 and 34, pp. 28 and 29: \u201cThat on an average of 17,000,000 gallons of water every 24 hours passes down the sluiceway of the Carbon Iron & Steel Company and flows into the Lehigh river,\u201d and is thus lost to all parties, and \u201cthe...... Steel Company pumps from the flume that leads from the Parryville dam to the shops of said company about 3,000,000 gallons a day;\u201d and \u201cthat the average daily flow......into the flume of the......Steel Company ......was 20,000,000 gallons,\u201d (or, as further analyzed by plaintiff\u2019s testimony, 13,000,000 gallons per day is necessary for appellee\u2019s use; this, with the Zinc Company\u2019s or appellee\u2019s requirement, of 16,000,000 gallons, makes a total of 29,000,000 gallons daily use; in addition, add the water lost by seepage, 6,000,000 gallons daily, and we have 35,000,000 gallons daily use) with finding No. 19, p. 26: \u201cThat for the greater portion of the year the water flows over the breast at the Parryville dam,\u201d and with paragraph (A) and (B) above.\nThe uncontradicted evidence is that 6,480,000 gallons were lost daily by actual measurement through seepage and leaks. One-half of the loss came from the flume of the Carbon Iron & Steel Company and one-half seeped underneath the dam. Compare finding No. 23, p. 18, which says: \u201cEvery reasonable effort has been made ......to minimize the seepage......In 1908 over $2,000 were expended......in extensive repairs,\u201d with finding No. 28, p. 28, which says: \u201cThat with reasonable expenditure 4,500,000 gallons of the leakage can be conserved.\u201d\nThe decree is reversed, the exceptions are reinstated and the record remitted to the court below that proper and consistent findings of fact may be made, the law applied thereto, and a decree entered in accordance therewith.",
