        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mosohzisker,\nThis case was tried by the court below without a jury; judgment being entered on a verdict for defendant, plaintiff appealed.\nPrior to December 28, 1908, the Pennsylvania Company and the Midland Steel Company constructed a siding from a point near the Midland station of the former corporation, by a circuitous route, to the plant of the latter company; this siding, which we shall hereinafter designate as siding \u201cA,\u201d was over a mile long and connected with certain private sidings of the Pennsylvania Company, the Midland Company and other industries; the railway company desired to construct certain new sidings, one called \u201cB,\u201d and to join them with the old siding \u201cA,\u201d all to be used in connection with a new freight station, the erection of which was also contemplated, when, \u201cin the judgment of the parties\u201d to the contract, such station might become necessary; in order to provide, inter alia., for the use of these several sidings, the two corporations named, on the date mentioned at the head of this paragraph, entered into a written agreement, which forms the basis of the present action; up to the time of bringing suit, however, neither the freight station nor the new sidings had been constructed.\nThe contract provides, by section 8: \u201cThe steel company hereby grants to the railway company the right to transport over said siding \u2018A\u2019 cars consigned to or from said proposed freight station, and to or from any industry now or hereafter to be located on property now or hereafter owned by the steel company. For each loaded car, not engaged in the business of the steel company, so transported over siding \u2018A,\u2019 excepting cars containing carload and less than carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station or for station team track delivery, the railway company agrees to pay the steel company the sum of one dollar for such privilege; no charge shall be made for handling over said track empty cars, or cars used for the business of the steel company, or cars containing carload and less than carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station or for station team track delivery. The steel company further grants to the railway company the exclusive use of that portion of said siding \u2018B\u2019 to be constructed and owned by said steel company, and also the right to use the other sidings of said steel company, so far as is necessary for the handling of said railway company\u2019s freight house and team track business.\u201d\nOn March 1, 1911, the contract was assigned by the Midland Steel Company to the Pittsburgh Crucible Steel Company, which latter corporation, on July 1, 1914, sued thereunder to recover for \u201cloaded cars\u201d transported by defendant over siding \u201cA,\u201d between March 1, 1911, and December 28, 1913, first 1,577, and next 5,383 cars, at the agreed rate of $1 each.\nDefendant contended that, since the cars in question were not \u201cconsigned to or from said proposed station\u201d or \u201cto or from any industry......located on property ......owned by the Steel Company,\u201d they were not comprehended by the contract in suit, and hence no recovery could be had in the present action; plaintiff, of course, maintained the contrary.\nThe court below, after first deciding for plaintiff, reversed itself, on exceptions, and determined, inter alia, that \u201cthe contract does not give the railway company the broad right to transport over siding \u2018A\u2019 cars consigned to any person whatsoever, and provide payment for all those not exempted in any of the ways specified; on the contrary, it limits the right to [certain designated classes], and compensation cannot be claimed, under the contract, except for cars transported thereunder and not exempted thereby.\u201d\nWe are not convinced of error in the construction finally adopted. Any right of recovery which plaintiff has in connection with the transportation of the cars in question must be found in section 8 of the written agreement. The phrase, \u201cso transported over said siding,\u201d is correctly viewed by the court below to mean transported under consignment either \u201cto or from said proposed freight station\u201d or \u201cto or from any industry......located on property......owned by the steel company.\u201d The subsequent special reference to certain classes of cars which are not to be charged for, means that, even if such cars happen to fall within the first mentioned kinds, no charge can be made in connection with their transportation.\nIn conclusion, there is no claim here upon a quantum meruit; the suit is to recover a fixed sum under a written contract, and that is all with which we are at present concerned.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

Pennsylvania Company.\nRailroads \u2014 Contract \u2014 Sidings \u2014 Charge for cars transported over a siding \u2014 Construction of written contract.\nIn an action by a steel company against a railroad company to recover a charge of one dollar per car on a large number of \u201cloaded cars\u201d transported over a siding of plaintiff known as siding \u201cA,\u201d it appeared that the claim was based on a written contract, and not on a quantum meruit. At the date of the contract the railroad company contemplated building certain new sidings to join with siding \u201cA\u201d all to be used in connection with a new freight station. Neither new sidings nor freight station had been constructed at the time suit was brought. The contract provided that \u201cthe steel company hereby grants to the railway company the right to transport over siding \u201cA\u201d cars consigned to or from the proposed freight station and to or from any industry now or hereafter to be located on property now or hereafter owned by the steel company. Por each loaded car not engaged in the business of the steel company transported over siding \u201cA\u201d excepting ears containing carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station, or for station team track delivery, the railway company agrees to pay the steel company the sum of one dollar, for such privilege.\u201d The contract immediately thereafter referred to certain other classes of cars which were not to be charged for. Reid:\n(a) That since the \u201cloaded\u201d cars in question were not \u201cconsigned to or from said proposed station\u201d or \u201cto or from any industry......located on property......owned by the steel company,\u201d they were not comprehended by the contract in suit, and hence no recovery could be had in the present suit.\n(b) That the subsequent special reference to certain classes of cars, meant that, even if such ears happened to fall within the first mentioned kinds, no charge could be made in connection with their transportation.\nArgued October 3, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 123, Oct. T., 1919, by plaintiff, from judgment of O. P. Beaver Co., Sept. T., 1914, No. 180, for defendant on case tried by the court without a jury in suit of Pittsburgh Crucible Steel Co. v. Pennsylvania Company, operating the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad.\nBefore Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer, Walling and Simpson, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a written contract.\nBy agreement the case was tried by Baldwin, P. J., without a jury. Judgment was entered for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was the judgment of the court.\nF. G. Moorhead, with him John G. Marshall, for appellant.\nWm. A. McConnell, for appellee.\nJanuary 5, 1920:"
