        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nJuly 11,1917, Katherine Groner sued to recover $2,000 insurance on the life of her husband, Jacob Groner, who she alleged died in the year 1917; the defendant beneficial association claimed there was no sufficient proof of death; judgment was entered on a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and this appeal followed.\nMrs. Groner depended upon evidence of facts justifying the presumption of her husband\u2019s death after seven years\u2019 unexplained absence. The testimony produced shows Jacob Groner and his wife lived together for some twelve years in a house which they had built in Bradford City, Pa., where two children were born to them, one, a daughter, still alive; on November 11, 1907, Groner left home with the intention of going to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, to work at his trade of machinist; his wife accompanied him to Salamanca, and he mailed letters to her \u201call along his route,\u201d sending several from Oklahoma; the shop where Groner was engaged failed, and he wrote home for money, saying he was out of work; thereupon $30 was remitted to him; he was next heard of from Coalinga, California, when a check arrived for $50, sent by him to Mary Groner, the daughter, through a man named Prank Thompson; in 1909, Groner wrote \u201ca small little note stating he was in Hanford, California, getting his teeth fixed\u201d; and, from that time on, no one received any communication whatever from him.\nPlaintiff further testified that her husband, so far as she \u201ccould find out,\u201d had no permanent place of abode in the West, but \u201cseemed to go from one place to another,\u201d wherever he could get a job in the \u201cmachine shops scattered among the camps where new [oil] wells were coming in\u201d; that she had written everyone she knew of from Bradford, \u201cor anyone [she] heard of, asking if they could give [her] any information as to [her] husband\u2019s whereabouts\u201d; that she communicated with several western oil field men (naming them), in an effort to locate him; that her brother-in-law went on a trip \u201cand tried to find him\u201d for her; that she wrote letters addressed to Jacob Groner, which were not received by him; that, on her request, the mayor of the city wrote the officials of several places in the oil fields \u201cto see if they could not get the police to locate him\u201d; and, finally, that she advertised in the \u201cMachinist\u2019s Union Journal,\u201d presumably a trade journal of general circulation, and in one of the Bradford papers, offering a reward of $50 for information as to her husband\u2019s whereabouts.\nIn addition to the circumstances already recited, it may be noted that Groner had \u201ca pleasant home\u201d in Bradford; his parents, who were much advanced in years, and many friends, lived there; when he left, \u201chis health was poor.\u201d In fact, the evidence fails to indicate any reason, other than death, for this man\u2019s total disappearance and utter lack of communication with his family after 1909. True, defendant produced a written deposition of a witness, one Gilbertson, who said that he had seen Groner in California, stating \u201cit might have been in 1913 or 1914 \u2014 I don\u2019t know the exact date\u201d; and the jury were told by the trial judge that, if they believed this testimony, they should find for defendant. It is evident from the verdict, however, the jury did not credit the witness; and that, from the evidence produced.by-plaintiff, they concluded Groner must be dead, as alleged by her.\nAn examination of the Pennsylvania authorities shows the evidence in this case was ample to sustain the verdict rendered. In Burr v. Sim, 4 Wh. 149, the person whose death was at issue left his home in 1792 for South America, and was never again heard from; the report does not indicate any special search. We held the English rule, \u201cthat, in the case of an absent person of whom no tidings are received, the presumption of the continuance of life ceases at the end of seven years,\u201d to be the law of Pennsylvania. In Bradley v. Bradley, 4 Wh. 173, the trial judge charged: \u201cIt was admitted that Francis Bradley had been absent for sixteen years and upwards,\u201d adding \u201cit is therefore presumed he is dead; the law presumes a man to be dead after seven years\u2019 absence, or seven years from the time he was last heard of.\u201d On appeal, we said the case was \u201cput to the jury with peculiar accuracy,\u201d and affirmed a judgment on a verdict in accord with the charge. In Miller v. Beates, 3 S. & R. 490, \u201cit was proved on the part of plaintiff that John Schlosser went beyond sea, unmarried, many years ago and the last that was heard of him was by a letter from him to his father, dated Bordeaux, Nov. 24, 1802......Pains had been taken to ascertain whether he died in France, but no evidence of his death could be obtained.\u201d The suit was brought in 1817 and the jury found that Schlosser was dead. In affirming, we stated that the statute of 19 Car. 2, c. 6, which enacted, in effect, that persons absent for seven years, where \u201cno evident proof\u201d was made of \u201ctheir being alive,\u201d shall \u201cbe counted as dead,\u201d \u201cextends to Pennsylvania\u201d; and that, under the rule thus pronounced, \u201cwhen a man\u2019s being alive is inconsistent with other facts proved in a cause, according to general experience it ought to be presumed that he is not alive.\u201d In Whiteside\u2019s Appeal, 23 Pa. 114, James Whiteside \u201chad gone to the West or Southwest, and had not been heard of by his relatives in Pennsylvania for above fifteen years.\u201d This was shown by a witness, not a relative, who further testified that the relatives of the absent man \u201cgot a letter , from him about sixteen years ago,\u201d that \u201che had heard his relatives frequently speak of him, and they said that letter was the last they heard of him.\u201d In affirming a finding of death, we said \u201cthe proof might have been stronger and fuller, but it was enough to make out a case prima facie.\u201d In Esterly\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 222, 231, one Gery disappeared from his home in 1870, leaving a wife and four minor children, and was not afterwards heard from. These bare facts are all that appear. In discussing the question as to his death, we stated, \u201cthe presumption of death after the lapse of seven years is as effective as direct proof of the fact,\u201d adding, \u201cthis period of time, as respects Joseph A. Gery, elapsed on the 13th of May, 1877; after that date, according'to the facts clearly established, he was in the law presumed to be dead.\u201d In Welch\u2019s App., 126 Pa. 297, 299, the report shows: \u201cThe evidence disclosed the fact that [the person in question] had been absent, and his absence unaccounted for, for a period far exceeding seven years.\u201d This was held sufficient to justify a finding of death. In Mutual Benefit Co.\u2019s Petition, 174 Pa. 1, 2, one Schoneman left his home in New York, October 10,1881, to take a train for Boston, and was not heard of afterwards. \u201cEvery inquiry and method of search reasonably possible was adopted by his family and friends to discover his whereabouts.\u201d We affirmed a finding that he had died at the end of seven years from the time of his disappearance. In Francis v. Francis, 180 Pa. 644, 646-7, decided in 1897, the person alleged to be dead \u201chad left his home in Scranton, and gone with a colony to settle in Patagonia\u201d ; he was last heard from in 1876. In passing upon the question as to when he was presumed to have died, we ruled that, when a person departs from his home with a fixed intention of changing his domicile, absence from his last domicile for seven years must be shown, and the presumption of death \u201cbuilt\u201d thereon; this rule was followed in Morrison\u2019s Est., 183 Pa. 155, 160, where the person in question removed from his home in this State and \u201csettled\u201d at Ft. Dodge, Kansas. Finally, in Maley v. P. R. R. Co., 258 Pa. 73, we held that, notwithstanding the Act of June 24, 1885, P. L. 155, relating to the granting of letters of administration upon the estates of persons presumed to be dead, the common law rules upon that point are still applicable to cases, arising in the common pleas, involving the question of the presumption of death. After deciding the point just referred to, we state, on p. 81, \u201cThe remaining question is whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant the jury in finding the fact of the death of the two sons. Jerry Maley left home in 1894, when under twenty years of age. Daniel Maley left in 1897, when about the same age. They had lived at home with their father in the small village of Grover, containing about 150 inhabitants......During the long period of twenty years, which had elapsed since the departure of the sons, no word was received from either of them; ......a witness, who had employed Jerry [testified] that the latter indicated an intention of \u2018going West.\u2019 \u201d These facts were held sufficient to justify the presumption of their death, notwithstanding a contention (p. 82) \u201cthat an effort to locate the absentees must appear\u201d; but, in disposing of this contention, we said, \u201cThere was nothing to indicate to the father the possible destination of his sons; had such fact been known to him, reasonable search should be required to be made at the place where the boys were last known to live. As matters stood, however, the last known residence was the home of their father.\u201d Again, on p. 85, we amplified this thought by stating that, if the two boys had \u201cleft home with the intention of establishing their permanent residence at another place, absence from such place, unheard of for a period of seven years, would become necessary to raise the presumption of death.\u201d\nIn the case at bar, it appears that plaintiff\u2019s husband, after leaving his home in Bradford, did not at any time take up a permanent residence elsewhere; on the contrary he seems to have roved from place to place. Hence the rule referred to, in the three cases cited, as to the requirement of showing absence for seven years from the last known, \u201csettled\u201d or \u201cestablished,\u201d domicile, has no relevancy.\nPlaintiff occupied the close relation of wife, to insured; and it has been held, in other jurisdictions, \u201ca wife who has not been advised of his whereabouts, by her absent husband......, for the period required to raise the presumption of his death, has the right to believe that he is dead, although having made no attempt to find him\u201d: 17 Corpus Juris, 1171. In short, the proof required, so far as the obligation to search for the missing one is concerned, depends in a marked degree upon the peculiar facts of each particular case; here, considering the relation of plaintiff to Groner, his utter failure to advise her of his existence for more than seven years, together with all the other circumstances in the case, as previously said, the evidence was sufficient to justify the conclusion that he died at the time alleged.\nAs the record stands, unless some reversible trial error, in submitting the issues to the jury, is properly before us for review, the judgment for plaintiff must stand; and, in this regard, it must be remembered that the sole exception taken to the charge was a general one, asked and granted after the jury retired. Therefore, appellant may assign for review only material matters \u201cso inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury\u201d or \u201cactual errors of law,\u201d it being the rule that we \u201cwill refuse to review matters not called to the attention of the trial judges unless the alleged errors are basic and fundamental\u201d : Sikorski v. P. & R. R. R. Co., 260 Pa. 243, 250, and Mackowski v. Phila. R. T. Co., 265 Pa. 34.\nAfter detailing the circumstances of Groner\u2019s departure for the West, his absence unheard of, for seven years, the efforts to locate him, etc., the trial judge immediately charged, \u201cIf you find the fact that Katherine Groner has not heard from her husband since 1909, under the circumstances as detailed to you here, the law will raise the presumption that he is dead.\u201d Counsel for defendant asked the court, \u201cDid you make clear to the jury that it is not absence of the man for seven years, but the unexplained absence that raises the presumption of death\u201d; whereupon the judge stated: \u201cI intended to so do if I have not; it is not the fact that a man goes away and has been away for seven years, but it is his unexplained absence which gives rise to the presumption which the law makes that he is dead. If he goes away under normal conditions, as testified to here by Mrs. Groner, and wrote to her afterward, then, for some unexplained reason, ceased to write to her, or to any person, for the period of seven years, those are circumstances that would give rise to the presumption he was not alive at this time.\u201d These instructions are assigned for error.\nWhen the parts of the charge complained of are read with their context, particularly the recital of facts depended upon by plaintiff to show the death of her husband, and when the inquiry put by counsel, which called forth the last above quoted instruction, is given due consideration, we are not convinced that any \u201cactual error of law\u201d appears, or that any material matter was \u201cso inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury.\u201d If the charge is taken as a whole, it is quite plain the trial judge, when he said the absent one\u2019s failure to write for seven years, \u201cwould give rise to the presumption that he was not alive,\u201d meant merely that such failure to Write, together with the other circumstances in the case, was sufficient to give rise to the presumption that Groner was dead; and this, if, and only if, the jury believed the facts and circumstances detailed to them by plaintiff and her witnesses. The charge not only reviews plaintiff\u2019s evidence, but also that depended upon by the other side; and the trial judge instructed the jury, if they believed the latter, the verdict must be for defendant, that the credibility of the witnesses was for them to consider and determine, and, finally, that the burden of proof was upon plaintiff to establish her case by a fair preponderance of evidence. No \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201cfundamental\u201d errors appear ; if counsel for appellant were dissatisfied with the answer made by the court to their inquiry, which was practically a request for additional instructions, they should have called the attention of the trial judge to the matter of their dissatisfaction, and, if not corrected, taken a special exception. The first two assignments of error are overruled.\nThe remaining assignments complain of the judgment for plaintiff and the refusal to grant defendant a new trial; they rest upon an allegation, based on an ex parte affidavit of a juror named Lindholm, that he and certain of his associates, in reaching their verdict, considered testimony stricken ont by the trial judge. Counsel for appellant concede that \u201cwhat transpired in the jury room cannot be revealed by the testimony of any of the jury, as this would be against public policy\u201d (Stull v. Stull, 197 Pa. 243, 248, 253-4; Smalley v. Morris, 157 Pa. 349, 351, 358; also see opinion of Thayer, J., in Ring v. Baker, 4 W. N. C. 185), but contend that a stipulation, entered into between them and counsel for plaintiff, requires the present affidavit to be considered. The court below has this to say upon the point at issue: \u201cWhen the stipulation was filed, counsel for plaintiff expressly stated that he reserved the right to object to the competency of the juror as a witness......All that was [intended], when the stipulation was executed, was to give the ex parte affidavit the same force and effect as if it had been taken on deposition......The objection to the competency of Lindholm to testify to the facts set forth in the affidavit is sustained\u201d; we see no error in this ruling.\nThe assignments are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

The rule that, in case of an absent person of whom no tidings are received, the presumption of the continuance of life ceases at the end of seven years, is applicable in an action in the common pleas by a wife to recover insurance on the life of her husband, whose death is alleged.\n2. In such a case where it appears that plaintiff\u2019s husband after leaving his wife and home, did not take up a permanent residence elsewhere, but roved from place to place, the rule, as to the requirement of a showing of absence for seven years from the last known \u201csettled or established\u201d domicile, has no relevancy.\n3. In an action to recover insurance on the life of plaintiff\u2019s husband whose death is denied by defendant, a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff will be sustained, where the evidence tends to ;show that the insured had lived for twelve years with his wife in a \u201cpleasant\u201d home which he had built; that he had two children; that his parents who were advanced in years, and many friends, lived in the same town; that in November, 1907, when his health was poor, he left home, with the intention of going to Oklahoma to work at his trade; that his wife accompanied him part of the way; that after she left him he mailed letters to her all along his route, and some from Oklahoma; that running out of funds he wrote to his wife and she sent him money; that he subsequently sent a cheek to his daughter from California; that in 1909 he wrote from a town in California that he was getting his teeth fixed; that thereafter no communication was received from him; that the wife made numerous inquiries for him, writing to machine shops, to public officers of towns where such shops existed, and to people, who she thought might know of his whereabouts; that her brother-in-law went on a trip to find him; that she advertised in a trade journal, offering a reward for information about his whereabouts, and that all her efforts to locate him had failed; and more than seven years after last hearing from him suit was brought.\nAppeals \u2014 Assignments of error \u2014 Exception to charge \u2014 General exception \u2014 Practice, Supreme Oourt.\n4. Where the record of an appeal shows that the sole exception taken to the charge was a general one, asked and granted after the jury retired, the applicant may assign for review only material matters \u201cso inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury or \u201cactual error of law.\u201d In such a case the appellate court will refuse to review matters not called to the attention of the trial judge unless the alleged errors are basic and fundamental.\nAppeals \u2014 New trial \u2014 Refusal of new trial \u2014 Affidavit of juror\u2014 Occurrence in jury room \u2014 Juror as witness.\n5. Where on a rule for a new trial it appears that counsel had filed a stipulation by which it was agreed that an ex parte affidavit of a juror should be given the same force and effect as if it had been taken on deposition, but plaintiff\u2019s counsel reserved the right to object to the competency of the juror as a witness, the court commits no error in excluding the affidavit, which was in effect that the affiant and certain of his associates had, in reaching the verdict, considered testimony stricken out by the trial judge.\nArgued May 6, 1919.\nAppeal, No. 324, Jan. T., 1919, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. McKean Co., Oct. T., 1917, No. 55, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Katherine Groner v. The Supreme Tent of the Knights of the Maccabees of the.World.\nBefore Brown, O. J., Moscttzisker, Frazer, Waeeing, Simpson and Kephart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover life insurance. Before Heck, P. J., specially presiding.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $2,000. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were various portions of the charge and refusal of new trial.\nF. D. Gallup, with him James George and W. E. Blarney, for appellant.\nSeven years\u2019 absence in itself does not determine the status of the absentee: Ulrich\u2019s Est., 14 Phila. 243.\nMere absence of a person from a place where his relatives reside, but which is not his own place of residence and failure of his relatives to receive letters from him for a period of seven years, does not raise a presumption of death. The absence must be from his usual place of abode or resort: Maley v. Penna. R. R. Co., 258 Pa. 73; Francis v. Francis, 180 Pa. 644; Mut. Benefit Co. of Penna. v. Martin, 55 S. W. Rep. 694.\nT. F. Mullin, for appellee.\nWhere a person leaves his home and place of residence for temporary purposes and is not seen, heard of, or known to be living for the term of seven years thereafter, he is presumed to be dead. But in such case the presumption of life continues and the presumption of death does not arise until the expiration of seven years from the time of disappearance, unless there is evidence that the person was, at some particular date, in contact with a specific peril as a circumstance to quicken the operation of time: Schoneman\u2019s App., 174 Pa. 1.\nA juror is not competent to impeach his own verdict: Ring v. Baker, 4 W. N. C. 185.\nA general exception to the charge of the court is not sufficient. The portions of the charge excepted to must be set out when the exception is taken: Sikorski v. P. & R. R. R. Co., 260 Pa. 243.\nMay 21, 1919:"
