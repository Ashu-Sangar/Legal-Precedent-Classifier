Isett, a childless widow, 83 years old, residing on her farm in Huntingdon County, entered into a contract with her niece, Ellen C. Maclay, a trained nurse living in Philadelphia, that the latter should give up her profession and reside with and care for the former during the balance of her life, for which Miss Maclay was to have all of Mrs. Isett’s property, including the farm, worth about $4,500 and $6,000 in personalty. All of which was duly transferred and the use thereof for life secured to Mrs. Isett. The niece carried out her part of the agreement and the old lady died three years later.</p>

Isett, was a nephew of Mrs. Isett’s husband, and lived with them as a inember of the family from the death of his parents in 1884 until his marriage in 1897. He stood to them as a foster son and after his uncle’s death in 1897, although a railroad conductor with a home in Harrisburg, continued to spend as much time as possible on the farm and still called it home. He as<a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>sisted Ms aunt in its management and did work thereon, also bought seed grain and other necessaries for the farm from time to time. He kept no account of the work so done or money so expended and never requested payment for either, and while she made some statements that he would be paid there was no agreement to that effect. In April, 1917, four months after the death of Mrs. Isett, a colored man, stranger to plaintiff, handed him an envelope in which was a note as follows (omitting the judgment clause and waivers), viz:</p>

The trial of that case resulted in a verdict in favor of plaintiff for the amount of the note and interest, upon which judgment was later entered against the administrator alone. Before that judgment was entered the recoi’d of the case was offered in evidence at this trial for the purpose of identifying the note and to show that its lien had been kept alive, and later the judgment entered therein was also offered in evidence; but there was no claim made in the court below that the. judgment entered against the administrator was res judicata of the present case or any branch of it.</p>

So the real question here is, was plaintiff a creditor of Mrs. Isett in February, 1914?
