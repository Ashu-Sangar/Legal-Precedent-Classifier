L. 97, to hold the property and rights of the committee of the proprietors of Kingston Township. The act confirmed all leases made by the committee. In 1799 a Connecticut claimant conveyed a lot known as Lot No. 5, containing a part of the coal in question to the committee, in consideration of conveyance to him of a lot which the committee held for public use. In 1800 the committee executed to one Hoyt, his heirs and assigns, a lease of Lot No. 5, for 999 years. No mention of minerals was made in the lease, and the same day Hoyt executed to <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>the committee a mortgage on Lot No. 5, and an adjoining lot, containing a general warranty of title purporting a fee absolute in the mortgagor. The lease and mortgage were both recorded. Prior to the execution of these papers Hoyt had entered an application for Lot No. 5. A survey was made to him, and the commissioners under the Act of April 4, 1799, 3 Sm. L. 362, certified that he was the owner, and subsequently, in 1804, the Commonwealth issued a patent to him, his heirs and assigns, to have and hold the same free and clear of all restrictions and reservations as to mines, royalties, etc. In the proceedings to procure the patent Hoyt mentioned the lease. The defendant claimed the coal in controversy by mean conveyances from Hoyt. The grantor in each of the conveyances treated the estate involved as though it were a fee in the original patentee. Plaintiff never asserted any claim to the coal until 1913, when suit was brought. <em>Held,</em>

Smith, 1 Binney, 109, 120, 121, 123) —all deeds, leases, and other contracts, purporting to transfer uncertified claims of Connecticut settlers (except as expressly permitted by the statutes of Pennsylvania), were considered unlawful and void (Mitchell v.

We make the last statement, for the reason that, since Hoyt (the person named as tenant in the lease) was successful before the legal tribunal authorized to act in the premises, it must now be conclusively presumed he was the sole “actual” settler entitled, and that plaintiff’s predecessors, as well as Myers, who conveyed to them, had no legal right whatever to a certificate or patent: Griffin v.

In connection with the cases just discussed, see Satterlee v. Matthewson, <a href="/us/27/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="2 Pet. 380" data-case-ids="11338041" data-case-paths="/us/27/0380-01">2 Peters 380</a>.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[267,2200,1149,208]],["BL_271.1",271,[125,349,1155,582]]]'>A final point urged by defendant against plaintiff’s right to recover, is that, since the original grants from the Susquehanna Company reserved for future disposal “all beds of mine, iron, ore and coal,” and <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>since it is conceded the lease to Hoyt did not include mineral rights, therefore the coal here in controversy never passed under that instrument, or vested in anyone else than the patentee of the Commonwealth, and, as to that particular estate, Hoyt was no other than an owner in fee; which, so far as the coal is concerned, excludes the relation of landlord and tenant with all its incidents. It is not necessary to do more than mention this contention, for we deem the broader grounds previously discussed sufficient to sustain the judgment about to be entered.</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[124,953,1157,481]]]'>We conclude that, on the facts at bar, defendant was fully warranted in resting upon the Hoyt patent (Balliot v. Bauman, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 150" data-case-ids="478251" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0150-01">5 W. &amp; S. 150</a>; Woodward, J., in Grotz v.
