The notes were not paid at maturity, and the First National Bank brought suit to recover the amount of the indebtedness due it. The Kester Slate Company had various other creditors, several of whom had brought suit and obtained judgments and, for the purpose of protecting all creditors, the company, acting on advice of counsel, executed to the Citizens National Bank a judgment note in the sum of $20,760, that being the aggregate amount of its indebtedness, “to equally secure the claims against the said Kester Slate Company,” a list of the creditors with the sums due them respectively being set out in full and made part of the note. Subsequently, at the instance of an attorney representing one of the creditors named in the note, not how<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>ever either of the banks, execution was issued upon the judgment entered thereon and levy made upon the real estate of the company, which ivas advertised for sale by the sheriff on January 31,1914, subsequently adjourned to February 7,1914, at which time the property levied upon was sold. Previous to the sale the two banks agreed to cooperate for the purpose of protecting their interests, the First National Bank to bid at the sale and, if necessary, purchase the property on their joint account, any loss sustained or profit realized to be shared pro rata between the two. The First National Bank became the purchaser for the sum of $3,000, this being the highest bid. A few months later the bank resold the property for the sum of $25,000, thereupon the creditors named in the trust note, other than defendants, filed the bill in this case asking that defendants be ordered to pay to them their proportionate share of the net proceeds derived from the resale, basing their proceeding on the theory that the circumstances'“created a resulting trust for the benefit of all parties mentioned in the obligation. The court below dismissed the bill and plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

The sale, however, was not brought about or controlled by either defendant. The general rule is that if a trustee becomes the purchaser of property at public sale brought about or in any manner controlled by him, he will be presumed to buy and hold for the benefit of the trust. But this rule does not apply where the trustee is without control over the sale and is not instrumental in bringing it about.

The former testified: “I was about to bid on the property and he [defendant’s attorney] said ‘Don’t bid; it will only run up the costs.’ ” This, the witness stated, was the only conversation in regard to the matter. Defendants’ attorney denied using the language attributed to him and testified: “Mr. Hauk asked me if I wanted any bidder and I said it is immaterial to us” and that nothing further was said in regard to the matter. This testimony is inferentially corroborated by that of the president of the First National Bank to the effect that the president of the slate company asked an option on the property if bought in by the bank. This, however, was refused with the remark that he was there to protect the interest of the bank only, and that the president of the slate company or any other person had the privilege of bidding at the sale. The court below found this testimony was not contradicted or impeached and that the alleged request not to bid at the sale was not, in fact, made, and further <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>that the evidence failed to show a combination by defendants for any purpose other than their own protection from loss in the resale of the property and that the sale was fair and open to all bidders and not controlled or brought about by defendants or either of them.
