L. 261, known as the Attorney’s Lien Act, and procured an order from the court for the payment, by defendant, to him of the sum of $35 for services rendered in the case. On appeal by defendant the Superior Court reversed the order, and, upon application, an appeal was allowed to this court.

The act in question extends the right of lien to any award, compromise or verdict in favor of the client “in whosesoever hands they may come,” regardless of whether the proceeds were at any time in the hands of the attorney. It also confers upon the court in which the action is pending, on application of the party aggrieved, jurisdiction to “determine and enforce” the lien. We thus have an enactment radically different from any law existing before the date of its passage, providing a remedy different from common law or statutory remedies in force at that time, or at the time of the adoption of the present Constitution.

Such grouping is subject, however, to the qualification that the basis for classification must be reasonable and proper and founded upon a real, and not merely artificial, distinction between the members of the class and the general public, and based upon “a necessity springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class, separately, that would be useless and detrimental to the others”: Ayars’s App., <a href="/pa/122/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="122 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1948405" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0266-01">122 Pa. 266</a>, 281, quoted with approval in Com. v.

    <p id="b333-3" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[143,462,1159,1405]]]'>Tested by the foregoing principles the act in question cannot be sustained as one where classification can be upheld on the ground of necessity. Attorneys do not differ materially from other classes. The desire, and presumably the need, to collect compensation for services, whether physical or mental, is not peculiar to attorneys, but is shared in common by all other members of society who labor for their daily bread. No adequate reason appears for placing an attorney of record in a favored class, not only as against persons in other professions or occupations but also against other members of his profession who render services but do not appear of record in a court proceeding, and provide him with a special means of collecting his debt different from a method heretofore known to the law. He has a right, the same as a physician, or person in another profession or occupation or business, to sue and recover for his services. Although an attorney is also an officer of the court, and a law regulating his duties as such would be considered proper classification, this fact furnishes no valid reason for conferring special benefits upon him in the way of providing, a lien for services rendered his client or a new method of collecting compensation for his services. Classification for this purpose is as unwarrantable as classification of sheriffs and prothonotaries, with respect to the collection of their fees: Strine v. Foltz, <a href="/pa/113/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="113 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="457589" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0349-01">113 Pa. 349</a>.</p>

In the latter case it was held that the Act of April 22, 1903, P. L. 255, amending the Mechanics’ Lien Law of June 4, 1901, P.
