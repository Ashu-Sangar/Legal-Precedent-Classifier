The distilling company, claiming it should be obliged to pay only at the rate of five mills, appealed from each assessment to the Common Fleas of Dauphin County ; the three appeals were consolidated and tried as one.

L. 292, 294, which provides, “Companies organized and incorporated for the purpose of distilling liquors and selling the same at wholesale shall constitute a separate class for the purpose of taxation; and every such corporation......shall be subject to pay......annually a tax at the rate of ten mills upon each dollar of the actual value of its whole capital stock.”</p>

While “organized” is a word susceptible of different uses, yet, in the phrase “organized and incorporated,” it has an established import. “ ‘Organize’ or ‘organization,’ as used in reference to corporations, has a well understood meaning, which is the election of officers, providing for the subscription and payment of the capital stock, the adoption of by-laws, and such other steps as are necessary to endow the legal entity with capacity to transact the legitimate business for which it was created” (Words and Phrases, vol. 6, p. 5053) ; and, in our law, the word has been held to include within its meaning “incorporation.” In Com. v. Westinghouse Elec. &amp; M. Co., <a href="/pa/151/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="151 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="836690" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0265-01">151 Pa. 265</a>, 275, citing Com. v. Wm.

    <p id="b375-3" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[152,679,1158,972]]]'>We cannot follow appellant’s contention that the present tax should be “settled according to equity.” In some cases, equity may control the apportionment of a tax, when duly assessed (Com. v. Independence Trust Co., <a href="/pa/233/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="233 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="981051" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0092-01">233 Pa. 92</a>, 99; Com. v.

A corporation may, in point of fact, be solely engaged in the pursuit of one business, yet, if possessed of charter powers to carry on another, the legislature has the right to classify it in the latter category; and, when this is plainly done, the course-adopted is binding upon the courts: Cochranton Tel. Co. v. Petroleum Tel. Co., <a href="/pa/263/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="263 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1047460" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0506-01">263 Pa. 506</a>, 509.</p>

Com., <a href="/pa/104/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="104 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="452176" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0038-01">104 Pa. 38</a>, the point to be determined <em>was, </em>what is the corporation in question, — is it really a railroad company, or is it a navigation company? and this was held to depend upon the business the corporation was actually doing at the time. In Com. v. Pottsville T. &amp; S. Co., <a href="/pa/157/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="157 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="846550" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0500-01">157 Pa. 500</a>, 506, the controlling inquiry was as to whether or not the defendant was actually carrying on manufacturing within the State; we held (p. 505) that, since it was so doing, “the mere possession of ancillary power [to mine iron ore], which it had never used or sought to use......and which was evidently intended for use only in aid of its manu<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>facturing enterprises, [did] not change the character of the corporation or deprive it of its privileges and immunities as a manufacturing corporation.” In the present case, however, the act itself provides in distinct terms that companies “organized and incorporated for the purpose of distilling liquors and selling the same at wholesale” shall “constitute a separate class for the purpose of taxation.” Hence, here, the question is not what kind of a business is appellant engaged in, or what charter powers is it exercising, but, was the company organized and incorporated for “distilling liquors and selling the same at wholesale”? This the court below properly held could, for present purposes, be judged from its charter (Com. v. Pottsville Co., supra, 506), and, since the company was incorporated with “capacity to accomplish” (Com. v. Mann, <a href="/pa/150/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="150 Pa. 64" data-case-ids="834390" data-case-paths="/pa/150/0064-01">supra, 71</a>) the “distilling of liquors and selling of same at wholesale,” with the name of a distilling company (Com. v. Pottsville Co., supra, 506), such was its design, so far as the application of the Act of 1897 is concerned. In other words, it makes no difference what else appellant may do, since the corporation can appropriately be found to have been organized and incorporated as a distilling company, it falls within the class fixed by the Act of 1897, and must pay accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_376.4",376,[249,1659,1156,373]]]'>The act under which the taxing authorities proceeded is an independent statute, which, without resort to other legislation, provides machinery to work out its purposes.
