Here, on the facts at bar, it is quite clear that, no matter what other purpose plaintiff may have in view, it maintains its so-called relay stations “for the purpose of vending goods,” and does in fact there vend certain of its merchandise, as well as the goods of others; —and these facts are controlling. In brief, plaintiff’s stations are not mere storage houses but, to a certain extent at least, sales stores; and, as stated in Com. v. Campbell, <a href="/pa/33/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="33 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="988392" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0380-01">33 Pa. 380</a>, 385, a manufacturer is taxed for selling his wares “when he keeps a store or warehouse away from his manufactory, in which he sells the wares, in the manufacture of which he is ‘concerned or interested.’ ”</p>

The very words of the legislation are repugnant <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>to plaintiff’s idea of a division of the volume of such business into sales which, from every aspect, should be credited to the stores and those which, although delivered from the stores, might from some aspects be credited to the main factory. As stated by the Superior Court in Com. v. Atlantic Refining Co., supra, 35: “The goods delivered or handled through the stations do not become the subject of barter and sale until they arrive there, and, for purposes of the Act of 1899, the sales are accomplished from [and taxable at] the place where they are so made available.”</p>

L. 184, very properly states: “It was the purpose of the statute to impose such tax on permanent dealers having a place of business within the county; the assessment is not on the sales, however, but on the dealer. It is not important, therefore, whether these sales are actually made from wagons sent out from the place of business or are made at the store......In this view of the case .it is not material whether the title......was transferred at the time the driver delivered the [goods] or whether it was received by the purchaser at [the business establishments of the seller].” The tax is on the gross volume of business transacted annually (Act of 1899), which, of course, must be judged by sales; but, as just pointed out, we are not concerned, in a case of this kind, with any nice question as to exactly when the title to the goods involved in these sales passes. The question is, can the sales be credited reasonably, within the meaning and intent of the tax law, to the place under consideration? Here it is apparent that the first separation from the bulk, for purpose of delivery to the customer, takes place at appellant’s stations when the fluid is run from the storage tanks, there located, into its delivery wagons, and, to that extent at least, in each instance, the station marks the place of sale, or the place to which, under the tax laws, such sales may properly be credited.</p>

The Act of 1899 repeals only former acts inconsistent therewith (Com. v. Vetterline, <a href="/pa-super/21/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="21 Pa. Super. 587" data-case-ids="844336" data-case-paths="/pa-super/21/0587-01">21 Pa. Superior Ct. 587</a>); many of its provisions indicate a legislative intention that “each dealer shall be classified and his business appraised at each store or place of business which he maintains, and, as hereinbefore pointed out, this requirement includes manufacturers, such as appellant, who maintain stores or warehouses apart from their factories for the purpose of vending goods.</p>

    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.7",488,[299,704,1152,1026]]]'>The appellant is a manufacturing corporation, and admittedly not liable to a tax on goods of its own manufacture sold at its manufacturing plant. It concedes its liability to a tax on all goods sold at its distributing stations, whether manufactured by itself or others. The measure of relief for which it prays, and which is denied it by the majority of the court, is exemption from tax on goods not sold at a distributing station, but at its plant, to be delivered in the future. Because sales made at its plant happen to be delivered from one of its distributing stations, why should it be liable to a tax on them, when admittedly it would not be liable if the goods sold should be delivered directly from its plant? The legislature might have so directed, but I am unable to follow the reasoning of the majority of my brethren in holding that it has done so. I would reverse the decree below, reinstate the bill and award the relief to which the appellant, in my judgment, is clearly entitled. My Brother Walling joins in this dissent.</p>
