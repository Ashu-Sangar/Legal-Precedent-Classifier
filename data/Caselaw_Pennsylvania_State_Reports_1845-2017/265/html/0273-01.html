The trial judge charged the jury fully upon the law applicable to the facts, and there is no merit in the fourth assignment complaining of his failure to instruct them adequately as to the weight to be given the testimony introduced by the Commonwealth for the purpose of proving motive on the part of the defendant, for no request was asked for such instruction: Com. v.

Though the threats were not made to Brady, his victim, they were evidence of an intention of the prisoner to kill somebody, and were, therefore, admissible as showing his malice: Hopkins v.
