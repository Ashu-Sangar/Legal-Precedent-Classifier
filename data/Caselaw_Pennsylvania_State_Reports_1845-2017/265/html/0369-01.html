The proceedings upon said petition and by the viewers shall be governed by existing laws relating to the ascertainment and assessment of damages for opening public highways,” with a further provision that the damages when ascertained shall be paid by the Commonwealth. The real question here is whether a change of grade constitutes a change of existing lines and location within the meaning of the section last above quoted. Notwithstanding the able and ingenious argument on behalf of appellants, we are clearly satisfied it does not. The lines of a highway as commonly understood, and as generally used in our statutes, refer to center and side lines and not to grade lines, that is, to horizontal rather than vertical lines. Besides, to come within the act, there must be a change of lines and location. A highway is located where it is laid out and established on the ground and that is not changed by the elevation or depression of its surface any more than is the location of a building changed by raising the roof.</p>

    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[149,952,1157,696]]]'>The change of grade of an existing highway is not the taking or application of private property to public use within the inhibition of the clause of Sec. 10 of Article I of the Constitution, which says, “nor shall private property be taken or applied to public use without authority of law and without just compensation being first made or secured.” And, under the authorities, it is clear that Sec. 8 of Art. XYI of the Constitution, requiring corporations and individuals invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use to make or secure compensation for the property taken, injured or destroyed, has no application to the Commonwealth engaged in the improvement of State highways.</p>
