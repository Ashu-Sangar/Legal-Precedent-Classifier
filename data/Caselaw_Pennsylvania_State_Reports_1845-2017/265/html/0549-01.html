Van Horn, the owner of real estate in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, died intestate, leaving to survive him a widow and children. Letters of administration on his estate were granted to the widow. For the purpose of keeping alive the lien of their claim on decedent’s land, plaintiffs, on December 2, 1911, brought suit against the administratrix; on <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>January 24,1916, they recovered a verdict; on February 5,1916, judgment was entered thereon; and, on April 12, 1917, they issued a writ of scire facias to revive and continue the lien of the judgment, with notice to the widow and children. The children filed affidavits of defense averring the lien on the land was lost because of a failure to issue the scire facias within seven years from the death of their father, as required by the Act of May 3, 1909, P. L. 386, a rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense was made absolute, and the heirs prosecute this appeal.</p>

If this conclusion is correct then the time when the scire facias must be issued, fluctuates according to the tardiness or diligence of the creditor, and may, in the second alternative, be five years later than in the first, for the creditor is not required to enter judgment on his verdict against the executor or administrator until the last day of the first five-year period; and, so also, if that conclusion is correct, the judgment would itself operate to extend the ■duration of the lien.

This, however, was not adopted, because it would have continued the injustice we pointed out in Fritz v. Evans, supra, and would have defeated the very purpose of the Acts of 1834, 1893,1901 and 1909. This was well stated in Benner v. Phillips, supra, where we said: “Unless by analogy we put some limit to the time, the lien against heirs, where suit is brought against the administrator, may be indefinite; for, where the creditor commences suit and obtains judgment against the personal representatives every five years, as he may, he might, at any distance of time, issue a scire facias and call upon the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>heirs to show cause why the debt should not be levied off their land.

The exact dates are not given in the report, but the sci. fa. was in time no matter which of the present contentions is correct. This is true also of Schwartz’s Est., <a href="/pa/14/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="14 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="405921" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0042-01">14 Pa. 42</a>, where decedent died February 26, 1838, suit was brought and judgment recovered March 15, 1838, and a sci. fa. with notice to the widow and heirs was issued February 4, 1843; and of Moore v. Skelton, <a href="/pa/14/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="14 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="405880" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0359-01">14 Pa. 359</a>, where some of the dates are not carefully stated, but it appears that the suit was commenced in time to February Term, 1847, judgment was recovered August 20, 1847, and judgment for plaintiff on the sci. fa. with notice to the devisee was affirmed by this court in December, 1850; and of Corrigan’s Est., <a href="/pa/82/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="82 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1047839" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0495-01">82 Pa. 495</a>, where decedent died July 20, 1856, suit was brought June 4, 1857, judgment recovered February 23, 1859, and a sci. fa. with notice to the widow and heirs was issued March 9, 1865.</p>

We do not think it does. If it is applicable, and retroactive so far as the present case is concerned, then as plaintiffs did not bring suit within one year nor issue a sci. fa. to revive with notice to the heirs within six years from the death of decedent, the lien would be lost, exactly as we have held it to be under the Act of 1909. This obviates the necessity for considering the extent to which the Act of 1917 could constitutionally be held to be retroactive as against existing creditors, in view of the alleged fact that it gives <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>them no time to protect themselves, if it is held to be retroactive generally.</p>

L. 101; but since they have a complete remedy under section 20 of the Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, we will make the usual order on reversing a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</p>
