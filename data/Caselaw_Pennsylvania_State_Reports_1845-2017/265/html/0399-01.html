Suehtparty is usually the contestant but the rule is the same as to the other side, and, where the trial judge after a careful review of all the testimony would feel constrained to set aside a verdict, if in favor of one side, as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, the issue should be refused.</p>

The right to an issue under the statute depends upon whether there is a substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact, and unless there is, the proponent is no more entitled to an issue on a question of forgery than is the contestant on a question of testamentary capacity. The statute does not confine the dispute to any particular question.</p>

The orphans’ court within its jurisdiction is a court of equity, although not technically so called, and proceedings therein on will contests are, as a rule, equitable in form and substance. The usual grounds upon which such contests are ba.sed, to wit, “lack of testamentary capacity,” “undue influence,” “fraud” and “forgery” are of equitable cognizance; and for either, when satisfactorily proven, chancery may decree the cancellation of a written instrument. Fraud, of which forgery is a glaring example, is one of the principal grounds of equity jurisdiction, and, as a general rule, equity may decree the cancellation of a written instrument found to be a forgery.</p>

When the court is considering the validity of written instruments as affected by undue influence, fraud, forgery or incapacity, it is considering equitable questions wherein jury trials are not, and were not, when our first state constitution was established, a matter of right; and its declaration that “trial by jury shall be as heretofore,” has no application to cases where such trial was not then demandable. There is no common law right to a trial by jury in a will contest.</p>

From a decree of that court, sustaining such contention, Clara Belle Fleming, the principal beneficiary thereunder, brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b426-15" data-blocks='[["BL_426.15",426,[285,1812,1154,589]],["BL_427.1",427,[146,341,1154,427]]]'>Each side submitted to the orphans’ court a large amount of evidence; that for proponents included the testimony of Mrs. Mary Jane McCauley to the effect that, in the spring of 1910, while residing in the Fleming homestead, she found the will, also a copy thereof, and $50 in a tin box concealed in the chimney of an abandoned fireplace, and kept the will until September, 1916, when she left it in the office of appellant’s attorney. Meantime two of the alleged witnesses, Gilmore and Baum, had died; but their signatures and also the signature and handwriting of Mr. Fleming (the will pur<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>porting to be holographic) were identified by bankers and others qualified to express opinions thereon. Mr. Moore, the third witness, testified to having subscribed his name thereto in the presence of Fleming and Gilmore. Proponents also called Mr. Malone, a handwriting expert, who expressed the opinion that the document and signatures were genuine; however, he qualified his testimony somewhat on cross-examination.</p>

Morton on a percentage basis to look after her interest, whatever it might be, in the estate in question, which he proceeded to do; and about 1915 caused an action of ejectment to be brought on behalf of herself and sister, for the Fleming real estate, on the assertion that they were the nearest heirs of decedent. However, in August, 1916, a month before that case was listed for trial, they became satisfied that such suit must fail, as there were others more closely related to Mr. Fleming. Shortly after this discovery it was intimated that he left a will, under which appellant was a beneficiary, that had been surreptitiously destroyed ; and in the following month (September, 1916) her petition was presented in the ejectment suit praying for leave to amend her claim so as to base it on the lost will. At the same time there was a further intimation that the will had been found and a few days later it was left at the attorney’s office, Morton meantime having secured genuine signatures of Gilmore and Baum. He had borrowed from Samuel Dempster a receipt with Gilmore’s genuine signature, and when returned it showed the marks of a sharp instrument as if the signature had been traced; and of that signature Gilmore’s name as a witness to the will is practically a reproduction. The latter when examined under a microscope shows carbon along the edges and bears every mark of being a traced signature. Just ten days after the will purports to have been executed, Mr. Gilmore, a man of undoubted character, went before the register, made oath that Fleming had died intestate and was one of the parties to whom <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>letters of administration were first granted. The conclusion is unavoidable that his signature to the will is a forgery. The evidence as to the spurious character of Baum’s signature, standing by itself, is less convincing.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[274,550,1156,1740]]]'>A careful examination of the record leads to the firm conviction that Mr. Fleming neither wrote nor signed the will in question. He died suddenly and to the end was in full possession of his faculties. He was a good English scholar, had been a telegraph operator and was an excellent speller; yet the will contains five misspelled words, all simple, and two being the names of intimate friends. Aside from that the will is not in his handwriting. This appears not only from the opinions of experts and of lay-witnesses familiar with his writing but clearly from a comparison of the will with specimens of his genuine penmanship; in fact the will bears no marked resemblance to his handwriting. The word “Fleming” appears nine times in and upon the will, all strikingly similar, yet none of them appears to resemble any one of his many genuine signatures in evidence. The will on its face bears evidence of having been written with a studied effort and not naturally. It is not in harmony with Mr. Fleming’s expressed intentions as to the disposition of his estate. It was his cherished purpose, often mentioned, to establish a home for crippled children by the devise of his residence for that purpose, with a proper endowment to equip and maintain the same, but that is not found in this will. Appellant’s kinship to him was remote and while naturally she might be remembered in his will, and he had probably said she would be, he had never, so far as appears, declared an intention of making her his principal beneficiary, nor was there any reason why he should do so. Mrs. Brown was a friend of the family and the legacy to her was probably inserted as a makeweight to support the will which purports to give what amounts to 95 per cent of the estate to appellant.</p>

      <em>of good </em>judgment, <em>the </em>suggestion <em>that he </em>would keep liis will, disposing of a $200,000 estate, concealed in a chimney, where it might easily he destroyed or never discovered, is highly improbable; as is the weird story of Mrs. McCauley about guarding the will so carefully for a year and a half and then placing it with a dress in a trunk and forgetting all about it for years and then unable to recall where it was until accidentally discovered, etc. Considering all the circumstances, including her own admissions of wrong-doing, the court below was justified in disregarding her testimony.</p>

There was also the testimony of Mrs. Lamker that Mrs. McCauley had shown her the will on several occasions; also other evidence that the will was seen before Morton obtained the signatures as above stated. There was evidence that Gilmore and Baum made declarations to the effect that they were witnesses to Mr. Fleming’s will. Mrs. McCauley refers to an unposted letter, which she says she found under the carpet, written by Mr. Fleming to appellant on the day of his death, and making reference to a will radically different from the one here at issue. The real question is not whether he made a new will but whether he made this will. The contention that he made another will, if true, does not prove that this one is genuine. Such other will may have been lost or destroyed. The court below saw and heard the witnesses and their explanations of the numerous photographs and other exhibits, a decided advantage especially in weighing testimony depending largely upon reasons shown and demonstrations made, and found the will was a forgery, and that on the entire evidence a verdict in its favor could <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>not be sustained; hence, it set aside the probate and refused to grant an issue as prayed for by proponents.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[264,453,1153,1191]]]'>The case was well considered and in our opinion properly decided. A dispute as to the facts such as to require the granting of an issue, under the Act of March 15, 1832, P.

L. 249), as confessedly this was, is always admissible in evidence, and its effect cannot be overcome, as a matter of law, by oral evidence, which is necessarily for a jury’s consideration. No valid reason exists, and none is anywhere suggested, why a different rule should apply in the case of a will, from that in the case of a note, deed, or other written instrument, where <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>the only question is the validity of the signature thereto. On the contrary, the authorities establishing the rule relied on by the court below, base it on the analogy between the two classes of cases (Bradford’s Will, 1 Parson’s Select Equity Cases 153; DeHaven’s App., <a href="/pa/75/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="75 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="1036799" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0337-01">75 Pa. 337</a>, 341); and, apparently recognizing that it can have no other basis, the majority opinion says “where a court is considering the validity of written instruments as affected by undue influence, fraud, forgery or incapacity, it is considering equitable questions wherein jury trials are not......a matter of right.” Many cases so hold where the signatures are admitted or proved, and the written instruments are attacked for “undue influence, fraud......or incapacity”; but it is sufficient to refer to Church v. Ruland, <a href="/pa/64/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="64 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="1021290" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0432-01">64 Pa. 432</a>; McDonald v.

In principle this is sound, for capacity and knowledge of and assent to the contents of a writing, are all inferred from the admission or proof of the signature. On the other hand there is no presumption as to the validity or invalidity of the signature itself, and hence the law in regard thereto should be and is the reverse thereof. It is sufficient, however, for the present moment, that the majority assert that the same rule should be applied in all cases “where a court is considering the validity of written instruments”; and our immediate inquiry therefore is: What are the legal rules applicable to such controversies?</p>

L. 146) ought not to be difficult of ascertainment. As no method is prescribed for determining whether or not it is a real dispute or only a pleaded one, it is evident the principles applicable to cognate cases should be applied, and not that the matter should be within the discretion <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>of a trial judge, as was the result here; for otherwise we convict the legislature, when it said an issue shall be of right “whenever a dispute upon a matter of fact arises,” of meaning that it shall never be of right but always of discretion; a legal discretion, if you choose, but none the less a matter of discretion. The majority opinion, as shown above, recognizes the fallacy of so holding, and in the endeavor to bring itself within the principle stated further says: “Fraud, of which forgery is a glaring example, is one of the principal grounds of equity jurisdiction, and, as a general rule, equity may decree the cancellation of a written instrument found to be a forgery.” This is stated evidently for the purpose of establishing an analogy to the language of the statute which gives equity “jurisdiction on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake or account.” It is true in the sense that it is an attempt to wrong another, forgery is a fraud. But in the same sense every other attempt to wrong another is “fraud.” Hence, if fraud in that sense is sufficient to furnish a basis for equitable jurisdiction, perhaps no disputed cases, other than those having for their sole purpose the construction of writings, the terms of which are admitted, would be subject compulsorily to the “trial by jury” provisions of our Constitution. Of course this cannot be so, and hence in this country, where we have written constitutions guaranteeing jury trials, equity’s jurisdiction on the subject of “fraud” is greatly limited.</p>

This is especially true where an action at law upon the instrument is actually pending.” In 10 Ruling Case Law 318-19, it is said: “The great majority of the later American cases, however, restrict courts of equity to narrower limits in cases of fraud than does the English doctrine on the sub<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>ject, by considering inadequacy of the remedy at law, and not the existence of fraud, as the true criterion by which the question whether equity will exercise its jurisdiction is to be determined......This so-called American doctrine has resulted partly from the tendency of legislation in that direction......but more prominently from the effect attributed to constitutional guaranties relating to the right of trial by jury, which are commonly construed as constituting an inherent limitation on the jurisdiction of courts of equity.”</p>

Baker, <a href="/pa/212/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="212 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="941809" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0224-01">212 Pa. 224</a>, 226, where we said: “We do not dispute the general principle, relied upon by the appellee, that where fraud is alleged equity has concurrent jurisdiction with law. In our State, however, the settled rule has never been departed from that equity jurisdiction will not attach where there is a full, complete and adequate remedy at law.” It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that a will can only be contested in the method prescribed by statute and the judgment in the case is conclusive upon the parties thereto and their privies, and hence there is not only a full, complete and adequate remedy at law, but it is the only remedy. If it be suggested that the proceeding is nevertheless of an equitable nature and hence equitable principles must be applied in the trial thereof, the answer is, not only does that beg the question, and, as applied here, modify the above-quoted language of the Act of 1832 providing for an issue where facts are really in dispute, but it goes much too far; for in that event, in all actions at law to recover money or property alleged to have been wrongfully withheld, the same rule would have to be applied, and the right of a jury to determine the facts would be almost wholly destroyed in the great body of our civil actions. In an ordinary suit, akin to the present one, no one would ever apply such a principle in determining the case. For instance, if the suit were upon a due-bill, the signature to <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>which was alleged to be a forgery, and one of the subscribing witnesses testified he saw the maker sign it, the signatures of the other two were proved by eleven witnesses and that of the maker by eight witnesses, would binding instructions for defendant be sustained because the trial judge did not believe the maker’s signature was genuine, and discredited also some of the other witnesses for plaintiff? Clearly not; yet we would have to so hold, if the principle contended for in the majority opinion Were applied thereto.</p>

If the forgery was personally known to the alleged testator, he could, if competent, clear up the matter by another will, — containing, if he chooses, merely a clause of revocation, — except in those rare cases where the alleged will would be irrevocable because contractually made upon sufficient consideration, in which event I have no doubt he could maintain a bill quia timet. So, too, it would lie at the instance of anybody in interest, if the alleged testator was incompetent. If the paper becomes known after his death, sections 7 and 8 of the Act of March 15, 1832, P. L. 136, and sections 8 and 9 of the Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 415, provide a complete remedy to compel the production of the document, after which a caveat duly prosecuted would result in a conclusive determination of the question of validity, either by a decree of the register of wills or the orphans’ court, or by judgment on the verdict of a jury after issue awarded. From such a proceeding the parties claiming under the alleged will could not withdraw, nor could they enter a discontinuance or suffer a nonsuit. In every contingency, therefore, we have a statutory proceeding, providing a complete and therefore <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>an exclusive remedy: Section 13, Act of March 21, 1806, 4 Sm.

Moreover, all the authorities agree that the principle quia timet is the only basis of the equitable right to cancel for forgery, and those principles have no relevancy to this proceeding, which is not only statutory and exclusive, but is also more expeditious and at least as efficacious as a bill in equity; and hence, as against it, there is no basis for the “fear” of future wrong, which alone sustains the jurisdiction. If it be again suggested that even if this be true it does not alter the fact that the proceeding is equitable in its nature, then, it is repeated, the considerations set forth in the last paragraph hereof also answer the renewed suggestion.</p>

Indeed this has always been the practice in this State, for in the early days, owing to the absence of a court of chancery, equitable actions and defenses were prosecuted and interposed in common law actions, according to the rules of evidence applicable to equitable proceedings. This was shown so fully in Laussatt’s “Essay on Equity in Pennsylvania,” republished as an appendix to the First Annual Report of the Pennsylvania Bar Association, that nothing can profitably be added thereto. Applying this principle, it follows that inasmuch as there are no equitable considerations involved in determining whether or not a signature is in the handwriting of a given party, our conclusion in Crawford v.

There are other authorities to the same effect, but in no case is it even suggested that a jury trial is not demandable where at the time the Constitution declared “trial by jury shall be as heretofore and the right thereof remain inviolate,” there was anything even remotely similar to our constitutional provision “-that in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the parties have a right to trial by jury, which ought to be held sacred”; and hence the quotations from the Cyclopaedia have no applicability in this State.</p>

The majority opinion seems to approve of this desire, though reaching an opposite conclusion, which has, I believe, been shown to be erroneous. Entirely aside from our difference in that regard, however, it is <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>clear to me the court below erred even if it is right as to the applicable rule of law; unless in will cases the trial judge may curtly reject evidence which for any reason he does not accept as true. That this has been the practical result in the present case is evident, for as to the woman who testified she found the alleged will in decedent’s house, the man who acted for appellant, and the only living subscribing witness to the document, the trial judge summarily brushes aside their testimony thus: “A decree dismissing this appeal or awarding an issue based upon the testimony of Mary Jane McCauley and Frank U. Morton, could not be made, because their testimony is false. Nor is the testimony of Moore, who claims to have attested decedent’s signature, reliable.” This also is the opinion of the majority, reached somewhat more argumentatively; but on the evidence alone a different conclusion might well obtain, supported as their testimony is by that of a number of other witnesses. Moreover, the issue applied for did not depend on the testimony of those witnesses, and should have been awarded entirely aside therefrom.</p>

So, on the other hand, it is equally clear that the proponent’s evidence would not only support, but, uncontradicted, would command a verdict. Does it, however, so completely meet, answer, and overthrow the contestant’s case as to leave but a one-sided issue? We cannot say so. Looking at the whole evidence as put before us in print, we do not think we can safely say that the balance is not doubtful. So much depends on the means of knowledge, the interest or bias, the manner, the character, and the personal weight which each witness carries as an individual among his neighbors and in the community, that a jury is the only appropriate tribunal, in such a case, to determine which way the balance inclines.” No other conclusion is possible, for if, as required here, a party to the controversy must not only show that material facts are in dispute, but must also convince the trial judge that the verdict should be rendered as requested, then there is no need for an issue, for the trial judge may find forgery or no forgery as he views the evidence, and decree accordingly without the intervention of a jury; and the requirement that “the court shall direct a precept for an issue” generally would become a dead letter except in the case of judges too incompetent or too indolent to have or express an opinion. Surely “shall” does and should mean “shall” to all judges alike, leaving to them only the question as to whether or not there is really “a dispute upon a matter of fact,” which the jury and not the court might resolve either way.</p>

Gilmore, R. B. Baum and J. J. Moore. Contestants’ claim is that all those signatures are forgeries, except that of J. J. Moore, who testified positively as to the execution of the will. His testimony is strongly challenged, and much has been <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>argued for and against it, but it cannot be said, from a legal standpoint, to be self-destructive. Judging from the cold type some of contestants’ testimony also is not overly strong, and the whole of it is not so overwhelming in quantity or quality, when compared with proponents’, even if we give full weight to it and to the suspicious circumstances referred to by counsel, as to compel the conclusion that a chancellor would feel obliged to take the question from a jury and decide it himself.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[303,836,1155,1415]]]'>The signature of Fleming was proved by the cashier and also by the auditor of the Farmers’ Deposit Bank; by Dr. Henry It. McKee and Mrs. Flora Josephine Tadder, who had known him all their lives; by H. H. Hunger-man, a tenant of Fleming, and Nancy Kuhn, who had lived with him for years; somewhat indefinitely by Rev. H. H. Marlin, who corresponded with him frequently; and by S. C. Malone, a handwriting expert. In addition, Mrs. Annie Brown, wife of Marshall Brown, testified decedent told her he had made a will in her favor. The signature of H. J. Gilmore was proved by his widow and daughter, by James A. Wakefield, Esq., who had been his attorney for over twenty years; by the cashier of the Diamond National Bank where he had an account; by John H. Armstrong, a real estate agent who had known him for over ten years; by Thomas McLahahan, who had traveled with him, and to whom he had written many times; and by S. O. Malone, a handwriting expert. In addition Gilmore told Mrs. Tadder, Frank H. Morton and Mr. Wakefield that he had witnessed such a will for Fleming. The signature of Baum was proved by his wife, his brother, his sister and his niece by marriage, and by S. O. Malone, a handwriting expert. In addition Baum told his wife, Mrs. Brown and G. Wash. Moore, one of contestants’ witnesses, that he had witnessed such a will for Fleming.</p>

Indeed of the twenty-nine witnesses called to sustain the validity <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>of the signature, <em>hut the three </em>above-mentioned are discredited in either court.' It is safe to say no other case can be found in the books wherein the testimony of so many witnesses, nearly all of them admittedly honest and credible, has been summarily brushed aside, in order to avoid allowing a jury to pass upon a simple “dispute upon a matter of fact.” Certainly none has been brought to my attention. At the root of the decision, as I see it, is indignation at a supposed attempt to maintain a forgery. The indignation may or may not have ample justification, but, in my judgment, it should have been held in judicial abeyance until the tribunal established by law to determine whether or not it is “a matter of fact” had finally so decided.</p>
