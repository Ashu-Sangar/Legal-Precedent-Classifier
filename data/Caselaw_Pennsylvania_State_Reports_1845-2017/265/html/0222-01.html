The case was heard upon bill, answer, replication and testimony. The Cumberland Valley Electric Passenger Railway Company was chartered in 1893, as a Pennsylvania corporation, and in 1900, by a franchise ordinance (No. 133), the defendant borough granted the company the right to occupy certain designated streets, upon conditions therein named, one of which was, “That said railway company, in consideration of the rights and privileges granted by this ordinance, shall pay the borough the sum of Fifty ($50.00) Dollars per annum, said payment to begin two years after the completion of said railway and to continue for a period of three years, at the expiration of which term said annual amount shall be increased to the sum of One Hundred ($100) Dollars, which latter annual sum shall continue for the period of five years, at the expiration of which period the council reserves the right to regulate and determine the future annual payments.”</p>

So far as appears the company and its successors complied with the ordinance, by paying the amounts therein specified, doing the required street paving, etc. In 1911 the town council of the defendant borough duly enacted an ordinance (No. 226), which provides, inter alia, “That the Valley Traction Company, successors to the Cumberland Valley Electric Passenger Railway Company shall pay annually, on or before the first day of August, unto the Borough of Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, the sum of Twelve Hundred ($1,200) Dollars. This rate to commence with the fiscal year beginning March 1,1911, and continue until the amount of said annual payment shall be readjusted by ordinance.

To recover the same the borough brought an action at law, pending which this bill was filed averring, inter alia, that when the franchise ordinance was granted it was the intention of the parties that the annual charge should be increased, if at all, in proportion to the increase of the earnings and prosperity of the company, of which intent the $1,200 charge was in effect a palpable violation, and praying that ordinance No. 226 be declared void as unreasonable, oppressive and confiscatory, and that the borough be restrained from enforcing the same or any penalties that might be incurred by the company from noncompliance therewith.

The trial court reports there is no evidence to justify a finding of an intention of the parties, when the franchise was granted and accepted, that the rate charged should only be increased in proportion to the earnings of the company; also, “That there is no evidence which would justify the finding that the charge of $1,200 per annum by the defendant for the use of the main street by the trolley company is unreasonable or unduly excessive, or that this amount is in effect confiscatory”; and, upon the presumption that ordinance No. 226 was reasonable and fair, entered a final decree dismissing the bill; from which plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>
