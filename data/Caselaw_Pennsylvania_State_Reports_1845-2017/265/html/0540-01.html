In the present case it is as follows: “The question has been raised by counsel for the defendants that Irvin G. Gray, one of the defendants, should not be convicted of any crime because the testimony does not directly connect him with the actual killing or butchering of this alleged stolen bull. If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, first, that this was the Andrews bull, that Irvin G. Gray participated, either in the communication for the sale of it or after it was butchered in the delivery of it, taking a part of it. or receiving money for it, and that he, as he stated, was present and saw the carcass and the hide of the bull that was butchered that day, and that the testimony convinces you, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this was.the Andrews bull and not the bull contended for by these defendants, then you would be justified in finding him guilty, as he would be what is known in law as an accessory either before or after the fact, as you may find from the testimony and as instructed by the court, and would be as guilty as the principals, or the persons who actually did the butchering or killing of this animal.”</p>
