In Winston v. Moore, <a href="/pa/244/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="244 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1003531" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0447-01">244 Pa. 447</a>, it was held that the power to regulate elections, to frame an election ballot, to prescribe the conditions upon which the names of candidates may appear on the official ballot, the method by which a candidate may be voted for, and all like cognate provisions, were legislative matters over which the courts have no control, unless thereby the right of franchise be denied. Accordingly in that case it was held that the provisions of the Act of 1913 for sole nominees on the official ballot was not an infringement of the constitutional direction. In the present case fhe objection is made to the method provided for the ascertainment of sole nominees, but that is one of the very subjects that comes within the legislative control. As said in Winston v. Moore, “The Constitution says nothing about nominations, or how candidates shall be chosen, or how many names shall be printed on the ballot. It furnishes no rule by which to accurately determine what the legis<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>lature may or may not do in the enactment of laws relating to such, details in the exercise of the elective franchise,” etc. But it is not necessary to quote further. It is sufficient to say that applying the tests laid down in that case, the amending Act of 1919 successfully resists the constitutional assault. But the plaintiff answers that the validity of the Act of 1913 was sustained in that case because its provisions did not conflict with the freedom and equality of elections so far as the elector was concerned and the question is still open whether the amended Act of 1919 is constitutional so far as a candidate is concerned. We see no difference in the applicability of Winston v. Moore, whether a citizen be an elector or a candidate. There is no greater constitutional guarantee respecting elections to a citizen as a candidate than to him as an elector. When he is a candidate he is as much subject to the power of the legislature to regulate the form of the ballot, to fix the number of names to be placed thereon and the method of election, as he is when he is an elector.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[135,1436,1150,971]],["BL_470.1",470,[296,333,1145,93]]]'>It must be conceded that it is difficult to prescribe a method for making sole nominees. Under the original Act of 1913, the mode of determining a sole nominee seemed to be based on a majority of those who voted at the election, but when it came to adopting a method for determining sole nominees for two or more vacancies to be filled in the office of judge, many difficulties presented themselves. None of the candidates would be voted for to fill any particular one of the vacancies and it was impossible to base the method on the theory of the majority of the votes or ballots cast. However that may be, it is clear that the provision of the amending Act of 1919 is an election regulation, and has been left by the Constitution to the legislature to prescribe. We find every reason for sustaining its constitutionality in Winston v. Moore. It may be observed that the placing of plaintiff’s name on the official ballot with the other nominees for the five vacancies would eliminate them all <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>as sole nominees and thus the provision of the act would he nullified.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[294,449,1148,483]]]'>The suggestion that the provision for sole nominees in the act virtually changes the time of the election fixed by the Constitution is without weight. Although no name of a competitor will appear on the official ballot, nevertheless there will be an election. The elector still has the right of selection between such sole nominee and any other person he may desire to vote for by inserting the name of that person in the blank space on the ballot left for that purpose.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[295,944,1158,473]]]'>So also as to the objection to the sufficiency of the title of the act. It purports to amend certain sections of the Act of 1913, making, however, no reference to the amendment of 1915. We fail to see how the title is de-, fective on that account. It gives notice that it amends the Act of 1913. The original Act of 1913 with the amendment of 1915 constituted the Act of 1913 as it stood when the amendment of 1919 was passed. The reference to it in the title could not mislead.</p>
