By clause third of the lease under which defendant occupies and operates the plaintiff’s property, the former agreed to pay all taxes and assessments upon the rent reserved by the latter in that instrument, for the payment of which taxes the plaintiff would otherwise be liable. The defendant failed to pay the war excess profits tax assessed against the plaintiff for the year 1917 and it has been paid by the plaintiff, which brings this action to secure reimbursement for that which it has thus expended.
