    <p class="syllabus" id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[287,742,1152,914]]]'>In an action by a steel company against a railroad company to recover a charge of one dollar per car on a large number of “loaded cars” transported over a siding of plaintiff known as siding “A,” it appeared that the claim was based on a written contract, and not on a quantum meruit. At the date of the contract the railroad company contemplated building certain new sidings to join with siding “A” all to be used in connection with a new freight station. Neither new sidings nor freight station had been constructed at the time suit was brought. The contract provided that “the steel company hereby grants to the railway company the right to transport over siding “A” cars consigned to or from the proposed freight station and to or from any industry now or hereafter to be located on property now or hereafter owned by the steel company. Por each loaded car not engaged in the business of the steel company transported over siding “A” excepting ears containing carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station, or for station team track delivery, the railway company agrees to pay the steel company the sum of one dollar, for such privilege.” The contract immediately thereafter referred to certain other classes of cars which were not to be charged for. <em>Reid:</em>

    <p class="syllabus" id="b592-9" data-blocks='[["BL_592.7",592,[288,1911,1149,179]]]'>(b) That the subsequent special reference to certain classes of cars, meant that, even if such ears happened to fall within the first mentioned kinds, no charge could be made in connection with their transportation.</p>

    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[265,460,1156,1246]]]'>The contract provides, by section 8: “The steel company hereby grants to the railway company the right to transport over said siding ‘A’ cars consigned to or from said proposed freight station, and to or from any industry now or hereafter to be located on property now or hereafter owned by the steel company. For each loaded car, not engaged in the business of the steel company, so transported over siding ‘A,’ excepting cars containing carload and less than carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station or for station team track delivery, the railway company agrees to pay the steel company the sum of one dollar for such privilege; no charge shall be made for handling over said track empty cars, or cars used for the business of the steel company, or cars containing carload and less than carload shipments consigned to or from said freight station or for station team track delivery. The steel company further grants to the railway company the exclusive use of that portion of said siding ‘B’ to be constructed and owned by said steel company, and also the right to use the other sidings of said steel company, so far as is necessary for the handling of said railway company’s freight house and team track business.”</p>

Any right of recovery which plaintiff has in connection with the transportation of the cars in question must be found in section 8 of the written agreement. The phrase, “so transported over said siding,” is correctly viewed by the court below to mean transported under consignment either “to or from said proposed freight station” or “to or from any industry......located on property......owned by the steel company.” The subsequent special reference to certain classes of cars which are not to be charged for, means that, even if such cars happen to fall within the first mentioned kinds, no charge can be made in connection with their transportation.</p>
