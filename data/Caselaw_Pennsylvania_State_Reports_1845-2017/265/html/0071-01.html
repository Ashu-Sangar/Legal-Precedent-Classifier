    <p class="syllabus" id="b95-8" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[129,1061,1155,315]]]'>2. The Act of June <em>1, </em>1915, P. L. 878, entitled “An Act providing for the escheat of deposits of money or property of another received for storage or safe keeping,” etc., does not violate Art. I, Sec. 17, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and Art. I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, by. impairing the obligation of the contract between the owner of the property and the depositary.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b95-9" data-blocks='[["BL_95.7",95,[131,1394,1155,359]]]'>3. The agreement of the bank or depositary is to keep the money and pay it on demand. When demand is made the contractual relation ends. A statute of escheat, in effect, simply provides for a termination of the contract of deposit, at the instance of the Commonwealth and by virtue of its sovereign power where there are no heirs to claim the property after the death of the owner, or after the expiration of such reasonable time as may be fixed by law to raise a presumption of death.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b95-10" data-blocks='[["BL_95.8",95,[130,1770,1156,220]]]'>4. While the Act of 1915 requires the filing of certain reports, for the information of the Commonwealth, a considerable time before an escheat is declared, this provision is reasonable and enables the Commonwealth to follow up property as to which there is no apparent claim of ownership.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b95-11" data-blocks='[["BL_95.9",95,[132,2009,1155,267]]]'>5. The act does not deprive an owner of his property without due process of law. While the fact of death is established only presumptively by failure of the owner or any known heirs to appear, this is not in itself sufficient to constitute a denial of due process of law, or the equal protection of the law within the meaning of the provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>

    <p class="syllabus" id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[274,387,1152,267]]]'>7. The provisions of the act for reporting dividends, profits, debts and interest on debts of corporations, companies, banks, trust companies, insurance companies, limited partnerships and partnership associations, are limited to those organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, and consequently do not apply to foreign corporations, doing business in this Commonwealth.</p>

The dissimilarity between building and loan associations and saving fund societies, as compared with banks of deposit and other corporations receiving deposits of money and securities for safekeeping is sufficient to warrant placing the former in a class by themselves and exempting them from the provisions of the act.</p>

Under section 15 of the act, the bar of the statute of limitations and presumption of payment will not affect the duty to make report and liability to escheat according to the provisions of the act. The legislature has power, if deemed necessary, to establish a new period of limitations, or change an existing one without violating any constitutional prohibition, providing, of course, notice of such provision is contained in the title of the statute. While the subject of the statute of limitations is not expressly referred to in the title of the law under consideration, the general subject-matter provides for the escheat of money, property, debts, etc., and this language necessarily includes the fixing of a limitation period and suggests to persons interested in the subject-matter the likelihood of a provision relating to the effect to be given the existing statutes of limitation on debts Subject to escheat.</p>

Dollar Savings Bank, <a href="/pa/259/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="259 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1038281" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0138-01">259 Pa. 138</a>, 145, and cases cited. This right is not seriously disputed; it is contended, however, in the first place, that the act in question violates Article 1, Section 17, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, by impairing the obligation of the contract between the owner of the property and the depositary, the theory being that, upon money being deposited in a bank, a contract attaches between the depositor and the bank under which the latter is bound to return to the former, on demand, the amount of the deposit, and that the provisions in the act for the taking of money or other property after the expiration of a specified time, if the owner has not been heard from, amounts to a violation of this contract. The agreement of the bank or depositary, however, is merely to keep the money of the depositor until it is demanded by the owner, or his duly authorized representatives. It agrees to pay on’ demand. When demand is made the contractual relation ceases, there being no vested right to continue the contract in force thereafter, or for any definite time. If the depositor should die or make an assignment, his personal representative or assignee succeeds to his right to make demand for the money and the bank is in duty bound to make payment. A statute of escheat, in effect, simply provides for a termination of the contract of deposit, at the instance of the Commonwealth and by virtue of its <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>sovereign power, where there are no heirs to claim the property, after the death of the owner, or after expiration of snch reasonable time as may be fixed by law to raise a presumption of death. While the act requires the filing of certain reports for the information of the Commonwealth a considerable time before an escheat is declared, this provision is reasonable and enables the Commonwealth to follow up property as to which there is no apparent claim of ownership. The right of escheat has been recognized under the English law from the earliest times and has also been the subject of continuous statutory regulation in Pennsylvania from colonial days, the latest general law on the subject being the Act of May 2, 1889, P. L. 66; the validity of these acts has been sustained without suggestion that their enforcement violates any contract between the owner of the property and the person or institution in whose hands the property was deposited or placed for keeping.</p>

Section 14 requires the report to contain the names and addresses of the depositors or owners of the money, property or claims, as the case may be, with the nature and amount of the property. Section 5 directs the auditor general to prepare and keep open to public inspection an alphabetical index of the names of such persons, with reference to the reports, and, under section 6, he is directed to notify the person shown to be entitled to money or property, by mail if possible, and shall duly publish, in manner prescribed, in the city or county in which the property is held, a list of the names, addresses and amount of money or character of property belonging to such persons. Thereafter, if the owner fails to make claim to the property for the period stated, which varies according to the nature of the property, the same shall <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>escheat to the Commonwealth. Provision is there made (section 7) for proceeding by bill in equity on part of the Commonwealth at the instance of the attorney general and against the debtor and its creditors to determine issues of fact and for a decree of escheat, with further provision, in section 8, that the lawful owners of such property may, within ten years after payment into the State treasury, recover the same upon satisfactory proof to the auditor general of their ownership. While the fact of death is established only presumptively by failure of the owner or any known heirs to appear, this is not, in itself, sufficient to constitute a denial of due process of law or the equal protection of the law within the meaning of the provisions of the State and Federal Constitutions: Mobile J. &amp; K. C. R. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, <a href="/citations/?q=219%20U.S.%2085" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="219 U.S. 85">219 U. S. 85</a>. The death of a person whose whereabouts is unknown, and the total absence of heirs, can, in the very nature of the case, seldom be established by affirmative proof. A familiar illustration of the right to rely upon presumptive proof of death is the Pennsylvania statute relating to the presumption of death arising from seven years’ absence unheard of. The right of the State to take steps to conserve property within its jurisdiction which has no known owner is fully sustained: Cunnius v. Reading School Dist., <a href="/pa/206/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="206 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="931695" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0469-01">206 Pa. 469</a>, affirmed in <a href="/us/198/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="198 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="1499471" data-case-paths="/us/198/0458-01">198 U.

A <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>reading of the act shows the evident intention of the legislature was not to appropriate or confiscate property of a living person, but to establish a period at the expiration of which the owner of property will be presumed to be dead unless his whereabouts, or that of his heirs, shall have been ascertained in the method prescribed by its provisions. That the State has power to fix a time when the presumption of death of the owner, or abandonment of the property, may arise cannot be open to question, as heretofore pointed out: Com. v. Dollar Savings Bank, supra; Mobile, etc., R. R. Co. v. Turnipseed, supra. The time is fixed by the statute after which such presumption will arise and establishes a form of procedure to have the fact judicially ascertained. The law is, therefore, properly designated an escheat act.</p>

This is undoubtedly a correct statement of the law if we add the qualification that the legislation must not conflict with the portion of article 3, section 7, forbidding the “granting to any corporation, ......any special or exclusive privilege or immunity.” If it be held that imposing a liability of property to be escheated when in the possession of corporations embraced by this act, by indirection grants a “special or exclusive privilege or immunity” to other corporations not covered by the act, then the statute would be invalid unless upheld on the ground of proper classification,, as detailed in the preceding paragraph.

While the subject of the statute of limitations is not expressly referred to in the title of the law under consideration, the general subject-matter provides for the escheat of money, property, debts, etc., and this language necessarily includes the fixing of a limitation period and suggests to persons interested in the subject-matter the likelihood of a provision relating to the effect to be given the existing statutes of limitation on debts subject to escheat.

For instance, appellants’ bills show these companies reported neither unpaid debts nor dividends, this being the case, even though the present act contains no title notice of any change of law affecting the application of the statute of limitations, the question whether such debts <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>and dividends may be treated as escbeatable property when, qua debts, tbeir recovery would be barred, is not a point before us for determination; therefore, according to my view, the subject of the applicability of the statute of limitations has no proper place in our considerations, and should not be referred to in the majority opinion. Were the status of such property, in any particular, up for determination, then I should be compelled to dissent from the decrees entered if they depended at all for support on the doctrine of classification; because, to my mind, no good reason has been, or can be, given why debts due by, and unclaimed dividends on the stock of, “corporations receiving deposits of money, securities or other property for safe-keeping” should be subject to escheat, while debts and dividends of other corporations are not; yet Section 16 of the Act of 1915, in effect, makes this entirely artificial and irrelevant distinction. In my opinion the doctrine of classification has no relevancy. There is, however, nothing in the fundamental law of Pennsylvania which forbids special legislation on the subject of escheat; consequently, speaking generally, it is always the right of the lawmakers to determine what an escheat act shall comprehend.</p>
