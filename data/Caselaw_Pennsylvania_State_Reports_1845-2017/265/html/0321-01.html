To deprive tbe lessee of tbe use and occupation of tbe leased premises is a breach of tbe landlord’s covenant of quiet enjoyment and possession of tbe premises. Such a covenant, when not expressly set forth, will be implied from tbe use of tbe usual formal terms of tbe lease, viz: “lease and let,” or “demise and let,” etc. But whether express or implied, tbe breach of such covenants by tbe lessor entitles tbe tenant to recover <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>damages in an action of covenant (or in an action of assumpsit, under our present system of pleading), and the measure of his damages, for such eviction, has been passed upon and repeatedly construed and determined by the courts.

    <p class="summary" id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[144,1327,1155,1082]]]'>In the light of these authorities there seems to be no doubt that the plaintiff has a remedy at law against the defendant for the eviction complained of in his bill, and the only remaining question, for consideration, is whether or not it is adequate and sufficient to enable him to recover such damages as he may sustain. The general rule laid down in the cases cited is, that the lessee may recover in an action of trespass for all losses which he can prove he has actually sustained, or which he will necessarily sustain, under the circumstances, as a result of the unlawful eviction. The measure of damages has been liberally extended to include even well established profits of the business during the unexpired term of the lease. It has also been held that punitive or exemplary damages may be recovered, when the facts show wanton or malicious injuries to, or interference with, the lessee’s possession and enjoyment of the property: Gallagher v.

It is the settled policy of the law, under such circumstances, to adopt no method of procedure which would deprive the defendant of his right of trial by jury, which has always been favored by the law. In this case the eviction of the tenant was a fully completed act when suit was brought, and all of its consequences will follow without regard to, and unaffected by, the form of action, or the court in which the issue is tried.</p>
