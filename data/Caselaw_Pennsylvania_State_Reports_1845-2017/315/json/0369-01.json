L. 478, as amended by th\u00e9 Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 663, and the Act of May 18, 1933, P. L. 807, the Township of Lower Swatara, The Pennsylvania Railroad Company and The First Catholic Slovak Union of America, as additional defendants. The motion to quash must be sustained as the order of the lower court appealed from is merely interlocutory and not a final judgment of the matter in controversy: Steach v. Hippensteele, 315 Pa. 420, and cases there cited.\nAppeal quashed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
