It was customary to deposit Saturday’s receipts, at a late hour, with a bank across the street. Previous to this robbery, the men who were assigned the duty of taking the deposit to the bank, left through the front door, but, in view of a rumor that the store was to be robbed, Groda, employed as meat manager by the American Stores Company, and Mr. Leedy, another employee, who were selected to take that day’s deposit to the bank, departed from the store by the rear door so as to make it appear that they had finished work and were going home. As they attempted to get into their car, they were surrounded by armed men who commanded them to drive into the country. They did so and when several miles away, the American Stores’ money was taken from them. They made their way back to town and Groda notified the state police of the robbery, <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>between 3:30 and 4 o’clock Sunday morning. Groda also reported the robbery to Brensinger, general superintendent of the American Stores Company for that district. Groda and Leedy were both questioned by the state police on Sunday night and for about six or seven hours Monday. On Tuesday they were taken by the state police to the district attorney’s office in Harrisburg, where, after questioning, information was made by Elmer L. Ludwig, manager of the Hummelstown store of the defendant company, charging both Groda and Leedy with the larceny of the above sum of money of the American Stores Company. There were certain circumstances which seemed to cast some suspicion on them, such as the one that none of their own week’s salary, just received, had been taken from them in the robbery and the fact that Groda had failed to keep an appointment that he had with the state police when they were investigating this crime. Groda and Leedy were arrested on warrants and in default of bail Groda was, on November 27, 1928, committed to the Dauphin County Jail, where he was confined four days until he was released on bail. When the case against the plaintiff was called before the alderman, it was dismissed for lack of evidence and the costs put upon the County of Dauphin. Later the perpetrators of this robbery were apprehended and it was found that Groda and Leedy were entirely innocent.</p>

Such cases as have or seem to have supported this doctrine can no longer be considered as expressing the law of this State and they are now overruled to the extent that they support the doctrine herein repudiated.

Other things may be inferred from this. But this cannot be inferred from anything else. It must be established by positive and express proof. It is not enough to show that the plaintiff was acquitted on the charge preferred against him, or that the defendant abandoned the prosecution.” Chief Justice Rugg said in that case: “The instruction that the jury could not consider the acquittal or the discharge on the issues of malice and want of probable cause was right. It is manifest that one might make a complaint for a criminal prosecution in good faith with probable cause and yet that the court upon trial might discharge the defendant. Plainly, the mere acquittal is a fact of no significance on the question whether there was malice or want of probable cause in instituting the criminal proceedings. The existence of probable cause depends upon the facts within the knowledge of the defendant at the time the prosecution was instituted and not upon subsequent events nor upon matters then unknown to him.” He said further: “Acauittal of the <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>plaintiff on the criminal charge is of itself no evidence of want of probable cause.......

R. 280</a>, appears this statement: “An abandonment of the prosecution by the complaining witness, a discontinuance at the instance of the prosecuting attorney, a dismissal by the magistrate or court without a hearing of all the evidence, and other similar terminations of a criminal proceeding whereon an action of malicious prosecution has been based have been variously spoken of as constituting no evidence of want of probable cause, raising no presumption thereof, establishing no prima facie case of lack of probable cause, being insufficient to prove want of probable cause, etc. The weight of authority is in this direction.” Cases are then cited from the following jurisdictions: United States, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Wyoming, England and Canada. On this question, reason abundantly supports the weight of authority. The twenty-third assignment of error is sustained.</p>

This for the purpose of showing that the prosecution was brought upon the advice of the prosecuting officer of the county, and, therefore, was brought upon probable cause, and without malice upon the part of the informant.” As to this, the court said in the opinion refusing a new trial: “The matter referred to was not offered, neither was the communication to the district attorney, nor what the district attorney advised, or that his advice was communicated to the prosecutor, Ludwig. This we think was necessary to render the testimony offered admissible.” In Smith v. Walter, <a href="/pa/125/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="125 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="563931" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0453-01">125 Pa. 453</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.%20466" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="17 A. 466">17 A. 466</a>, this court held that a defendant, in an action for malicious prosecution, who pleads advice of counsel must show that in instituting the prosecution he not only availed himself of the advice of counsel, but that he made a full and fair disclosure of the facts to counsel, and then in good faith followed the advice received. In that case Mr. Justice Mitchell said: “Absence of probable cause raises a presumption of malice, but the presumption may be rebutted by showing that malice did not in fact exist, and one of the ways of showing that fact is by showing the advice of counsel. It is not, how<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>ever, the advice that rebuts the presumption of malice, but the innocence of the defendant’s conduct, of which his seeking advice is merely evidence. Whether the advice makes out a good defense or not, depends on the good faith with which it is sought and followed. Such good faith is shown by the candor, fullness, and fairness of the client’s statement, upon which the advice was based, and its adequacy in those respects, whenever it is disputed, is for the jury to determine upon all the evidence.”</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[245,893,1158,1346]]]'>There is some evidence in this case that the prosecution was advised by the members of the state constabulary. This is of no avail as a defense. In Davis v. Morrison, <a href="/pa-super/82/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="82 Pa. Super. 537" data-case-ids="657485" data-case-paths="/pa-super/82/0537-01">82 Pa. Superior Ct. 537</a>, that court said: “The advice of the policeman that the defendant should institute the prosecution did not exonerate the defendant. The officer is not supposed to be learned in the law,” citing Brobst v. Ruff, <a href="/pa/100/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="100 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="498409" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0091-01">100 Pa. 91</a>, which held that “the advice of a justice of the peace does not relieve the prosecution from liability for an unfounded prosecution.” See also King v. Lejko et al., <a href="/pa-super/102/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="102 Pa. Super. 569" data-case-ids="695559" data-case-paths="/pa-super/102/0569-01">102 Pa. Superior Ct. 569</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20A.%20334" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="157 A. 334">157 A. 334</a>. Practically all American jurisdictions hold that the advice of police officers or of justices of the peace does not constitute a defense in an action for malicious prosecution. This is also the rule in Canada. In Schall v. Reeves (a Canadian case), 1918, 2 West Weekly 442, 446, it is well said: “The basis upon which the taking of legal advice affords protection is, that a person who has qualified himself to act as counsel, or to be enrolled as a solicitor, is, prima facie, competent to give advice upon which a man may safely rely. No such presumption arises in the case of a police constable or a police sergeant. The fact that a person holds either of these positions, does not, of itself, indicate that he is expert in legal matters, or that his advice may safely be followed.”</p>

One who initiates a criminal prosecution ought to have a well-founded belief of the guilt of the party prosecuted. Whether or not there were substantial indications of defendant’s guilt justifying a reasonable belief of it on the part of the prosecutor in the present case, is, as the record stands, a jury question.</p>
