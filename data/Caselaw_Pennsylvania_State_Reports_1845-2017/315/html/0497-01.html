Watkins obtained a policy of insurance from the appellant company in which the latter agreed to pay the insured’s wife, Elizabeth M. Watkins, the sum of $20,000 upon receipt of due proof of the death of the insured during the continuance of the policy. It also agreed to pay the beneficiary “the further sum of $20,000 upon receipt of due proof that such death of the insured occurred during the continuance of said policy while there was no default in the payment of premium, as a result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injuries, effected solely through external, violent and accidental means, of which, except in the case of drowning or of internal injuries revealed by an autopsy, there is a visible contusion or wound on the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>exterior of the body, and that such death occurred within sixty days of the accident, provided, however, that no accidental death benefit shall be payable if such death resulted from suicide — whether sane or insane; from having engaged in aviation or submarine operations. ......” On March 19, 1928, Watkins obtained another policy from the same company providing for the payment of sixty monthly installments of $200 each, upon the happening of the same contingencies as those specified in the first policy.</p>

Defendant contested the suit on the ground that the inhalation was not accidental but intentional. The plaintiff claimed $20,000, being the amount of the accidental death benefit under the first policy, and also three installments of $200 each due in April, May and June, 1931, under the second policy, making a total claim of $20,600 with interest.

Considerable confusion appears in judicial opinions as to the nature of presumptions and their function in the administration of justice. They are not evidence and should not be substituted for evidence. Presumptions are generally grouped into two major classes: (1) of law; and (2) of fact. The former usually have the force of legal maxims and become rules of law, with definite procedural consequences. As Mr. Justice Agnew said in Tanner v. Hughes and Kincaid, <a href="/pa/53/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1004779" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0289-01">53 Pa. 289</a>: “A legal presumption is the conclusion of the law itself of the existence of one fact from others in proof, and is binding on the jury, prima facie till disproved, or conclusively, just as the law adopts the one or the other as the effect of proof.” Justice Agnew also refers to the other kind of presumption as merely “a natural probability,” i. e., “an inference of fact of the probability.” Wigmore on Evidence, 2d edition, volume 5, section 2491, says: “The distinc<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>tion between presumptions ‘of law’ and presumptions ‘of fact’ is in truth the difference between things that are in reality presumptions and things that are not presumptions at all. A presumption is in its characteristic feature a rule of law laid down by the judge, and attaching to one evidentiary fact certain procedural consequences as to the duty of production of other evidence by the opponent. It is based, in policy, upon the probative strength, as a matter of reasoning and inference, of the evidentiary fact; but the presumption is not the fact itself, nor the inference itself, but the legal consequence attached to it.......A ‘presumption of fact,’ in the loose sense, is merely an improper term for the rational potency, or probative value, of the evidentiary fact, regarded as not having this necessary legal consequence. ‘They are, in truth, but mere arguments,’ and ‘depend upon their own natural force and efficacy in generating belief or conviction in the mind.’ (Greenleaf, Evidence, section 44.) They have no significance so far as affects the duty of one or the other party to produce evidence, because there is no rule of law attached to them, and the jury may give to them whatever force or weight it thinks best....... So long as the law attaches no legal consequences in the way of a duty upon the opponent to come forward with contrary evidence, there is no propriety in applying the term ‘presumption’ to such facts, however great their probative significance. The employment here of the term ‘presumption’ is due simply to historical usage, by which ‘presumption’ was originally a term equivalent, in one sense, to ‘inference.’ ...... There is in truth but one kind of presumption; and the term ‘presumption of fact’ should be discarded as useless and confusing. Nevei’theless, it must be kept in mind that the peculiar effect of a presumption ‘of law’ (that is, the real presumption) is merely to invoke a rule of law compelling the jury to reach the conclusion <em>in the absence of evidence to the contrary </em>from the opponent.” Wigmox*e says further in section 2492: “In strictness, there <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>eannot be such a thing as a ‘conclusive presumption.’ Wherever from one fact another is conclusively presumed, in the sense that the opponent is absolutely precluded from showing by any evidence that the second fact does not exist, the rule really provides that, where the first fact is shown to exist, the second fact’s existence is wholly immaterial for the purpose of the proponent’s case; and to provide this is to make a rule of substantive law, and not a rule apportioning the burden of persuading as to certain propositions or varying the duty of coming forward with evidence. The term has no place in the principles of evidence (although the history of a ‘conclusive presumption’ often includes a genuine presumption as its earlier stage), and should be discarded.”</p>

If, for example, “in the beginning,” 100 human beings had been created, and sometime later 51% or more had died, there would then have arisen an inference that all men are mortal. Later in the course of time, with additional data all supporting the same inference, it would become a presumption of law that all men are mortal. Judge Baldwin of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut has admirably characterized the nature of presumption as follows, in Ward v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.%20902" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="33 A. 902">33 A. 902</a>, 904: “The term ‘presumption’ is used to signify that which may be assumed without proof, or taken for granted....... It is asserted as a self-evident result of human reason and experience. In its origin, every presumption is one of fact, and not of law. It may, in course of time, become a presumption of law, and even an indisputable one. Its truth may be so universally accepted as to elevate it to the position of a maxim of jurisprudence. Its convenience, as a rule of decision, may be so generally recognized- as to place it in the rank of legal fictions. But,, so long as it retains its original character as a presumption of fact, it has simply the <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>force of an argument: 1 Greenleaf, Evidence, section 44; Steph.

Professor Thayer in his Storrs Lectures, 1896, before the Law School of Yale University, said: “By a loose habit of speech, the presumption is occasionally said to be, itself, evidence, and juries are told to put it on the scale and weigh it...... A presumption itself contributes no evidence, and has no probative quality. It is sometimes said that the presumption will tip the scale when the evidence is balanced. But, in truth, nothing tips the scale but evidence, and a presumption — being a legal rule or a legal conclusion — is not evidence. It may represent and spring from certain evidential facts; and these facts may be put in the scale. But that is not putting in the presumption itself. A presumption may be called ‘an instrument of proof,’ in the sense that it determines from whom evidence shall come, and it may be called something ‘in the nature of evidence,’ for the same reason; or it may be called a substitute for evidence, and even ‘evidence’ — in the sense that it counts at the outset, for evidence enough to make a prima facie case. But the moment these conceptions give way to the perfectly distinct notion of evidence proper — i. e., probative matter, which may be a basis of inference, something capable of being weighed in the scales of reason and compared and estimated with other matter of the probative sort — so that we get to treating the presumption of innocence or any other presumption, as being evidence in this its true sense, then we have wandered into the region of shadows and phantoms.”</p>

They were thus entitled to consider, on , an even balance of the evidence <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>as between accidental death and suicide, the probabilities against suicide; but the court below erred in its interpretation and application of the so-called “presumption against suicide.” The court gave to the ordinary probability that a human being will not commit suicide the force of a fact in evidence shifting the burden, of proof to the defendant. The court charged the jury (as above noted) : “The necessary element of accidental death is, prima facie, supplied by the presumption against suicide.” “Norman C. Watkins having died a violent death, viz., by carbon monoxide poisoning, the law presumes that his death was not by suicide but was accidental.” These instructions made the fact of <em>accidental </em>death such a to-be-expected concomitant of a <em>violent death by carbon monowide poisoning </em>as to render it unnecessary for the plaintiff, after prima facie proving the latter, to offer further testimony in support of the cause of action sued upon.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[252,1331,1155,737]]]'>It is true that there is a reasonable inference against death being self-inflicted, but this inference does not have a sufficiently broad factual base to warrant its projection to the height of a presumption of law. Presumptions are not fact suppliers; they are guide-posts indicating whence proof must come; for example, in criminal cases, the presumption of innocence mantling an accused is a challenge of proof, to the asserter of guilt. Sometimes the party who has the burden of persuading the jury does not have all through the case the burden of coming forward with affirmative evidence; as for example, in a criminal case if insanity is pleaded, the burden of proving it is on the defendant, who <em>presumably </em>is sane.</p>

It is not based upon extensive data arising from human experience. An unexplained absence for seven years raises the presumption of the death of the absentee upon the expiration of the last day of the period. This also is a procedural expedient — an arbitrary but necessary rule for the solution of problems arising from unexplained absences of human beings. An example of (2) is the rule requiring persons on trial for doing certain acts which are illegal if done without a license to produce evidence that they belong to the class privileged by license. See Com. v. Wenzel, <a href="/pa-super/24/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="24 Pa. Super. 467" data-case-ids="849877" data-case-paths="/pa-super/24/0467-01">24 Pa. Superior Ct. 467</a>. The following are examples of (3) : (a) an envelope properly addressed and stamped will reach the addressee if the latter is alive; (b) a child born during the wedlock of its parents is legitimate; (c) a person who drives across a railroad crossing will show due care. If the driver is killed at such a crossing, the presumption that he showed due care shifts the burden of proof to the party who defends the action on the ground of the victim’s want of care. (In this example, the presumption of the victim’s due care is merely the converse of the statement that the burden of proof rests on the asserter of the victim’s negligence.) A presumption that a debt is paid after a lapse of a definite long period of time is both a procedural expedient (1) and a conclusion based on the results of wide human experience (3).</p>

It is merely a permissible consideration of the nonprobability of death by suicide.</p>

That a witness who has an interest in the outcome of a lawsuit will “color his testimony” accordingly, is a probability which jurors have a right to consider, but it is not a presumption. Any fabrication of testimony gives rise to a permissible inference by the jury of the lack of credibility of the entire testimony of the fabricator, but this legitimate inference does not amount to a legal presumption that his entire testimony is false. In the instant case the general probability against suicide did not shift the burden of producing evidence upon the party against whom it operated. Here the burden of proving that the death of the insured was caused through “external, violent and accidental means” was squarely placed on the plaintiff. Under the contract of insurance she, in order to make out a cause of action against the defendant for the amount claimed, had to incorporate in her statement these averments. For a commensurate recovery her proof had to sustain them. What the trial judge aptly called “the necessary element of accidental death” was not (as he said it was) “supplied by the presumption against suicide.” No presumptions ever take the place of proof. The so-called “presumption against suicide” is merely an inference or argument; it is not what Justice Agnew, in the opinion above cited, properly designates as a “legal presumption binding on the jury, prima facie, till disproved.”</p>

As to (1), this we have already discussed. As to (2), “It is a fallacy to attribute (as do some judges) an <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>artificial probative force to a presumption, increasing for the jury the weight of the facts, even when the opponent has come forward with <em>some </em>evidence to the contrary” : Wigmore on Evidence, 2d edition, volume 5, section 2491. “...... No presumption can <em>be </em>evidence; it is a rule about the duty of producing evidence”: Ibid., section 2511. Presumptions are always independent of evidence.

There he said: “All the presumptions of law independent of evidence are in favor of innocence.” In Agnew v.

S. 36</a>, counsel for the plaintiff in error (who was the defendant below) asked the trial court to instruct the jury that the presumption of innocence was “to be treated as evidence giving rise to resulting proof to the full extent of its legal efficacy.” This instruction was refused. The Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion by Chief Justice Fuller, said that the instruction was well declined “on the ground of its tendency to mislead.” In Lisbon v.

The Supreme Court of New Hampshire held: “The presumption against the freedom of minors was not an element of evidence and could not be weighed as evidence.” As to (3), when in a suit on a policy containing a provision avoiding the policy if the insured dies by his own hand, plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, and defendant seeks to avail itself of the substantive defense reserved in the policy that the loss was due to a cause or risk <em>specifically excepted in the policy, </em>the defense becomes an affirmative one and has the burden of proof.

But, to charge the jury that after plaintiff proved the insured’s death through external and violent means, the balance of the proof required to maintain the cause of action, that is, “the necessary element óf accidental death is, prima facie, supplied by the presumption against suicide,” is erroneous. Reason leads to this conclusion and authority supports it.</p>

W. 596</a>, where the plaintiff in an action on an accident policy alleged that the insured lost his life by accidental carbolic acid poisoning, and the defendant’s answer contained a general denial and allegation that the insured took his own life by drinking a deadly poison, it was held that the burden was on the plaintiff to show that death was accidental, and that she must do so by evidence of the actual facts, or a situation from which accident is the reasonable and not <em>a </em>reasonable inference or possibility, and that the plaintiff having offered no evidence a directed verdict in her favor was error. The Supreme Court of Nebraska, in its opinion, stated: “Because men love life and fear death, they instinctively avoid obvious danger. This fact, drawn from experience, is the basis of a presumption, relied upon by plaintiff, that when the cause or manner of death is unknown we infer that it was not suicidal. The inference is not based upon a law of nature which is invariable. Men do frequently commit suicide. It is one of a multitude of legitimate inferences, in which we infer the unknown from the known, having greater or less degrees of probability, which we use in reasoning to arrive at the ultimate fact....... When, knowing only that one has died from drinking carbolic acid, you say you are in doubt as to cause, and then, bringing into service the <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>presumption against suicidal intent, you finally conclude that the death was accidental, are you not guilty of that error known in logic as petitio principii? Had you not, in reaching your first conclusion, given the theory of accident the benefit of the truth upon which the presumption is founded? Had you assumed as a fact that the deceased contemplated suicide or was indifferent to life, you might not have entertained the doubt. Let us suppose experience has shown that of all the persons who have died from drinking carbolic acid three out of four were cases of suicide; then, would it not be palpably absurd to infer in the given case that the death was not intentional? ...... The presumption against intentional death can no longer prevail as prima facie proof. The burden was and remained upon plaintiff to prove his case.”</p>
