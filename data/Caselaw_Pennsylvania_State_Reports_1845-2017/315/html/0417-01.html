The matter was partially heard in the court below on a rule for a preliminary injunction. The trial judge, after hearing the evidence presented, stated in substance there was not sufficient <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>evidence to warrant a decision in favor of either party and that the case should go to a final hearing. The rule for a preliminary injunction was discharged. An examination of the testimony justifies the action of the trial judge and fails to establish an abuse of discretion.</p>
    <p id="b444-4" data-blocks='[["BL_444.4",444,[278,634,1150,99]]]'>Appeal dismissed, costs to await final determination of the proceedings.</p>
