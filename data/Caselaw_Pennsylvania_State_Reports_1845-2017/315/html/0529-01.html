She was a nonresident of Pennsylvania, her habitation being Honolulu. Mrs. Whitten received at the latter place a cable from the appellee, the Atlantic Seaboard Natural Gas Company, asking her for her “best cash price” for a gas lease on her Oswayo farm. On November 19th, she cabled that her price was $1,000. On the same day the gas company by cable accepted the offer. On December 1, 1932, Mrs. Whitten received the lease submitted by the gas company and also a check for. $1,000. She refused to sign the lease. The gas company filed a bill of complaint setting forth the facts and praying (1) that a decree be made directing specific performance by Mrs. Whitten of the agreement of leasing; (2) that a decree be made directing that upon failure of Mrs. Whitten “to make and execute lease according to the decree first made that the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Potter County execute said lease as and for the respondent and in her stead and that the consideration therefor be deposited to her credit in The First National Bank of Coudersport, Pa., and the original check be cancelled.”</p>

In the opinion of the court below which was approved in a per curiam opinion of this court, appears the following language : “...... To say that because the bonds are secured by a mortgage, or because the. value of outstanding bonds may be affected as long as a part of the bonds are unissued, their delivery or nondelivery concerns the lien of the mortgage which is given to secure the bonds, is placing a strained construction upon the plain language of the said act of assembly.

The lease if executed would have value because of certain interests it would convey in lands within the jurisdiction of the court directing the service of process; the bonds had value because they were secured by a mortgage on land within the jurisdiction of the court directing the service of process. To hold that the suit praying for the execution of a lease on Pennsylvania land by a nonresident is a suit concerning “any charge, lien, judgment,” etc., upon lands, etc., within the jurisdiction of the court directing the service of process “is to put a strained construction” on the Act of 1859. “Service statutes are to be construed strictly”: Hughes v.

The former is a proceeding in rem; the latter is a proceeding in personam. The suit before us is not specifically directed toward the res; it is directed toward the owner of the res. The status of the res is not in the slightest degree affected until after the suit against the owner is terminated adversely to the latter.

Rule 87 provides that when any act required to be done is not done, it may be performed by the prothonotary in the name of the delinquent party.
