    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.8",83,[134,836,1155,588]]]'>By contract dated April 7, 1927 (Exhibit A to the bill), plaintiffs — husband and wife — and appellants — • husband and wife — agreed to exchange two lots, describing them by metes and bounds, and providing that a mortgage in specified amount should be placed on each property. Attached to this contract were riders, in which plaintiffs’ property was designated as “the Phillips Avenue property” and the defendants’ as “the Ridge-wood Street property.” April 17, 1931, a supplemental agreement (Exhibit B) was executed, referring to the properties by the same designations.</p>

    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[282,628,1153,856]]]'>The contention is without merit: the preamble to the agreement of July 21, 1931 (quoted above) shows that it provides for the transfer of the properties particularly described in the first contract. Between the date of the original agreement and July 21st, plaintiffs had secured the required mortgage on their property, thus rendering the second rider to the contract of April 7th and the supplemental agreement of the 17th inappropriate. In consequence of this change of circumstances, a new contract which (in the words of the parties already quoted) would “be in detail the understanding and agreement which the said parties have concerning the transfer of said properties” became necessary. This contract took the place of prior agreements as to the terms of the transfer, but it clearly appears that it referred to the same properties.</p>
