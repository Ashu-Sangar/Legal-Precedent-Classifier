The money had been deposited from time to time by the board, acting under the will of Stephen Girard, deceased. The secretary being unable to pay the depositor, the City of Philadelphia, acting through the board, after demand upon the surety, instituted this action. The trial judge directed a verdict in favor of the city.</p>

L. 1276, a department of city government, and the members thereof are officers of the City of Philadelphia. They have been so recognized by this court: Phila. v. Fox, <a href="/pa/64/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="64 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1021273" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0169-01">64 Pa. 169</a>; Girard’s App., 4 Pennypacker 347. The money in the account here involved was money belonging to or in the custody of the City of Philadelphia or of certain officers thereof, and come clearly within the terms of the bond. The bond covered funds deposited or to be deposited; these moneys were deposited in the name and to the credit of the City of Philadelphia, trustee under the will of Stephen Girard, at that time, and under our interpretation of the terms of the bond, these funds were embraced therein.</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[161,1234,1153,914]]]'>Appellant urges that the bond was not within the strict terms of the Act of 1929. Even so such circumstance does not prevent the bond by its own provisions from extending the liability of appellant beyond the requirements of that act: Com. ex rel. v. Great American Indemnity Co., <a href="/pa/310/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="310 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1144252" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0201-01">310 Pa. 201</a>. This case controls the question here involved. We held therein that deposits made by the trustees of the Eastern State Penitentiary of moneys turned over to them for safekeeping by prisoners and others were protected by a bond covering “all moneys belonging to the Commonwealth.....and..... of which certain officers thereof are custodians,..... deposited in said depositories by the state treasurer ......or by other officers of the Commonwealth or of departments, boards or commissions......or of institutions owned and controlled by said Commonwealth in whole or in part.”</p>

It might indeed be true that <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>parol testimony may be admissible to explain an ambiguous or indifferently expressed written agreement (Nimlet’s Est., <a href="/pa/299/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="299 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1122313" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0359-01">299 Pa. 359</a>.

Trust Co., <a href="/pa/311/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="311 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1146212" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0001-01">311 Pa. 1</a>; Trust Co. v.

The words used in the bond are not ambiguous; the agreement is complete within itself. Any attempt by any of the parties thereto to show by parol evidence what his interpretation or belief was as to the effect of the contract is immaterial unless words having a special meaning were employed: Emmons v.

At the bar of the court we felt that this possibly was well taken, but, after mature consideration, we cannot sustain this position. The comprehensive language of the bond insures all the deposits, and the penalty is $35,000. In view of the surety’s obligation no act of its should be permitted to prejudice payment of the creditor’s claim from the only available assets out of which it could be paid, and to which the contract of indemnity is related. Had the surety company paid to the city the penalty of the bond when the bank closed, it would have been subrogated to its right against the funds in the bank only when the depositor, the city, had received its claim in full: Hunsberger v. Bank, <a href="/pa-super/108/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="108 Pa. Super. 443" data-case-ids="706407" data-case-paths="/pa-super/108/0443-01">108 Pa. Superior Ct. 443</a>. Thereafter all the assets of the bank that might be attributed to this deposit would have become the property of the surety under the principle of subrogation. Subrogation is an equitable result and depends upon facts to <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>develop its necessity that justice may be done. This obligation insured <em>all deposits. </em>Appellant was liable in dollars to the penal sum of $35,000. It would not have been insuring all deposits if, assuming it paid the penal sum as mentioned, it were permitted to participate in the distribution of the defunct bank to the prejudice of the depositor, leaving the latter, perhaps, to lose deposits because of such premature subrogation. If a subsequent dividend should pay the balance of the city’s claim, after deducting $35,000 and the dividend of 17%%, then the surety company would be entitled to all future dividends, but until that time arrives, its right of subrogation is secondary to the city’s right to obtain its whole deposit. The latter is not a claim on the bond for an excess deposit over and above the amount of the penal sum, but it is a claim on the assets of the principal obligor equal to its deposit. Appellant attempts a division of the debt for which it is bound. This was nowhere provided in the bond.</p>
