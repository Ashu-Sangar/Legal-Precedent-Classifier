      <em>Streets in the City of </em>Philadelphia was assessed for taxes for the year 1933 in the amount of $496,000. Upon appeal to the Board of Revision of Taxes the assessment was reduced to $475,000. A further appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County, in which, after a hearing, the court determined the fair market value of the property to be $455,000. The present appeal is from dismissal of exceptions to that adjudication.</p>
