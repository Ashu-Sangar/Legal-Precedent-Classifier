Plaintiff claimed he was employed by defendant as consulting engineer on the building at a compensation of 2% of the contract price. Defendant denied the employment. A <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>verdict was rendered for plaintiff. Subsequently the lower court refused a motion for judgment for defendant n. o. v., but granted a new trial, stating in its opinion: “Plaintiff’s right to recovery rests entirely on his own testimony. The trial judge was convinced that this testimony was false. A reading of the record confirms this opinion formed at the time of the trial. For this reason, we believe that in the interest of justice a new trial should be granted. This is the only reason for our so doing.”</p>
