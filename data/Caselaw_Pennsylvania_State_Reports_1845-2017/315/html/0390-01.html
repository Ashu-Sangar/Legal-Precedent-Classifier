    <p id="b417-5" data-blocks='[["BL_417.4",417,[138,632,1153,414]]]'>Among the errors assigned by defendant is the refusal of the trial judge to charge the jury that the minor plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. It is sufficient to say, without here relating details of the accident, that a perusal of the record clearly shows the court below properly decided contributory negligence could not be held as a matter of law but the evidence was for the jury to consider.</p>
