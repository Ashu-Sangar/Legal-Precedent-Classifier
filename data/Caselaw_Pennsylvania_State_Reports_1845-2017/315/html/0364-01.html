Tbe alleged negligence of defendant was failure to maintain, in reasonably good condition, an unimproved township road, surfaced with a material known as “red-dog,” by permitting a depression some four feet long, three feet wide and twelve inches deep to exist in the roadway. The testimony as to whether or not a defect in the roadway, sufficient to charge the township with negligence, existed at the point of the accident, was quite contradictory, and presented a question peculiarly within the province of the jury to answer; and that question having been determined adversely to defendant, we are concluded by their verdict: Remppis v. Ettelt, <a href="/pa/310/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="310 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="1144291" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0479-01">310 Pa. 479</a>. The trial judge correctly charged as to defendant’s negligence, as well as to contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff, and a careful examination of the record discloses no reason for the award of a new trial.</p>
