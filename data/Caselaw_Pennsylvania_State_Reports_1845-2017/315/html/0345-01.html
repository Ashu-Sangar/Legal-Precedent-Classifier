Thus a foreign corporation cannot he compelled to remove from the state because of a failure to comply with an unreasonable regulation imposed subsequently to its entry in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Care should be taken to distinguish between cases where a corporation comes into a state casually to enforce some specific right (Kentucky Co. v.

The question is not whether the conditions imposed on a foreign corporation entering are reasonable, which, in this case, we unhesitatingly hold they are, but whether these conditions invade a federal right. If a state may admit foreign corporations to do business subject to certain conditions, to hold that any condition imposed must come under the scrutiny of the Fourteenth Amendment on a theory of some right grounded in the parent state, would deny to a state the power to regulate the entry of foreign corporations.

    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[269,1219,1152,803]]]'>Appellant’s position would be no better off were we to declare the act unconstitutional. The intent and purpose of the Undertakers’ Act, the Act of June 10, 1931, P. L. 485, was to license individuals, not corporations, as undertakers. It permitted corporations that had been and were doing an undertaking business at the time the act was passed, to continue to do business. It also permitted corporations afterwards organized, either domestic or foreign, to secure a permit to do business if all the officers were licensed undertakers and personally performed the acts of undertaking. If this latter provision is stricken down, then, as we view the Undertakers’ Act, corporations, either domestic or foreign, cannot transact an undertaking business in this State, after its passage, unless they were engaged therein prior to its enactment.</p>
