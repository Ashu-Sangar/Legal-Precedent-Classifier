The wife and daughter died instantly in their sleep. He survived for a few hours. The daughter left no will. The question before us is whether her estate shall be distributed to the administrator of her father, or to her maternal grandfather, Louis Koch, who is her next of kin if the inheritance may not pass through her father. The orphans’ court awarded the property to the administrator of the father. Louis Koch has appealed.</p>

S. 136, which reads as follows: “No person who shall be finally adjudged guilty, either as principal or accessory, of murder of the first or second degree, shall be entitled to inherit or take any part of the real or personal estate of the person killed, as surviving spouse, heir, or next of kin to such person under the provisions of this act.” With the section in view, it is quite apparent that the field of inquiry is further limited to the meaning of but one of its words, “adjudged.” Does it connote final conviction in the court of oyer and terminer? If it does, then of course there can be no blocking of the usual course of descent as the killer was not tried and convicted. His suicide prevented this.</p>

The act which we are considering was the result of the study and recommendation of an able commission appointed by the governor of the Commonwealth. Section 23 is in the exact language of their recommendation. In their report (page 47) they say: “This is a new section framed to meet the situation presented in Carpenter’s Est., <a href="/pa/170/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="170 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="872239" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0203-01">170 Pa. 203</a>. In that case, a son killed his father, was convicted of murder and was executed therefor. His mother, the widow of the intestate, was convicted as an accessory after the fact and duly sentenced. The motive of the crime was to get possession of the estate of the decedent, and the Supreme Court was constrained to hold that the criminals had not forfeited their rights under the intestate law....... The commissioners are of opinion however that the guilt of the party charged with the crime should be determined by his conviction in the proper forum.” It is impossible to conclude that the legislature in approving the language of the section as the commission had drafted it did not do so with the intent that it should have the effect which the commission designed and pointed out to <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>the law makers. To give it a wider effect by our saying that in using the words “adjudged guilty” the legislature meant more than the commission intended and meant “adjudged guilty” by the orphans’ court, as appellant contends, would be to close our eyes to the obvious when everything points the other way. If the law is to be changed so as to cover the situation before us, it is for the legislature to make the change, not for us.</p>

I think it impossible, on legal grounds, to reach any other conclusion. The language of section 23 of the Intestate Act of 1917 is too plain. When considered in the light of the law as declared by us in Carpenter’s Est., <a href="/pa/170/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="170 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="872239" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0203-01">170 Pa. 203</a>, which has been changed only to the extent expressed clearly and unequivocally in the act, the conclusion is inevitable that except in the case of one “finally adjudged guilty, either as principal or accessory, of murder of the first or second degree,” our statute regulating descent and distribution is adamant, and we are powerless to change the course of descent from that expressed therein. As we said in that case, “The intestate law in the plainest words designates the persons who shall succeed to the estates of deceased in-testates. It is impossible for the courts to designate any different persons to take such estates without violating the law. We have no possible warrant for doing so.” That case has never been overruled, and is the law of the Commonwealth today, except in the one respect changed by the act. As we have seen, that change affects only inheritance by one “finally adjudged guilty......of murder,” which certainly means after trial, conviction, and final judgment in a court of oyer and terminer; and, by the same token, it certainly does not affect the inheritance of one not so adjudged guilty of murder. We have <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>not tlie power to set aside the plain mandate of the statute of descent, and we would do that if, for any reason, we wrote into it a course of descent other than that provided therein. Without overruling the principle expressed in Carpenter’s Estate, which I have quoted above, and doing violence to the statute of descent, the device of a constructive trust cannot be employed.</p>

The decision was later followed by section 23 of the Intestate Act of 1917, which provides as follows: “No person who shall be finally <em>adjudged </em>guilty, either as principal or accessory, of murder in the first or second degree, shall be entitled to inherit or take any part of the real or personal estate of the person killed, as surviving spouse, heir or next of kin to such person under the provisions of this act.” In my opinion, Carpenter’s Estate is the law today and should be followed except to the extent changed as indicated in the Act of 1917. While the language of the Act of 1917 is somewhat uncertain the intention of its framers should be ascertained by “rational interpretation” of its provisions ; applying this rule to the situation before us, it seems to me that under the legislation in question, in adjudicating estates of murdered persons, the killer should be “finally adjudged guilty [of the killing], either as principal or accessory,” by the tribunal having jurisdiction in such eases, before his next of kin can be barred from participating in the distribution of the es<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>tate of Ms victim. As I read the act, its provisions do not require that the killer be convicted of murder in the court of oyer and terminer, as this would be impossible in many cases, especially the one now before us, as here the offender died by his own hand within a few hours following the killing. We should assume the legislature did not intend the Act of 1917 to be of little or no effect or its provisions to be applicable only in cases where conviction is had in the court of oyer and terminer; what it undoubtedly intended was that the circumstances of each particular case should be “adjudged,” that is, decided and determined in a competent tribunal, either civil or criminal as the situation demands. In this case, in my opinion, the orphans’ court, in adjudicating distribution of the deceased’s estate, is the proper tribunal to determine the parties entitled to participate in the distribution. If the killer had survived and been convicted, and sentenced in the court of oyer and terminer for murder of the first or second degree or accessory, that conviction would be conclusive in determining the right of those entitled to participate in the distribution. Here, the offender’s suicide immediately following the killing precludes a trial in the court of oyer and terminer, and if the legislation is to have any bearing on cases of this character, its provisions require the right of those claiming to participate in the distribution of the decedent’s estate to be passed upon by a proper tribunal. That he took the life of his daughter is not disputed. Do the circumstances surrounding the unfortunate occurrence establish the elements necessary to sustain murder of either first or second degree or accessory? If they do and the father is, after hearing testimony, adjudged to have been sane at the time of committing the deed, his next of kin is not entitled to inherit; if, on the contrary, he was insane and as a result of that condition or because of some other legal reason not chargeable for his act, the next of kin should participate in the distribution under the intestate laws. The question of the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>killer’s responsibility should, under the situation here before us, be determined by the orphans’ court and distribution made in accordance with the finding supported by the testimony after full hearing.</p>

The collateral kinsmen of the father claimed the son had forfeited any interest he had in his father’s estate, and that they were therefore entitled to inherit. This court held on two grounds [Justice Williams dissenting], that the son had not forfeited his right to inherit, regardless of the means by which he inherited, because: 1st. Under article I, section 18 and section 19, of the declaration of rights, it is provided that “no person shall be attainted by treason or felony <em>by the legislature” </em>and that “no attainder shall work corruption of blood, nor, except during the life of the offender, forfeiture of estate <em>to the Commonwealth ” </em>It is apparent that the court erred in using this reason as a basis for its opinion, since there can be no forfeiture of an estate of which one has not yet come into possession, nor was there in that case, nor is there in this, any question of “forfeiture of estate <em>to the Commonwealth ” </em>Moreover, such provisions, indubitably apply to the estate in the possession of the one guilty of the treason or felony at the time he commits the act, and do not govern the question of the transmission to or through him of other interests or estates thereafter: Price v.

      <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>The second reason given Was that “the Intestate Law in the plainest words designates the persons who shall succeed to the estates of deceased intestates. It is impossible for the courts to designate any different persons to take such estates without violating the law.” Justice Green, in meeting the argument that it was against public policy to permit a murderer to profit by his crime, stated that there could be no public policy directly in opposition to a positive statute on the subject. There was, however, no “positive statute on the subject,” but only an inference by the court. Upon such legalistic reasoning as that stated, without regard to the fundamental principles and concepts of equity which this court had prior thereto often announced and applied to prevent the consummation of fraud, duress, undue influence, and other analogous situations, the decision was reached. It was necessarily followed by the Superior Court, of course, without discussion, in Johnson’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/29/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="29 Pa.

L. 429, which provided: “No person who shall be finally adjudged guilty, either as principal or accessory, of murder of the first or second degree, shall be entitled to inherit or take any part of the real or personal estate of the person killed, as surviving spouse, heir, or next of kin to such person under the provisions of this act.” The title to the estate would not pass to the murderer as an heir, spouse or next of kin. The act dealt with descent only.</p>

      <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>The legislature, however, enacted this section with Carpenter’s Est., supra, in mind. It was advisedly overruling the reasoning of that decision; it wiped out and completely destroyed its effect and declared as the policy of the Commonwealth the principle that those found guilty of murder shall not profit by their wrong and inherit from their victims. This policy is the reverse of that stated in the court’s opinion in Carpenter’s Est., supra.</p>

While it was of course the function of the legislature to declare the public policy as it related to inheritance resulting from murder, the mere fact that the legislature set aside the public policy announced in Carpenter’s Estate and declared a new policy as to inheritance by those “adjudged guilty” of murder, does not prevent us in those cases which may fall outside the statute from considering, under the principles of equity and common law, the legal effect of murder on the transmission of title to the property of the deceased. The legislature did not declare that murderers who <em>were not “adjudged guilty” </em>should profit by the crime.</p>

The legislature has expressed the public policy in section 23 of the Intestate Act, supra, and as it relates to wills in the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, section 22.

On principle, it is apparent that a court of conscience must, if possible, intervene to prevent a murderer from enjoying the property of his victim, — a result so sordid and so abhorrent to all principles of fairness and right. This may be done by the application of the well established and frequently employed equitable doctrine or principle that no person shall be permitted to profit or be unjustly enriched as the result of unlawful acts committed by him. All laws as well as contracts may be controlled in their operation and effect by the general fundamental concepts of equity and the common law. As stated by Fry, L. J., in Cleaver v. Mutual Reserve, etc., Assn. (1892), 1 Q. B. 147, 156: “It appears to me that no system of jurisprudence can with reason include, amongst the rights which it enforces, rights directly resulting to the person asserting them from the crime of that person. If no action can arise from fraud, it seems impossible to suppose that it can arise from felony or misdemeanor.” It is uniformly stated that no one shall be permitted to profit by his own fraud, to take advantage of his own wrong, to found any claim upon his own iniquity, or to acquire property by his own crime. These are not new, novel, or untried <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>principles, but are constantly applied by this court under its great equity powers. No interference with the operation of the law of intestacy, descent and wills is involved. The title under the law passes to the wrongdoer, but, to prevent him from being unjustly enriched as a result of his crime, chancery compels him to hold the property he has thus received as constructive trustee for the benefit, use and enjoyment of those whom by his act he has attempted to cheat, and there being no legal or equitable reason for continuing such a trust, may decree it ended and give the estate to those beneficially interested.</p>
