March 31,1929, while driving to Elmira, she crashed into an abutment and sustained injuries which caused her death a few hours later. April 3, 1929, plaintiff notified defendant of the death, and later defendant refused payment on the ground that the first premium had not been paid and the policy had never been legally delivered to the insured.</p>

In the affidavit of defense appellant averred that this policy was handed to the applicant by the company’s agent only for the purpose of permitting her to inspect it and to decide whether she would accept this policy, or return it to defendant for cancellation and have another policy for a different amount issued to her, and that it was only on this express agreement and understanding that Emma D.

Counsel for the defendant moved for a compulsory non-suit for the following reason: “plaintiff failed to prove that the consideration mentioned in the policy was actually paid to the insurance company through its duly authorized representatives.” This motion was denied. Defendant then offered in evidence the testimony of agents McEwen and Thomas, who testified that the premium had not been paid and also testified as to the circumstances under which the policy came into the insured’s possession. The testimony of agent McEwen was that he in company with Wesley Thomas, took the policy to the insured and undertook to deliver it to her and col<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>lect the first premium; that she said to the witness that she did not know whether she wanted that policy or a smaller policy “of something like $2,000,” but she requested him to allow her to take the policy home to Lawrenceville, and consult with her mother as to whether she would take it; that he consented to this and “placed this policy in her hands solely and only for inspection”; but neither she nor anyone else ever paid the premium. This offer of evidence was objected to on the ground that “any statement made by the insured cannot be used against the plaintiff in this case, and further that the testimony as to the lack of consideration was incompetent, and that the contract said the premium had been paid, and the effect of the testimony would be to defeat the operation of the contract. There is no affirmation or proof offered that anything was added to, or omitted, from the agreement by fraud, accident or mistake.”</p>
    <p id="b99-3" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[136,1282,1155,1131]]]'>The trial judge made conflicting rulings on the admissibility of evidence. After defendant first rested, the case was reopened at defendant’s request and it was then testified by defendant’s agent that “the policy itself is the official receipt, supposed to be for the first premium.” As the record stood when the plaintiff and defendant <em>finally </em>rested, the court had stricken out much of the evidence previously received, and particularly had excluded the oral evidence of the agents: (1) that the premium had not been paid, and the policy had been delivered for inspection only; and (2) that Miss Eaton had stated at the time the policy was placed in her hands that she would take the policy home to consult with her mother as to its acceptance. As to (1), the court said, inter alia, that “the fafct the premium was not paid to them at that time would not rebut, or would not at least contradict the receipt which they delivered.” The court directed a verdict for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $11,550. Defendant appealed. The exclusion of (1) and (2) constitutes the subjects of the chief assignments of error.</p>

The insured was a local agent of the company and the policy was delivered to him under the agreement that the commissions he should earn should be applied by the company to the premium payment. He died a few weeks later but before he had earned any commissions. The agreement as to the delivery of the policy and as to the manner in which the premium was to be paid was made with the consent of the general agent. It was held by this court that “the company could waive the stipulation, made solely for its protection, that no liability should attach until the first premium was actually paid to it or to its authorized agent, and its general agent could bind it in this regard.” That is what the case actually decided, though the court in its opinion said further: “The real question at the trial was whether there has been an absolute delivery of the policy to take effect at once, or only a conditional delivery with the understanding that the policy was not to go into effect until the premium had been earned. This question was for the jury, to whom it was submitted with clear and adequate instructions.”</p>

The answer to this is to be found not only in what was <em>done </em>but in what was <em>said. </em>What was merely done being not conclusive of the issue, what words accompanied the deeds of manual delivery and acceptance, respectively, become important. These deeds <em>unaccompanied by words </em>would indicate an absolute delivery and acceptance.

If the issue on a trial was whether or not a person knew a revolver which he had pointed at another and discharged was loaded at the time, his declaration when he pulled the trigger would go far in determining the issue. If he had said, “I am going to shoot you,” his remark (assuming it was not made in jest) would prove the existence of harmful intent on his part; if he had said, “See, it isn’t loaded,” his remark (if made in good faith) would negative the idea of harmful intent.</p>

The beneficiary is suing in her independent right, which is not dependent on nor representative of the right of the assured. No interest of the assured passed to the beneficiary; she stands in her own right as a party to the contract: <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>Hamill v.

As appellee, then, was suing in her own right, conversations between the assured and appellant’s agents are inadmissible since they were not had in the presence of appellee. Wigmore on Evidence, volume 2, 2d edition, section 1081, page 599, states: “In a beneficiary’s action for the sum conditioned in a policy of <em>life insurance, </em>there is no legal identity of'title between the deceased and the beneficiary, although the beneficiary’s right is after all no more than the creation of the insured’s contract; hence unless the beneficiary has in the beginning been made a party to the contract so as to bind himself to be identified with the insured [and some forms of contract attempt this] the insured’s admissions would not be receivable against the beneficiary.”</p>

Here is a plain, unambiguous and certain statement that money had been paid, and it is certified over the signature of the president and secretary. There is no attempt on the part of the insurance company to introduce evidence that because of fraud, accident or mistake it had not been paid. No such claim is involved in the case, yet the majority opinion permits two agents to say that they did not receive the money, notwithstanding the fact that the money may have been sent to the home office. There were other channels through which the money could have passed. Certainly the testimony of the agents would not be competent to disprove the fact of payment of money <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>into the hands of the secretary and the president.
