So, too, “in cases of doubt or ambiguity, the provisions of a life insurance policy [and of all other insurance policies] will be viewed in the light most favorable to the insured” : Brams v.

John Hancock Mutual Life Ins.

    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[266,2093,1149,316]],["BL_231.1",231,[156,359,1154,1351]]]'>In the instant case it is not necessary to go so far as in some of the cases cited, but, speaking generally, we are in accord with them. Here there was ample proof for the court below to submit to the jury to determine whether or not plaintiff was “incapacitated to such an extent as to be wholly, continuously and permanently <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>unable to engage in any occupation or profession or to perform any work or service for compensation, gain or profit.” Considering the policy in its entirety, the following statement of the trial judge would appear to be fully justified: “......there is in this policy somewhat of an inconsistency. It gives the right to this income to the insured if he is totally, continuously and permanently disabled in the manner I have indicated; and then further on it says that, if he gets better, the payments of income will stop and the prior relations of the parties under the policy shall be resumed, and the plaintiff will then return to the payment of the premium. It is, therefore, perfectly obvious that they did not mean permanent in the ordinary sense of that word. What the parties meant was this, — and the interpretation and meaning of the language is for the court to give you, — that if the insured gets into such physical condition that the probabilities appear to be that he will be permanently disabled, his right to the monthly income then arises and continues until it develops that that physical disability which was apparently permanent has, for any reason, ceased.” In this connection see Tibbetts v. Prudential Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/313/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="313 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="1152688" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0310-01">313 Pa. 310</a>, where we approved the above cited opinions of the Superior Court.</p>

In these matters he was corroborated by defendant’s expert oculist as well as by his own. He further said that he had tried to work at other businesses as well as his own, which was that of an electrical engineer, but found that he could not <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>work at any of them. And it is not to be overlooked in this connection, that, at the trial, in the presence of the jury, defendant’s counsel stated that they did not contend that plaintiff was malingering. His wife and the two physicians who attended him, corroborated his story. One of the physicians said that he is “an awful nervous wreck at the present time,” and when asked “Q. Apart from giving your prognosis as to the effect of this case up to the present time, since the accident, in your opinion, has he been able to engage in any occupation, any gainful occupation?,” he answered “No sir, he has not.” The other doctor, who was an eye specialist, says substantially the same thing, concluding his testimony with the statement: “Well really I don’t know of any occupation he could engage in, considering his education along the lines that he started out his life in. It is very difficult for any man to take up a new occupation.” It also appeared that the sight of the left eye is getting worse, the expert witness last referred to saying also: “The probabilities are very much against him regaining what he has already lost. The probabilities are that he will have more involvement........rather than that he will have improvement.”</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[266,1653,1150,698]],["BL_233.1",233,[117,342,1150,97]]]'>Defendant’s witnesses in their testimony very inadequately met that evidence. One of their physicians said that he had made two examinations of plaintiff, and that he did not think plaintiff was “wholly, continuously and permanently unable to engage in any occupation or profession, or to perform any service for gain or profit.” But he also said: “I could not pass any opinion on the left eye, because it looked perfectly normal to me; but it required a certain examination that I was not prepared to make to determine the exact condition of the left eye.” Defendant’s eye specialist had, however, made such an examination, and he testified that “The left eye had a vision of five-thirtieths <em>with a large </em>

    <p id="b233-4" data-blocks='[["BL_233.5",233,[115,779,1154,1623]],["BL_234.1",234,[288,346,1146,373]]]'>The second question said to be involved, viz., “Should the court below have declared as a matter of law that plaintiff did not submit to defendant, while the policies were in force, proof of total permanent disability as required by the policies?” requires but little consideration. What the policies require is that “due proof [be] made to the company of the fact of such disability.” It would seem that defendant’s contention is that this constituted it as the final arbiter, in its own case, of the question of “due proof.” If the clause meant that, probably no court would sustain it; but that is not its true import. What it does mean is that the insured shall submit “due proof......of the fact of such disability”; whether or not there is sufficient to justify a recovery is a matter for the trial tribunal. Plaintiff in due course gave to defendant written notice of that fact, in a series of letters, resulting in defendant’s physician examining plaintiff, defendant postponing decision on what they would do until they heard from him, and then closing the pending matter by writing “After carefully considering the completed file in connection with your claim for disability benefits under the above contracts, we regret to advise you that the company cannot approve your claim for the reason [not that you have not complied with the formal requirements as to notice, but] that the information submitted in your case does not fall within the provisions of the disability clause in your policies.” This operated as a waiver of a requirement of further notice, gave plaintiff the right to sue at once, and limited defendant to the defense ex<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>pressed in that letter: Did the injury which plaintiff suffered “fall within the provisions of the disability clause in [his] policies?” What defendant was entitled to have was notice of the fact of permanent disability, not such proofs as would be required on the trial of the case. The former it got, and “as notice” it made no objection thereto.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[287,730,1146,151]]]'>The third question involved requires no further consideration. It is covered by what we have already said in answering the second question.</p>
