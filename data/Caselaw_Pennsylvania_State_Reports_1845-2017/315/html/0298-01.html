June 17, 1927, defendant Melvin, by writing, agreed to buy from P. J. and J. T. Whelan, certain real estate and to give in pax’t payment a first mortgage of $37,000, payable within three years, settlement to be made on or before September 20, 1927. <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>There was no agreement that defendant should give a bond. In July, 1927, one of the Whelans stated to defendant that they should also like to have a bond; Melvin replied he had not agreed to give one, but, after some conversation on the subject, agreed to give his bond, good for three years, on condition that it should be “restricted” ; i. e., collectible only out of the mortgaged property. No additional consideration was given for the bond. September 19, 1927, the parties met for settlement at the Integrity Trust Company, Whelan meanwhile having prepared the bond and mortgage. When they were produced at the settlement for Melvin’s signature, he called attention to the fact that the bond was unrestricted and not in compliance with the understanding, and refused to execute it. Whelan stated that the restriction agreed upon had been omitted from the bond by mistake, and, to avoid delaying the settlement (the time for which expired next day), asked Melvin to sign it upon condition that he would immediately give Melvin a letter or agreement protecting him and restricting the obligation of the bond to default within three years and to the mortgaged real estate. Melvin then executed the papers and Whelan delivered the letter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There is no dispute about these facts. None of this testimony was <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>contradicted, and, as to what happened at the settlement, not only defendant and one of the Whelans, but Wildey, the Whelans’s agent in the transaction, testified. On September 21, 1927, Whelan assigned the bond and mortgage to the Integrity Trust Company, as additional security for a preexisting collateral loan. October 20, 1927, Melvin sold the premises fo one Quigley and thereafter had no interest in them. October 29, 1927, the Integrity Trust Company sold the bond and mortgage to Allinger, the present use-plaintiff and appellant. The mortgage was, of course, duly recorded. Neither the Integrity Trust Company nor Allinger were advised of the existence of the agreement restricting liability on the bond. Neither of them inquired of Melvin whether he had any defense, nor did they ask for a declaration of no set-off. Melvin did nothing that induced them to refrain from inquiring for defenses or obtaining a declaration of no set-off.</p>
