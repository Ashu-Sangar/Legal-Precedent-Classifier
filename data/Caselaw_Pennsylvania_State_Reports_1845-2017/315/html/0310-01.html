Bowers, plaintiff, was duly elected treasurer of Jefferson County, for the term of four years, commencing the first Monday of January, 1934, to succeed defendant Richard E. Reitz, who, by appointment, was filling an unexpired term ending on that date. A certificate of election was issued to Bowers. He took the oath of office January 5, 1934, and on January 9th filed the required bonds, which were duly approved. He. then called upon defendant to turn over to him the office quarters provided by the county for use of the county treasurer, with their official <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>appurtenances, which-defendant refused to do, claiming that, by reason of having failed to qualify for his office at the beginning of the term, plaintiff had forfeited his right to the office, and that, under the Act of June 9, 1931, P. L. 401, section 51,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> it was his (appellant’s) duty to continue to act as county treasurer until the first Monday of January, 1936. On plaintiff’s motion, the court below issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining defendant “from exercising any and all acts as treasurer of Jefferson County” and commanding him to deliver to plaintiff possession of the office facilities provided by the county and the accompanying appurtenances. Upon service of the writ on defendant, he stated he would not comply with its requirements, and, in answer to a rule to show cause why he should not be adjudged guilty of contempt, he by his counsel reiterated, at a hearing held by the chancellor, that he did not intend to obey the order. Thereupon the court imposed a jail sentence, for contempt, of five days, refusing plaintiff’s demand for a trial by jury. On allowance by this court of a supersedeas as to the order of attachment for contempt, defendant was released at the end of three days.</p>

Brookville Boro., <a href="/pa/300/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1125884" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0021-01">300 Pa. 21</a>, 23, and cases there cited. The undenied fact that Harvey G. Bowers was duly elected county <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>treasurer and held a certificate of election is prima facie evidence that he is entitled to the office, and, having qualified by taking the oath of office and filing the required bonds, is the county treasurer, at least so far. as these proceedings are concerned. Plaintiff’s statement that his delay in qualifying was due to circumstances not under his control is accepted by defendant and the court below without objection. The court below was of opinion plaintiff’s title to the office was so clear that it was not involved in these proceedings, and that plaintiff’s delay in qualifying did not, under the law, constitute a failure to qualify (Anderson’s App., <a href="/pa/215/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="215 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="948460" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0119-01">215 Pa. 119</a>; Com. ex rel. v.

J. 962, section 95) ; consequently injunction was a permissible remedy to protect relator in the exercise of the duties of the office (Kerr v. Trego, <a href="/pa/47/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="47 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="485585" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0292-01">47 Pa. 292</a>, 295; and see Scott v.

Despite his argument to the contrary, he would, by complying, have sacrified none of his legal rights: Scott v. Sheehan, supra. His contention that the court was without jurisdiction to issue an injunction and that, without jurisdiction, the decree was void and consequently he could not be adjudged in contempt, is based on a misapprehension of the meaning of the word “jurisdiction” in this connection. The court below had jurisdiction over the parties (Allegheny Bank’s App., <a href="/pa/48/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="48 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="422228" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0328-01">48 Pa. 328</a>) and <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>over the general subject involved: 32 C. J. 286, section 454. “Where the court has jurisdiction, the fact that the injunction......is erroneous, or was improvidently granted or irregularly obtained, is no excuse for violating it; and this rule applies with equal force to a prosecution for contempt instituted for the purpose of punishing a person for disobeying an order of the court on the ground that its authority or dignity is in question, and one which-»is instituted to enforce the authority of the court in the administration of justice between litigants”: 32 C. J. 482-4, section 833. “If a party can make himself a judge of the validity of orders which have been issued, and by his own act of disobedience set them aside, then are the courts impotent, and what the Constitution fittingly calls the ‘judicial power......’would be a mere mockery”: Gompers v. Bucks Stove, etc., Co., <a href="/us/221/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="221 U.S. 418" data-case-ids="3658940" data-case-paths="/us/221/0418-01">221 U. S. 418</a>, 450.</p>
