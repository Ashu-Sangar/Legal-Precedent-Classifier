That is so under this Act of Assembly. They are forbidden to go to any greater width than that, except where there is an excavation or a fill. It is admitted by an engineer that where there is a deep cut, for every foot on the height of the cut it requires one and a half feet laterally. It is the same where an enbankment must be made; and if the embankment were twenty feet high there would be a lateral extension of 15 feet on each side, because for every foot in ascent one and a half feet is required laterally to support it, otherwise the bank would roll down and would not be safe. Railroads must be built safe, and the act gives the railroad company the right to so extend on the ground where there are cuts or fills. This doctrine, however, does not apply in this case for the reason that under the evidence, winch is uncontradicted, whenever the company filled up on the side toward the old fence, after it reached it, then Obert filled up to the level of the track, -thereby making the ground level at that point. That question, therefore, needs no consideration from you.”</p>

The Cotton Mill branch was not part of the defendants’ original location, and there is no evidence to show how they procured their right of way over it.

It was competent of course for the company to construct its road, in whole or part, upon a location of less than four rods; that was merely the legal limit, which except for cuts, fills, &amp;c., the company could not exceed ; and wo can see no ground when the question is raised collaterally, for the presumption, in the absence of proof, that the taking was to the full extent allowed by law. In the ease of Prather <em>v. </em>West. Union Tel. Co., 14 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R.

The description given in that deed begins at “ a post in a line of South street; ” but where this point is, was and still is a. matter of serious dispute; the location of the line “along the eastern bank of the railroad, south fourteen and a fourth degrees west, fifteen and one fourth perches,” <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>depends of course upon the place of beginning. The defendants say, that this “ post ” is a point in the line of South street, at the west side of the,old Lewis Ferry road; whilst the plaintiffs contend, that it is a point one and nine tenths perches west of that road. The survey shows that if the lines are run according to the plaintiff’s contention, the line referred to would, as we understand it, run near to, but not with an “ old fence,” which the plaintiff claims to have been the line, and would include the ground taken for the additional track; but, beginning at the point claimed by the defendants, the survey will exclude that ground. The proper location of the lines was for the jury; that the question was not discussed at the trial is perhaps unfortunate, but is not ground for complaint here. The rights of the railroad company are to be measured by the deed of Hahs to the company, and the location therein referred to. and not by any subsequent deed conveying the residue. But as one of the lines of the deed to Muhlenberg is “ along the eastern bank of the railroad south fourteen and one fourth degrees west, fifteen and one fourth perches,” the courses and distances of that deed, being the deed under which the plaintiff claims title, may furnish some evidence as to where that location actually was. The description might be deemed equivalent to a deliberate statement of the parties to it, that a line running from the northwest corner of the lot conveyed, with the bearing south fourteen and one fourth degrees west, would run along the eastern bank of the railroad. But no principle in the nature of an estoppel could apply, as no one appears to have acted upon the admission to his injury. The evidence was, therefore, not of a conclusive character; this statement of the parties was simply to be taken with other evidence in the cause, to determine tlie precise location of the railroad line; because if the courses and distances of the deed did exclude the land in dispute, they would yield to the call for the eastern bank of the railroad, if the location of that bank could be otherwise clearly established.</p>

The owner is not ordinarily bound to put his fences on the line of his land, and no presumption arises from his failure so to do; but in this instance the covenant of Hahs was to build the fence along the railroad, and that he built and maintained such a fence in pursuance of the covenant, with the acquiescence of the company, if the facts be as alleged, would certainty be evidence that the fence was along the railroad, according to the line established by the parties: So also, where the terms of a grant of a right of way are general and indefinite, its location and use by the grantee, acquiesced in by the grantor, will have the same effect as if it had been fully described by the terms of the grant: Warner <em>v. </em>Railroad Co.

William R. Seitzinger testifies in substance, that “ in the beginning ” the company had only one track, which was completed in 1838; that a fence was afterwards built from fifteen to twenty feet from the base of the embankment of the railroad; that not a great while afterwards, perhaps two or three years, the second track was laid, on the eastern side of the first track, which brought the embankment within five or six feet of the fence. In these statements he is to some extent corroborated by Jacob Bowers, Henry Seiders, and Lewis Eisenhower. The last witness also testified that he knew the fence from the beginning, and that to the best of his knowledge it was never moved. Francis J. <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>Obert, the plaintiff, testified that he purchased the property iu 1854, and that at that time there was an old fence along the railroad, close up to the embankment; that from time to time, as the company filled on their side of the fence, be filled on his side, and that the fence was at three different times lifted up, but that it was always kept upon the same line on which lie found it when he bought the property. It does <em>not </em>appear by whom the fence was built, but the fair and reasonable presumption is, that it was built pursuant to the provision of the contract. Upon such evidence the court was certainly-justified in submitting the question to the jury. It was further contended, however, that the strip of land in question, was embraced in the right of way of the Cotton Mill branch. We have no evidence, however, how this right was acquired or to what extent, and there can, under such circumstances, be no presumption which will extend the right beyond what was actually appropriated, and was used by the company for the purpose. In the ascertainment of the damages, considerable latitude was allowed in the examination, but we discover no error which would call for a reversal of the judgment.</p>
