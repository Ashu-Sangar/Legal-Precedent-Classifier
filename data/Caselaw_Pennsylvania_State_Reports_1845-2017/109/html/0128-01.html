    <p id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.10",147,[121,759,1172,301]]]'>It is settled law both in this country and in England that quo warranto is not a writ of right; it rests in the sound discretion of the judge whether he will allow the writ. The late Chief Justice Gibson has made this so plain in Com. <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/nc/47/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Jones 365" data-case-ids="8682593" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0365-01">2 Jones, 365</a>, that no room is left for doubt.

This is so, but in that case the question was not raised, nor was it called to our attention in any manner. The judgment was affirmed upon the merits ; had the point been made the writ would probably have been quashed. It is always well to remember that a case is authority only for what is decided.</p>
