But the court decided that the paper of September 6th, 1877, was in no sense a will, such as was contemplated by the donor of the power, and therefore failed to execute the power created by the will of George P. DeSilver. This raises the question whether the estate covered by the power, which was untouched by the deed of 1877, passed under the will of 1876. It seems to be quite clear that a subsequent conveyance by the testatrix which disposed of only part of her own estate, or which failed to dispose of the estate which was under her control, would be a revocation pro tanto only of her will. The cases cited in the note to 1 Jarman, 130, seem to establish this point; and the Act of 8th April, 1833, sections 13 and 14, declares that “ no will in writing ..... shall be repealed ..... otherwise than by some other will.....or other writing declaring the same.” If the deed was silent as to the power, and the will either expressly or by legal implication, referred to and executed the power, then the will, to this extent, was unrevoked. If it had been made in Pennsylvania, it would not only be unrevoked, but would be deemed, under the Act of 1879, a valid execution of the power. One obstacle to the recovery by the husband, which existed at the time of the audit, arising from the direction by the donor that the power of appointment in the will should be exercised by a “will duly executed according to the law of her domicil,” has been removed by the subsequent proof of the existence of such an instrument. But the argument was used that the donor of the power has himself made the law which shall rule this case, and has declared that the will, which shall execute the power, must be such a will as would be valid for that purpose by the law of France ; that the testatrix must be presumed to have framed her will in the light of the French law; and that inasmuch as that law knows nothing of powers of appointment, the testatrix, when she gave to her husband “all her fortune,” gave him nothing more than the French law would imply from that phrase. The intent of the testatrix is thus made to depend upon the accident of locality; and although by the very words which she has used an intent to exercise the power would be inferred if she had written them in Pennsylvania, a contrary meaning will be put upon them because she wrote them in France. The broader view would seem to be that the testatrix had quite as fully in mind the property which she controlled by virtue of the will of her first husband and, which was essentially her own, as the prop<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>erty which she possessed in her own right. The layman is not apt to draw a nice distinction between these two species of interest, and the recognition of this obvious fact in daily life led to the Act of 1879. It does seem a fallacy to say that because an estate which may be created by a power of appointment is unknown to the French law, no form of testamentary disposition could pass it; it might almost as well be said that the testatrix could not have disposed of her property by designating its value in dollars, because the law of France would have estimated it in francs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[235,850,1183,597]]]'>The argument, moreover, assumes too much which declares that the gift by the testatrix of all her fortune constituted the husband her “ universal legatee,” and therefore gave him only the interest which an heir would have taken in case of an intestacy. The term “ universal legatee ” is a technical term, in ordinary use in French wills; and in the absence of recognized authority to that effect, cannot be replaced by other expressions. It is sufficient to say that the testatrix did not use it. To make the case of the next of kin good, it should have been shown that a French court, before whom a similar testament had been produced, had decided that a gift of all the fortune of the testatrix would not have comprehended the fortune which was hers under a power of appointment.</p>

Changing the names of the donor and donee of the power to those of the parties before us, the present case is thus ruled by Justice Agnew: “The property and the domicil of George P. DeSilver, being within Pennsylvania, the law of this state must govern the interpretation both of the power and the execution of it......The exercise of Elizabeth Aubert’s power of dominion over the property is necessarily regulated by the law which governs the subject of her dominion. It is not the estate of Elizabeth Aubert, but that of George P.

The court below while calling the Acte a deed, at the same time gave it the effect of a will by making it pass the property Mrs. Aubert owned at her death, and by making it revoke the will of 1876. It is virtually a will. The essence of the definition of a will is that it is a disposition to take effect after death.

Tbe Acte is a perfect execution of the power under the rule of construction established by the Act of June 4th, 1879, P. L., 88. There is therefore no need to call for the equitable interpretation of the court in favor of Mr. Aubert. It is a valid execution of tbe power even if regarded as a deed, because testamentary in its nature: Sugden on Powers, chap. 7, § 3, part 15; 1 Chance on Powers, p. 860 § 828. The Acte moreover is a will within the meaning of the donor of the power whose will must be construed by Pennsylvania law because it disposes of property to be here administered. The power will therefore be properly executed by any instrument which would have in France the same efficacy which a will has here. It is immaterial by what name the instrument is called, otherwise a Pennsylvania will would have to be construed by the French code : Bingbam’s Appeal, 14 P. F. S., 345; Sewall <em>v. </em>Wilmer, <a href="/mass/132/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="132 Mass. 131" data-case-ids="2131552" data-case-paths="/mass/132/0131-01">132 Mass., 131</a>. Besides, the appellant claims under the will of 1876. If the Acte is not a will it must be a deed, and as a deed, cannot revoke the will of 1876. The will has been proved under the French law, and the decree of the French court upon it is conclusive here: Miller <em>v. </em>James, L. R. 3 P. D. 4; D’Huartv. Darkness, 34 Beav., 324. The disposition of property by a deed is by its nature specific, and therefore cannot adeem or sat<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>isfy a general bequest of all the property owned by the testator at his death : Bothamly <em>v. </em>Sherson, L.

If the Aete is a deed the will of 1876 will stand and pass by its general terms the residuum of Mrs. Aubert’s estate. If the Acte is a will, it makes, together with the will, but a single testamentary disposition. A later will will revoke a former one only so far as they are inconsistent with each other: Williams on Executors, part I, book II, chap. Ill, § 2; Goods of Petchell, 3 P. &amp; D., 153 ; Goods of Donaldson, 3 P. &amp; D., 45; Lemage <em>v. </em>Goodban, 1 P. &amp; D., 57; Hegartv’s Appeal, 25 P. F. S., 503; Cochran <em>v. </em>Young, 8 Out., 333; Price <em>v. </em>Maxwell, 4 Case_y, 23. It is immaterial that neither the will nor the Acte alludes to the power, for the Act of 1879, affords a rule of construction which prevails unless the “contrary intention” expressly appears in the will. It cannot be inferred from extrinsic circumstances: Act June 4th, 1879, P. L., 88; Stillman <em>v. </em>Weedon, 16 Simons, 26; Boyes <em>v. </em>Cook, L. R. 14 Ch. Div. 53.</p>

It matters not that the Acte could not take effect as a will, for it demonstrates the intention to revoke, and therefore amounts in law to a revocation: Shove <em>v. </em>Pineke, 5 Term, 129 ; Dempsey <em>v. </em>Lawson, L.

The Act of June 4th, 1879, was not in force in 1877 when the Acte de Notariete was made. The latter revoked the will of 1876, and being revoked two years before the passage of the Act of 1879 was not by it galvanized into life. The will of DeSilver, directed expressly that the power should be executed by will “ executed according to the law of her domicile.” Therefore Bingham’s Appeal, 14 P. F. S., 345, is not in point, for the rule there laid down applies only to eases where there is no direction in the instrument creating the power. It is very clear that the Acte de Notariete was not a will according to the law of France ; and a mere equivalence of function is not enough; for the instrument must be “ duly executed ” as a will, and this was not, for it was neither holographic nor executed before two notaries and two witnesses, or one notary and four witnesses. It was in fact executed as a donation <em>inter vivos, </em>before one notary and two witnesses. Not only was the Acte <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>de Notariete not a will by the law of France but it was not a will by tlie law of Pennsylvania. It was a mere agreement and was not transformed into a will by the power of revocation. The question is not whether the beneficiary takes any title anterior to death, but whether the instrument under which he claims has any effect <em>as an instrument </em>before the death of its maker: Frew <em>v. </em>Clarke, 30 P. F. S., 179 ; Habergham <em>v. </em>Vincent, 2 Ves. jr., 230 ; Paul <em>v. </em>Hewetson. 2 M. &amp; K., 434; Bell’s Principle of the law of Scotland, § 1681; Majoribanks <em>v. </em>Hovenden, 6 Ir. Eq. 238, Drury 11. Note of Sugden in 2d Ed. of Sugden’s Powers, page 215; on Attorney General <em>v. </em>Jones, 3 Price, 384. The Act of June 4th, 1879 by its wording applies only to a will strictly so called, and does not apply to a mere convention or agreement; and if it did, the wording of the Acte de Notariete brings it within the exception of the Act of Assembly. She gives all “ which will compose her estate after her death.” This amounts to a limitation of the bequest.</p>

We shall treat it as a dry question of law. The contest is between the husband on the one hand, and the residuary legatees, who are the brother and sister of the testator, on the other. The fund is in the hands of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives and Granting Annuities, trustee in place of Henry M.

By public act, which must be executed before two notaries in the presence of two witnesses, or before one notary in the presence of four witnesses; and 2. By holograph, which is not valid unless it has been written, dated and signed exclusively by the hand of the testator. The will in question was a holograph will and appears to have been properly executed. The <em>Acte de Notariete </em>was a donation <em>inter </em>vivos. We need not discuss the latter paper at length for the reason that, according to the law of France, it is not a testament. Such gifts are conventional in their nature, partaking of the character of agreements or covenants. Ordinarily they are irrevocable, and can only affect property then the possession of the donor. In the case of husband and wife, however, they are revocable, and may include property to be acquired in the future.</p>

That if not revoked, it contains no reference to the power, and is not an execution thereof.</p>

And the same writer lays down the doctrine, which I do not understand to be seriously disputed, that an instrument purporting to be a conveyance, but incapable of taking effect as such, may operate to revoke a previous devise. But the reason of this rule evidently is, that the subsequent conveyance was inconsistent with the devise, and disclosed <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>an intent to revoke it. But here the <em>Acte de Notariete </em>is in entire harmony with the previous will. It passed the same estate and to the same person. It was evidently intended to confirm the will. It was not necessary; it adds no strength to the will, but to say that it revokes what it was intended to make sirre is a contradiction of terms.</p>
    <p id="b477-4" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[98,678,1178,652]]]'>It is true there is an apparent difference in the disposition of the property by the two instruments. By her will Mrs. Aubert gives her husband “all my property in full ownership, so that he may dispose of it as he shall deem advisable,” while by the <em>Acte </em>tíre gift is reduced in the event of there being children by the marriage to “one quarter in ownership and one quarter for life.” But this difference is only apparent. I understand by sections 913, 916 and 920 of the French Code, that the <em>Acte </em>would not be revoked by the subsequent birth of children, because the said Code would, in such event, reduce the portion of which disposition had been made in the gift <em>iniei' vivos </em>exactly as in the testament. So that this provision in the <em>Acte </em>was surplusage; the Code would have written it in that instrument in case children had been born of the marriage.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[92,1328,1182,897]]]'>The second objection to the will presents a question of more difficulty. As before observed, the will makes no reference to the power; it purports only to pass the estate of Mrs. Aubert ; the fund in question is a part of the estate of George P. DeSilver, over which he gave his wife a power of appointment. It is very clear that by the law of Pennsylvania as it existed at the time this will was written, the will would not have been an execution of the power. But after the date of the will and before the death of Mrs. Aubert, the Act of 4th June, 1879, P. L. 88, was passed by the legislature of this state, the third section of which provides inter alia that “ a bequest of the personal estate of the testator, or any bequest of personal property described in a general manner, shall be construed to include any personal estate, or any personal estate to which such description shall extend, as the ease may be, which he may have power to appoint in any maimer he may think proper, and shall operate as an execution of such power, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.” And the fourth section enacts that “this Act shall operate and go into effect as to the wills of all persons who shall die after the date of the Act.”</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.7",477,[90,2236,1176,216]],["BL_478.1",478,[263,425,1183,1208]]]'>It was argued with much plausibility that the Act of 1879 could not be applied in this case for the reason that inasmuch as it was not in existence when the will was executed, Mrs. Aubert could not have had it in contemplation when she made said will; hence her omission to refer to the power was not an <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>accident, but the result of an intent to give her husband only her own estate. This course of reasoning, however, ignores the purpose of the Act, which was to make a general will execute the power in all cases when a contrary intent does not appear upon the face of the will. When such contrary intent does appear the Act has no effect, for it was not intended to thwart the intent of the testator, but to cany it into effect. Experience had shown that in many instances a power had been defectively executed through ignorance or the carelessness of the draftsman of the will. The Act declares substantially that a gift, or devise of all of a man’s estate, shall carry with it property over which he had a power of appointment by will; in other words that a general will is an execution of the power. And it assumes that such was the intent of the testator unless the contrary intent appears by the will. It is true we must presume that Mrs. Aubert knew the law when she made her will, and that as it then existed a general will would not execute a power. But the same is true of the many other persons whose failure to properly execute a power led to the passage of the Act of 1879. The recognized presumption is that no one is ignorant of the law, yet every intelligent man knows that this is an extremely violent presumption; it is a convenient, if not necessary fiction, nothing more. We cannot impute to Mrs. Aubert a greater knowledge of the law upon this subject then was possessed by hundreds of others who have failed in the execution of powers. We would equally err in imputing to her less. The probability is that she knew nothing about it.</p>
    <p id="b478-6" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[264,1633,1177,387]]]'>The Act of 1879, as we have.seen, operates upon the wills of all persons who shall die after the date of the Act. It is not confined to wills which are executed after the date of the Act. The reason of this is plain. The Act is based upon the fact that testators in many instances are either ignorant of the law or neglect to comply with it. In order that their intent may not by such means be defeated, it declares that under certain circumstances a general will shall execute a power. We are of opinion that this will comes within the Act of 1879.</p>

Subsequent reflection has changed my view upon this point and I am clear that it was intended as an enabling clause. Mr. De Silver was a citizen of this state and we have no reason to suppose he would not have been satisfied with an appointment in conformity with Pennsylvania law. But his wife was of French birth and he evidently contemplated her being domi <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>ciled abroad. He probably knew if be made no provision upon the subject the validity of the appointment must be determined by the law of this state. This would require a knowledge of our laws on the part of whoever prepared her will in a foreign country, and might involve a failure. In order to facilitate the execution of the power he provides that it may be done in conformity to the law of her domicile.</p>
