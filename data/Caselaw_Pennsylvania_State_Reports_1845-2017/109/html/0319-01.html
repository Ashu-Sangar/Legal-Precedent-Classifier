If C. died before all the instalments became due A. was to pay B. interest, from that time, on those still due; on the other hand B. agreed to pay A. interest on instalments paid by the latter from date of payment until O.’s death. B. gave A. a deed, and the latter gave notes for the purchase money, which B. sold before maturity. A. paid the notes which matured, and B. paid him interest on the amounts thus paid, until the land was sold at sheriff's sale under a judgment against A., when B. refused to make further payments. A.’s’outstanding notes for purchase money wore paid out of the proceeds of this sale. A. then brought suit against B. (C. being still alive), for interest on the former’s payments of purchase money, made before the sheriff’s sale.</p>

Before her interest ceased, the plaintiff suffered his interest in the land to be taken from him by virtue of a sheriff’s sale. He no longer controls the land which was the subject of the contract. He was paid all he could in equity or law require from the defendant. His property has gone to pay his honest debts. By this action he seeks to recover something for nothing. The court below could not see how this could be done, and so informed the jury. In this we see no error.</p>

The consideration to be paid was fixed on a valuation of the entire property when this life estate should terminate, an event which the parties thought would not be long delayed. In the meantime the purchaser was not to have any possession, and was not to pay interest on the purchase money, which was $2,500. He was to make the first payment of $200 in October following, and the residue of the purchase money in three annual instalments thereafter. If by the death of Mrs. Rogers he came into possession before the payments became due, he was to pay interest from such time on the whole sum unpaid. If, however, the payments should be made before he came into possession, then he was to be allowed interest on all sums so paid from the time of payment until he should be entitled to the possession.</p>

The learned judge thought this sale was fatal to the plaintiff’s right to recover, and directed a compulsory nonsuit, which he refused to take off. This is assigned for error.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.6",341,[108,698,1172,257]]]'>The evidence is that the portion of the purchase money not paid by the plaintiff before the sheriff’s sale, was paid out of the proceeds of that sale.

It is a mistake to treat this interest money as rent. It does not issue out of the land. It cannot be collected by distress. It has none of the incidents appertaining to rent. The learned judge was also mistaken in holding that the sheriff’s sale prevented a recovery by the plaintiff. The agreement was a personal contract between the parties thereto. It did not run with the land, nor did the plaintiff’s claim for interest paid, become a lien thereon. The judgment on which the sale was made was a lien on the estate or interest only which Mason held in the land. The purchaser at sheriff’s sale took no greater interest than this. The sale did not divest the life estate of Mrs. Rogers. It gave to the purchaser no right of possession during her life. It did not transfer to him any personal claim the plaintiff had or might have against the defendant. The purchaser bought with full knowledge or means of knowledge that he would not have a right to possession until after the death of Mrs. Rogers.</p>
