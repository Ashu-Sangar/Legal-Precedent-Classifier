But it is a well settled principle that seaworthiness of the ship is not a condition precedent to the shipper’s liability for general average, although, if the loss was caused by it, that would constitute a good defence : Schloss <em>v. </em>Heriot, 14 C. B. N. S., 59. Under a marine policy on ship, freight or cargo, the fitness of the vessel for service, in the absence of any contrary provision, may be an implied condition, but in contracts of affreightment, no such condition exists. In the latter case, however, there is perhaps an implied contract on the part of the ship owner that the ship is tight: Abbott on Shipping, 224; Lyon <em>v. </em>Mells, 5 East, 428 ; Putnam <em>v. </em>Wood, <a href="/mass/3/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Mass. 481" data-case-ids="2005743" data-case-paths="/mass/3/0421-01">3 Mass., 481</a>; but that it is tight is the prima facie presumption: Myers <em>v. </em>Girard Ins. Co., 2 Casey, 195; and if it be not, unless the loss occurs in consequence of unseaworthiness, the doctrine of general average will apply. The averment in the plaintiff’s declaration, that the schooner was staunch and seaworthy, was, under the implication arising out of the contract of affreightment, a proper one; perhaps it was not essential, but it did not require any proof in the first instance in support of it. There are affirmative averments, deemed essential in formal pleading, which stand upon the presumption of their truth until that presumption is rebutted; for example, in an action for defamation, the good repute of the plaintiff is always averred, but need not be proved until it is attacked.</p>

The court was right, we think, in refusing to charge the jury that the plaintiff /as bound to prove the seaworthiness of the vessel, as a condition of his recovery.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.6",458,[262,2012,1173,214]]]'>But it was competent, we think, for the defendants, notwithstanding the execution of the general average bond, and the adjustment and apportionment of the loss, to have shown that the unseaworthiuess of the vessel caused the extraordinary expense incurred at Norfolk.</p>

In the case of a general ship, <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>where there are many consignees, the English practice is for the master, before delivering the goods, to take a bond from the different merchants for payment of their portion of the average, when the same shall be adjusted : Abbott on Shipping, part 3, c. 8, sec. 17; and it has been held in this country that as the right is founded in commercial usage, the captain may make the giving of the average bond a condition of the delivery: Cole <em>v. </em>Bartlett, <a href="/la/4/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 La. 130" data-case-ids="1821700" data-case-paths="/la/4/0130-01">4 La., 130</a>. But the obligor might, we think, set up want of consideration, fraud, or mistake as a defence to the payment of it, as to the payment of any other bond. If the loss was in fact not occasioned by some peril of the sea, but by the misconduct of the master, the bond could have no consideration whatever to support it, and it would certainly be competent to defend against it upon that ground.</p>
    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[125,1021,1169,1163]]]'>In Strong <em>v. </em>New York Firemen Ins.

When the general average is thus fairly settled in the foreign port, according to the usage and law of that port, it is binding and conclusive as to the items, as well as to the apportionment thereof upon the various interests, though settled differently from what it would have been in the home port: 3 Kent's Com., 244. If, however, it was not a proper case for a general average, and was a partial loss only, the adjustment, assuming a case for general average, when none existed, is not binding: Lenox <em>v. </em>United Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Johns.%20Cas.%20178" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Johns.

In Chamberlaine <em>v. </em>Reed, 13 Maine, 357, which was an action between the owner of the goods shipped on board a vessel as freight and the master of the vessel, it was held that an adjustment and general average of a loss made on the protest and representation of the master, did not preclude the owner from showing that they were not liable to contribution, because the loss was occasioned by the culpable negligence or want of skill of the master. The legal operation and only effect of the bond and the adjustment is, in each instance, we think, to fix the measure of the defendants’ liability, and secure payment of the amount, unless it shall afterwards appear that it was not a case for general average.</p>

Edwards, and other witnesses, that the schooner “Mattie A. Hand” at and before the time of her departure from the port of Philadelphia, on the voyage described in the inuT, was uuseaworthy. The offer was in direct proof of the <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>defendants’ first special plea. It may be that this plea even if sustained by the proof, is insufficient in law to bar the plaintiffs’ recovery; if the plaintiff thought it insufficient he should have demurred, but he joined issue and went to trial upon it, and he cannot prevent that from going to the jury, on part of the defendants, which tends to prove the issue thus formed. If a party accepts an issue tendered, the question thus raised is one that must be tried, and upon which evidence is necessarily admissible. In Howell <em>v. </em>McCoy, <a href="/rawle/3/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Rawle 256" data-case-ids="1822540" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0256-01">3 Rawle, 256</a>, it is held that the plaintiff has a right to support his cause of action by proof of the facts, stated in the declaration, and this can only be prevented by a demurrer, which admits the truth of the facts as set forth. The defence, if any he has, will avail the defendant, when the whole case is before the court and jury, by a direction on the law, arising on the facts. In Moore <em>v. </em>Houston, 3 S. &amp; R., 175, Chief Justice Tilghman says: “If the question were simply, whether the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas should be reversed or affirmed, there would be little difficulty in deciding it. If any of the rejected evidence was competent the judgment cannot stand. And, without doubt, part of it was competent, because it was in direct proof of the defendant’s plea, and therefore admissible, whether it was matter sufficient, in law, to bar the plaintiff’s action or not. If the plaintiff thought it insufficient to bar him he might have démurred; but having joined issue, he cannot prevein; that from going to the jury which tends to prove the issue on the part of the defendant.” Rawlins <em>v. </em>Danvers, 5 Espinasse, 38; Thompson <em>v. </em>Barclay, 3 Casey, 263; Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Ervin, 8 Norris, 71; and Seymour <em>v. </em>Hubert, 11 Id., 499, are eases in support of the same principle. The exclusion of the evidence offered, was, in our opinion, erroneous.</p>
