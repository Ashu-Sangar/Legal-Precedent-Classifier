Farrandsville was the western terminus of the canal and from this point to Lock Haven it was slack water navigation, created by dams at Queens Run and Lock Haven. The defendants failed to keep said part of the canal in operation and repair, whereby the plaintiffs were prevented from using it for shipping lumber, and they brought this suit December 10th, 1881, for damages thereby suffered. The defence was that the defendants bad abandoned this part of the canal, under the Act of June 2d, 1870 (P.

The plain meaning of two thirds of the stockholders, is two thirds in number. There was, therefore, not a compliance with the Act, which must be construed strictly and against the corpoiation in favor of the public: Packer <em>v. </em>Sunbury &amp; Erie It. R., 7 Harris, 218; Johnson <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 10 P. F. S., 451; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Erie and North East R. R., 3 Casey,.339. Again, the Act is unconstitutional and void, as obnoxious to Art. XI., sec. 8 of the State Constitution. It contains four subjects not related to each other: (1.) Authority to plank-road, turnpike and canal companies to issue bonds and mortgages; (2) Authority to canal companies to build dams and substitute slack water, for canal navigation; (3) Authority to abandon parts of plank-roads, turnpikes and canals; (4) It limits the provisions of the Act to specified companies. Of these four subjects only two are mentioned in the title. Thus the Act is unconstitutional as against both prohibitions of the Constitution, in that it contains a multiplicity of subjects, and does not express its objects clearly in its title: West Pliila. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Union R. R. Co., 9 Pliila., 495; Dorsey’s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 192; Allegheny Co. Home’s Appeal, 27 P. F. S., 8G.

Even if, as contended, there are subjects in the Act not mentioned in the title those which do not there appear can be stricken out and the Act as it then stands will be constitutional: Cooley on Cons. Limitations, 178; Dewhnrst <em>v. </em>City of Allegheny, 14 Norris, 442; Dorsey’s Appeal, 22 P. F.

The abandonment also complied with the requirements of the Act. A stockholder is a person who holds stock. “ Two thirds of the stockholders” are therefore the holders of two thirds of the stock. Out of the 89,148 shares of capital stock the Pennsylvania Railroad Company held 69,500. No stockholder of the canal company has ever objected to the abandonment, and they may all therefore be considered as consenting to it, since they have acquiesced for nearly ten years. No one else has any standing to object.</p>

By the Act of April 21st, 1858 (P. L. 414), it was expressly provided that the canal must be kept open and in good repair as a public highway forever. But under the resolution the defendants, while abandoning the part of the canal in question, as a canal, retain their property rights and privileges, and use the same for their own private purposes. Under this resolution they have maintained the dams at Lock Haven and Queens Run and backed the water in the river for their own use, free from any obligation to the public, and they could even now take tolls if they saw fit. This certainly was not a legal abandonment.</p>

    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.6",73,[104,631,1180,217]]]'>This contention arises from the abandonment by the defendant of a portion of its line of canal, under this Act.

    <p id="b73-7" data-blocks='[["BL_73.7",73,[101,849,1182,952]]]'>1. The subject of such abandonment is clearly and specifically expressed in the title. The body of the Act, <em>inter alia, </em>declares “ any such company may, and is hereby authorized to abandon for public use such portions of their roads or lines of improvement as may be deemed by such board unnecessary to be kept open for public use. <em>Provided, </em>however, at least two thirds of the stockholders of such company approve and consent to the same.” The subject and the several parts thereof, specified in the Act, are germane to the subject expressed in the title. The title is not deceptive or misleading. The subject is not disguised nor concealed thereby. It is therefore sufficient: Dewhurst <em>v. </em>City of Allegheny, 14 Norris, 442. As it gives such notice of the subject of the bill as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body thereof, that is all which is required: Allegheny County Home’s Appeal, 27 P. F. S., 80. It is true the latter part of the bill somewhat restricts its general operation, but this in no manner affects the right of the defendant to abandon the portion of its canal in question. The power of the legislature to authorize this abandonment with the consent and approval of the company which owned it, is very clear. We cannot review the wisdom of the Act. This legislation is therefore valid.</p>
    <p id="b73-8" data-blocks='[["BL_73.8",73,[100,1803,1179,606]]]'>2. Was the action of the canal company in abandoning a portion of its canal, in substantial accordance with the provisions of the statute? It does not declare that two thirds <em>in number </em>of the stockholders must consent thereto. We think the approval and consent of any number of stockholders who own two thirds of the whole stock of the company is within the meaning and spirit of the Act. If, however, a sufficient number of the stockholders did not affirmatively consent to the abandonment at first, a subsequent approval or consent made valid the action of the others. The stockholders are the only persons who can object to an unwarranted exercise of authority. If they remain silent, after a lapse of time, they will be presumed to have ratified the Act: Eppricht <em>v. </em>Nickerson, 4 Amer. &amp; Eng. Cor. Cases, 388.</p>

At a meeting of the directors held on the 4th of August, 1874, it was announced that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which owned and held more than two thirds of the capital stock of the company had, bjr writing filed in the office thereof, assented to such abandonment. Thereupon the president was instructed to declare the same abandoned, which he accordingly did.</p>

The railroad company unquestionably approved and consented to the abandonment. More than ten years have since elapsed^ yet no stockholder has ever questioned the regularity of the proceedings or the validity of the abandonment. It may safely be presumed that all of them are well satisfied with the action of the directors, and that they have approved and consented thereto.</p>

If, however, in fact, they should be held to be unnecessarily extensive, such excess will merely be inoperative. It will not make nugatory the action of the company as to that portion of the canal which it actually abandoned.</p>
