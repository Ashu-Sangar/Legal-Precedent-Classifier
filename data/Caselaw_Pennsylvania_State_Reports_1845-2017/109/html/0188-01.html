A. reduced the terms of these requests to writing, naming himself as trustee, subscribed his name thereto, read it to his mother, and asked her if it was right, to which she answered, “ Yes.” After Ms mother’s death A. gave to B. the memorandum which he had made of his mother’s requests, and paid to her during her life the income on the sum stipulated.

She replied: “Very well.” She then said : “I wish you would divide my chain between Helen (defendant’s daughter), and Kate (one of the plaintiffs), and give one half to each, and the watch to Kate.” He answered: “No, mother, I will not do so. I want Helen, as your grandchild, to have the watch and chain. I will buy a watch and chain for Kate.” To which she replied: “Very well.” The defendant then made a memorandum, of the result or conclusion of the conversation, which he signed and submitted to his mother, and asked her if it was right, and she said “ Yes.” The memorandum was as follows :</p>

The defendant soon afterwards related to Dr. Differ Luther (the grandfather of the plaintiffs, with whom they lived), the conversation which had taken place between his (the defendant’s) mother and himself, and delivered to Dr. Luther or to his wife, Mrs. Amelia II. Luther, the memorandum he had made of it at the time.

This view was also strongly urged by the learned counsel for the defendant, who argued, that the love of the mother was so intense that she wanted the beneficiaries to feel that they were enjojdng, not her bounty, but the bounty of her son ; but I cannot find in the evidence of the conversation, nor in the surrounding circumstances or conditions, an}*- warrant for such an inference or conclusion. On the contrar3r, the conclusion is irresistible that the subject of the conversation was the disposition of the estate of Mrs. Brooke, and not of the prospective bounty of her son, and that it was so understood at the time by both parties. This is clearly indicated, on the one part, by the consciousness of Mrs. Brooke of impending death, and of the consequent release of her grasp upon her worldly goods, which were about to pass (she forbearing to act) by operation of law under the control of her son, to whom the wish was expressed; by the specific directions given in immediate connection with the $2,000, concerning the disposition of her watch and chain, and by her acquiescence in his proposal that he should hold the money in trust until the plaintiffs became of age. And, on the other part, by the promise of the defendant to his mother that he would carry out her wish; by his suggestions of detail as to the manner and method in which it should be done ; by his reduction of the result or understanding arrived at in the conversation to writing, and the submission of it to his mother for her approval, thus acknowledging her as a party; by his declaration to Kate (one of the plaintiffs), on the very day of the death that his mother had “ remembered her; ” by his delivery of the memorandum into the custody of the beneficiaries as evidence of his mother’s wishes charged <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>upon him ; and by his partial performance in the purchase and delivery of the watch and chain, and the payment of interest on the sum of $2,000 for two years.”</p>

In this case Mrs. Brooke meant the bounty to proceed from her son. It was not a case in which she intended to make provision out of her own estate for the appellees. In order to establish a trust of the nature claimed in this case there must be clearly proved actual, persona] fraud of the party to be charged : Wallgrave <em>v. </em>Tebbs, 2 K. &amp; J., 318; <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>Russell <em>v. </em>Jackson, 10 Hare, 204 ; Dowd. <em>v. </em>Tucker, <a href="/conn/41/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="41 Conn. 197" data-case-ids="745411" data-case-paths="/conn/41/0197-01">41 Conn., 197</a> ; Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2036" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Watts 36">9 Watts, 36</a>.</p>

The mere fact that he inherited his mother’s estate is not a con ■ sideration unless he secured that inheritance by his promise. His conduct shows the utmost frankness and candor. There was clearly no trust created by Mrs. Brooke. A trust arises where property has been conferred upon one person and accepted by him for the benefit of another. An excellent definition, approved by Perry, is : “A trust is in the nature of a disposition by which the proprietor transfers to another the property of the subject intrusted, not that it should remain with him, but that it should be applied to certain uses for the behoof of a third party.” But Mrs. Brooke made no transfer of any property; she designated no fund out of which the $2,000 should be paid. A day after the conversation with her son she died, and the intestate laws of the Commonwealth cast upon him the whole estate absolutely; he took nothing by any act or deed of his mother, and in no legal sense was she the settlor of any trust. The promise made by the appellee to his mother was without consideration. It was <em>nudum </em>pactum, and cannot be enforced: Long’s Appeal, 5 Norris, 196.</p>
