In 1842, A., the owner of meadow land through which a creek passed, built a low dam, dug a ditch therefrom across which he put a gate, and used the water to irrigate Ms meadows. This use, under a claim of right, continued for nearly 40 years. In 1881, B., the owner of mills located lower down on the creek, filed a bill to restrain such use of the water. It also appeared that for many years after the dam was built there was enough water in the creek both for irrigation and for the mills, so that no injury accrued to the latter by A.’s use of it, but the volume of water in the creek gradually diminished so that when the bill was filed the use of it made by A. was a serious damage to B. iu the dry season, although the dam was no higher, the ditches no larger, and the amount of water used by A. no greater, than when the dam was first built r</p>

Reeder, Esq., the Master, were as follows : About the year 1842, the predecessors in title of the defendants built a low dam across the East Bush-kill creek which flowed through their land, and cut a ditch therefrom by which the waters of said creek were let into their meadows for the purposes of irrigation. A gate was placed across the ditch to regulate the quantity of water allowed to flow into the meadows. This use of the water was made under a claim of right and continued for about forty years, the quantity of water used being regulated by the need therefor as determined by the meadow owners, and the gate being closed at times for several months in the year. Prior to the year 1862, this use of the water did little if any injury to the complainants. The Master reported as facts that the dam, at the time of beginning this proceeding, was no higher, the ditches no larger, and the quantity of water used no greater than when the dam was constructed, but that three acres less of meadow were irrigated in this manner at present than originally; also that while the quantity of water thus presently used was less than formerly, yet this use had not decreased proportionately with the diminution in the quantity of water in the stream.</p>

They further claimed that owing to the diminished quantity of water in the creeks, the use made by the defendants of the water of the East Bushkill creek consumed the entire supply therefrom during the dry season of the year ; and that in 1877 they notified the meadow owners to cease the injury.</p>

The defendants, however, claim a right bv prescription because the dam and ditches are said to have existed since 1842. But as shown by the above authorities, the right to irrigate, so long as it is without substantial or material diminution of the stream, is a proper use of the water, and cannot create an easement however long used : Washburn on Easements, *235 and *240. The Master has found that prior to 1862, the taking of water by the defendants did no injury to the plaintiffs; and in 1877 the defendants were duly notified to discontinue their use. “ Prescription does not begin till the act by which it is claimed has begun to work some injury to the right of the other party, of which be might be cognizant”: Washburn on Easements, *p. 90 ; McCallum <em>v. </em>Germantown Water Co., 4 P. F. S., 58. As has been said, the use of the water for purposes of irrigation did the complainants no damage prior to 1862, but since that time the volume of water has been gradually growing less in the creeks until now it is only about one half as great as formerly, and the use of it made by defendants exhausts the entire supply from the East Bushkill in the dry season. In 1877, less than twenty-one years after the injury really began, defendants were duly notified.</p>

The defendant’s right by prescription to the use now made of the water, is also clear. The dam and ditches were made in 1842, and exist now just as they did then. It is well settled that such a continued, uninterrupted and exclusive enjoyment as has been shown in this case, affords a conclusive prescriptive right: Strickier <em>v. </em>Todd, 10 S. &amp; R., 69 ; Darlington v.

The Master, after finding that the dam and ditches were erected, as they exist now, in 1842, decides that because the defendants failed to prove that the talcing of the water by the dam and ditches caused no injury to complainants, and did not cause a material diminution of the stream, their right is incomplete. We claim, however, that under the authorities such proof was not necessary: Washburn on Easements and Servitudes, pp. 90, 100; Angelí on WaterCourses, § 219c; Brace «.

They are, that about forty years before this bill was filed, the predecessors in title of the appellees built a low dam across the stream, and cut a sluice or ditch therefrom by which the waters were led into their meadows adjoining. A gate was put at the entrance of the ditch by which the quantity allowed to flow could be checked or shut off when desired; this use of the waters under a claim of right, has continued for about forty years, whenever the owners of the meadows thought they needed watering. It did not flow constantly over the meadows, as there were times when for several months, they did not need the water, yet during that portion of each and every year, when the growth of the grass would be promoted by irrigation the water was so used. Such use of the water was continuous and uninterrupted except when they did not want it, and closed the gates. He further found that the dam is no higher, the ditches no larger, nor the quantity of water diverted any greater than when the dam was originally constructed. On the contrary that three acres less of meadow land are now irrigated than while it was in possession of the former owners; that a number of ditches through which the water formerly flowed for irrigating purposes are now abandoned and closed; that the water now taken from the creek is less than was formerly taken, but it has not decreased proportionately with the diminution of water in the creek.</p>

The injury results from the gradual diminution of the volumé of water flowing in the stream, which has been tlie ease for several years. While the dam which diverts the water remains no higher, and the ditches which led the water from the stream, and returned it thereto, are unchanged, and the appellees use less water than formerly, yet the appellants claim in consequence of the diminished flow of water in the stream, the effect of the diversion, at first harmless, has now become injurious, and therefore the use of the water should be enjoined against. In support of this view the general rule as declared in Washb. on Easements, § 49 is invoked that tlie time from which the period is to be reckoned in computing the duration of a continuous enjoyment is when the injury or invasion of right begins, and not the time when the party causing it began that which finally creates the injury.</p>
