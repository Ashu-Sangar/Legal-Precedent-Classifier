On April 21st, 1880, under written articles of agreement, A. bought a tract of land from B., with the right to immediate possession. B. reserved the sawing timber in case A. should fail to manufacture it as provided by the agreement. A. agreed to manufacture a specified, quantity per annum, the price to be applied on the purchase money and the timber to vest in A. upon payment of the price in the manner set out. A. took possession and proceeded with his contract, carrying out <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>the terms thereof. While so doing, October 7th, 1880, he agreed in writing to sell to C. “ all the sawing timber,” with the right in C. to enter and take the same as soon as peeled by A., for which C. agreed to pay, in cash and monthly instalments, as specified in the contract. C. also agreed upon non-performance <em>of </em>the terms of the contract A. should have the right “ to resume possession of the premises and treat C. as a tenant holding over after the expiration of a lease.” Under this contract C. took possession of the timber already cut by A. and performed his part of the contract until August 1881, when he failed, and his execution creditors levied on said timber. C. thereafter ceased to perform his part of the contract with A. and the latter got judgment against him, notified him that the agreement was at an end and took possession of the premises. B. notified the sheriff that he claimed the timber levied on, and an interpleader suit in which A. <em>&amp; </em>B. were plaintiffs and C.’s execution creditors defendants, resulted in judgment for the latter. D., who had knowledge of the claims against said timber, purchased the same at private sale from C., bought the claims of C.’s execution creditors, and then brought replevin against A. for the timber cut by him and delivered to C. under the contract between them: <em>Held,</em>

The fact is not disputed that in August, 1881, Jordan abandoned the mill and all business connected with the property mentioned in the Seeley and Jordan contract, and the evidence all shows that he has treated the contract as at an end since August, 1881.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.9",325,[80,894,1179,559]]]'>The abandonment of the contract by Jordan was a forfeiture. His leaving the premises and not offering to comply with the contract by paying the monthly payments was an abandonment of the contract, and if Seeley took possession after Jordan had left, and Seeley was the vendor of Jordan as is claimed by the plaintiff in this case, then Jordan could not i’ecover in any form of action until he had complied or offered-to perform his covenants and agreements. Garey can rise no higher than Jordan. Jordan was to make monthly payments to Seeley. We say that each monthly failure to comply with the contract was a ground of forfeiture, and if Seeley had no right to forfeit the contract in August, he certainly had the right to do so for a subsequent breach in September, 1881.</p>

It did not determine the rights of any subsequent execution creditors, nor did it determine any rights that the plaintiff in that issue acquired after the levy in August, 1881. Jordan was not a party to that issue: Bain <em>v. </em>Lyle, 18 P. ,F. S., 60. The only issue tried in an Interpleader suit is the question between the execution creditor and claimant.</p>

Garey, the plaintiff below, stands no higher than Jordan. In fact, he took the assign<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>ment of the Jordan contract more than one year after he had full notice that Smulls did not sell the timber to Seeley, and that Seeley only had the right to manufacture the timber on the lot; that it was not till after it was manufactured that he had the opportunity of purchasing it, then not till he had paid 0.75 per thousand for the timber actually manufactured into lumber.

It was purchased from Jordan by a judgment creditor, to secure his debt, without any notice of Smull’s claim. .It is impossible to question the legality of such a transaction. If anything could make this view of the case stronger, it consists in the fact that O. A. Seeley after receiving in payment upon his contract with Thos. J. Jordan, about thirteen hundred dollars, took advantage of the clause in his contract which permitted him on failure of any payment to elect to have the whole purchase money become due, and entered judgment for the whole amount remaining unpaid. Upon that judgment he issued execution, and that judgment has ever since that time been held over Jordan, ready to take any property of his that could anywhere be found. To compel a .man to pay for property, or what is equivalent thereto, to hold a judgment against him for it, and then deny his ownership of that property is so grossly against equity that no court can entertain such a proposition for a moment. And again, O. A. Seeley having sold this property to Thos. J. Jordan now turns around and pleads, that when he sold the same he was not the owner, and it seems to us, that from these facts he is certainly estopped from raising such a plea. When W. G. Garey undertook to get possession of the property he had <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>honestly purchased he found it in possession of this same O. A. Seeley. He brings replevin against O. A. Seeley. O. A. Seeley pleads “property in F. T. Page, H. S. Dunham and N. K. Woodward.” And in justification of his plea claims that lie had no right to sell the property to T. J. Jordan, being bound by his previous contract with Smull Bros, not to sell it.</p>

    <p id="b327-8" data-blocks='[["BL_327.10",327,[72,929,1168,514]]]'>On April 21st, 1880, by articles of agreement with Smull Brothers, Seeley purchased a tract of land with right to take possession immediately. The vendors reserved all the “sawing timber” in case the vendee should fail to manufacture the same on said land as provided by the agreement. Seeley agreed to manufacture at least fifteen hundred thousand per year, to pay seventy-five cents per thousand, to be applied on tliepurehase money of the land, and upon such payment then the title to said lumber to vest in him with right to remove it from the premises. Also he was bound to peel and deliver hemlock bark to the vendors, in each year, a portion of its value to be credited on said purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b327-9" data-blocks='[["BL_327.11",327,[68,1443,1171,991]],["BL_328.1",328,[302,416,1178,378]]]'>Seeley took possession of the land, built a saw-mill, cut a part of the hemlock trees and peeled the bark, and began the manufacture of lumber. On October 7th, 1880, he agreed to sell to Jordan “all tlie sawing timber” on said land, with right to enter “to get said timber as fast and when the same has been peeled,” and not to take any timber from any part of the land “ only where the hemlock has been peeled,” for which Jordan agreed to pay 87,000; Seeley reserved the hemlock and birch bark and obligated himself to peel about two thousand eords of bark per year. It was agreed that for certain non-performance by Jordan the agreement should become void at the option of Seeley, and then he eould “ resume possession of the mill and premises and have the rights to treat Jordan as tenant holding over after the expiration of a lease.” This agreement contains no provision that upon the contract becoming void Jordan shall lose his right to the timber already cut; nor is bo prohibited from removing the timber already cut, at any timo before or after the contract may be declared void. The logs and lumber in controversy are part of the timber which was cut and peeled by Seeley before the making of the contract, and possession of said timber was delivered to Jordan who held it until taken in execution by the sheriff. At- the making of the contract Jordan paid 8600 on. the pur<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>chase money, and made the next six payménts of $ 100 each on the stipulated dates. He carried on the manufacture of lumber until August, 1881, when he failed. Soon after, Seeley gave notice to Jordan that because of his non-performance, his rights under the contract had ceased and the contract had become void. Thereupon Seeley took possession of the realty and Jordan went out — apparently there was no dispute respecting the right of the one to enter and the duty of the other to leave.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[298,803,1180,900]]]'>Prior to said notice, by virtue of divers executions, the sheriff had levied on the personal property of Jordan, and Smull Brothers notified the sheriff that they claimed the timber, logs and mill. On petition of the sheriff a rule was granted on the claimants to appear and maintain or relinquish their claim to the property levied upon; afterwards an issue was ordered and Page, grantee of the Smulls, and Seeley were permitted to join as plaintiffs in the issue. The claimants gave bond to the sheriff and thereby acquired a right of possession to the personal property levied upon, until the issue should be determined. When that issue was tried and judgment entered against him, such right instantly ceased. Then the sheriff could take and sell the propertjq if so required by the plaintiff in the execution. If the writ was stajmd, or levy abandoned, the real owner of the property had right of possession. Had the sheriff demanded the property for sale by virtue of his writ, in case of non-delivery the claimants would have been liable for its value. Upon abandonment of the levy, the false claim that had been set up against the execution-plaintiff would not be a defence against the owner in an action for recovery of his property.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.6",328,[291,1702,1181,730]],["BL_329.1",329,[124,414,1169,390]]]'>The issue in the interpleader was between the claimants of the property and the plaintiffs in the executions, and its determination settled that the claimants had no title that would prevent the execution-plaintiff from seizing and selling the property in satisfaction of their judgments against Jordan. But Jordan was not a party in the issue, and against him the plaintiffs might have had a valid title. Frequently a debtor may have good title to personal property as respects the right of his creditor to seize the same in execution, but no title as against a person with whom he has a contract respecting such property. For instance, a sale and delivery of personal property, with an agreement that the ownership shall remain in the vendor until the purchase money is paid, enables creditors of the vendee to seize and sell the same in payment of their debts ; but the contract may be valid between the parties, and in default of payment by the vendee as he agreed he shall have no right of property or possession against the vendor. Hence, it is nec<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>essaryto ascertain if Jordan had title as against the claimants, for Garey purchased tho lumber at private sale from Jordan, after fuli knowledge of the alleged title of Smull Brothers and their grantee. Garey did not purchase at a judicial sale ; nor did he purchase from Jordan without knowledge of'the adverse claim. If Jordan was the absolute owner of the property he liad a right to sell it, and the purchaser by discharging the lien of the levy on Pomeroy’s execution, had right to immediate possession.</p>
    <p id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[118,801,1174,859]]]'>The sale of'the timber in controversy by Seeley to Jordan was absolute, and in no event was Jordan’s title to be abrogated. Jordan purchased without knowledge of the agreement between Smull Brothers and Seeley. This timber was personalty in the possession of Seeley who had been and was at the time of the sale by him to Jordan, manufacturing and disposing of it as his own. It was not the duty of Jordan to inquire of Smull Brothers if Seeley had title. Upon the uncontroverted facts, proved by both Seeley and Jordan, in connection with the written contract, the court rightly instructed the jury that “The delivery of the possession of the said sawing timber already cut down and peeled by Seeley in accordance with the terms of the contract, conveyed to Jordan the absolute ownership of the timber which was then down and so delivered by Seeley to him.” Nor was there any question of the fact that Garey had acquired Jordan’s title to the timber, and an assignment of Pomeroy’s judgment, before he issued the writs, in replevin. Having become the owner of that judgment and also of tho property levied upon, there was no occasion for a judicial sale — he had right to recover the property or its value.</p>
    <p id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[117,1661,1171,462]]]'>Conceding that the testimony referred to in the first and second specifications of error was improperly received for the purposes for which it was offered, its admission did no hurt <em>to </em>the defendant. So far as concerns this case it is immaterial whether Seeley made an election of remedy under his contract with Jordan, for the timber <em>in </em>controversy was vested in Jordan. And although the record in the issue may not have determined whether Jordan owned the property as against the, plaintiffs <em>in that </em>issue, the ease was finally put on tho true ground, namely, the sale and delivery of the timber to Jordan vested in him absolute title.</p>
    <p id="b329-8" data-blocks='[["BL_329.8",329,[114,2134,1170,299]],["BL_330.1",330,[252,411,1182,79]]]'>The sixth assignment is not sustained. As the ease stood it was no matter whether Seeley gave notice of forfeiture to Jordan, or whether he ordered his writ to be returned before the giving of such notice. Therefore, we express no opinion upon the ruling that parol testimony that Seeley ordered the sheriff to return the execution before the 13th day of September, 1881, was inadmissible on the ground that it contradicted <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>the record' which set forth nothing that the sheriff did, except as follows : I return this writ.</p>
    <p id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.6",330,[252,499,1183,87]]]'>We deem it unnecessary to specialty note any of the other specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b330-7" data-blocks='[["BL_330.7",330,[1068,585,366,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
