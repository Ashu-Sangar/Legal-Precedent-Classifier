Whether the court below on this account meant to treat it as an action in assumpsit, does not appear •from the charge, except inferentially, but it was so intimated to counsel at the trial. We submit that it was an unwarrantable assumption on the part of the court below to treat it as an action in assumpsit or to regard it as anything but an action in debt. Although the case did not originate in the court below, and the plaintiff had filed no formal narr., yet, the transcript, when filed, became the plaintiff’s narr., as is provided for in section 3, of rule 24, of the court below, which is as follows, to wit: “ In all cases of appeals from judgments of justices of the peace, the transcript, when filed, shall be considered the declaration of the plaintiff, unless the defendant, or his attorney, shall before plea pleaded, enter a rule upon the plaintiff to file a special narr., or statement. This rule, however, shall not be so construed as to authorize on the trial of any case, the reading to the jury of any more of such transcript than may be required to show the cause of action.” A reference to the transcript discloses the form of action to be debt. The claim of the plaintiff below as therein set forth is “ seventy-five dollars, being the value of a blacksmith shop and tools sold by J. L. Brensinger, assignor, to the defendant, 'after having executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, to George W. Kershner, the plaintiff.”</p>

In other words, the rule simply applies to the illegal detention of chattels. The case at bar is so entirely different from all the cases cited by the counsel for plaintiff in error, that they can have no force in this argument. Kershner had the legal title to the goods sold by Brensinger. Although the act of Brensinger was unauthorized, yet Kerslmer could either affirm or disaffirm the contract. By bringing suit he affirmed the act of Brensinger, and ratified his agency. A subsequent ratification is equivalent to an original authority. We have already shown from the evidence that Brensinger received nothing from Weiler. He is therefore, clearly liable to Kershner, the assignee. This element of a contract is wanting in every case cited by the plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.8",240,[266,629,1185,727]]]'>It is undoubtedly true that in case of the mere detention of a chattel a plaintiff cannot waive the tort and sue in assumpsit or in debt. Without something more than mere detention there is no contract either expressed or implied : Bethlehem Borough <em>v. </em>Perseverance Fire Co. 31 P. F. S., 445; Boyer <em>v. </em>Bullard, 6 Out., 555. It follows that if the plaintiff below had in the Common Pleas declared either in assumpsit or in debt, the evidence might not have sustained the action. In this case no narr. was there filed. Due effect must therefore be given to the 4th section of the Act of 1810, which provides on appeal from a justice of the peace to the common pleas, the cause shall be decided in such court on its facts and merits only, and that no mistake in the form or name of the action shall prejudice either party. This case was tried on its merits. The fact that the court did not put the case on the true grounds, does not prevent our doing so now.</p>
