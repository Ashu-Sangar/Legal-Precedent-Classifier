L. 533), requiring the treasurer of the proper city or county to account to the Auditor-General for the fees of the mercantile appraiser, makes this a duty owing to the Commonwealth. Therefore, when, in pursuance of law, a city treasurer has given two official bonds, one to the city, conditioned that he “shall well and faithfully execute the duties of the said office according to law, and shall pay over the moneys received by him as directed by the proper authorities,” and the other to the Commonwealth, conditioned “ for the faithful discharge of all duties enjoined upon him by law in behalf of athe Commonwealth, and for the payment according to law of all moneys received by him for the use of the Commonwealth,” on default of payment by him of the appraiser’s fees received by him, the sureties on the bond given to the city are not liable, the breach having been solely under the bond given to the Commonwealth.</p>

Q. Carman the amount of appraiser’s fees claimed by him. If this bond covers this part of the treasurer’s duties then they are liable; if it does not, then they are not liable. At the first blush the language of this bond would seem broad enough to cover the liability, for its condition is that “he shall well and faithfully execute the duties of the said office according to law, and 'shall pay over the moneys received by him as directed by the proper authorities,” etc. Also the city charter of the city of Scranton, Act April 28d, 1866 (P. L., 1040), section 11 provided for “ sureties for the faithful performance of their trusts ” on the part of the city treasurer. But we must bear in mind that this bond is given by the city treasurer as such — an official bond in his character as city treasurer solely. It is also true that the duties imposed upon him in regard to the appraisement and collection of mercantile taxes are in no sense a part of his duties as treasurer of the city of Scranton. The city of Scranton is no party to these duties, and is not concerned with regard to them. It is true that the laws of the Commonwealth have placed these duties upon the city treasurer, but they are duties which he is to perform with reference to the state and not to the city.. For these duties he is required to give an additional bond to the Commonwealth, and it is this fact which leads us to the conclusion that for these fees of the mercantile appraiser this bond to the city cannot be held. Under the Acts of Assembly, as we read them, the city treasurer was compelled to give bond to the Commonwealth to secure all moneys collected under the mer<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>cantile appraisement laws. Wo think this fact is settled by the Act of 15th April, 1828 (P. L. 491), and the Act of 7th April, 1830, section 7 (P. L. 390).</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.6",159,[81,538,1181,1080]]]'>“ The Act of 1828 provides ‘ that it shall be the duty of all the city and county treasurers thereafter,’.....‘to give bonds to the Commonwealth conditioned for the payment according to law of all moneys that shall be received by them for the use of the Commonwealth, and for the faithful discharge of all duties enjoined upon them by existing or future laws in which the Commonwealth is concerned: ’(P. D. 1827-28, P. L. 491, section 1.) And the law which made county treasurers’ bonds given to commissioners a security for moneys of the Commonwealth was repealed by the third section. Now if there were any doubt whether these duties of the treasurer in relation to the mercantile appraisement are duties ‘ enjoined upon him by existing or future laws in which the Commonwealth is concerned,’ that doubt is settled by the Act of 1830, section 10. This Act relates to the mercantile appraisement especially, and is one of the laws now in force. It provides ‘ that the aforesaid city and county treasurers previous to entering upon the duties enjoined upon them by this Act shall enter into bonds conditioned for the faithful performance of their trust to the Commonwealth according to the provisions of the Act of 15th April, 1828, relative to treasurers’ bonds,’ etc. It was part of the duties of the treasurer to receive the fee then due the constable for each name correctly returned and pay it out of the funds created by the Act.

The Act of April 22d, 1846, extending this provision to the other counties in the state, directs that an account of the mileage being verified by the affidavit of the appraiser, it shall be paid by the treasurer of the county out of any state taxes in his hands, thus leaving the fees as they were before — to be paid by the county treasurer as such to the appraiser.</p>

The matter of collecting fees was therefore not touched upon. The collection and payment of these fees is no part of the treasurer’s duty to the state but to the city, and the bondsmen on his bond to the former cannot be liable, as he was responsible thereby only for “ moneys received by him for the use of the Commonwealth: ” Act of March 30th, 1867, section 7, P.

P&gt;y the 33d and 34th sections of the Act of 15th April, 1834, Purd., 306, pi. 8 and 9, county treasurers are required to give two bonds, one to the county conditioned for a just account of all moneys that may come into their hands on behalf of the county, and the other for the faithful discharge of all duties enjoined upon them by law on behalf of the Commonwealth, and for the payment of all moneys received by them for the use of the Commonwealth. In the present case, the city treasurer received the fees due the appraiser, as well as the license fee from the persons appraised, and the question is whether his obligation to pay the appraiser's fees over,arises under the bond given to the city, or under the bond given to the Commonwealth. That depends upon whether the duty to make such payment is a duty to the Commonwealth or to the city. By the 8th section of the Act of 16th April, 1845: Bright. Purd., 1458, pi. 14, the appraisers are required to fur<a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>nish to the treasurer of the proper city or county a certified list of the dealers, and the treasurer is required, within twenty days thereafter, to transmit to the Auditor General a copy of such list; and he is also required to “receive and collect, together with the fees of the appraiser, and his own fee, the sums to be paid by such dealers for their licenses in the manner directed by law.”</p>

This is made still more clear by the seventh section of the Act of 7th April, 1830, Purd., 1458, pi. 15, which provides that “it shall be the duty of the Auditor General to charge the treasurers of the said cities or counties with the amount payable by the several persons mentioned in said lists.” The 12th section of the Act of 22d April, 1846, extended the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th sections of the Act of 16th April, 1845, which was originally confined to the counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny, to all the remaining counties of the Commonwealth, and fixed the compensation of appraisers at thirty-seven and a half cents for each certificate of license issued, and three cents for each mile travelled. It also directed an account of the mileage to be made out and verified by affidavit, and that upon approval by the treasurer, the same should be paid by the treasurer out of any state taxes in his hands. There is perhaps some doubt owing to the peculiar phraseology of the latter part of the section, whether the treasurer was to pay the appraiser’s fees as well as "his mileage out of state taxes in his hands, but it is not very material to settle the doubt, because the 1st section of the Act of 13th March, 1847, Purd., 1458, pi. 17, repeals so much of any law as requires payment from county treasurers of the costs of collecting mercantile taxes, and directs that they shall be paid out of the state treasury on the warrants of the Auditor. General. If the expression, “ costs of collecting,” includes the appraiser’s fees, then, of course, the Commonwealth is interested in their payment, aud if not, the law is left as it was before, in which event also the Commonwealth is interested, as we have seen. The 8th section of the Act of 15th April, 1850, Purd., 1458, pi. 18, directed that the mileage of appraisers should be paid by the state treasurer on the warrant of the Auditor General, and repealed so much of the 12th section of the Act of 22d April, 1846, as authorized county treasurers to pay it. It is not easy to see why this Act was passed, if the Act of 13th March, 1847, was limited to mileage, as in that event the Act of 1850 would be a mere repetition of the Act of 1847. But however that may be, and conceding that the Act of April 22d, 1846, § 12, is not clear in <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>directing bow the appraiser’s fees shall be paid, we think it plain that the 7th section of the Act of April 7th, 1880, in connection with the 8th section of the Act of 16th April, 1845, makes the collection, adjustment and payment of the appraiser's fees a'Commonwealth matter. It is true this legislation does not direct the fees to be paid out of the state treasury, nor indeed does it, or any other legislation to which we are referred, direct them to be paid out of any treasury, but it does direct that the treasurer shall collect the appraiser’s fees, with the license fees, and shall transmit to the Auditor General a certified list of all dealers subject to the tax, and that the Auditor General shall charge the treasurers with the amounts payable by the persons mentioned in the lists. The duty of collecting the appraiser’s fees therefore is as much a Commonwealth duty as the duty of collecting the tax itself, and when collected the whole account is to be settled with the Auditor General, who is a state and not a county officer. Of course the appraiser’s fees belong to the appraiser, but the duty of paj-ing them is a duty enjoined by law in behalf of the Commonwealth, and this brings it within the very terms of the conditions of the bond required to be given by treasurers, both of cities and counties, to the Commonwealth. Whether these fees must be paid by the county or city treasurer to the state treasurer, and by him to the appraiser, or whether they may be paid directly by the city or county treasurer to the appraiser, it is not material in this case to decide, as there was no payment whatever of the amount now claimed, and there was an undoubted breach of condition in that respect. But as we are of opinion that the bond in suit was not the one whose condition was broken, there can be no recovery in this action.</p>
