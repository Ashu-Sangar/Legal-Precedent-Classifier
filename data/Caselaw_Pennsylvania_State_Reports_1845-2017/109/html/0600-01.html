But the taxes levied are not only for the municipal purposes of the city of Wilkes-Barre but also for county purposes, and so far as the latter are concerned the assessors are merely city, not county officers. They simply determine the value of the land located within their wards. As, however, they cannot assess land situated without the ward boundaries, it would follow, if the court below is correct, that the state and county cannot derive any revenue from these lands. The Master bases his report upon the Acts of March 14th, 1761, 1 Smith L., 231 ; March 9th, 1771, 1 Id., 324 ; and March 31st, 1785, 2 Id., 811, declaring the Susquehanna to be a navigable river.

As to this no change was intended in the common law, and therefore the rule “ <em>usque ad filum aquce </em>” should prevail. None of the Pennsylvania cases on riparian boundaries involve the question of municipal jurisdiction except Johns <em>v. </em>Davidson, 4 Harris, 512, which would lead to anomalous results. It would be impossible, for example, to serve a summons on a defendant while navigating a river between two counties if the sheriff of neither county had jurisdiction : Pratt <em>v. </em>State, <a href="/conn/5/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Conn. 388" data-case-ids="12131441" data-case-paths="/conn/5/0388-01">5 Conn., 388</a>; Adams <em>v. </em>Pease, 2 <a href="/conn/5/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Conn. 388" data-case-ids="12131441" data-case-paths="/conn/5/0388-01">Id., 481</a>.</p>

Unless this proposition is established the appellants have no case, since if this commonwealth in declaring the great fresh water non-tidal rivers of the state to be navigable abolished the English rule which confined the definition of navigable streams to those in which the tide ebbed and flowed, then the principles of the English law relative to tidal streams applied to navigable streams as established in this state, and among these principles that which stopped both municipal and private rights bounded by such streams at the high-water mark.</p>

One reason given for so declaring the law was said in Carson <em>v. </em>Blazer, <a href="/binn/2/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Binn. 475" data-case-ids="1788962" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0475-01">2 Binn., 475</a>, to be tbe fact that in England the streams in which the tide does not ebb and flow are small, while in this state they are large. The law thus announced in 2 Binn. has been approved and affirmed in Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Nav. Co., 14 S. &amp;. R., 71; Johns <em>v. </em>Davidson, 4 Harris, 512; Barclay Railroad and Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Ingham, 12 Casey, 194; Zimmerman <em>v. </em>Union Cana.

In like manner the townships situate on tbe opposite side of the river were bounded by the river. The land covered by water situate between the two boundaries was not so granted as to be within any of the municipalities named. The coal underlying the same has since been granted by tbe commonwealth, but it has not been attached to the city of Wilkes-Barre, nor have the boundaries of the city been extended so as to bring it within the limits thereof. Whether this body of coal ought to be subject to taxation, or whether the legislature may not at any time declare it shall be, and provide by what authority it shall be taxed, are questions not before us now.
