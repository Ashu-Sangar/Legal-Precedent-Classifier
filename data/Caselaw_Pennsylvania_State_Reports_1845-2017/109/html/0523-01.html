I am not disposed to deny that the corporation in question had such a power, although in view of the fact that proceedings were in progress for its dissolution, I regard it as a very serious question, whether it could have taken a large part of its assets to purchase an immunity for the exclusive benefit of a portion of its policy-holders. However that may be, as I understand the law, a contract of re-insurance made by an insurance company to cover risks which it has assumed, will <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>never be treated as a contract for the sole benefit of the holders of the policies creating such risks, except when the provisions of the contract itself are of such a character as show clearly and expressly that it was made for their benefit and not for the advantage of the company, or unless, possibly, it can be made to appear that for some proper consideration moving from the assured to the company effecting the reinsurance, it was agreed between them that such re-insurance should be for their exclusive benefit. It is urged upon me that it is evident from the whole transaction that the Penn Company expected to go out of business, and that it was endeavoring to protect its policy-holders by the contract which it made with the French Company. Doubtless tins is true to a large degree, and perhaps to the entire extent claimed, but I am unable to see how this <em>general purpose </em>which appears from attendant circumstances, principally, can be made to operate as a contract or as the creation of a trust. In my judgment, before such a result would be reached as is contended, the particular purpose must appear, affirmatively and definitely, in the very terms of the contract of re-insurance. As I read and understand the agreement between the two companies, it only related to obligations and rights of the corporations, and did not undertake to regard the rights of policy-holders, except through their relation to the re-insured company......It cannot be successfully maintained, in my opinion, that the contract in question either provided, or intended to provide, that the French corporations should issue a policy to the holders of policies in the Penn Company, severally or as a class, or that the former should pay to the policy-holders of the latter the amounts of their losses directly, and not as the agents of the latter. The French Company undertook to re-insure “its” (the Penn’s) “outstanding risks;" that is, as I understand it, to re-insure or indemnify it — the <em>Penn Company </em>— against losses occurring under its policies.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b545-8" data-blocks='[["BL_545.6",545,[130,1864,1165,468]]]'>The fact that <em>the </em>books and papers of the <em>Penn </em>Company were placed in the custody, of the other corporation is undoubtedly consistent witli an undertaking on tbe part of the latter directly, and only for the benefit of the holders of policies of the former, if such a contract liad been made, but it does not tend to prove that it was made. On the other hand, such custody was a proper tiling for the French corporation to require, inasmuch as it only became bound for the amount of losses which could be enforced as claims under the policies, and it was natural that it should ask to have the material at band to test each case as it might arise.</p>

There is in such case, however, no privity between the original insured and the re-insurer ; the latter is in no respect liable to the former, as a surety or otherwise, the contract of insurance and of re-insurance being totally distinct and disconnected. But whilst the contract is one of indemnity simply, in which the insurer is to be protected to the extent of his loss, when ‘the loss is incurred and ascertained, the re-insurer must pay the amount. The insurer may at once, without payment to the original assured, resort to his action: Fame Ins.

Cas., 844); and, if the insurance was in their interest, directly for their benefit, and free from any additional burden or obligation on their part, ratification might be presumed. But we fail to find anything in the words of the contract, in the special circumstances attending its creation, in the nature of the transaction itself, or in any rule of public policy, that would justify us in saying that the contract was any other than a contract of re-insurance, in the proper sense of that term. The contract was written by and between persons on both sides, actually engaged in the business of insurance, persons conversant doubtless with the meaning of terms employed in the practice of insurance, and the presumption is a fair and reasonable one, that words of technical or special import were by them properly applied. The words “re-insure” and “re-insurance” would therefore seem in the first instance at least to characterize the contract and to point out the object and purpose of the parties. The proper signification of these terms would, of course, vary with the clearly manifested intention of the parties. But the contract is with the Penn Company, for a consideration moving from it providing for a policy to the Penn Company, to re-insure its risks. There is no provision whatever, expressed in the contract, for the individual indemnity of the policy-holders nor ■for the insurance of their property for them ; the re-insurance is expressly upon the “ outstanding risks ” of the company. The contract of re-insurance, in some sense perhaps operates upon the property itself rather than the risk, but the fact that ■the policy was to be -upon the “ risks,” indicates that it was .the company’s insurable interest in the property, which formed the basis of the insurance.</p>

It is true, also, that the reinsurance was of all the outstanding risks of the company, and <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>not as is usually the case, of any particular part of them ; but whether a compare shall re-insure tlie whole or only a part of its risks, is a question of policy for the company, dependent upon its purposes for the future, or its circumstances. If the underwriter wishes to change his business, or to quit the country, or to avert insolvency, he may choose to re-insure the whole ; under different circumstances he may choose to indemnify himself as to part only. The provisions that the Penn Company “will turn over to the Caisse Générale its original registers, hooks, reports, and other papers, in any way relating to the policies thereby insured,” and, “that the Caisse Générale will assume the care and expense of tlie adjustment of all losses which may occur under the policies of the said Penn Fire Insurance Company, which are thereby to be re-insured,” are consistent, wo think, with either theory of the case — as consistent with one as with the other; and they, therefore, prove nothing either way. Such a course of proceeding may be rare, but cases are rare perhaps when the re-insurance is upon the whole list of the underwriters’ risks, and where this is the case there can certainly be nothing unreasonable in the provision. We think there is nothing on the face of the contract itself, to give it the effect claimed for it, and we can discover nothing in the facts which led up to its execution, which would evidence any intention of the parties different 1'rom what is plainly expressed.</p>
    <p id="b549-6" data-blocks='[["BL_549.6",549,[119,1512,1185,899]]]'>The inducing cause of the contract, doubtless, was the proceeding instituted by tlie Attorney General, at tlie instance of the Insurance Commissioner. After the order to suspend business, the company was permitted to effect a re-insurance of its outstanding policies, &amp;c., for sixty days, with the hope that its available funds would prove sufficient to complete the re-insurance, at the expiration of that time. Had these hopes been realized, it is probable that the decree of dissolution, during the period of re-insurance at least might not have been entered. The commissioner, in his report refers, it is true, to this contract as an effort of the company to “ secure its policy-liolders by re-insurance,” but if the contract were, in fact, otherwise, the report of the commissioner, subsequently made, could not change its provisions, or alter its effect. The Caisse Générale, &amp;c., in paying certain of the losses directly to the policy-holders, would seem, subsequently to have put a construction on the contract, conformable to the appellants’ claim; but the effect of this is certainly overcome by the fact that the Penn Company repudiated this payment by bringing suit against the Caisse Générale &amp;c., and tlie fund now for distribution is the result of that action.</p>

Co., supra, is greatly relied on by the appellants, but that case is materially different from this. By a contract duty executed, the Hope agreed to re-insure the Craftsman Company, on all risks for which its policies were outstanding; and, also, to assume all such policies, and to pay the holders thereof all such sums as the Craftsman might, by force of such policies, become liable to pay. The engagement to the policy-holders was direct and express, and the liability was therefore direct and exclusive. This case was followed by Eischer <em>v. </em>Hope Mut. Ins. Co., supra, which was another action on the same contract, and the rulings in the former case were in the latter recognized and approved.</p>
