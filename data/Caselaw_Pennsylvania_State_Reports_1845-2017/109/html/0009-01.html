The City Council of Meadvilie passed a,n ordinance and resolution authorizing the laying of certain sewer pipes in sewer district fío. 1, but did not comply with the provisions of the above Acts; the pipes were actually laid, however, in the autumn of 1881. In March, 1882, the City Council passed another ordinance for the completion of the sewer system in district fío. 1, and this time complied with the requirements of said Acts. In pursuance of the latter ordinance a system of sewers was laid, of which the pipes laid in 1881 formed a part. An ordinance was then passed assessing the cost of the sewers on the abutting lots; and the property owners along the part laid in 1881 filed a bill for a perpetual injunction against the collection of the assessments, as to their lots:</p>

No appeal is given under the Act of 1874, and none therefore exists. ..... Certiorari is only available where the illegality of the assessment appears upon the face of the proceedings, and where no extrinsic evidence is necessary to show the invalidity of the proceedings : Ewing <em>v. </em>City of St. Louis, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wall.%2C%20418" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Wall., 418">5 Wall., 418</a> ; Heywood <em>v. </em>City of Buffalo, 4 Kern an, 534.
