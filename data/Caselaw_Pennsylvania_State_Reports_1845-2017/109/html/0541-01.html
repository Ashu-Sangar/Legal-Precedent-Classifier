Objection overruled and evidence admitted. Exception. (First assignment of error.) The defence thereupon admitted the identity of the prisoner with the James. Kane mentioned in the above indictment. From the evidence it appeared that James Kane kept a tavern at Eighth and South street, in the city of Philadelphia, which was frequented by thieves and where the deceased, Andrew Kane, a brother of the prisoner, spent most of4iis time, although he did not live there. The brothers had had two slight quarrels within a fortnight of the killing. On the evening of January 11th, 1885, the brothers came into the bar-room together and James was heard to remark emphatically “ I told you, no.” A few moments later Andrew Kane attempted to go up stairs when he was met by his brother and some conversation passed between them which was not heard, but two pistol shots were heard in quick succession and Anderw Kane staggered back into the room and afterwards fell to the floor. Later, he was taken to the Pennsylvania Hospital, where he died early the next morning from the effects of the wound. John McCloskey, a witness for the Commonwealth, testified as follows: — “I Avas standing at the bar, not looking in that direction at the time, but as I heard the report of the first shot I looked around and just then I saw the flash and heard the report of the second shot. I sarv James Kane fire the second shot. He was about two feet away from Andy when the last shot was fired. I saw the pistol in his hand.” At the time of the shooting, both men were somewhat under the influence of liquor, although it Avas testified that James Kane “ could talk intelligently and knew what he Avas doing.”</p>

The joinder of the two counts of murder and manslaughter in the indictment was not the subject of successful objection, hence exception to it in the court below would have been to no purpose. Ordinarily such joinder is useless, as the jury may convict of manslaughter on the count for murder, but where the object is to include a second offence under the 182d section of the Act of March, 1860, there may-well be a count for the minor offence. So,the complaint that the record of the previous coimction was set forth in the indictment, and offered in evidence on the trial, has nothing in it, for in this manner alone can the provisions of the statute be carried into effect: Rauch <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 28 P. F. S., 494. It is true, the exhibition, in this manner, of the defendant’s previous crime may have a very bad effect upon his character, but this result must be charged to his own default, and to the statute which looks" rather to the protection of the law-abiding community than to the welfare of the criminal <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>class. Nor need we say that it was entirely proper for the defendant, through his counsel, to admit his identity as defendant in the former indictment. He was under no kind of constraint, and by this he improved rather than impaired his case. As well might it be said that a defendant ought not to bo called upon to admit his identity on arraignment; that he might not admit any fact during trial, or that he might not confess himself guilty of the whole charge laid against him in the indictment, by a plea to that effect. To make such admission and confession is the right of the defendant, and of it he cannot he deprived. Whether he will exercise a priviledge of this kind is not for the court, but for himself and his counsel to determine.</p>

    <p id="b563-7" data-blocks='[["BL_563.7",563,[127,1265,1184,520]]]'>The testimony thus offered cannot be regarded as part of the <em>res </em>gestee, for these declarations were made neither at the lime nor place of the shooting, but some hours after, in the hospital. As therefore, they could not be regarded as part of the immediate transaction, to qualify them as admissible declarations, they must have been made under circumstances of such solemnity as to be equivalent to a judicial oath; that is, the declarant must have been impressed by a knowledge of his approaching death. But of this there was no proof offered. It was not made to appear, by Kane’s declarations or otherwise, that he had any sense of impending dissolution, and without such proof the proposed evidence was properly rejected.</p>
