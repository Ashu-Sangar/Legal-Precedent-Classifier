The Act of February 24th, 1834, sec. 48, Br. Turd. (ed. of 1885), p. 554, pi. 227, providing for such abatement “ unless it shall be otherwise provided by the will ” is declaratory of the common law rule.</p>

What then is the meaning of the clause (separated only by a comma from the clause providing for payment of incumbrances) “it being my intention that each bequest shall be fully carried out in the order in which it appears in this my will as the funds derived from my estate may permit.” It will be observed that the beneficiaries in the three sets of trusts bear the same relationship to the testator. It will also be observed that the word “ bequeathed ” is used in speaking of the property given to the brother, and that the testator would naturally, therefore, refer to the gifts to both his sister and brother as “bequests.” The provision for his sister is to be “ fully carried out,” even if the gift to the brother, “ in whole or in part,” should be required for the purpose ; but if the funds derived from the general estate will permit, <em>“each </em>bequest” shall be “fully carried out in the order in which they appear in the will,” the “bequest” to the brother being defeated only to the extent that an insufficiency of the funds derived from <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>the general estate may require sales of portions of it and thus prevent the gift from being <em>“fully </em>carried out.”</p>

It is perhaps at least as likely that he did intend, notwithstanding the connection in which it is expressed, to create preferences among the general legatees of whom, as yet, he had not spoken.

The presumption in favor of equality among legatees is founded on so strong an equity that it will prevail unless, upon a fair construction of the will, an intention to give priority is clearly manifest. “The onus lies on the party seeking priority to make out that such priority was intended by the testator, and the proof must be clear and conclusive.”.....“Where the expressions are ambiguous and do not mark with certainty the testator’s intention, no priority can be allowed: ” Williams ■on Executors, 1472; Towle <em>v. </em>Swasey, <a href="/mass/106/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="106 Mass. 100" data-case-ids="715949" data-case-paths="/mass/106/0100-01">106 Mass., 100</a>; Appeal of University of Pennsylvania, 1 Out., 187.</p>

(1) Does the disputed provision in the will direct a preference? and (2) Is this provision applicable to each bequest of the will or only to those which preceded it? As to the first the eourt below held that a preference was indicated and it is clear that the direction in the wfill was made in contemplation of a possible deficiency (a) from the antecedent devise of 914 Walnut St., to Phoebe L. Wain and the accompanying direction to pay the incumbrances on it out of the general estate. This could not be paid out of the real estate specifically devised until all else was exhausted and then as a <em>debt. </em>(5) From the specific devise following the above, of Wain Grove, to William Wain. Had the general estate proved insufficient, the direction in favor of Phoebe L. Wain as a <em>testamentary direction </em>could not have been enforced against Wain Grove without a special provision. Therefore the testator made this devise subject to a power of sale in his executors, because he feared the insufficiency of his general estate, (e) Immediately after providing for a possible deficit by thus clearly directing <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>as between Pboebe and William a preference as well as a priority he expressed his will concerning all his’bequests. The provision for one brought within his contemplation all his legatees, and he directed that each bequest should “be fully carried out in the order in which it appears in this my last will.” A direction to “ carry out ” may be only equivalent to “ pay,” but a direction fully to carry out in a certain order implies more. (d) The decisions which give no preference because of a mere provision for priority in the order of payment rest upon the absence of anything to show that the testator contemplated a deficit: Murdoch’s Appeal, 7 Casey, 51; Beeston <em>v. </em>Booth, 4 Maddock, 161; 2 Williams on Executors, 1471.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.6",503,[132,954,1186,986]]]'>(2) The provision is applicable to each bequest in the will; because the testator evidently intended a preference. The only question is what legatees are to be preferred ; and the objection arising from the general presumption of intended equality cannot arise, (a) The direction is that <em>each bequest </em>is to be fully carried out in the order in which it appears, not that each <em>previous </em>bequest shall be so carried out. It was unnecessary to make such direction as to the bequest to Phoebe because the power of sale of the property to William covered her case and effectually provided against any deficiency so far as she was concerned. But the contemplation of the contingency induced him to insert there his general intention as to all his bequests. (6) The bequest covered by the direction was those payable out “of the funds derived from the estate.” But the previous devise and bequest were not to be thus carried out; but by a sale of a part of it only, viz., Walu Grove, and the testator directs a sale of the farm to meet the general legacies, (c) Moreover if the provision refers simply to the previous bequest it becomes absurd, because inapplicable to William’s share. If Wain Grove should be called on for contribution to Phoebe, the devise would not be fully carried out. If it should not be called upon, there would <em>be </em>no necessity for saying anything about it.</p>

Wain, he devised his house and lot, No. 914 Walnut street, with the furniture, &amp;c., except his books and paintings, otherwise specifically disposed of; directing, that all incumbrances thereon should, as soon as practicable, be discharged, “ so that,” as the testator himself says, “ my sister may hold the said estate in fee simple, free from all incumbrances, and free from any claim for interest, or taxes.”</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.12",504,[253,1677,1181,432]]]'>3. To his brother William Wain, he gave Wain Grove, his country seat, with the adjoining grounds, comprising about fifteen acres, in the twenty-third ward, with the personal property therein, &amp;c.; “provided nevertheless, that the property bequeathed shall be subject to sale in whole or in part, as the case may require, to enable the executors to carry out fully the. previous provisions of this will, it being my intention that each bequest shall be fully carried out, in the order in which it appears in this my last will and testament, as the funds derived from my estate may permit.”</p>

After directing the sale of the remainder of his real estate in the Twenty-third ward, within two years after his death, he gives pecuniary legacies as follows: — $200 to each of his two colored servants, “ in consideration of their faithful services; ” $10,000 in trust for his niece Susan Israel, for life, &amp;c.; $10,000 in trust for his two nieces, Phoebe and Mary, in equal shares, for life, &amp;c.; $12,000 in trust for his two nieces, Rebecca and Julia, and a nephew, Francis, for life, in equal <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>shares, &amp;c.; $2000 to the son of his niece Mary; $2000 to the son of an old friend. The residue of his estate, real and personal, is given to his brother, the devisee of the country seat.</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.6",505,[180,568,1179,513]]]'>The specific provisions in favor of liis sister Plioebe L. Wain and his brother William Wain, are unimpaired, and these, with the bequest of his books and paintings, have been “ fully carried out ” ; but to pay the general legacies, amounting in the aggregate to $88.400, there remains in the hands of the executor only $16,000. In view of this deficiency of assets the Pennsylvania Company &amp;e., trustee for Susan Israel, contends, that this fund should be applied to each of the several pecuniary legacies, “in the order in which it appears,” in the will, and claims priority in right, over the legacies which are written in the will, after the legacy of Susan Israel. »</p>
    <p id="b505-7" data-blocks='[["BL_505.7",505,[173,1089,1189,1215]]]'>In the distribution of a testator’s estate, the well known general rule of the common law is, that, in case the assets, after payment of debts, are insufficient to answer the specific but not the general legacies, the latter are subject to a proportional abatement; but if by the will the intent of the testator, clearly manifested, is to give one or more general,, legatees a priority to others, that intention will be carried into effect: Williams on Executors, 1467-71. The 48th section of our statute, of 24th February, 1834? Purd. Dig., 448 pi. 212, is, therefore, declaratory merely of the rule previously recognized. No such preference, however, can be presumed; <em>it </em>must clearly appear, either by the express words, or from fair construction of the will. It is founded in an apprehension of an actual deficiency of assets, not of any anticipated delay, in bringing them to distributable form; therefore, a distinction must, in each case, be made between what may be intended as a priority in payment merely, and wliat may import a priority in right. We think however, to whichever portion of the will they may be found to refer, there can be no doubt, that the words of the proviso are sufficient to indicate, that a preference in right was intended. We cannot mistake the meaning of the testator, when he says, that it is his intention “ that each bequest shall be fully carried out, in the order in which it appears,” in the will, as the funds of his estate nmy permit. It is quite clear, we think, that this was written, when the testator had in his mind the possibility of a deficiency of assets, and that his purpose was not merely to provide an order of payment.</p>
    <p id="b505-8" data-blocks='[["BL_505.8",505,[170,2304,1176,174]],["BL_506.1",506,[248,423,1192,2036]],["BL_507.1",507,[110,418,1182,524]]]'>But the question which remains to be decided is, to what this preference applies. Was it intended to apply in the immediate connection in which it is expressed, only, or was it also intended to affect the relative rights of the general lega<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>tees, of whom as yet the testator liad not spoken? The opinion of the learned court below is so full and clear upon the point indicated, that any further discussion or elaboration of it must necessarily involve a useless repetition. We will, therefore, refer but briefly to the considerations which, in our view, show the conclusions of the learned court to be correct. It is certainly clear that the first clause relates exclusively to the. antecedent portions of the will; that is its plain and precise expression — “ the property bequeathed shall be subject to sale, in whole or in part, as the case may require, to enable the executors to carry out fully the previous provisions of the will.” But it is contended, that the second clause is more general in expression, and was intended to apply to the provisions of the will throughout. It will be observed that the two clauses constitute but a single sentence; their grammatical construction seems to show that they were so intended. No mere punctuation could give to the second clause the form of an independent sentence; it is parenthetic, and is connected in sense with what immediately precedes it. The first clause, it is admitted, gave a preference to Phoebe L. Wain, oover her brother, William Wain, and the second, undoubted!]', gave them both a preference over all others; each clause, therefore, evidences a distinct purpose of the testator’s mind, and their force would in no degree be impaired, if the general legacies had, in fact, not been created. A bequest, it is true, is properly of personal estate, but the testator having spoken of the gift to his brother as the “ property bequeathed ” to him, we may believe, if the contexts favors it, that “ each bequest ” refers to the gifts previously made although consisting, in part, of realty; and especially so, as these were a't the moment, the subject of his particular consideration. The testator does not say that “ all the bequests ” are to be fully carried out in their order; his language is, “ each bequest ” and as, in the same sentence, he had particular reference to the two previous provisions it is fair to infer that these were intended. This view of the ease is greatly strengthened by the fact, that no motive is discovered for the preference of one of the legatees over the others; all stood in equal degree of kinship to the testator, and no fact or circumstance appears to explain his purpose, in the preference, alleged. We may however, readily assign the motive which would move the mind of a brother to exercise such a preference for the protection of a single sister. Whilst a preference in right is in all cases founded on an apprehension of a deficiency of assets, it is not established thereby, it must be expressed in the will. Equality is the highest equit]q and, in a distribution to legatees, will be enforced unless, as directed by the <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>Act of 1834, “it shall be otherwise provided bv the will.” The burden is upon the appellants; if the will gives them a preference over others, they must point out the place where it may be found. The presumption is against it, and tliat presumption cannot be repelled by any ambiguous expression; the intent to the contrary must be clear. Nor will tbe testator’s design, in any event to uphold the specific gift to bis sister, dispense with the measure and quality of proof required, or sliow an intent to extend that preference to the general legatees in their order; unless the priority alleged clearly appear, they will be let in on equal terms : University’s Appeal, 1 Out., 187.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[115,941,1179,346]]]'>We agree with the learned court below, that the reasonable construction of this will shows the testator’s purpose, that the provision for his sister should first be “ fully carried out,” even if tbe gift to his brother, “in full or in part,” be required for the purpose; but if the funds of the estate permit, that each of said “bequests” should be “fully carried out, in tbe order in which they appear in the will, and.that this was the only preference which the testator intended.</p>
