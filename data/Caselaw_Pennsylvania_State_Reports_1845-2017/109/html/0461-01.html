NYI of Constitution § 2, Buekalew, page 244. The Act of April 17th, 1876, P. L., 33, amendatory of the general corporation Act of April 29th, 1874, P. L., 84, simply provides a means whereby the benefit of the latter Act might be obtained, i. e. by accepting the new Constitution and that Act. The case in which a corporation does not desire to accept the Act of 1874 but simply to accept the new Constitution, is provided for solely by the Act of 1878. Even if a meeting of the stockholders had been called to consider this question, it would be determined by a vote of the stockholders as individuals, for the charter provides for a stock vote only in case of the election of directors, and without an express statute on the subject the stockholders vote as individuals: Morawetz on Private Corporations, § 360 <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>Field on Corporations, § 226; St. Mary’s Church, 7 S. &amp; R., 517; Tavlor <em>v. </em>Griswold, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20N.J.L.%20227" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="14 N.J.L. 227">14 N.

As was said in Hayes <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Norris, 518, “This was part of the contract under which they entered into the company and paid their money. The compact was that they should have the power to select those who should have <em>the </em>management and control of the” corporate funds and property’. For reasons given at length in that case, and which need not be now repeated, the authority thus conferred on the stockholders is a vested right, with which the Constitution of 1874 has not intended to interfere, except in the manner therein provided. But, on behalf of appellees, <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>it is contended that the provisions of the new constitution were duly accepted by the board of directors and thus became substantially a part of the charter ; and, if there should be any doubt, as to the authority of the board to do what they did, their action in the premises was subsequent^ approved by a majority of the stockholders present at the last annual meeting in June, 1884. In view of the duties and powers of the directors, as specified in the charter, we have no hesitation in saying it was not within the scope of their authority to accept the provisions of the present constitution relating to the subject of cumulative voting. They had no power express or implied to surrender, as they undertook to do, the vested rights of their constituents. Their action was not only without authority, but it was manifestly designed to deprive the majority in interest, of the stockholders, of a right guaranteed to them by their charter. Directors clothed, as they were, merely with the ordinary powers of executive management are powerless to effect a radical change in the chartered rights of stockholders, contrary to the wishes and against the objection of a majority in interest. But, aside from all this, the Act of 1878, under which it is claimed the board of directors acted, was never intended to apply to such corporations as the Academy of Music. In very terms it is restricted to private corporations applying to the state for aid, and hence it embraces only charitable corporations which have no stockholders with vested property rights. The Act of 1876 had previously prescribed a mode of proceeding by which corporations for profit and having capital stock may adopt the system of cumulative voting. The acceptance required <em>po </em>be filed in the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, must not only be under the corporate seal, but it must also appear that the Act was duly authorized by a meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose. It is only by complying with this provision of the Act of 1876 that a regular and valid acceptance, of the cumulative sj'stem of voting, by the Academy of Music can be accomplished. If at a meeting duly called for that purpose, a majority, not in number but in interest of the stockholders present thereat in person or by proxy, authorizes such acceptance, then and not till then can the holders of the major part of the capital stock be stripped of their vested right to elect a full board of directors all of their own selection. A stock vote on the question of acceptance may undoubtedly be waived, but if demanded by stockholders they are entitled to it.</p>
