The plaintiff, a market gardener, in 1881 purchased some seeds of the defendant known as “ Wakefield Cabbage” soeds, which produced an excellent crop of cabbages. In the following year the plaintiff desired to obtain some more oí this seed; went accordingly to the defendant’s store and asked him if he had “ any more of Wakefield cabbage seed, same as in 1881.” The defendant replied that he had some oí the old stock, and produced some seed in envelopes which were laid upon the shop counter. It was shown that it was impossible to distinguish Wakefield cabbage seed by its appearance. The plaintiff purchased a quantity of the seed and planted it, but it did not produce Wakefield cabbages. Some of the plants were cabbages like the Wakefield, others resembled drum, and others cauliflower, worth little or nothing. In an action on the ease to recover damages thus occasioned:</p>

He said he had eight or ten pounds <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>of the old seed of 1881. I asked him if it was the old seed. He said it was. He said the new crop had not been harvested jet; he had no new seed in. .... . He said it was all right. <em>We </em>called it Wakefield cabbage seed. I purchased eight pounds and a half altogether; paid five dollars, a pound; used a pound and a half for myself; sowed it September 12th, 1882. Wintered the plants all winter. They should have matured by June, 1883 ; they did not so mature ; they matured about latter part of July and in August. The product was not Wakefield cabbage; there were all varieties in it; some you couldn’t call cabbage at all. I had about two acres. There were say five heads out of a hundred resembling Wakefipld, but didn’t call it Wakefield; it did not grow as the Wakefield should grow ; did not produce Wakefield cabbage. Balance of crop was drum in appearance; didn’t call it drum-head — something resembling a collard, a species of cabbage ; something resembling a cauliflower. Balance very wild ; couldn’t tell what it was. The small lot like Wakefield he sold, but not at Wakefield prices. The drum came into a cheap market. The rest was worthless......I lost about $500.” <em>Cross-examined </em>— “ Have dealt with Baxter eight or ten years ; I always bought the seed in papers [paper shown witness] ; it was in paper like that. I didn’t see that on the back of it .... . He opened the drawer and said he had got some of that old stock of Wakefield cabbage seed, same as I got in 1881. He got it out on the counter. ..... I kept my seed till I sowed it; it looked like cabbage seed.” Re-examined— “Cannot judge as to cabbage from seed itself; we can tell resemblance when we go to transfer to boxes. When we replanted, the plants were four or five inches high. There was nothing in their appearance then by which I could tell positively that they were Wakefield. About three weeks after we planted them in the spring I found cabbage did not look right; found mixtures amongst them ; at times found it growing wild. There was nothing before this to put me on guard that it was not Wakefield. ..... Baxter did not call my attention to what was printed on envelopes. He did not at any time mention to me the name of Bolgiano or B. &amp; C. He •never told me he was acting for B. &amp; C.”</p>
