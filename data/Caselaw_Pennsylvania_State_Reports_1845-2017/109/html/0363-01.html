The Gas Trust is au agency established by the city of Philadelphia as a means of supplying the citizens with gas, and the money which the defendant received and failed to account for, was collected under an ordinance of the city of Philadelphia for the purpose of paying a city loan, and, in so doing, free the property of the city which had been pledged for the debt. It was therefore, money of tbe city, received and to be applied on her behalf, and the defendant was none the less the servant of the city because he acted in a subordinate capacity, and was not appointed directly by her. If, as has been said, the trustees of the GasWorks cannot be removed by Councils, save for cause shown and after trial, this, before the new constitution, was equally true of the beads of tbe water and highway departments and is still applicable to the Board of Health and the clerks and officers whom they appoint. Nor, so far as I can discern, does it materially vary the case that the sums due for gas are collected by tbe trustees and disbursed by them, instead of being paid into the city Treasury and appropriated by councils. Were a like rule established in the administration of the water department by law, or as a result of a contract with third persons, the chief <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>engineer and his subordinates would still be municipal officers and liable for the embezzlement of the money which it is their duty to apply to public use. The inquiry might, it would seem, stop here, but as the subject is one of some importance, I will proceed to examine it more in detail.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-5" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[275,640,1210,1816]],["BL_385.1",385,[109,403,1180,1555]]]'>As Judge Thayer, observed in Strawbridge <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Phila.%20173" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Phila. 173">13 Phila., 173</a>, the Act of April 2nd, 1790, “ gave the city full power to ordain and establish whatever laws might be convenient or necessary for the purpose of lighting the city: ” and we need not inquire whether the ordinance of March 21st, 1835, was in all respects a legitimate exercise of that power, because there can be no doubt of the legality of the result. For when the city took possession of the Gas Works under the privilege originally reserved, the anomalous joint stock company which the ordinance had sanctioned was dissolved, and the Gas Works became as much a purely municipal agency as if they had been established on that basis in the first instance. True, the ordinance of January 14th, 1841, by which the change was effected, declared that the Gas Works should remain under the care and superintendence of the trustees then existing, until otherwise provided for; but this clause implied rather than negatived the right of councils to control the Gas Works equally with the other branches of the city government. On the 17th of June, of the same year, however, councils passed another ordinance, which in some respects materially varied the case, while leaving it in others unchanged. By that ordinance a loan of $125,000 was authorized for the purpose of extending the works, the money to be borrowed in such sums as might be required by the trustees, and the rate of interest fixed by them; and the faith of the city, and the buildings, apparatus, pipes, income and profits of the Gas Works-were pledged for the punctual payment of the interest, and for the ultimate reimbursement of the principal of “ all loans made for or on account of the said GasWorks as the same should become due.” For the further security of the said loan holders, it was also “ stipulated that the works shall be controlled and managed by a board of trustees, elected and - constituted as heretofore, who shall have the whole control and management of the said works, and of the said sinking fund, and of all the other funds belonging to the said works and the said trustees shall pay no part of said fund, nor any part of the profit of said works into the city treasury, but shall apply and appropriate the same as is directed by this ordinance, until the interest and principal of the said loans shall be fully paid as they become due to the said loan holders.” There can be no doubt that the effect of this ordinance was to place the city of Philadelphia, as it regarded the control and manage<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ment of the Gas Works and the land on which they stood, in the position of a private corporation relatively to the loan holders, and so far as was requisite for the security of the loan. The transaction operated as a mortgage of a branch or department of the city government which, from its nature was susceptible of being so pledged, and the city was bound in law and morals to take no step that would render the security loss available. The judgment of the Supreme Court, in the noted case of Western Saving Fund <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 7 Casey, 175,185. decides thus much, but it decides no more. What it establishes is that, like other mortgagors, the city of Philadelphia ceased to be an owner so far as was requisite for the security of the loan holders, and not that it did not continue to be an owner for other purposes, or as it regarded the rest of the world. The Supreme Court did not say, nor was the question before it for consideration, that the Gas Trust was not a public trust, or that the city of Philadelphia acted as a private corporation in providing the citizens with gas, but simply that the loan holders were entitled to require that the public faith should be kept with them, precisely as if private faith had been pledged by a corporation constituted for merely private ends. Hence, as the ordinance of June 17th stipulated that the Gas Works should be controlled and managed by a board of trustees, elected and controlled as heretofore, the number of trustees could not be altered, nor could they bo required to pay the proceeds which had been specifically pledged, into the city treasury for general purposes. But the trust was not on that account less a trust for the payment of a public debt, confided to persons designated by the city, and bound to render her the account which every fiduciary owes to the parties who are interested in the faithful performance of his charge. So the land, buildings and apparatus of the Gas Works, and tin? right to employ them for the purpose of lighting the city and supplying the citizens with gas, and the profits resulting therefrom, were and are the property of the city, subject only to the repayment of the loan.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[110,1961,1178,430]]]'>It seems to me, therefore, that the Gas Trust is as much a public agency established for municipal purposes, as it regards the city of Philadelphia and the community at large, as though it were not mortgaged to the loan holders, and bound by stipulations which must be observed until the debt is paid; and I find nothing in the ordinances to which I have referred, or the interpretation put on them by the Supreme Court contrary to the opinion already intimated, that the defendant acted as a servant or'agent of a municipal corporation, and might properly be convicted under the Act of June 12th, 1878.</p>

Such a criterion would singularly limit the number of public servants, if applied at common law where offices were incorporeal hereditaments, and the occupant could not be removed, save for some sufficient cause, and an opportunity to be heard in his own defense: Field <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 8 Casey, 478. The question is not who appoints the officer, or by whom he may be dismissed, but are his duties private or such as concern the public weal. Were the charge of supplying the city with water vested in the Mayor, as was recently suggested, and engineers appointed by and responsible to him, and were he further authorized to defray their salaries and all other necessary expenses out of the water rents, the water department would be less dependent on councils than is the Gas Trust, and yet no one would contend that it was not a branch of the city government, or within the scope of a law passed to keep municipal officers in the path of duty.</p>

    <p id="b389-9" data-blocks='[["BL_389.9",389,[140,1311,1178,129]]]'>The learned judge very properly refused to charge as requested, and submitted the case to the jury with proper instructions as to the law applicable thereto.</p>
    <p id="b389-10" data-blocks='[["BL_389.10",389,[139,1441,1193,992]],["BL_390.1",390,[248,415,1190,778]]]'>The main ground of defence was that the prosecution was barred by the general statute limiting the time within which misdemeanors (with a few exceptions) may be prosecuted, to two years; but if the indictment is properly framed under the ' section of the Act above quoted, and is supported by competent testimony, there is nothing in that ground of defence, because the 6tfi section of the Act declares that indictments for misdemeanors committed by either of the persons named in the first section “may be commenced and prosecuted at any time within four years from the time the alleged offence was committed.” The controlling question therefore is whether the defendant was a clerk, receiving clerk, employé or agent of a municipal or <em>quasi </em>municipal corporation, as charged in the indictment? The solution of this question depends on the relation existing between the city of Philadelphia and the trustees of the Gas Works. If the Gas Works constitute one of the agencies or departments of the city, similar to the Water, Health or Fire Departments of the city government, it follows that persons employed by the trustees, in tlie discharge of their duties, are employes of the city in the same sense and to same extent as persons employed by the Commissioner of Highways or the Chief Engineer of the Water Works. The fact that the trustees, to whose immediate management <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>the Gas Works are entrusted, have special duties to perform in the interest and for the protection of those who advanced money to establish the works, does not make the Gas Works any the less an agency or department of the city. A municipal corporation is an agency established, directly or indirectly, by the State for the better administration of certain local affairs of a district, town or city; and whenever such an agency exists, it is justly termed municipal, whether its functions be lodged in a single hand or confided to various departments or bodies acting independently or as an organic whole. But it is not our purpose to further discuss the questions raised by the assignments of error in this case. They have been so fully and ably considered by the learned president of the court below in his opinion overruling the motion for a new trial, that nothing we could say would add to the force of his argument or the correctness of his conclusions. For reasons suggested and fully presented in that opinion, the several assignments of error are not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[509,1191,921,88]]]'>Judgment affirmed and record remitted to the court below for the purpose of execution.</p>
