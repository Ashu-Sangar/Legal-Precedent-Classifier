On the face of the record the court ■expresses its doubts as to whether Joseph H. Gery were alive or dead, and the .question is expressly left an open one. Nor did the appointment of a trustee <em>durante absentia </em>adjudicate the question. It was improvidently made, the petition setting forth facts from which the legal presumption that Joseph H. Gery was dead inevitably arose. But even if the trustee thus improvidently clothed with power by the court had under color of law legally obtained the fund, the fund having been in point of actual fact wrongfully obtained, the trustee can and ought to have been ordered by the court to turn over the fund to the rightful owners. The Act of April 11th, 1879 (P. L. 21), under which the court improvidently appointed the trustee, does not give title to property. The proceeding is an ex parte one, but the simple affidavit does not preclude the rightful owner from asserting and proving title. The trustee simply becomes the custodian of the fund, and under the latter part of section 1 of the Act, “ shall be under the control and direction of the court.” He is the creature of the court, and can and ought to be controlled by the court, when, under the power of the court, he takes into his hands the money of another, and can be directed and compelled to surrender. In assuming, therefore, that the question of the ownership of the <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>fund for distribution had been formerly adjudicated, the court below erred.

The fund, therefore, being in the hands of the trustee as the estate of Joseph H. Gery, was properly distributed as such estate by the Auditor, and to adopt the theory of the appellants would be to ask the Orphans’ Court of Berks county to review the action of the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery county in a matter wherein the latter court had jurisdiction. The decree of the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery county directing the payment of the fund unto the trustee is final and conclusive as to the Orphans’ Court of Berks county, and to hold that the appellants can set aside this decree in the present proceedings would be authorizing a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction to open, revise, or correct the decree of another court of similar jurisdiction. The estate of Joseph T. Gery, as claimed by the appellants, cannot be distributed in Berks county, nor has the Orphans’ Court jurisdiction over that fund. It obtained the money of a living person, it holds it as such, and must distribute it as the estate of the person for whom it was received. The appellants do not claim the fund in question as heirs of Joseph H. Gery, and, therefore, claiming adversely to the trust fund, have no status, and are in no position to interfere with the distribution made by the court: McBride’s Appeal. 22 F. F.

Whether or not he has an estate may, as in this case, depend upon the date of <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>liis death. He may therefore be fairly supposed to have an estate when he has none, to be alive when he is dead, or dead when, in fact, he is alive. The proceeding is therefore wholly under the control and direction of the court, and the final disposition of the trust estate must, of necessity, depend upon the development of the truth as to the cause of the absence.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[263,683,1178,862]]]'>It is true, that at the time of the appointment of the trustee, in this case, the period which limits the presumption of life had already expired, but no adjudication, as to Joseph H. Grery’s death, could be had in this form of proceeding, and the trustee entered upon his trust and held the trust property subject to the control and direction of the court, for such uses as to right and justice might belong, when the truth was known and had been established. The purpose of the provision is to prevent spoil and destruction of the estate, during the absence of the supposed owner, or until his death is shown. It follows, therefore, that the trust is but a temporary and provisional one, and that the fund is not necessarily the estate of the absentee. In a distribution of moneys in the hands of an executor or administrator, the fund, from whatever source derived, is necessarily part of the decedent’s estate, and participation in it is limited to those who claim through the decedent, either as creditors, legatees, or next of kin: McBride’s Appeal, 22 P. F. S., 481. In this case, however, the trustee is rather in the nature of a stakeholder, and the distribution is to those who in justice and equity are entitled.</p>

The opinion, filed in the court below, contains a statement of the several sums received by the trustee, out of the realty and personalty of Joseph T. Gery, deceased, the whole amounting to $6,240.85 ; referring to that sum the learned judge says : “ This amount was decreed by the Orphans’ Court of Montgomery county to Jesse Gery, trustee of the said Joseph H. Gery, and was the amount coming to the said Joseph H. Gery out of his father’s estate.” The record exhibits no legal adjudication or decree to that effect; on the contrary, the doubt, as to the real ownership of that share, is spread all over the record, the proceedings throughout being written in the alternative. Elizabeth Gery is represented as his wife or widow; Joseph H. Gery, his wife, and the children are all made parties to the partition, the latter being represented by guardians ad litem; Joseph H. Gery was called to accept or refuse the real estate at the valuation, and as he did not answer the guardian ad litem of the children was called, and the privilege extended to them ; and the recognizances, securing this <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>interest or share in the estate, were drawn to Joseph H. Gery, third eldest son, &amp;c., and in ease he died before his father, then to his heirs and legal representatives; this was not strictly accurate in expression, perhaps, as the heirs are entitled by re presentation, and not bv substitution, but the meaning is obvious and apparent. These several sums of money were paid to, and received by, the trustee under a right, real or supposed, arising from his appointment, without question in any respect, and in advance of any lawful adjudication as to the actual beneficial ownership ; and the fund so received is now brought before the court to be applied to whom it may belong’. If it now appeared, by positive and direct proof, that Joseph H. Gery bad, in fact, ¿lied on the day he disappeared, <em>it </em>certainly cannot be doubted that we would distribute this fund, so held in trust and awaiting adjudication, to those upon whom the estate devolved; and as the presumption of death after the lapse of seven years is as effective as direct proof of the fact, we cannot see how any doubt can exist as to tbe parties entitled here.</p>

Longaker &amp; Son, as creditors of the father, cannot therefore participate in the fund.</p>
    <p id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[428,1423,907,217]]]'>The decree of the Orphans’ Court of Berks county is, therefore, reversed, and it is ordered, that the record be remitted, that distribution may be made in accordance with this opinion.</p>
