By direction of the court, the jury found a verdict “for the defendant, to be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff on his paying the balance due within six months with interest and costs.” The court being subsequently of opinion that the plaintiff could not recover unless the mortgage debt was fully paid, entered judgment for defendant absolutely.</p>

By deed of that date, acknowledged September 25th, 1872, she and her husband conveyed this tract to defendant in consideration of three thousand dollars to be advanced by him to be used in the construction of a grist mill on the premises conveyed. An agreement was entered into the same day between the parties to the effect that this sum was to be repaid by plaintiffs within five years from the first of the following March, when defendant agreed to re-convoy the premises. This contract was acknowledged on July 2d, 1873. Defendant also became indorser on the notes of Charles Wells for about seventeen hundred dollars. On July 3d, 1873, he caused a bond and mortgage to be prepared and executed by Charles and Amelia Wells, for the purpose of securing the advances mentioned in the contract, as well as the notes indorsed — amounting as fixed by the bond, to one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven dollars and twenty-eight cents, and also nine hundred dollars to cover accruing interest on the three thousand dollars, until payment of the debt. The bond also provided for an insurance on the property, contained a confession of judgment, and recited that the before-mentioned deed and contract were understood to constitute a mortgage. On April 27th, 1874, judgment was entered upon this bond and a fi. fa. issued. A rule granted to open this judgment on the application of Amelia Wells, for the reason that being a married woman when she executed the bond it was therefore void, was afterwards discharged.</p>

This rule is not inflexible, for the allowance may be regulated by the justice and equity arising out of the circumstances of eaclr particular cause. Nor will the mortgagee be held to proof of absolute necessity: Harper’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/64/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="64 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1021266" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0315-01">64 Pa. St., 315</a>. While charges for repairs for the purpose of ornament, or the comfort of the mortgagee, or new buildings unnecessary for the preservation of the estate, will not be allowed, expenses for permanent improvements necessary and beneficial for the proper use of'the estate will be allowed in the account: Jones on Mortgages, § 1129. Under the circumstances of this case, the evidence referred to in the second and third specifications was properly received. That the buckwheat refiner, was a substantial improvement, and not a repair of old machinery, was' not enough to exclude its cost as a proper charge. The old machinery may have been of such character as to have become useless in the competition with other mills <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>in tbe neighborhood. Only upon the special circumstances could it be determined whether the defendant ought to be allowed the cost of the refiner.

    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[130,585,1163,989]]]'>The only remaining question which calls for remark, namely, whether the court erred in entering judgment for the defendant, is raised by the fifth specification. As the verdict settles that the debt was not fully paid, the learned judge of the common pleas was of opinion that the verdict and judgment must be for the defendant, citing as authority Hewitt <em>v. </em>Huling, <a href="/pa/11/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="11 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="404612" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0027-01">11 Pa. St., 27</a>. In that case, it is true, that the jury were instructed to render a verdict for the defendants, unless tho clear profits up to the time of the trial amounted to as much as the debt and interest. The point was not considered in this court, for there was an unconditional verdict for the plaintiff, showing that the jury found that the debt had been paid before the beginning of the suit. In Cole <em>v. </em>Bolard, <a href="/pa/22/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="22 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="413779" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0431-01">22 Pa. St., 431</a>, the plaintiff alleged that the apparent deed was a mortgage ; there was no claim of any payment by rent or profit, and it was said that if the debt was paid any time before trial, though not before the bringing of the suit, the plaintiff was entitled to the verdict for the laud, conditioned that he should pay the costs before taking out execution. There, no point was raised in this court respecting a verdict should the jury find that a part of the mortgage debt was unpaid at the time of the trial. We are not advised of any other case in this state touching or disposing of the question.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[127,1575,1167,816]],["BL_354.1",354,[261,409,1164,553]]]'>Formerly, in some other states, the mortgagor, after payment of the debt, could not recover possession in ejectment from the mortgagee; his remedy was by bill in equity. Even where this rule has been somewhat relaxed, it has been held that the mortgagor cannot maintain ejectment against the mortgagee in possession so long as there is any question whether the mortgage debt has been paid in full, or there remains any question of account to settle between the parties ; in such ease he must resort to a bill to redeem. When the mortgagee has in fact received rents and profits sufficient to satisfy the debt, the mortgagor's remedy is in equity, for only in a court of equity can he compel account and application of the profits to the payment of the debt. The mortgagor seeking to regain possession of the premises must do equity to the mortgagee by paying all that is due on the mortgage. Ordinarily, when the debt has not been fully paid, the form of the judgment is that the plaintiff may redeem, upon paying the amount found due on the mortgage, within a specified time, together with costs, and upon his doing so the defendant shall <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>discharge the mortgage and. deliver up the premises, and that upon default of such payment the bill be dismissed with costs. And the decree should fix a time within which the redemption is to take place. The general rule in regard to costs upon a suit to redeem is that the plaintiff, although successful in the suit, instead of recovering costs, pays them to the defendant. An exception to this rule is made when the defendant sets up an unwarranted defence, or one which wholly fails, in which case he may be compelled to pay costs. If the amount due is in dispute, although the defendant proves to be in error, yet if he had reasonable ground for his view of the case, the costs will be awarded against the plaintiff: Jones on Mort., §§ 673, 674, 1106, 1111.</p>

He shall recover if the debt be paid at any time before the trial, for this would be his right in equity' in a suit to redeem. Where an account is necessaiy to determine whether or not aiything is due on the mortgage debt, in equity he could recover in case it was not wholly paid, upon condition that he pay the balance. In such case why may he not also recover in ejectment? The account is to be settled and the equity to be administered when it turns out that the rents and profits up to the date of trial do not equal the debt, precisely upon equitable principles as if it should happen that no balance was due and owing on the mortgage debt. We are of opinion that the mortgagor is entitled to recover in the former case, as well as in the hitter.</p>

Its form is incorrect; but its plain meaning is that judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the land shall be entered, “ upon the plaintiff pa.ying to the defendant $241.44 in six months, with interest thereon and costs.” The Act of March 14th, 1872, provides that no verdict shall be set aside for defectiveness in form.
