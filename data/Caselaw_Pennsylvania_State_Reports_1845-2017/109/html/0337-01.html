That they have such right is denied by the contestants in view of the 5th section of the 5th article of the Constitution of this Commonwealth. This section reads: “ Whenever a county shall contain 40,000 inhabitants it shall constitute a separate judicial district and shall elect one judge learned in the law, and the General Assembly shall provide additional judges as the business of the district may require. Counties containing a population less than is sufficient to constitute .separate districts shall be formed into convenient single districts, or if necessary may be attached to contiguous districts, as the General Assembly may provide.” Under this section of the Constitution the contestants maintain that as Butler county contains 40,000 inhabitants it is, and of right ought to be, a separate judicial district, with the right to elect at least one judge learned in <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>the law, and that in such election Lawrence county cannot lawfully participate. On the other hand the right is claimed by the respondents for the qualified electors of Lawrence county, on the ground, 1st, that Lawrence county is a part of the Seventeenth Judicial District to the extent or in the sense that the qualified electors of said county may take part in the election of the law judges of said district, and 2d, because of the express provision of the 3d section of the Act of General. Assembly approved August 7th, 1883, in the following words: “ And in all cases where a county is or shall be attached to an adjoining district the qualified electors of such county shall be entitled to vote for the president judge and an additional law judge where provided for.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[132,991,1176,1424]]]'>The questions raised by these propositions are interdependent, and their answer is to be found in the true construction of the 5th section of the 5th article of the Constitution. The purpose of this part of our fundamental law was to prescribe a rule for the division of the state into judicial districts. Such a rule is indicated not by any merit which one section or municipal division has superior to that of another, but only by consideration of convenience. It was not in its object to create rights, and if under it rights are given to one or to a class which are not given to all, it is not because a special grant was its purpose, but because it so happened in carrying out a general plan adopted for convenience. In seeking the true construction of this section, therefore, we must leave out of mind the idea of a grant of right to the counties of the state, and keep in mind that the object of it is to provide a certain basis for dividing the state into districts convenient for the administration of justice. The chief and underlying wish expressed in this section is that all counties in the state with sufficient business to occupy a judge learned in the law should constitute a separate judicial district. The advantages sought by this plan seemed to have been, <em>(a) </em>to enable each county to elect a judge to preside over its courts, <em>(b) </em>to have a law judge resident in each county to whom the inhabitants could apply when necessary, and <em>(o') </em>to thereby be able to dispose of associate judges. It was conceived that a county with 40,000 inhabitants would have sufficient business to occupy a judge learned in the law, and that number was therefore fixed for counties that would constitute separate judicial districts. But.in the division of the state it would necessarily happen that some counties, for lack of sufficient inhabitants, could not constitute separate districts, therefore the favorite plan could not be adopted as to them, and it was directed that they should be formed into convenient single districts.</p>

It was therefore necessary to make a further modification, hence it was provided that when necessary the General Assembly might attach such county to a contiguous district. When such attachment takes place it does not necessarily follow that the larger county loses all the advantages of a separate district, but we consider it loses the right of'itself to elect the law judges for the district. Prior to such union the law judges of the district presided over the courts of the county that constituted it, therefore they presided over the courts of the attached as well; before their jurisdiction was confined to the single county, save for special purposes, therefore their jurisdiction is equal in both counties. Therefore, when judges learned in the law are to be elected in such a district, the electors -of both counties have a common interest, and we consider a common right, to take partin their election. This right, we think, is secured to the qualified electors of the attached county in general terms by section 5 of the declaration of rights, and more plainly by the 15th section of the 5th article of the Constitution, in these words: “All judges required to be learned in the law, except the judges of the Supreme Court, shall be elected by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside, &amp;e.” This section brings the election of law judges under the general rule growing out of the spirit of our institutions, that when an office is elective the officer to fill it shall be chosen by those over whom he is placed.</p>

In reaching this conclusion we are not unmindful of the case of the Commonwealth <em>v, </em>Dumbauld et al., 1 Out., 293, but we consider that the question which here arises was properly left open in the decision then made.</p>

Neale dissented from the judgment, and filed a dissenting opinion, in which he said, <em>inter alia: </em>It is hardly necessary, in assigning a reason for the radical change made by the framers of the Constitution of 1874, to say that'it was the intention of the Constitution to subdivide the state into separate judicial districts, as far,as possible to consist of one county, and where that was impracticable, into single judicial districts composed of counties containing less <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>than forty thousand inhabitants. The formation of separate districts, consisting of a singlo county was evidently the leading thought, as evidenced by the low numerical qualification attached, and the provision for decennial designations, thus clearly taking into view the certain natural increase of population, and the consequent rights of counties acquiring the requisite population to be detached from their temporary relation with other counties, either as components of single districts or attachments to separate districts. Hence, in the face of such an inevitable result, it is giving no strained meaning to the intention of the framers of the Constitution to say that in isolated, unavoidable instances some part of the rights of the people of an unclassified county should be merely suspended. • Construing the fifth section of the fifth article by its plain words and unmistakable meaning, it is conclusively and only deducible that it intends to confer upon counties having <em>over </em>forty thousand inhabitants at least temporary advantages, not to be possessed and enjoyed by counties of <em>less </em>than forty thousand population.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[119,1260,1175,389]]]'>These advantages consisted of the right to be <em>constituted </em>a “separate judicial district,” “the right to have a resident law judge,” and “the right not to have associate judges,” as contra-distinguished from all other counties having less*than forty thousand inhabitants, either forming single districts or attached to separate districts — wherein the right to have a resident law judge does not expressly pertain to any one of those component or attached counties, but wherein the right to have associate judges for each county is not taken away or disturbed.</p>

(Schedule section 14.) Pursuant to this duty the Act of General Assembly of 7th August, 1883, was passed, designating “The 17th judicial district of the county of Butler, to which the county of Lawrence is hereby attached, and shall have two judges learned in law, and the additional law judge shall reside in New Castle, in Lawrence county.” By this Act one thing is provided for, viz., that “ the additional law judge shall reside at New Castle,” and so far as the Act contravenes, the other law judge may also “reside at New Castle,” and there may be no judge whatever residing in Butler county. Hence it follows that the more populous county, with the right to be constituted “ a separate judicial district,” that to wliicli the district designation is expressly given, is not only shorn of its ancient privilege of having associate judges, by operation of the fifth section of tlie fifth article, but as a possible, and in this case, an actual result, of the Act of 7th Au<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>gust, 1883, is to be wholly deprived of the privilege of a law judge residing within its territorial limits. Therefore, to give the interpretation to the statute of the 7th August, 1883, and enforcement to its provisions as asked for by the respondents, the large county, <em>the object of assured constitutional preference, </em>is to be deprived of every privilege, except that its courts may be presided over by a judge elected by the votes of the county of inferior population — the attached county. What is this but the denial of right, of constitutional right, deprivation of privileges, disfranchisement, not of an individual, but of the people of a whole country, indeed of a district, botli <em>de jure </em>and <em>defacto, </em>without compensation of any kind. The lion’s share of benefits appropriated and enjoyed by the weaker and dependent protegé!

It then unavoidably follows that the condition of attachment can only arise when the prerequisite condition of a separate district has been established. The trunk or tree must first exist before the ingrafted branches can appear. Nor is it necessary under the fifth article that the designation o:: separate judicial districts be immediately contemporaneous with the Act attaching a smaller county. A pre-existing separate judicial district may, by a subsequent apportionment or assignment, have another or other counties attached to it, providing they are under the numerical limitation of the fifth article. Hence there was nothing in the way of attaching Lawrence to Mercer county, and subjecting it for nine years to a judicial administration in the selection of which it would have had no voice — only a year less than would occur by giving efl'ect and force to the position, contended for by the petitioners......But why multiply words, or suggest additional reasons why the prayer of the petition should be allowed, when the duty of this court is so plainly indicated in the learned opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Dumbauld et al., 1 Out., 293, delivered by Mr. Justice Paxson in full view of just such facts possible to arise, and now involved in the pres- ■ ent case.</p>

The qualified electors of each of said counties, met at their respective legal places for holding elections, and voted for two judges, and the votes cast in each county were counted and ascertained at the county seat thereof. A return judge ivas appointed according to the requirement of the statute, in each county, to meet a similar officer appointed by the other county. Those two met at the county seat of Butler county, at the time designated by statute and cast up the votes of both counties, and on a correct computation thereof, found that John McMichael and Aaron L.

The tribunal authorized by law to decide such a contest, decided adversely to the claim of the appellants, and the commissions have been issued to the other candidates named.</p>

In other words although the county of Lawrence was legally united, annexed, or attached, in the formation of the district, yet the qualified electors thereof, are, by the Constitution, denied all right to vote for the judges, who for a full term of ten years, are to preside in the courts of their county. A proposition so startling as this, and one affirming such an unequal and unjust discrimination against all the legal voters of a county, ought not to be assented to, unless its correctness be clearly established.</p>

It was held that this section did not of itself constitute a separate district when a county attains the number of inhabitants specified; but it indicates the basis on which, at the proper time and in the proper manner, judicial districts may be created by the legislature. The unreasonable and mischievous effects of any other construction are well stated in the able opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Agnew. The correctness of this construction has since been affirmed and approved by this court, in a distinct manner in Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Burns <em>v. </em>Handley et al., 10 Out. 245 ; <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>and in sur petition of Cahill, Slevin and McVay, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20W.N.C.%20485" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="16 W.N.C. 485">16 W.

It declares “tbe General Assembly shall at the next suceeding session after each decennial census and not oftener, designate the several judicial districts as required by the Constitution.” Thus not only is the whole power of designating judicial districts given to the legislature, but it can be exercised only after each decennial census. Although a county, forming part of another district, may in fact, for many years, have the population stated as sufficient to constitute a separate judicial district, yet it must bide its time and await the action of the General Assembly.</p>

If then, persons possessing these qualifications, are entitled to vote at “ all elections ” and judges learned in the law shall be elected by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside, it must be conceded that these sections intend to give and do give, to the electors of the county of Lawrence, the right to vote for their judges, unless that county is not within the 17th judicial district over which said judges are to preside.

One is that the law judges of the 17th district do preside over and in the county of Lawrence. The other is that the county is not in any other judicial district. No judges, other than those of the 17th district are authorized to preside there. All writs issued from the several courts of record of the county of Lawrence must be tested in the name of the president juclge of the district. The <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>commissions issue to these judges as judges of the 17th judicial district. If the county of Lawrence is not within the district of these judges, then the president judge thereof has no power to call upon the president or law judge of any other district to hold a term of court therein. The electors of the county of Lawrence are either within the 17th district with the right to vote in the election of judges learned in the law, to preside there, or else they are outside of that district, and in no other, and legally have no such judge to preside in the courts of their county. Such a result would not only be repugant to the whole scope and spirit of the Constitution relating to courts, but would destroy that uniformity in the organization and operation of courts of equal grade, which it expressly declares shall be preserved. Thus section 26, of Art. V., <em>inter alia </em>declares “all laws relating to courts shall be general, and of uniform operation, and the organization, jurisdiction and powers of all courts of the same class or grade, so far as regulated by law, and the force and effect of the process and judgments of such courts shall be uniform.” The construction claimed by the appellants for section 5, denies to one county that uniform organization and operation which the constitution declares shall tee enjoyed by all the counties, and which no law shall impair.</p>

This however is only one view of the case. It has another side, that side is the people. Uniformity in the organization and operations of a court is not for the exclusive convenience of the judge who administers the laws, but its main purpose is for the benefit of the people of every county, whose rights might be injuriously affected by an absence of this uniformity.</p>
