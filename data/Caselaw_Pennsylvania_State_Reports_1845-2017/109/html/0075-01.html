His widow took the $3.77 on account of her exemption, and claimed the balance of $296.23 out of the realty. After an Orphans’ Court sale of the latter, A.’s administrator had in hand for distribution, as the proceeds of the sale, $271.86. Before the Auditor appointed to distribute this fund, the widow claimed the balance of her exemption; the holders of a first mortgage against the real estate which had been discharged by the Orphans’ Court sale, presented a claim for $110; and the city of Allentown presented claims based on liens against the real estate for taxes, amounting to about $84. The Auditor first awarded $110 to the holders of the mortgage, and the balance of the fund to the widow on account of her exemption. This award was confirmed by the court below, whereupon the city appealed.</p>

There had been a trifling amount of personal property — three dollars and seventy-seven cents— which the widow, Catharine Sweeney, took on account of her $300 exemption allowance. She claimed the balance of her “ exemption ” out of the real estate, and the appraisers returned that it could not be divided without spoiling the whole, and that she should be entitled to receive $296.23 out of the proceeds of its sale. This return was confirmed on July 3d, 1882. Before the Auditor, the widow claimed that the entire balance in hand be distributed to her, under the Act of April <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>14th, 1851, setting apart $300 to widows of decedents.

This mortgage was dated May 22d, 1876, and the association agreed to accept $110 in full, for the same and interest.</p>

But the Act of 1874 declares that the lien for taxes shall have priority to, and shall be fully paid and satisfied before any mortgage. The logic of the position of the court below is, that while our lieu is to be <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>preferred to the estate created by the mortgage, yet it is not to be preferred to an estate as to which the mortgage has priority.</p>

In Huifort's Appeal it is held that where a judgment is the first lien and the mortgage the second, the exemption cannot be claimed against the judgment, because to permit it it would be to affect the mortgage.

And though mortgages are commonly spoken of as mere securities for payment of money, they are such because they are formal pledges of the land.

Accordingly, the judgments were paid, and the balance of the fund applied on the mortgage; the debtor got nothing on his claim of exemption. These cases are not easily reconciled. It is recognized in the latter, with reference to the former, that if the fund for distribution does not exceed three hundred dollars, the subsequent mortgage may be paid out of the same, and if there be an overplus it shall be paid to tire debtor on his claim.
