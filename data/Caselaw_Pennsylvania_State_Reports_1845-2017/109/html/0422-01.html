If the latter view be adopted, the defendants must be regarded as having advanced to the plaintiffs the amount of money for which the check called, until it could be ascertained whether it would be paid upon pi'esentation to the Mississippi Valley Bank. In whatever light it may be viewed, the parties to this action stand to each other in the relation of endorser and endorsee, the endorsee being required to demand and entitled to receive payment from the maker of the check. The contention on the part of the plaintiffs is, that sending the check, to the bank on which it was drawn for payment, is not such a demand as will release the endorsee from liability to the en<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>dorser, when, as it is here admitted, the bank to which it was sent for payment does not return the money for the check, nor the check itself, but cancels it on the theory that it has been paid, by charging the account of the drawer with the amount of the check, surrendering the possession of it to him, or at least entitling him to have it delivered up to him, as paid and cancelled.</p>

Had this been done the rights of all parties would have been protected. The conclusion is a legitimate one, that had demand been made by an agent of defendant hank, the mone}^ for the check would have been paid to such agent, whose whole duty would have been performed by transmitting the proceeds of the check to the defendant bank who would thus have secured the advance which it had made to the plaintiffs, and the transaction as to all parties concerned would have been properly closed out. It must not be overlooked that the duty which the defendant bank undertook to perform in connection with the collection of the check was voluntarily <em>assumed; </em>it cannot, <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>therefore, complain if it is held not only to good faith, but also to the exercise of such diligence as would protect the rights of all parties. The law imposes no unreasonable obligation upon one who undertakes to do that which the defendant in this case undertook to perform. The entire measure of that duty was to transmit to a responsible agent for collection, and this the defendant could have done, or declined the performance of the obligation, if it had no correspondent or agent to whom it could have transmitted the check for collection from the bank on which it was drawn. Or it could have declined to accept the performance of any act connected with the collection of the check, except as acting under the instruction and at the risk of the depositor. This the defendant did not do, but assumed the responsibility of sending the evidence of the plaintiff’s right to have the money for which it called collected for their benefit to the bank which was expected to make payment. Not obtaining the money, but a worthless draft in return, the defendant treating the check as not paid, charged the amount of it back to the plaintiff’s account, and when they called for the check, as the best evidence of their right to recover against the maker, they are informed, the check you call for cannot be returned; it was paid, charged to the drawer’s account and cancelled.</p>

That such a course is frequently adopted may be admitted, but when it is followed it is at the risk of the agent, who, of his own choice, transmits the evidence of indebtedness upon which the right to demand payment depends to the party who is to make the payment, instead of forwarding it to a sub-agent, with express or implied instructions to do all that is required by way of demand for payment, protest when payment is refused, and return the instrument to the party from whom it had been received.</p>

The case has also been criticised in other states : Dorchester <em>v. </em>New England Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Cush.%20187" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Cush. 187">1 Cush., 187</a>; iEtna Ins.

    <p class="summary" id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[262,800,1181,1252]]]'>Thus far the cause has been argued without reference to the terms of the notice in the plaintiff’s bank book, which notice entered ipto and became part of the implied contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant. That notice in terms bound the plaintiffs to liability'', as indorsers upon the check, “ until payment has been ascertained” by the defendant; that is, until the defendant learned that the amount of the check had actually been paid to it or for its account. The check was paid as between the Mississippi Valley Bank and Ruhman &amp; Co., when its amount was charged by that bank against the deposit account of that firm, but although that bank mailed the New York draft to the defendant in payment for the check, the defendant never agreed to accept that draft as payment, and an express agreement to that effect was necessary to constitute that draft a payment of the amount of the check to the defendant : Cumber <em>v. </em>Wane, 1 Sm. L. C., 457; Hays <em>v. </em>Mc-Clurg, <a href="/watts/4/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Watts 452" data-case-ids="1842715" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0452-01">4 Watts, 452</a> ; Weakly <em>v. </em>Bell, 9 <a href="/watts/4/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Watts 452" data-case-ids="1842715" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0452-01">Id.,</a> 273 ; Darlington <em>v. </em>Gray, <a href="/whart/5/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Whart. 487" data-case-ids="8878740" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0487-01">5 Whart., 487</a>; Dougherty <em>v. </em>Hunter, 4 Sm., 382. If that draft on New York had been honored, then, and not until then, the defendant would have ascertained payment. That draft not having been honored, the defendant has not yet ascertained payment, and the plaintiffs are still bound to the defendants as indorsers. If the check had been lost in its transmission by mail to the Mississippi Bank, the plaintiffs, under the terms of the notice, would have had to make good the amount to the defendant; so also the check having been lost by its payment and cancellation at the Mississippi Bank, that loss, under the terms of the notice, must be borne by the plaintiffs.</p>

It is only as a favor and convenience to its depositor that a bank receives as cash that which is not cash. Especially is this true of checks payable in a distant city. To hold a bank, in the absence of an express agreement made upon an adequate consideration, liable as a collecting agency with regard to such checks, is neither reasonable nor just. If such is to be the <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>rule of law, banks must either refuse to take upon deposit, or receive for collection bills and checks payable at distant places, or they must charge such rates of collection as will adequately compensate them for the services rendered, and indemnify them against the risks incurred ; and in either event, their customers will be inconvenienced by the change in the manner of doing business.</p>

The defendants were bankers in London, in correspondence with the plaintiffs, their customers in the country. The bills in question, which had been indorsed to the plaintiffs in the course of negotiation, had been transmitted by them to the defendants in order to obtain payment from the acceptors, who resided in London, and to carry the amount to the account of the plaintiffs. The defendants accordingly tendered the bills to the acceptors for payment, when he gave them a check upon a banker in London for the amount, upon the receipt of which check they delivered up to the acceptor the bills in question. It turned out that the check was dishonored, the person on whom it was drawn having no account with the drawer. Upon these facts, which wore not disputed, the plaintiffs contended that the defendants had been guilty of negligence, in giving up the bills for the check they had received, in payment without previously inquiring whether or not the check would bo honored. The defendants, on the other hand, insisted that they had only done what was usual in the ordinary course of trade and business of bankers, and therefore ought not to be answerable for the event; and Lord Kenyon being clearly of the latter opinion, the plaintiffs were non-suited. Erskine moved to set aside the nonsuit upon the ground before stated. But, Per Cuiuam.: “We dare not even grant a rule to show cause, as it would be putting the whole trade of London in suspense pending it. There is no ground to impute negligence to the defendants.”</p>

The notice therefore establishes Harrington <em>&amp; </em>Goodman’s right to recover, for, in contemplation of law, the check was actually paid to the Merchants’ Bank when the bank on which it was drawn received it, ga.ve to the Merchants’ Bank a draft on a New York bank for it, credited the check to the Merchants’ Bank, charged the Merchants’ Bank with the draft, cancelled the check, charged it to the maker’s account, and surrendered it to the maker.</p>
