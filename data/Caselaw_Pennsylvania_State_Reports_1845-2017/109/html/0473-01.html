That In consideration of these assurances and guarantee of the plaintiff he signed the lease and moved into the house. That the defendant, shortly after moving into the premises, discovered that the drainage was defective, and that the soil-pipe that drained the water-closet in the house also drained the water from the bath-room and kitchen; in point of fact, all the wastage and nuisance of the house was drained through one small soil-pipe. That it drained into a covered well which had no ventilation or means of ventilation; said well had not been cleaned, as the defendant is informed, for eight years. That the said soil-pipe was so old and rotten that the roots of the trees had worked their way through defective joints so that they filled the said pipe for a length of thirty feet, rendering it Impossible for the contents of the water-closet and kitchen sink to pass through it into the well, but the same drained back into the sink in the kitchen and stationary wash-basins. That the said well was filled nearly to the top, and in consequence thereof and of the premises, the smell through the house was unbearable. That the said plaintiff' was notified of these defects and requested to have them remedied, but he refused. That the defendant thereupon employed the firm of McManemin &amp; Gunzer, practical plumbers, at Chestnut avenue, Chestnut Hill, to remedy these defects, which they did at an expense of fifty-three dollars and eighty-four cents, which he, the said defendant, has since paid. lie Inis also paid the sum of fifty-three dollars for having said well cleaned.
