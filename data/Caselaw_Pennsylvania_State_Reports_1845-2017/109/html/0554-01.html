The plaintiffs’ counsel contends, that, in determin<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>ing whether the municipal authorities may incur the proposed indebtedness without the vote of the people, the existing indebtedness incurred since the Constitution of 1874 went into effect must also be taken into account, and if both together, (after deducting money in the treasury, outstanding solvent debts and revenues applicable within the fiscal year to the payment of said debt) will make an aggregate exceeding two per centum of the assessed value of property, then the question must be submitted to a vote of the electors. According to the former construction there is nothing to prevent the municipal authorities, without a vote of the electors, adding to the indebtedness, until the seven per centum limit is reached, provided the debt incurred at any one time does not exceed two per centum; while, according to the latter construction, the authority of the municipal authorities to incur debt without the consent of the electors will be, for the present, exhausted when two per centum of the assessed value of the taxable property has been added to the present debt, which was in existence on January 1st, 1874. We are requested to decide between these conflicting theories as speedily as possible, in order that the question may be brought at once before the Supreme Court. We appreciate the importance of the question, and we hasten to decide it in order that it may be reviewed at the present term. The time allowed will, however, permit no more than a statement of our conclusion, that the construction contended for by the plaintiffs seems to best accord with the plain meaning of the terms used in the section, to most surely carry out the purpose which the convention and the people had in view in its adoption, to be the sense which the Legislature gave to it (see Section 2, Act April 20,1874 — supra), and to be required by the decisions, so far as opinions have been expressed by the Supreme Court upon the particular question. In Wheeler <em>v. </em>Phila., 27 P. F. S., 852, the court said: ‘ The municipal authorities may increase the debt from time to time until two per centum has been added, provided the original debt, with the increase, does not exceed seven per centum. After the two per centum has been added, there can be no further increase without the vote of the people.’ Language could not be plainer, and, unless we entirely misapprehend the meaning of the court, it was approved in Pike Go. <em>v. </em>Rowland, 18 Nor., 238. For these reasons we hold that, on the admitted facts, the municipal authorities may lawfully increase the present debt by @49,586.81, but that they cannot go beyond that amount without submitting the question to a vote of the qualified electors of the city and obtaining their assent.”</p>

If one addition should be made the other should. The construction contended for by the defendants in error would unjustly discriminate against cities that had small debts and few improvements at the adoption of the constitution.

The contention is whether this can be done without the previous assent of the electors in the manner prescribed by the Constitution. As we have shown, one clause thereof declares the city shall not increase its indebtedness “to an amount exceeding two per centum ” without such assent. There is no warrant in the Constitution to sustain the proposition that the city may now and from time to time as it sees proper, within the maximum limit of seven per centum, increase the indebtedness by successive steps if each increase be less than two per centum. Each action is not sanctioned by either the letter or the spirit of the Constitution. It is not one specific increase of more than two per centum that is forbidden. It is an aggregate indebtedness exceeding that per centum that is prohibited. Sections two and three of the Act of 20th April, 1874, Pur. Dig. pages 1928-29, repeat the language of the Constitution and provide for elections in furtherance thereof. The argument that ignores the aggregate indebtedness and considers the addition only, thereto, proves too much. It would nullify the right of the electors to vote on the question of increase altogether. By successive increases, each less than two per centum, the city might have the aggregate indebtedness reach the seven per centum without a vote of the electors. Up to that per centum the city would deny the right of the electors to vote on the question of increase, and beyond that per centum the Constitution itself prohibits any increase. It follows the learned judge was clearly right in holding that without submitting the question to a vote of the qualified electors of the city and obtaining their assent, the indebtedness of the city cannot be increased so as to aggregate in all more than <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>two per centum upon the assessed value of the taxable property therein.</p>
