The very necessity of such special power shows that in Its absence a partial election would be invalid. No such power is given to the corporation in the present ease either by its charter or the Act of 1874, and it is not one of the implied powers that where in every corporation at common law, the stockholders of this company can only fill vacancies in the board of directors cither at the regular annual meeting or at an adjourned meeting thereof. "To contend otherwise is to assert that a corporation which has failed to elect on the day fixed by its charter may do so at any future time. At common law, the failure to elect at the regular meeting worked a forfeiture of the corporation’s franchises. The Act of 1874 so far modifies this as to prevent the forfeiture, not by extending the power of election but by authorizing the old board to hold over until its successors are duly elected: Angel! and Ames on Corp., § 771; Hose <em>v. </em>Turnpike Company, <a href="/watts/3/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts 46" data-case-ids="1841330" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0046-01">3 Watts, 46</a> ; Philips <em>v. </em>Wickham, 1 Paige, Cli.

If all but one director were elected at the first election, how could the remaining director be elected on the cumulative plan? Or if more than one director remain to be elected, shall they who by their cumulating created the pluralities of those who were elected, be permitted to cumulate their votes again in filling the vacancies? To permit the board of directors to be elected piecemeal and at any other than the regular meeting set for the purpose, would certainly introduce doubt and confusion into the management of corporations, and frustrate the design and object of the system of cumulative voting.</p>

Nor can the cumulative system affect the validity of this election. The difficulties suggested by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error might arise in the event of a supplementary election to fill the vacancies in the board. They do not arise in the present case and therefore need not be discussed.

When, however, the result was made •known, the stockholders’ meeting had been adjourned,' and it was found that in consequence of a tie vote for three of the .candidates five only had received a plurality. There was no attempt to complete the number by a second ballot as the stockholders, not anticipating such a result, had left for their homes, mor was a subsequent special meeting called for that purpose. 'The .five .directors receiving a majority proceeded to organize <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>the new board, and the vacancies have not been filled in any manner. The old board claim to hold over upon the ground that the board must be elected as an entirety, and that the election of. a portion only of the number is a nullity.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[131,596,1181,1763]]]'>The election was for seven directors. That they are called a board has no significance. There were seven places to be filled. When the polls closed the five persons who received a plurality of all the votes cast were either elected or they were not. Did the failure to elect the other two • directors at the annual meeting render the election invalid as to the five? If so, we have a principle which is wholly at variance with our entire theory of elections, public and private, political, municipal and corporate. No doubt exists that if the stockholders had not adjourned and had proceeded to another ballot, the result,would have been legal.' Nor is there more room to doubt that had they adjourned the election to a subsequent day, an election for two more directors on that day would have been valid. It is said however, that inasmuch as there was no such ballot and no adjournment, and the Act of 1874 does not provide for filling up the board under such circumstances, the two vacancies cannot be filled at all; and that the five directors who were elected cannot act, and the old board holds over. This conclusion is reached by confusing two distinct questions, — the validity of the election of the five directors, and the filling the vacancies caused by the failure to elect the remaining two. The first question is legitimately before us and must be decided ; the second is not. The five directors having received a majority of votes were elected; their right to their seats does not depend upon the failure of the corporation to fill the vacancies any more than it would had the vacancies occurred from any other cause. The power of a board is never suspended by vacancies unless the number be reduced below a quorum. Here a quorum were elected ; their power to act is not impaired by the neglect of the corporation to fill up the board. It is begging the. question to say that the Act of 1874 does not provide for such a contingency. If the mode of doing so had been prescribed by the Act or by the charter of the corporation, tlie mode thus designated must be followed. See Gowen’s Appeal, 10 W. N. G., 85. But where the Act is silent, and there is no prohibition, the power inheres in the corporation to hold an election. It is a necessity of its corporate existence, and is among the implied powers granted. This is familiar law : Dillon on Corporations, vol. 2, page 768; Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, § 124 ; People <em>v. </em>Runkel, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Johns.%20157" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Johns. 157">9 John., 157</a>.</p>

A stockholder may perhaps by appropriate proceedings compel the corporation to proceed to fill vacancies in the board of directors, but no one has ever supposed that a neglect to fill up the -board would prevent the directors from acting as a board so long as there was a quorum.

Whether the stockholders can cumulate again to fill the vacancies is a matter that must be determined when the case arises. We cannot settle it in advance and therefore will express no opinion. The complications suggested in the argument of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs may not, and 'probably will not ever arise. If they should we will endeavor to grapple with them when they are brought before us.</p>
