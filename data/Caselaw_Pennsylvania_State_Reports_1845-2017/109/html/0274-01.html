In the laying out of a public road, viewers should avoid a location crossing ¿.railroad track at grade, if it can reasonably be avoided. If they adopt such a crossing at grade, and the Court of Quarter Sessions, on exceptions to the report, find that the grade crossing could not be reasonably avoided and confirm the viewers’ report, the Supreme Court cannot, on certiorari, go into the merits of the case, and where the record shows no error, or abuse of discretion, the order will be affirmed.</p>

The decision of the court below is final and conclusive as regards the merits involved. The statute does not give either appeal or a writ of error to bring the case before us. We can review the action of the court on certiorari only. On this writ we are restricted to an examination of the regularity of the proceedings. Questions of fact arising or passed upon by the court we will not review. All reasonable conclusions of facts will be presumed to have been correctly found by the court. When no mention is made of any improvements by the viewers, we will not presume that any existed. Much must rest in the sound discretion of the court. While crossing of a railroad track at grade, should be avoided whenever it can reasonably be done, yet in this case, with all the facts before it, the court found it could not be so avoided. We cannot say that it erred therein. There is nothing in the whole case to justify us in reviewing this exercise of discretion.</p>
