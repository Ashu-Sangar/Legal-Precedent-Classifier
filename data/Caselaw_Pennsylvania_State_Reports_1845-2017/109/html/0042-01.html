B. filed an affidavit of defence. A. took a rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit, and B., by permission of the court, then filed a supplemental affidavit, and the case was submitted on paper books. On June 2d the court discharged the rule for judgment; and on June 23d A. submitted an exception in writing, to the court at chambers, to this ruling. The court declined to note the exception, on the ground that it was filed too late, under tire rule of court requiring such exceptions to be filed within twenty days. A. again presented his exception in open court, and it was refused on the same ground. Thereupon he took a writ of error, assigning as reasons the judgment of the court discharging his rule, and the refusal of the court to note his exceptions on the record: ,</p>

On this writ we cannot review the action of the court in refusing to note an exception. If it was improperly refused, this is not the way to right the error. There is nothing here which we can review. It is only where the plaintiff excepts to the decision of the court refusing judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, that the right to a writ of error is given: Act of 18th April, 1874, § 2, P.
