That this deponent is informed and believes the same to be true, that the said Osmund Geier delivered certain building association shares of stock as collateral security for the payment of the debt due the plaintiff; that some time in May, 1883, the plaintiff was pressing his said criminal prosecution and threatened to imprison the said Osmund Geier unless the case was settled by the said Geier.

If the defendant may make restitution, he may do so by paying tbe cash, or he may give his note or other obligation therefor, if the prosecutor is willing to accept it: ” Act of March 81st, 1860, sec. 9, P.

    <p id="b201-7" data-blocks='[["BL_201.9",201,[160,979,1174,734]]]'>It is well settled that an agreement in consideration of stifling or compounding a criminal prosecution or proceeding for a felony or a misdemeanor of a public nature is void: Riddle <em>v. </em>Hall, 3 Out., 116. There are, however, misdemeanors of an inferior class in which the public is presumed to have less interest. They are assumed to affect chiefly the parties especially aggrieved thereby. The settlement of offences of this class is not illegal, and therefore an agreement between the offender and tbe party aggrieved, to settle one of this kind is not invalid. Section 9 of the Act of 31st March, 1860, Pur. Dig., 377, authorizes the magistrate or the court to which the proceedings have been returned, to permit the? settlement of such offences. The obtaining of money by means of false and fraudulent representations, with intent to cheat and defraud is an offence for which there would also be a remedy by action, and may be settled. There was therefore no error in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.</p>
