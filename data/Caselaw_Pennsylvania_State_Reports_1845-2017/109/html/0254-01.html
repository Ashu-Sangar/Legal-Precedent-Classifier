While the powers of the board are large and ample, their authority is not supreme. The town council are charged with the duty of providing the funds necessary to construct the water works ; but, in order that they may discharge that duty properly, they should be furnished with such information as will enable them to act intelligently and for the best interests of their constituents. They are clothed, it is true, with authority “ to issue bonds to raise money necessary for the purposes of the Act ” but they are the judges of the necessity for doing so. If they find that the current revenues of the borough from year to year are sufficient to pay for the construction of the works, they are not required to create a bonded indebtedness under the authority given them by the Act. For these and other reasons that might be suggested, it is obvious that the town council should be formalty and officially furnished with such information as has been suggested and is not averred in the petition.

On the contrary, the converse of some of them is thereby admitted. By demurring to the answer the plaintiffs below admit everything that is well pleaded therein, whether by way of traverse or otherwise. They thus admit, for example, the averments of fact above quoted from the third paragraph of the answer, <em>among </em>which are, that they never “ informed the town council how much money would be required during the year 1882, or during any other period of time, for the construction of said works or any part thereof; ” that they never “requested the town council to appropriate any specified sum. of money to the construction of said water works; ” and that they never “ furnished the town council with any estimate or statement either of the contract price of constructing said water works, or of the probable cost of constructing the same otherwise than by contract.” We have already said it was their duty to do these things before they are in a position to charge the town council with negligence and refusal to perform their duty.
