We must also consider the purpose of an Act of this character in construing the same, and the mischief it was designed to suppress. It is quite obvious that the object in view was to prevent an individual engaged in business from continuing to use the name of a member of the firm with whom such persons had been associated, after such member had retired from the concern, or of using the name of <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>a person not interested in such firm, and thus to induce credit to be given by those trading with such persons, and to impose on tlie public. Such being the manifest object of the law, it evidently related mainly to dealings between the individual who used the name of the old firm, or of one not interested, and tlie person who transacted business arising out of said dealings with Mm. These would be mainly between the vendor and the vendee, or the employer and the employee, or the person wbo performed labor or rendered services, and the one for whom it was rendered. Business transactions between parties occupying such a relationship would clearly come within the operation of the statute referred to, and were intended to be embraced within its provisions. It was against fraud and imposition which might be practised upon innocent parties wbo dealt with the persons who transacted business in the name of a party whose interest had ceased, or who never had any interest in tlie same, that the statute was directed. These were the evils intended to be remedied and clearly within the terms of the statute. Beyond this the statute cannot be extended by implication, or even by a liberal construction.”</p>
