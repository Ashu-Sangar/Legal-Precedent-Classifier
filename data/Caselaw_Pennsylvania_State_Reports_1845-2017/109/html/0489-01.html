Allen, as executor of said will, filed two accounts, one July 28th, 1858, and tbe other December 9th, 1864. In the second account, which was a combined principal and income account, he claimed and was allowed credit for a payment of securities valued at $8,550 to the guardian of Mary Quincy Allen. While this second account was before the Auditor, William H. Allen on January 8th, 1866, filed with the latter a supplemental account, and on July 20th, 1866, these accounts were confirmed absolutely. In 1872, Ellen Honora Allen, who at the death of testatrix had been a minor, arrived at full age. In 1882, William H. Allen died. Subsequently Ellen Honora Sheldon (formerly Allen), obtained a citation to his executor to file his account in the estate of Mary Frances Allen, deceased, and upon the filing of such account, together with an account in William H. Allen’s own estate, she asked the court to surcharge William II. Allen as executor with one third of the above sum of $8,550, and to award the same to her out of his estate. As a ground for this request she produced the records of a settlement in the Orphans’ Court of the account of the guardian of Mary Quincy Allen, in which it appeared that William H. Allen had been awarded one third of said $8,550 out of said minor’s estate, not as executor, but as the Auditor’s report and decree read, “ as his sole and separate estate.....in full of all interest in the said estate (of the minor) belonging to said William H. Allen.” This decree had been entered April 15th, 1865. Ellen Honora Sheldon claimed also that upon the death of Roland Curtin Allen his interest in his stepmother’s estate passed to her, and that she was, therefore, entitled to the whole of said money. The executors of William II. Allen resisted this on the ground that it was virtually a review of a decree made sixteen years before, and that in any event Roland Curtin Allen took a vested interest in one half of the sum received, which on his death passed to his father absolutely under the intestate law.</p>

And here the gift in effect is to the step-son, or, should iie be dead leaving issue, then to such issue taken substitutionally.

Mr. Theobald says: “ When the testator has disposed of his whole interest in realty or personalty; if, for instance, absolute vested interests have been given to several as tenants in common with a gift over upon the death of all in certain events, cross-limitations cannot be implied between them as there can be no intestacy, and cross-limitations would divest vested interests. If, however, the interests are not vested but contingent, with a gift over upon the death of all before the interests vest, the argument against an intestacy applies, and no argument can be raised against cross-limitations oil the ground that they would divest vested gifts, and therefore, in all probability cross-limitations would be implied.”</p>

It is obvious upon an examination of the above rules laid down by Mr. Theobald, that when he speaks of “absolute vested interests” he does not mean estates, which, though vested, are liable to be subsequently divested by the happening of a contingent event. The question of cross-remainders arises only when the testator has given a limitation over for the purpose of divesting a vested interest, or perhaps to meet the case of a contingent remainder which has never vested.</p>

We think not. It leaves the gift a vested interest subject to be divested upon a future contingency, which has never occurred, to wit, the death of both the step-children without leaving issue surviving them and the testator. The case of Skey <em>v. </em>Barnes, 3 Mer., 335, cited by Mr. Theobald, was considered by Mr. Jar-man as having finally settled the law on the subject. It was said by. the Master of the Rolls in that ease: “With respect to personal property, if a share once vests, though liable to be divested upon a contingencjs the question of reciprocal succession or survivorship can never arise. If the contingency happens, the share goes over; if the contingency does not happen the share remains vested and goes to representatives.” In the later case of Baxter <em>v. </em>Losli, 14 Beav., 612, there was a gift to certain persons for life, and after the decease of the life tenants to the use of and equally between G. and E. But in case it shall happen that the said G. and E. shall neither of them be living at the death of the survivor of the tenants for life, then I give and bequeath the same to F. Sir.

Scott <em>v. </em>Bargeman, 2 P.

This never happened, for one is still alive, and therefore the contingency on which the gift over was to take effect has not taken place, and there are no words to be found <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>In the will by which E. (the survivor) can be held to take by implication.”</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[126,503,1168,299]]]'>In Scott <em>v. </em>Bargeman, cited in the foregoing opinion, and also relied upon by tlio Auditing Judge below, the interests were held to be contingent, and for that reason cross-remainders were implied. The principal criticism which has been made upon that case is that the interests should have been held to be vested, and not contingent. It does not appear, however, to conflict with the rule laid down bjr Mr. Theobald.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.6",515,[127,803,1168,291]]]'>Our own cases of Chew’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2023" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 23">1 Wright, 23</a>, and McKee’s Appeal, 15 Norris, 277, are believed to be in accord with the foregoing views. That the English cases are not all harmonious or consistent may be admitted, but the leaning of the later cases then as well as now, has been to favor the vesting of interests wherever there are reasonable grounds for such construction.</p>
    <p id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[127,1105,1167,687]]]'>The court below attached much weight to what they believed to be the intent of the testator, and their ruling was evidently designed to carry it into effect. If that intent had been clearly expressed it would govern this case. It is not, however, expressed at all, and is only a matter of inference. It is possible their view as to the testator’s intent may be the correct one, and that Mrs. Allen never intended her husband to have more than a life interest in this third of her estate. It is more probable, however, that the contingency of his inheriting from his children never occurred to her or the draftsman of the will. It often happens that by the death of persons to whom a vested interest has been given, the property passes to some_ one not contemplated by the testator. It may be so here, but the intent of the testatrix is not so evident as to override what we regard as the settled law as to the vesting of a bequest under the will.</p>
    <p id="b515-8" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[389,1793,904,174]]]'>The decree is reversed in each estate at the costs of the appellees, and it is ordered that distribution be made in accordance with the views as expressed in this opinion.</p>
