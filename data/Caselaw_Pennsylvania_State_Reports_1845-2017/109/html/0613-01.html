At the hearing, May 3d, 1884, William H. Shoemaker, the Justice before whom suit was brought, entered judgment against the defendants for $25 penalty, with costs of suit. The defendants thereupon demanded of the Justice that he take such bail as is required by law, and issue a transcript to them for the purpose of an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, and offered to the Justice sufficient bail for that purpose. This the Justice refused to do.</p>

We think, however, that the Constitution since adopted, has changed the manner in which appeals may be allowed in cases of this kind. The provision, Art. 5, See. 14, is as follows: “In all cases of summary conviction in this Commonwealth, or of judgment in suit for a penalty before a magistrate, or court not of record, either party may appeal to such court of record as may he prescribed by law, upon allowance of the appellate court or judge thereof, upon cause shown.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[165,1131,1173,392]]]'>This section, as at first adopted by the convention, provided that: “either party shall have the right to appeal to such court of record as may be prescribed by law,” and there stopped : Debates, Yol. 6, p. 338. This was afterwards amended by striking out the words “ shall have the right to,” and inserting the word “may,” and at the end adding the words “upon allowance of the appellate court or Judge thereof on eause shown.” In this form it was finally adopted, and became a part of the constitution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.7",633,[156,1523,1179,942]]]'>Mr. Buckalow, who introduced the amendment, said he was opposed to the section as it then stood, “ because it will empty into the Common Pleas all cases of summary conviction before magistrates throughout the Commonwealth. I take it, it will also apply to all convictions in boroughs before the Chief Burgess, or other principal executive officers, for breach of a borough ordinance, — in other words, all the police business of towns and cities of the state will be taken to a higher court, and this will be an enormous mass of business.” (See Debates, Vol. 7, p. 515). It was the very purpose, therefore, of the convention to take away from the parties in cases of summary conviction, or in suits to recover penalties, the right to appeal from the judgment of the magistrate, unless application was made to the proper court, by which an appeal may be granted upon cause shown. The Act of 17th April, 1876, (Purd. Dig. 2001, pi., 6,) is substantially in the language of the Constitution, and directs <em>that </em>where an appeal is allowed it shall be upon such terms as to payment of costs and entering bail as the court, or judge allowing the appeal, may determine. This supplies former enactments, and necessarily throws the question of appeal upon the court to the exclusion of the magistrate.</p>

It is vested in the court of record, or a judge thereof, to Avhich the appeal is to be taken, and cause therefor must be shown to the Superior Court or judge thereof, before the appeal can be allowed.</p>
