It was alleged that this change was caused, primarily, by suddenly discovering his wife in the act of adultery with his own brother, Josiah Eddoy (one of the residuary legatees under the codicil) for which cause he obtained a divorce. Numerous witnesses testified that they did not believe he possessed testamentary capacity at the date of the will and codicil; some said he had told them that he had suffered two strokes of apoplexy or paralysis; he walked with a cane; was forgetful, would think he had given workmen lumber and hardware to repair his houses, when he had not; “the old man’s mind was so feeble that he didn’t know what he was saying half the time : ” would fail to recognize persons whom he had known well. His next door neighbor who had known him twenty-nine years testified : “ The latter part of his life he was weak, absent-minded and forgetful; he told me he was not capable of performing the duties he formerly did; he would bring letters in ; notes to read for him ; bring the same notes two or three times ; this would occur two or three times a week; told me of the trouble with liis wife, bragged of being the first colored man to gain a divorce in the courts of Pennsylvania; in the latter part of his life he would frequently give me too much change; complain in not being able to transact his business ; complain of feeling unwell, about his mind not being in the same condition, not able to get round as he had some years before; during latter years of his life I drew many notes for him, furnished the paper, etc., as paper he had was not in condition to write on; conversed with him upon subject of his will up to the last time I saw him; about three months before his death said he had made no will; that Burton and he were going over it at the present time ; I spoke of it on several occasions before that; each occasion said it was not completed; this he told me fre<a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>quently, from the summer of ’78 to within three months of his death; said the Lord had not helped him out in the way of disposing his property; he was convicted of forging a name to a judgment note for the purpose of collecting money; don’t think he was capable of making a will in February, ’79, or November ’81; while talking business to him, often go off into a sleep, and want to know wliat we were talking about.”</p>

He said he did all his house-work and preferred to live alone. I applied to Orphans’ Court for his discharge as administrator to liis son’s estate, in behalf of his grandchild, Clara Eddey, for the reason of old age and incompetency ; the case of slander, Lewis <em>v. </em>Eddey, was never pressed by me, though it remained on the list up to Mr. Eddey's death, five years, for the reason I did not consider Mr. Eddey responsible for the language and injury, because of his old age, eccentricities and mental condition; case was never tried. .....

George Tucker Bispham, Esq., remarked of him : “He was a firm man. A man who could not be easily influenced. He was a person of very decided and positive mental traits. He was a positive man in every way. I considered him of shrewd mind, and of very good business capacity. He had a good memory; he was intelligent, and he always understood what he was about. He was very careful of his own interests. He was, I considered, a sharp man of business.” Mr. John A. Burton said of him, “he was of a strong personality, self-contained, and altogether more than an ordinary man both in physical and mental respects.” Hon. Benjamin Harris Brews<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>ter said: “ I thought him one of the remarkable characters I had known in my life. I thought he was an uncommonly firm man; of great resolution and will. He frequently consulted me about business matters, was always clear-headed, and always competent to determine matters, and understood what was explained to him. He would not do anything unless he did understand it too. I had to be very careful in explaining everything ; he never took anything for granted.” Some time after the date of his will, he took it'(from a safe deposit company where he had kept it) to Mr. Brewster, to consult him about making a codicil, as to which Mr. Brewster further testified:</p>

I did not wish to prepare it, I told Mr. Eddey so. He wanted Mr. Wears to consult with me about it; Mr. Eddey himself spoke of it in the presence of Mr. Wears, and in his absence, but Mr. Wears was reluctant to interfere with it. When I spoke to him he said he would rather the old gentleman would attend to it himself, he did not want to be accused of making a will for himself, he did not want to have anything to do with it, he wanted it to be his free act. I said I would rather not make the will. Mr. Burton prepared this former will, he has been your counsel for so many years.

Burton testified in substance, in reférence to the drawing of the will, that early in 1879, in pursuance of Eddey’s instructions, he prepared a draft of the will, that while consulting with Eddey in reference to such draft, he (Burton)- remarked, that the legacies left to his grandchildren were very small in comparison to the value of his estate, and Eddey said he knew that to be so ; but bis reasons for Sarah Lewis, his granddaughter, were that her character and vices were of such a character that to leave her anything that she could get lierself, but a mere pittance, would be worse than throwing his money away ; that she was addicted to drunkenness, and that anything more than a mere amount sufficient to feed and clothe her would be worse than useless. As to Frank Eddey, be said: That his associates and mode of life, and what he had done so far as he had lived, was conclusive to his mind that any amount of money given to him would be of no benefit to him. When he came to the grandchild Clara Eddey, I knew something of Mr. Eddey’s mind in respect to her. He <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>had expressed himself that when her father died she was very-decent, and that he had felt extremely kindly towards her, but she had pursued a course, and she had taken advice which it seemed to him on every hand she had lost all filial affection and all respect; and I suggested to him that those things had probably been the result of bad advice or-improper advice or over-zealous friends, and that she was young, and that he ought to overlook some of them and leave her something considerable ; and he did put in the first draft of the will $500.

Briefly stated, it is that a beneficiary whose legacy is the fruit of his own advice to the testator, backed by the force of a confidential relationship, must show, where that testator is mentally weak, that he fully understood the disposition of his property which is attempted by the will. The testimony now <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>submitted, which has been examined by us with scrupulous care, fails, we think, to bring this case within the operation of that rule, or at least complies substantially with its requirements. It was conflicting, in the sense that there were opposing witnesses and irreconcilable statements ; but after eliminating from the mass of irrelevant matter which disfigures the record, the crude opinions, formed upon no perceptible basis of fact, and uttered by persons who could by no courtesy be described as experts, what remains will show that the testator executed the will and codicil with a full and unbiased appreciation of their meaning. All the circumstances of his history, as they were brought into view by the investigation, disclosed the working of a mind of even phenomenal vigor. By a shrewdness which owed nothing to education he contrived, out of the scanty opportunities which were possible to a direct descendant of slaves, to get together a considerable fortune. He was capable of strong resentments, for whose expression his domestic difficulties gave both scope and justification, and his will, if it needs an explanation, is, when read in the light of these facts, perfectly intelligible. The will and especially the codicil were attacked upon the ground, first, that the testator lacked testamentary capacity when they were executed. It was alleged that he was suffering at their date from one or more attacks of paralysis, and his own declarations to that effect were testified to by a large number of witnesses. The only evidences of this disease which they were able to discover for themselves were his failing memory and his use of a cane, infirmities which they were wholly unwilling to ascribe to his age, then verging on eighty-two years. It was also alleged that he had no knowledge of the value of his property, and that he expected to dispose of it through supernatural agencies. The proof of this was found in his repeated statement that he did not know how many properties he owned, and that the Lord would make his will for him. These statements, the witnesses admitted, without any consciousness that the admission weakened their force, were made in reply to friendly suggestions that certain charities would be suitable objects for his bounty, and to an equally kind, but perhaps impertinent solicitude to know what he was worth. The proneness to generalizing was shown by the declaration of one witness that he had always regarded the testator as an imbecile, and of another, that no colored man after he has reached the age of fifty is competent to make a will. A minister of decedent’s faith, who had unsuccessfully interceded on behalf of a charity, expressed the conviction that the testator was a miser, and was therefore, and necessarily, insane. This is a candid summary of the contestants’ case upon the point of mental unsound<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>ness; and it must read like a burlesque when contrasted with the testator’s character in that respect, as drawn by the proponent’s testimony, and by the facts which were incidentally developed on both sides. A physician who had known the testator fourteen years, and who attended him shortly before the codicil was signed as well as in his last illness, declared that he had no symptoms of having suffered at any time from paralysis, and that he was entirely sane ; and he was corroborated in every particular by another physician who had been acquainted with the decedent for a longer time, and had prescribed for him between the dates of the will and the codicil. It was shown that, to the last, the testator retained an accurate knowledge of his several properties; that he received their rents, and entertained offers for their sale; that he was present in 1882 at different hearings before a Master ; that in that year he presided at a meeting of a beneficial society, and advised its incorporation, and finally, that he attended the class meetings of his church, and so lately as July, 1882, administered the sacraments. The importance of these facts is apparent, when it is remembered that he wrote his will in 1879 and died in September, 1882.</p>

The latter point needs no further discussion. If he labored under any misconception, it was in the exaggerated estimate which he put upon its value. Respecting the other point, the only circumstance upon which a doubt can be reasonably hung is that he gave one half of the balance of his estate to a relative who, at a remote time, had done him a grievous personal injury. That relative, however, was a brother, and the only one of his blood who, towards the close of decedent’s life, appears to have cared for him. Unless we are prepared to believe that neither the lapse of forty years after the occurrence of the wrong, nor the marks of renewed affection on the part of the wrongdoer, could wipe out the hatred which had been engendered, we must explain his generosity in this instance on the same principles by which we account for his parsimony in others. He was estranged, not without cause, from his grandchildren, and in opposition even to the advice of his counsel, he cut down the legacy to one of them from $500 to $100. He was opposed to leaving any benefaction to the charities which had been recommended to him because he had been ill-treated by' their officers. On the other hand, his brother had attended him in sickness, and had been entrusted by him with business; and <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>Ms co-legatee had been raised as a son by the testator, and had certainty never betrayed his kindness. He was reminded, not by the legatees, but by his counsel, both of whom stand high at this bar, that the bulk of his estate was undisposed of by his will. His reply was, that he had purposely left his will incomplete in order to gain time for deliberation. The manner of execution of the codicil was in keeping with this utterance. He retained the draft, which had been prepared at his request, for at least a week before signing it, and he executed it in presence of witnesses of his own selection, when both of the residuary legatees were absent. During the ten months which followed, and until within a few hours of his death, he performed acts, both public and private, which were utterly incompatible with the theory of testamentary incapacity. We are averse to the taking from a complainant of the opportunity to submit his controversy to a jury; but upon the proofs before us, which, from their volume, we may safely assume to be exhaustive, we are convinced that a verdict for the proponents would be sustained, and we therefore dismiss the petition for an issue.</p>

He was born of colored parents in Virginia about 1798. His mo the being a slave he shared her condition of servitude as the law then stood, until his father purchased the freedom of his mother and the children. Joshua, the testator, subsequently removed from Virginia to Columbia, Pennsylvania, and about the year 1885 came to Philadelphia, where he resided until his death in September, 1882. He had little if any education, yet could read and write to some extent, and was able to keep his accounts in a rude way. He appears always to have attended closely to business; was at one time a barber ; kept an oyster saloon and fruit stand ; later in life engaged in real estate operations and loaning money; was close if not miserly in liis habits, and died leaving an estate in houses and personal property variously estimated at from $100,000 to $150,000. His calling for some time prior to bis death was that of a clergyman of the Colored Methodist Church, and he appeared to have enjoyed considerable reputation. It was alleged at one timo that lie was convicted of forgery, but the record of that case shows the granting of a new trial and no subsequent proceedings. We are bound in the absence of evidence to the contrary to assume that the new trial was granted because of insufficient evidence. It is manifest that he was a man of strong personality, of vigorous mind and will, and not easily turned from his purpose. As was to be expected, an ignorant man of this description, possessed of a large estate, and living alone in two small, illy furnished rooms, was the recipient of a large amount of disinterested advice in regard to the proper disposition of bis property by will, in addition to suggestions as to aiding particular charities during bis life. He was in the habit of saying that be looked to the Lord for guidance in making liis will, which, for a Christian clergyman, was neither heterodox in theology, nor bad in law. That he was shrewd <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>enough to keep the matter of his will to himself, taking into his confidence only bis lawyer who prepared it, and one or two friends, is plain from the testimony; that he purposely misled some of the anxious inquirers is equally clear. A lie is never justifiable for any purpose, yet if there are any circumstances which would give it a color of excuse, it is the case of just such a man as this, pestered with gratuitous advice, and constantly appealed to for money in aid of particular persons or charities. If, as was said by Justice Grier in Turner <em>v. </em>Hand; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wall.%20Jr.%2088" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wall. Jr. 88">8 Wall., Jr., 88</a>, a man be addicted to telling lies about his will, we could not on this account pronounce him unfit to manage his affairs or dispose of his property. Testators sometimes take a peculiar pleasure in misleading anxious relatives, particularly collaterals, in this manner. 1 remember a case tried before me where a childless old -woman, possessed of a considerable estate, seemed to have taken a mischievous delight in deceiving her nieces and nephews. She promised her estate to them all, and deceived them all — but one. It was not considered to affect her testamentary capacity.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[248,1211,1180,945]]]'>There were a number of witnesses who expressed the opinion that the testator was unfit to make a will. The opinion of many of them may be brushed aside as wholly worthless by reason of their lack of knowledge and judgment in such matters. A witness must know what testamentary capacity means before we can attach any weight to his testimony, else no man’s will would be safe. Some of the witnesses gave reasons for their opinions which are utterly worthless. As an illustration, Bishop Payne said: “A miser (referring to the testator,) is one who has mistaken gold for God, and property for blessedness. Such a person, in my opinion, is insane, and is therefore incapable of making a judicious will, such as Christians ought to make in view of the teachings of Jesus Christ, especially such as a Christian minister ought to make in view of his responsibility to Christ.” This standard is too vague for practical purposes. Another witness thought no colored man is competent to make a will after he is fifty years of age, though a white man may be. Another witness said : “ I don’t think he was capable of performing the duties of making a will, as he frequently had said that the law had not helped him out in the way he should dispose of his property.”</p>

They both swore before the Register that at that time they considered testator to have testamentary capacity. They appear since to have changed their minds. <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>Gould testified in this proceeding: “ From my observation of the decedent and the facts, I must concede that his memory was very poor, and his judgment not what I would think would be sound.” Thompson said : “ From his condition in 1881, I thought he was not in a condition to make a will, either mentally or physically. From July he did not possess testamentary capacity. Told me several times he did not know what be was worth.” Such declarations as the latter are of very little value. A man may say he does not know what he is worth by reason of fluctuating values, or it may be an evasive answer to an impertinent question. In either event it does not even tend to prove want of testamentary capacity</p>

These are the kind of facts which a court should look at in determining a testator’s capacity, and in the face of them the testimony of a crowd of ignorant witnesses, not experts, as to a testator’s unsoundness, goes for nothing. To permit a jury under such circumstances to set aside a will in order to give effect to their own notions of what a testator should do with his property under given circumstances, in other words to make a will for him, would be-to put many estates in peril, and destroy that assurance which now every man has, that after his death the property for which he has toiled and saved shall go according to the directions of his last will and testament.</p>

His brother appears to have done the testator a grievous domestic wrong, which at one time troubled and clouded his life. But this was forty years ago, and amicable relations were restored long before his death. If he forgave his brother it was not inconsistent with his religious profession.
