    <p class="summary" id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[267,496,1190,866]]]'>The authority of the Orphans’ Court upon equitable principles, and irrespective of its statutory powers, to exact security for the protection of contingent interests, was very plainly recognized in Duval’s Appeal, 2 Wr., 112. The reasoning in that case is applicable to the pi'esent, because the mischief is as great to creditors as it there was to remainder-men. The administration account was filed and audited within the year following the testator’s death. The formal notice by advertisement was, therefore, in advance of the time at which parties interested in the estate would fairly be held bound to look for it, and before laches could begin to be imputed to them. The party most benefited by an early distribution of the estate was the petitioner, and he not only acquiesced in the prompt action of the accountants, but asked for an order of payment. Under these facts, and following what was said in Palmer’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Leg.%20Int.%20240" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Leg. Int. 240">40 Leg.

No Act of Assembly requires such bond. The only Act touching the subject is that of February 24th, 1884, (P. L. 81), by which refunding bonds are only required in the following cases, viz., section 41, where distribution is to be made after presentation of a statement, and without the filing of an account. This is evident also from §§ 38, 39 and 40. The wording of these sections shows that no account is contemplated when such distribution is made, for the known debts are only estimated. In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Snyder, 12 P. F. S., 153, it is held that such distribution is not predicated of a partial or final account. By § 45, a refunding bond is required before distribution of the proceeds of the sale of real estate in partition. By § 52, before execution on a suit for a legacy in the Common Pleas. This also is before account filed, as is evident from §§ 50, 51 and 53. By § 61, where a legacy is charged on real estate, and the legatee desires payment. This also is before account filed, <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>as is evident from §§ 58, 59 and 60.

    <p class="summary" id="b403-4" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[111,504,1181,693]]]'>In the present caso the adjudication and distribution are not made under that Act, but under the Acts of 1882 and 1840. Purd. 445-6, pi. 198-200, which Acts do not require refunding-bonds. The Act of 13th April, 1859, P. L. 604, is not in point, for it only requires a refunding bond to be given where the executor, administrator or guardian, whose account is to be audited, is himself required by law to give a refunding bond. And no distinction is drawn in such cases between “ creditors, heirs, legatees or ward.” In Moorhead’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20Pitts%20L.J.%20291" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 Pitts L.J. 291">29 Pitts., L. J. 291</a> (S. C., 1 Chest. Co. Rep., 435), the precise point is decided, and Hawkins, P. J., concludes that “Where an account embracing personal estate lias been regularly filed in the Register’s office, and advertised, and distribution lias been made by the Orphans’ Court in due course of audit, the distributees cannot be compelled to give refunding bonds for the shares appropriated to them respectively.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[115,1194,1176,174]]]'>The same conclusion is reached in Clarlc’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Kulp%2082" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Kulp 82">1 Kulp, 82</a>.

It will bo noticed that there are no known creditors. It is only possible claimants that are to be protected. If there were such creditors, they should Lave appeared and claimed at the audit. Kittera’s Appeal, 5 Har., 422; Dundas’ Appeal, 23 P. F. S., 4T4; Hammett’s Appeal, 2 Nor., 392; Otterson <em>v. </em>Gallagher, 7 Nor., 857; Lex’s Appeal, 1 Out., 292, and other cases similar in principle, hold that the Orphans’ Court has full and complete jurisdiction in the distribution of the estates of decedents; and that creditors, as well as heirs, devisees, and legatees who fail to claim, are forever barred as to the fund for distribution. This being so, appellee would have been fully protected had it made payment. The Orphans’ Court is a court of statutory jurisdiction, and for all that it does must have a statutory power to support it: Franks <em>v. </em>Groff, 14 S. &amp; R., 181; Weyand <em>v. </em>Weller, <a href="/pa/39/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="39 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="996311" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0443-01">39 Penn.

The Commissioners found them provided for in cases of intestacy-by the Act of 1794, and in cases of legacies by the Act of March 21st, 1772, 1 Smith’s Laws, 384. There only remained unprovided for a single ease, where an executor’s account shows a surplus to be distributed under the intestate laws. Accordingly, having followed the former Act in section 41, and the latter in section 52, Purd. Dig., p. 449, pi. 217, a new section (47) was recommended and passed, providing for the only other possible case. The separation of the refunding bond provisions resulted from tlie revisers following the old intestate Act in section 41; <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>while sections 47 and 52 refer to section 41, as requiring security generally “in cases of distribution by administrators,” or “with respect to distributive shares.” Again, section 57 of the Act of 1834, provides: “ Executors and administrators making distribution, or paying or delivering any legacies as aforesaid, shall not be liable for the assets so paid or distributed, .....where security' shall be taken as is hereinbefore provided.” This reduced all the provisions of the Act to consistency. It was new, but as the revisers said: “It was in conformity'with the general understanding upon the subject.” Not a word have they to say as to any difference before account filed, or after account filed, about statements, enforced or voluntary' distribution. They' designed merely to make a more definite and complete enactment of the old law.</p>

We could not have been compelled to file our account until March 1st, 1885.. We did, in fact, file our account on May 31st, 1884, in order to accommodate the distributee who now objects to securing us against possible creditors who have twelve months in which to present their claims. In Moorhead’s Estate, 1 Chest. Co. Rep., 435, relied on by appellant, a period of over a year had elapsed since the grant of administration. Mr. Justice Trtjnkey, in his elaborate opinion in Jones’ Appeal, 3 Out., 124, said: “Whenever the question has arisen in this state it has been ruled that the payment of assets to distributees under the intestate laws without taking security to refund as prescribed by statute, is so contrary to the duty of administrators as to render them personally liable to creditors to the extent of such payments. Their liability' under these circumstances is fixed by the plain terms of the statute. The security required is specially for the protection of creditors whose claims are unknown by the administrators; and before they were authorized to take such security there was no mode by which they could distribute to heirs, and relieve themselves of liability to such creditors. It is unnecessary to consider whether the confirmation of the account was an adjudication of the distribution. Conceding that it was, the decree must be interpreted in the light of the statute. There is no conflict, no inconsistency between the statute and the decree. Had the administratrix taken security, approved by the court, her liability would have ceased. She paid without security, and it was at her own risk. It would be absurd to infer from anything in the account and its confirmation, that the court directed the money to be paid without security and in violation of law. If the meaning of the decree were doubt<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>ful, which it is not, it should be understood in the sense which is lawful, not that which is wholly outside the power of the court. The decree merely directed the distribution; the law de.elared the terms upon which the distributees were entitled to receive the money, and the administratrix could pay it without risk.”</p>
