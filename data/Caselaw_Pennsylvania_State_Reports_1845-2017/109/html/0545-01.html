Fitzpatrick was to furnish the land and about forty thousand dollars ; and what was necessary to complete and furnish the buildings, upon the plans and estimates agreed upon, was to be supplied by Pardee, Markle &amp; Grier, who were to take judgments from Fitzpatrick (in whose name the title was to remain) upon the whole property and plant, and to look exclusively to that property and plant for payment. Fitzpatrick paid in his forty thousand dollars, the building was erected upon his land, and the bank advanced the requisite difference, taking judgment notes for the amount thereof, upon that understanding. That, subsequently, in 1876, after the completion of the hotel, Mr. Grier asked Fitzpatrick to give his notes with indorsement for the amount so advanced, and for which the firm already held his judgment notes, in order, as he explained, that the transaction might look more regular upon the books of the bank. Col. Fitzpatrick expressed his willingness to put his own notes in- the bank, but refused to give such notes with indorsements. That shortly after this Mr. Grier came to the said hotel and •brought with him Thomas John, the decedent, who knew .nothing of the transaction or condition of affairs between Fitzpatrick and Pardee, Markle &amp; Grier, except as they were subsequently stated to him by Mr. Grier. That Mr. Grier then stated the foregoing facts to Mr. John, produced the promissory note ready for signature, and asked John to sign it, telling him that it was only a form, that he, John, would not be <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>liable on it, and that the firm looked only to Fitzpatrick, who had already received the money.

Now, the question arises, whether that evidence is such as would warrant the inference that the note had been paid. Payment is a question of law. It results as conclusion of law from certain facts. A witness may testify _to facts from which, if they warrant it, a conclusion of law arises that the debt has been paid, but we think no such conclusion arises from the testimony in this case. James Fitzpatrick was in<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>clovser of a note. The fact that he gave judgment, if he did give judgment, would not be a discharge in itself of the maker; because the holder of the note might sue both the maker and indorser, obtain judgment against both of them, and until he had satisfaction of his debt neither would be discharged. Hence mere testimony that the indorser had given a judgment would not discharge the maker, Thomas John, from his obligation <em>to </em>pay the note. He states further he paid it by judgments and property; this as we regard it, is testimony of a legal conclusion, and. not as to matter of fact.” (Tenth assignment of error.)</p>
