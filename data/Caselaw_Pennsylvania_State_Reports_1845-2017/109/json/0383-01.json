    "head_matter": "Simpson\u2019s Appeal.\n1. A distributee of a decedent\u2019s estate, to whom a balanec in the hands of the administrator was awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court on the adjudication oE an account tiled within one year from the grant of letters of administration, is not entitled to payment of such award without giving a refunding bond.\n2. The fact that such distributee is a trustee does not relieve him from the obligation of giving'a refunding bond.\nMarch 25th, 1885.\nBefore Mercur, C. J.. Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett and Clark, JJ. Green J., absent.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia county : Of January Term 1885, No. 168.\nThis was the appeal of Alexander Simpson, Jr., trustee, from a decree of said court refusing to compel payment to him by tlie Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company, administrator of the' estate of John G. Pusey, deceased, of the sum awarded to him, as trustee, in the adjudication on the account of said administrator, and decree of distribution thereon.\nThe petition of Alexander Simpson, Jr., trustee, set forth the following facts :\u2014\nJohn G. Pusey died January 17th, 1884. Letters of administration were duly granted to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, who filed their account, which embraced personal estate only, and which, after proper advertisement was on July 8th and lltli, 1884, audited. On July 17th, 1884, an adjudication was filed wherein after the payment of all debts, etc., the balance of $1,686.91 in cash, and $122.50 in furniture, was awarded to a trustee to be appointed for Mrs. Sarah H. Pusey, widow of decedent.\nOn July 19th, 1884, tlie Orphans\u2019 Court appointed the petitioner as such trustee, to receive the balance of said estate, and without giving security in accordance with the terms of a family settlement.\nSaid adjudication has been confirmed absolutely, but said administrators have refused to pay tlie award unless the petitioner will give to them a refunding bond, which he has declined to do because be believes that no such requirement is necessary under the circumstances aforesaid.\nThe petitioner averred that no further debts are known to exist and prayed for a citation, &c.\nThe answer of tlie administrator admitted the truth of tlie facts stated in the petition.\nThe court, after argument, sustained the demand of the administrator for a refunding bond, in the following opinion :\u2014\nThe authority of the Orphans\u2019 Court upon equitable principles, and irrespective of its statutory powers, to exact security for the protection of contingent interests, was very plainly recognized in Duval\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wr., 112. The reasoning in that case is applicable to the pi'esent, because the mischief is as great to creditors as it there was to remainder-men. The administration account was filed and audited within the year following the testator\u2019s death. The formal notice by advertisement was, therefore, in advance of the time at which parties interested in the estate would fairly be held bound to look for it, and before laches could begin to be imputed to them. The party most benefited by an early distribution of the estate was the petitioner, and he not only acquiesced in the prompt action of the accountants, but asked for an order of payment. Under these facts, and following what was said in Palmer\u2019s Estate, 40 Leg. Int., 240, we are justified in ordering security against the demands of future claimants to the fund. The petition is accordingly granted subject to that condition, and the bond of the petitioner and the cestui que trust is now approved as such security.\nThe petitioner took this appeal, assigning for error the refusal of the court to compel payment of the award without a refunding bond.\nJ. Alex. Simpson, for the appellant.\nWe contend that distributees are not required to give refunding bonds, where there lias been a decree of distribution of personalty on an account filed, after due advertisement. No Act of Assembly requires such bond. The only Act touching the subject is that of February 24th, 1884, (P. L. 81), by which refunding bonds are only required in the following cases, viz., section 41, where distribution is to be made after presentation of a statement, and without the filing of an account. This is evident also from \u00a7\u00a7 38, 39 and 40. The wording of these sections shows that no account is contemplated when such distribution is made, for the known debts are only estimated. In Commonwealth v. Snyder, 12 P. F. S., 153, it is held that such distribution is not predicated of a partial or final account. By \u00a7 45, a refunding bond is required before distribution of the proceeds of the sale of real estate in partition. By \u00a7 52, before execution on a suit for a legacy in the Common Pleas. This also is before account filed, as is evident from \u00a7\u00a7 50, 51 and 53. By \u00a7 61, where a legacy is charged on real estate, and the legatee desires payment. This also is before account filed, as is evident from \u00a7\u00a7 58, 59 and 60. These are the only sections on the subject, and none of them touch the present case.\nIn the present caso the adjudication and distribution are not made under that Act, but under the Acts of 1882 and 1840. Purd. 445-6, pi. 198-200, which Acts do not require refunding-bonds. The Act of 13th April, 1859, P. L. 604, is not in point, for it only requires a refunding bond to be given where the executor, administrator or guardian, whose account is to be audited, is himself required by law to give a refunding bond. And no distinction is drawn in such cases between \u201c creditors, heirs, legatees or ward.\u201d In Moorhead\u2019s Estate, 29 Pitts., L. J. 291 (S. C., 1 Chest. Co. Rep., 435), the precise point is decided, and Hawkins, P. J., concludes that \u201cWhere an account embracing personal estate lias been regularly filed in the Register\u2019s office, and advertised, and distribution lias been made by the Orphans\u2019 Court in due course of audit, the distributees cannot be compelled to give refunding bonds for the shares appropriated to them respectively.\u201d\nThe same conclusion is reached in Clarlc\u2019s Estate, 1 Kulp, 82. Indeed the court below, in their opinion, seem to have conceded that tlie appellee\u2019s demand for a refunding bond bad no authority in express statute.\nIn the absence of statutory authority, is the Orphans\u2019 Court justified in ordering security against the demands of future claimants to the fund ? It will bo noticed that there are no known creditors. It is only possible claimants that are to be protected. If there were such creditors, they should Lave appeared and claimed at the audit. Kittera\u2019s Appeal, 5 Har., 422; Dundas\u2019 Appeal, 23 P. F. S., 4T4; Hammett\u2019s Appeal, 2 Nor., 392; Otterson v. Gallagher, 7 Nor., 857; Lex\u2019s Appeal, 1 Out., 292, and other cases similar in principle, hold that the Orphans\u2019 Court has full and complete jurisdiction in the distribution of the estates of decedents; and that creditors, as well as heirs, devisees, and legatees who fail to claim, are forever barred as to the fund for distribution. This being so, appellee would have been fully protected had it made payment. The Orphans\u2019 Court is a court of statutory jurisdiction, and for all that it does must have a statutory power to support it: Franks v. Groff, 14 S. & R., 181; Weyand v. Weller, 39 Penn. St., 443.\nDuval\u2019s Appeal 2 Wr., 112, relied on by the court below, is essentially different from this. The property there consisted of real estate devised to A. for life with remainder over; it was sold by order of court for payment of debts, and after the payment thereof a balance remained for distribution. Security was ordered, not to protect possible creditors of the decedent, but to protect the corpus for the remaindermen. Authority for this was found in \u00a7 49 of the Act of 24th February, 1834, P. L., 83.\nJohn Marshall Crest, ( William P. Crest with him,) for the appellees.\nThe argument of the appellant is based upon the assumption that the case is ruled entirely by the Act of February 24th, 1834. It is impossible to understand this Act without a reference to prior legislation. The foundation of the provisions of our law relating to refunding bonds was laid by the English Statute of Distributions, 22 and 23 Car. 2, c. 10, \u00a7 8, in which it is provided; \u201c To the end that a due regard be had to creditors, that no such distribution of the goods of any person dying intestate be made till after one year be fully expired after the intestate\u2019s death, and that such and every one to whom any distribution and share shall be allotted, shall give bond with sufficient sureties in the said courts, that if any debt or debts truly owing by the intestate shall be after-wards sued for and recovered or otherwise duly made to appear, that then and in every such case he or she shall, respectively, refund, and pay back to the administrator his or her ratable part of that debt or debts, and of the costs of suit and charges of the administrator by reason of such debt, out of the part and share so as aforesaid allotted to him or her, thereby to enable the said administrator to pay and satisfy the debt or debts so discovered after the distribution made as aforesaid.\u201d\nThe first Act passed in this province was the Act of 1693 : Duke of York\u2019s Book of Laws, p. 232; 1 Dallas Laws, Appendix, 33. This provided \u201cand every one to whom any shares shall be allotted, shall give bond, with sureties, to the said Register General that if debts afterwards be made to appear, he or she shall refund his or her ratable part thereof and of the executor\u2019s or administrator\u2019s charges accruing thereby.\u201d In 1697, this provision was re-enacted in the same words: Duke of York\u2019s Book of Laws, p. 266; 1 Dallas\u2019 Laws, Appendix, 34. So, also, in the Act of 1700: 1 Dallas\u2019 Laws, Appendix, 36. In 1705, the English Act of 22 & 23 Car. 2, c. 10, \u00a7 8, was adopted verbatim as above, the only change being that the \u201c Orphan\u2019s Court \u201d was designated as the proper place for entering the security: 3 Smith Laws, 157. 1 Dallas\u2019 Laws, App., 44 ; Hall & Seller\u2019s Laws, Ch. 21, p. 32.\nThe Act of April 19, 1794, \u00a7 15, 3 Smith Laws, 149, supplied these Acts as follows :\n\u201c To the end that a due regard be had to creditors, no administrators shall be compelled to make such distribution of the goods of any person dying intestate, until one year be fully expired after the intestate\u2019s death, and that each and every one to whom any distribution and share shall be allotted, shall give bond, with sufficient securites in the said Orphan\u2019s Court, that if any debt or debts truly owing by the intestate shall bo afterwards sued and recovered, or otherwise duly made to appear, that then, and in every such case, he or she shall respectively refund and pay to the administrator his or her ratable part of that debt or debts, and of the costs of suits and charges of tlie administrator by reason of such debts, out of the part and shares so as aforesaid allotted to him or her, and thereby to enable the said administrator to pay and satisfy the said debt or debts so discovered after the distribution made as aforesaid.\u201d\nThis has not been reprinted in JPurdon\u2019s Digest, hut we contend that the provisions of this section were not repealed, but reenacted, by the Act of February 24th, 1834, and are still in force.\nIt clearly appeal's from the report of the Commissioners to revise the Civil Code who prepared the Act, that the only modification they intended to make was to allow distributees to procure as security for their bond a mortgage on real estate, or else to authorize the investment of the fund by the court.\nUnder tlie old Act of 1794 the practice was settled and uniform. It was said in Swearingen v. Pendleton, 4 S. & II., 394, \u201c Tlie exhausting of tlie assets, even after the expiration of a year, in the payment of legacies or distributive shares in prejudice of a creditor without requiring refunding bonds of the legatees or distributees, would amount to a devastavit.\u201d And in Patterson v. Nicbol, 6 Watts, 382 \u201cthe avowed object of requiring a refunding bond to be given in both cases (legacies or distribution), was that creditox-s of the estate of either might be made secure in receiving payment of their claims which was not to be dispensed with in any caseLogan v. Richardson, 1 Barr, 372. In none of these cases, the latter two being decided after tlie passage of the Act of 1834, was it even hinted that the law was changed in this respect: Scott on the Intestate Law, 180.\nThe Act of 1884, plainly shows the intention to require refunding bonds in every case of distribution. The Commissioners found them provided for in cases of intestacy-by the Act of 1794, and in cases of legacies by the Act of March 21st, 1772, 1 Smith\u2019s Laws, 384. There only remained unprovided for a single ease, where an executor\u2019s account shows a surplus to be distributed under the intestate laws. Accordingly, having followed the former Act in section 41, and the latter in section 52, Purd. Dig., p. 449, pi. 217, a new section (47) was recommended and passed, providing for the only other possible case. The separation of the refunding bond provisions resulted from tlie revisers following the old intestate Act in section 41; while sections 47 and 52 refer to section 41, as requiring security generally \u201cin cases of distribution by administrators,\u201d or \u201cwith respect to distributive shares.\u201d Again, section 57 of the Act of 1834, provides: \u201c Executors and administrators making distribution, or paying or delivering any legacies as aforesaid, shall not be liable for the assets so paid or distributed, .....where security' shall be taken as is hereinbefore provided.\u201d This reduced all the provisions of the Act to consistency. It was new, but as the revisers said: \u201cIt was in conformity'with the general understanding upon the subject.\u201d Not a word have they to say as to any difference before account filed, or after account filed, about statements, enforced or voluntary' distribution. They' designed merely to make a more definite and complete enactment of the old law.\nEspecially do these considerations apply to a case where the account has been filed and distribution awarded before the statutory period of twelve months has elapsed from the granting of letters. We could not have been compelled to file our account until March 1st, 1885.. We did, in fact, file our account on May 31st, 1884, in order to accommodate the distributee who now objects to securing us against possible creditors who have twelve months in which to present their claims. In Moorhead\u2019s Estate, 1 Chest. Co. Rep., 435, relied on by appellant, a period of over a year had elapsed since the grant of administration. Mr. Justice Trtjnkey, in his elaborate opinion in Jones\u2019 Appeal, 3 Out., 124, said: \u201cWhenever the question has arisen in this state it has been ruled that the payment of assets to distributees under the intestate laws without taking security to refund as prescribed by statute, is so contrary to the duty of administrators as to render them personally liable to creditors to the extent of such payments. Their liability' under these circumstances is fixed by the plain terms of the statute. The security required is specially for the protection of creditors whose claims are unknown by the administrators; and before they were authorized to take such security there was no mode by which they could distribute to heirs, and relieve themselves of liability to such creditors. It is unnecessary to consider whether the confirmation of the account was an adjudication of the distribution. Conceding that it was, the decree must be interpreted in the light of the statute. There is no conflict, no inconsistency between the statute and the decree. Had the administratrix taken security, approved by the court, her liability would have ceased. She paid without security, and it was at her own risk. It would be absurd to infer from anything in the account and its confirmation, that the court directed the money to be paid without security and in violation of law. If the meaning of the decree were doubtful, which it is not, it should be understood in the sense which is lawful, not that which is wholly outside the power of the court. The decree merely directed the distribution; the law de.elared the terms upon which the distributees were entitled to receive the money, and the administratrix could pay it without risk.\u201d\nIndependently of express statute the Orphans\u2019 Court had. discretionary power to order a refunding bond.\nApril 6th, 1885."
