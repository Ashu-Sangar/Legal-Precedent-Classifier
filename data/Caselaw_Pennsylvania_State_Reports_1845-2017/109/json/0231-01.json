        "text": "Mr. Justice Gordon\ndelivered the opinion of the Court,\nOn the 11th of August, 1856, John Manderbach sold to the Lebanon Valley Railroad Company a perpetual right, for the use of the railroad only, to take water from a spring on his land, and for that purpose to lay a three-inch pipe from the railroad to said spring, either on the property of the grantor, or on that of John Sheetz, an adjoining land owner. After-' wards, on the 1st of September, 1859, Manderbach granted to Sheetz the right \u2019 to use the water from said spring by attaching, on his own land, a two-inch pipe to the railroad company\u2019s pipe, and for this privilege he agreed to pay the sum of five dollars a year for each house that he might thus supply with water.\nJohn Manderbach died intestate; the defendant below was appointed administrator of his estate, and he, said defendant, afterwards by purchase became possessed of the land upon which the spring above mentioned was situated, and in turn sold it to the Bethany Orphans\u2019 Home. As there were in this conveyance no reservations except such as related to a water right distinct from the rights above stated, the grantee, of course, took not only the land but all the appurtenances not reserved. But as rent issues out of land it is incident to the reversion, and the right to demand it necessarily attaches to the ownership. Hence, in Streaper v. Fisher, 1 Rawle, 154, a sheriff\u2019s sale of a lot of ground was held to pass also a rent charge. It is urged, however, that this is not in the nature of a rent, but is rather a personal right belonging to the estate of the grantor. But, in answer to this, it ma]\u2019 well be contended that the covenant to supply Sheetz\u2019s pipe was undoubtedly one running with the land; by it the land was made perpetually servient to this right, and the plaintiff took it subject to the burthen thus imposed upon it by the grantor. Nor do I see how the fact that the Sheetz pipe tapped that of the railroad company on lands not of said grantor can make any difference. The water nevertheless comes from the Manderbach property, and for a disturbance of it such as would interfere with Sheetz\u2019s rights an action would lie. Thus the servitude upon the land continues as it was when first created, and whether Sheetz was to be supplied with water through his own pipes or those of the railroad company can made no difference.\nIndeed, the right of Sheetz to use the railroad pipes makes them, so far as the use intended is concerned, as much his own as though he had laid them in place. Should the company abandon them, Sheetz is still entitled to their use, and he may at any time enter upon the servient land for the purpose of repairing or relaying the pipes. All this follows as incident to his grant, and his rights cannot be destroyed either by the neglect or abandonment of the railroad company.\nHere then, is a right charged upon the land of the plaintiff; a right to which his land is servient, and in consideration of which Sheetz is obliged to pay an annual compensation.\nThis compensation is, therefore, a profit issuing yearly out of lands; a rent, reditus to the landlord for their annual use, and as such it passed by the conveyance of H. H. Manderbach to the plaintiff.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

The railroad company laid the pipe across Ji.\u2019s land, which adjoined A.\u2019s and across A.\u2019s land to the spring.

A. died intestate and his administrator conveyed the land to O.

J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, and Clark JJ. Green J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Berks county: Of January Term 1885, No. 395.\nThis was a case stated, wherein the Bethany Orphans\u2019 Home was plaintiff and Henry H. Manderbaeh defendant.\nThe following facts were stated in the nature of a special 'verdict for the opinion of the court: On August 11th, 185(5, John Manderbaeh, who was seised of a tract of land in Berks county containing about sixty-nine acres, sold and convejmd to the Lebanon Valley Railroad Company, and their successors, the right and privilege to enter in or upon his land aforesaid, and lay a pipe from any point on the railroad, either on the property of the said railroad company or on the property of the said John Sheetz, to a certain spring on the said land of Manderbaeh or to some point in the outlet thereof, and conduct the water of the spring to the railroad. In 1859, Manderbaeh by deed duly executed and acknowledged,granted and conveyed \u201c unto the said John Sheetz, and to his heirs and assigns, out of the pipes which the water is now conveyed from the said spring to said Womelsdorf Railroad Station, a perpetual water right, to attach a two-inch water pipe to the said pipes, to convey the water through the said two-inch pipes to the dwelling house or houses now built, or which may be hereafter built, by himself, his heirs, or assigns, to attach hydrants to said water pipes laid by the said John Sheetz, to convey water to any dwelling house or houses now built or which may hereafter be built on the premises of the said John Sheetz. . A perpetual water right, as aforesaid, to be at the expense of the said John Sheetz, his heirs or assigns. In consideration whereof, the said John Sheetz, for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, doth covenant, promise and agree to and with the said John Manderbaeh, his heirs and assigns, by these presents, that he, the said John Sheetz, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, shall and will pay the sum of five dollars annually for each and every dwelling house or houses, now built or which may be built hereafter, as aforesaid, to which the water may be conveyed to such 'house or houses through a hydrant or sub-hydrant out of said water pipes perpetual, as aforesaid. And for the true performance of all and every the covenants and agreements, aforesaid, each of the said parties binds himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns in the penalty of fifty dollars lawful money of Pennsylvania firmly by these presents.\u201d\nJohn Sheetz upon the execution of this deed made the attachment, and lie and his assigns have since used the water in conformity therewith. John Manderbach died intestate in 1868, seised of the aforesaid tract of land. His administrator conveyed the said land to David Manderbach, who conveyed it to Henry H. Manderbach, the defendant. The administrator\u2019s deed to David _ Manderbach, conveyed the aforesaid \u201csixty-nine acres and twenty-eight perches, strict measure, together with all and singular the houses, out-houses, buildings, ways, waters, water-courses, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances, whatsoever thereunto belonging, or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions, remainders, rents, issues and profits thereof, and also all the right, title, interest, property, claim and demand whatever of the said John Manderbach, in his lifetime, at and immediately before the time of his decease, in law, equity or otherwise howsoever, of, in and to, or out of the same.\u201d The deed from David Manderbach to Henry H. Manderbach, conveyed the same sixty-nine acres and twenty-eight perches, together with the \u201c ways, waters, water-courses, rents, issues and profits,\u201d &c., as above fully recited.\nIn 1867, Henry H. Manderbach by deed conveyed to the Bethany Orphans\u2019 Home the plaintiff, 29 acres of the aforesaid tract of land. The deed for this portion, which contained the spring of water, contained the usual grant of \u201cwaters, water-courses, reversions, remainders, rents, issues, and profits \u201d &c. By a subsequent deed, defendant conveyed to plaintiff the remaining portion of the original tract of 69 acres, except a lot of about three acres, over which the pipe of the railroad company crosses.\nThe question submitted for the determination of the court was whether the said Bethany Orphans\u2019 Home, the plaintiff, is entitled to the five dollars annually due from the said John Sheetz, his heirs and assigns, for each dwelling house to which the water from said spring is conveyed, or not.\nThe court below (Hagknman, P. J.,) entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant thereupon took this writ of-error, assigning for error the entry of the judgment for the plaintiff.\nWilliam H. Livingood, for the plaintiff in error.\nManderbach granted to Sheetz only the water in the pipes of the railroad company. The right to use the water he had already granted for a valuable consideration to the railroad company. To it therefore belonged both the pipe and the easement. In conveying the water, the soil will not pass. Hence this covenant with Sheetz does not attach to the land itself and does not run with the title : Greenleaf\u2019s Cruise IV., p. 268 ; Spencer\u2019s 1 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, 133; Dark v. Johnston, 5 P. F. S., 164. Granting that the right in Sheetz was an easement, it was therefore indivisible. As the defendant is still seised of a portion of the original tract, the right to the compensation necessarily inheres in him.\nGeo. F. Baer (with him Jeff. Snyder), for defendant in error.\nCited Boyd v. McCombs, 4 Pa. St., 147; Tabor v. Bradley, 18 N. Y.\u2018, 111.\nOctober 5th, 1885."
