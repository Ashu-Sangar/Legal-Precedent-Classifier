The first important one of concern here is the Inheritance Tax Act of May 6,1887, P. L. 79, which for the first time designated the registers of wills as ágents of the Commonwealth in the collection of inheritance taxes. Section 16 of that Act provided: “The registers of wills of the several counties of this Commonwealth .. . shall be the agents of the commonwealth for the collection of the collateral inheritance tax; and for servicés rendered in collecting and paying over the same, the said agents shall be allowed to retain for their own use such percentage as may be allowed by the Auditor General, not exceeding five per centum on all taxes <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>paid and accounted for”. This Act made the Eegister of Wills an agent for the Commonwealth and allowed him compensation as such agent. It was decided by . this •Court that such designation as agent and the allowance of compensation in that capacity does not contravene the provisions of the Constitution, (Article XIV, Section 5) and to the extent it was inconsistent with the Act of March 31, 1876, P. L. 13, it repealed that Act: <em>Allegheny County v.

L; 521, is the basis for the present collection of inheritance, taxes, both collateral and direct. Section 21 of this Act, as amended by the Act of June 4, 1937, P. L. 1597, fixes the amount of commission which the Eegister of Wills may retain out of inheritance taxes collected as. agent of the Commonwealth, as ■■follows: “Section 21.. The registers of wills, upon their filing with the Department of Eevenue the bond hereinafter required, shall be the agents of the Commonwealth for the collection of the said tax in the case of resident decedents. For services rendered in collecting and paying over , the same, they shall be allowed to retain for their own use, upon the gross amount collected during any year, five per centum'upon ,the tax collected, if such tax shall amount to a sum of fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars or less; three per centum on the amounts collected in. excess of fifty thousand ($50,-000) dollars and not exceeding one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars; one per centum on the amounts collected in excess of one hundred thousand ($100,000) dollars and not over two hundred thousand: ($200,000) dollars; and one-half of one per centum on the amounts collected in excess of two hundred thousand ($200,000) dollars and not over one million ($1,000,000) dollars; and one-quárter of one per centum on the amounts collected in excess of one million ($1,000,000) dollars:.

    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[224,391,1153,1459]]]'>It is too plain for words that this section of the Act puts a- ceiling , on registers and limits compensation to not more than $10,000 per year. The intention of the legislature to limit the compensation is manifest, and of course all that remained of the collection, after the compensation was paid was the property, of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is clearly1 entitled to recover from' defendant the $28,131.81-excess commissions retained by him, under the first item. The schedule in Section 21 shows defendant would have to collect $1,400,000 a year to; earn compensation of $10,000 per year, and ;that his rate of compensation for the last $400,000 collected would be one-fourth of one percent. For collections above $1,400,000 — no compensation is allowed. The County contends that defendant-should retain one-fourth of one percent on all collections over $1,400,000. Such an interpretation would- completely dtestroy the very spirit of the Act, and the decisive intention of the legislature to limit the compensation paid to $10,000 in any one year. Since we have concluded that defendant is not entitled to any fees in excess of $10,000 per year,-and since it has already been decided that the fees received by-an agent for. collecting the inheritance tax belong to. the agent and not to the County <em>(Allegheny County v. Stengel, </em>supra). it. follows that there are no fees or compensation, which-should be paid to the County-.</p>

The amendatory :act of 1937 here-involved-provided in, plain language, “That the registers -of wills shall, not retain any amount for théir own use for the collection of taxes under said acts as agents for. the Commonwealth.” The commissions withheld on such, collections clearly b.elong <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>to the State. Since defendant has withheld, pending judicial determination, $19,765.68, on collateral inheritance tax thus collected, and $28,431.81 commissions on collections in excess of $1,400,000 or a total of $48,-197.49 in excess of compensation allowed him by law, it follows from what has been said that the Commonwealth is entitled to that money.</p>

There is no statute, which was in force when defendant was in office, which allows such deduction. It was not until the Act of 1943, P. L. 369, that such a deduction was allowed. Prior to the Act of 1943 there were several acts which permitted deductions of “necessary expenses” or “reasonable fees and expenses” but the Attorney General had ruled (See Formal opinion of Attorney General, No. 474) that “Before May 21,1943, the premiums on surety bonds of Registers of Wills or agents for the collection of inheritance taxes had to be paid by the Registers of Wills, and might not be paid from inheritance tax collections”. This was because the register was not the agent of the State until his bond was filed, and the cost therefor was not a cost of collection. This had been the practice throughout the State, the registers furnishing and paying for their bonds, and it was not until the Act of 1943 that it was provided that “the payment of the cost of registers bonds to the Commonwealth shall be paid out of taxes in the hands of the registers.” The statutory construction Act of 1937, P. L. 1019, provides in Section 56 that “No law shall be construed to be retroactive unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the legislature”. There is no reason to suppose that the legislature intended the Act of 1943 to be retroactive, the contrary is the better sup<a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>position, and. therefore we cannot make it so. We are forced to conclude that prior to 1943, there was ■ no statutory authority for the deductions by registers of wills of bond premiums and that the Act of 1943 is not retroactive. Therefore defendant is not justified in withholding the sum of $4,222.21 representing the cost of his bond premiums, and the Commonwealth is entitled to receive the same.</p>
