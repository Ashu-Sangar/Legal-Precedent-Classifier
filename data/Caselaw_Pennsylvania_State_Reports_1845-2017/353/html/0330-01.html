On March 22, 1932, he concluded that the bank should be liquidated. On May 31, 1934, the Secretary, having determined that the bank’s assets were insufficient to pay creditors in full, made a 100% assessment against the stockholders, in accordance Avith the Department of Banking Code of <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>1933, P.

Notices were sent to the stockholders. The regularity of such later notices is conceded. A suit in assumpsit was then instituted against defendant on January 28, 1944, to collect such 1943 assessment. An affidavit of defense was filed and issue joined. After the trial in the court below, the jury was directed to render a verdict for defendant. Motions for new trial and for judgment for the plaintiff n. o. v. were dismissed by the court.</p>

Section 723 of the Department of Banking Code, 71 PS section 733-723, provides as follows: “A. If at any time after he takes possession of a corporation as receiver, it shall appear to the secretary that the assets of such corporation will be insufficient to pay in full its debts to depositors and other creditors, he shall, as soon as expedient, estimate the amount which shall be assessed against all shareholders who are, under these circumstances, personally liable for any part of the debts of such corporation, by reason of their ownership of such shares. He shall assess against such shareholders the amount which he then deems necessary for the payment of such debts, not however exceeding the maximum liability of such shareholders, as provided by law. The secretary shall send to every such shareholder by registered mail to the address which appears on the records of the corporation, or if none appears there, then to his last known address, a demand that the amount assessed against him be paid. Such demand shall state the total amount assessed by the secretary against all the shareholders, and the specific amount to be paid by the particular shareholder. It shall also designate a period within which such assessment shall be paid, such period to be not less than thirty days after the date of the sending of the notice. If any shareholders shall not pay the amount assessed against them, the secretary may institute actions at law or in equity against them, either severally or jointly, for the amount of such assessment, together with interest from the date designated in the notice from the secretary, for the payment of such assessment. In such action, the written statement of the secretary, signed by him in his official capacity as receiver and bearing the seal of the department, asserting <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>that the assets of the corporation appear insufficient to meet its liabilities to depositors and other creditors, that consequently he has made an assessment against the shareholder or shareholders being sued, that the period designated for the payment of the assessment has expired, and that the value of the assets of the corporation and the liabilities of such corporations are as set forth, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. B. The secretary may make as many partial assessments as shall appear expedient, until the total liability of the shareholders, or the total amount necessary to pay in full the depositors and other creditors of the corporation, has been assessed.”</p>

Neither does Schedule B disclose whether payments were made by stockholders under the 1934 assessment or under the 1943 assessment. Suits under the 1943 assessments, with a prior valid assess^ ment outstanding, would result in untold confusion. It is apparent that in order to enforce the liability of the defendant stockholder it will be necessary to mail to him, in the manner prescribed in the Code, a proper legal notice of such assessment and demand of payment thereof. If notice and demand have not been given in the prescribed statutory manner, new and legal notice may still be given based on the 1934 assessment.</p>

(See any standard dictionary). When Section 723 of the Banking Code uses the phrase “He [the Secretary] shall assess against such shareholders the amount which he then deems necessary,” etc., it obviously uses “assess” in the first named sense. The Secretary’s “determination” does not become a legal levy until he makes a “demand that the amount assessed against” the shareholder “be paid” and designates within what period it shall be paid and sends a notice of this demand and time designation to the shareholder “by registered mail.” Until <em>all </em>this is done the Secretary’s power to make a levy is not exhausted or impaired. When the Secretary determines the amount which shall be assessed against the shareholders, his “determination” alone is a mere “brutum fulmen” which does not affect his authority to make later a 100% assessment because his compliance with all the statutory prescriptions as to demand and notice is necessary to make his assessment a jural act giving rise to rights and obligations/ It is the “demand” and “notice” which gives <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>tlie “assessment” its legal compulsion. The error in the reasoning of the court below is in its statements: “. . . the Banking Department on May 31, 1934 levied a one hundred per cent assessment . . .” and thereby its power to levy assessments against shareholders was “fully exercised.” The answer to this is: The Secretary “determined” in 1934 on such an assessment but never “levied” it, and therefore his power was <em>not </em>“fully exercised.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

A shareholder who received by registered mail the demand for payment which the statute prescribes as an essential of the liability of a shareholder of a closed bank would be discharging a legal obligation by paying the assessment. A shareholder who, like this appellee shareholder, received <em>no demand </em>in statutory form for the payment of the 1934 “determination” or “assessment”, <em>was under no obligation to pay anything </em>and, of course, the Secretary, in that state of the record, had <em>no right </em>to make him pay. As to <em>this defendant </em>no assessment <em>which carried with it any legal compulsion </em>was made against him <em>until </em>the 1944 assessment, <em>followed by due demand, </em>was made. Therefore, he (and any shareholder similarly situated) was and is in no position to complain that he was assessed <em>twice. </em>It is obvious that he was <em>not </em>assessed twice, for the simple reason that he never received the <em>demand </em>and <em>notice </em>by registered mail which section 723 of the Banking Code makes <em>exactly as essential </em>to a shareholder’s legal liability to <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>pay as it makes what it calls the “assessment of the amount which he [the Secretary] then deems necessary.” This “assessment” is obviously the Secretary’s computation or determination of the amount needed from the shareholder. <em>Before </em>the Secretary can proceed to <em>collect </em>from the shareholder, he must under the statute take a <em>second </em>equally important step, which is, as already pointed out, (1) make a formal demand on the shareholder for payment, (2) designate the period within which payment must be made, and (3) send to the shareholder a notice of this demand and period for payment, “by registered mail”.</p>

As the Secretary of Banking has about completed his liquidation of closed banks and has dispensed with the service of most of his legal staff, it will probably be. necessary for him, in order to begin new cases against these shareholders, to engage additional counsel.
