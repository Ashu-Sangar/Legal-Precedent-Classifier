In that year two petitions were filed in the Philadelphia Orphans’ Court for declaratory judgments, <em>Carwithen’s Estate, 28 </em>D. &amp; C. 66 and <em>Donovan’s Estate, </em>28 D. &amp; C. 93. The orphans’ court entertained the petitions, but was divided on the merits. The majority decided that the waiver permitted investment in common stocks. The minority regarded the purchase of common stock as an acquisition of <em>ownership </em>and not a <em>loan, </em>and therefore not an investment or security. On appeal to this Court the petitions were dismissed because they were not within the provisions of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of June 18, 1923, P. L. 840, as amended and supplemented.

In that case <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>Stephen Girard directed the funds be invested in “good securities”. There was no waiver of investment in legáis. The trustee purchased bank stock. This Court held the fiduciary was limited to legáis. In <em>Pray’s Appeals, </em>supra, authority was given the fiduciary to invest in securities of his own choosing. This Court held that the trustee’s investment in stock of an irregularly formed and insolvent manufacturing company owned by the trustee was not an investment with common prudence, skill and caution. Appellant also relies upon <em>Cope Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="351 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="462765" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0514-01">351 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20617" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="41 A.2d 617">41 A. 2d 617</a>. In that case there was a waiver of the restriction as to investment in legáis. The testator specified, however, what the investments should be. They were “investments in any interest paying securities”. We held that common stocks were not <em>“interest paying” </em>investments which were authorized by the will.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[217,1206,1150,1081]]]'>Appellant contends that because testator explained his object in exempting his trustees from investments in legáis was to. obtain “a higher rate of interest” than was possible in legáis, that this statement indicated that testator, as in <em>Cope Estate, </em>supra, intended to restrict investment to interest paying securities. Appellant has analyzed the wording of this lengthy will. He attempts to distinguish testator’s use of the words “income” and “interest”. It is also to be noted that the word “dividends” is frequently used. When the will defined the measure of care required of the trustees, it stated that it was such as was required of the corporate trustee over its own corporate funds, which it is agreed then included common stocks. The intent of the testator is to be gathered from the <em>whole </em>will and not from a few of the clauses in it: <em>Fletcher v.
