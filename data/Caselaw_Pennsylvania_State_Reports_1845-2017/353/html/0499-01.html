She maintains, however, that the <em>inter vivos </em>trust was invalid as such, and became testamentary, solely because settlor superimposed <em>a reservation of the right to withdraw principal. </em>So far as we are aware, no such distinction has been recognized in any reported case in this Commonwealth. Appellant, in her paper book suggests what she deems the law should be: “Settlors and trustees . . . may accomplish all that they may reasonably expect by an <em>inter vivos </em>deed of trust, if the law limits them to the reservation of the right to income and the right to revoke.” It is argued that the right to withdraw funds renders the trust a mere agency account, from which settlor could withdraw principal as conveniently as from a savings account.</p>

This author comments that “while the courts have been extremely liberal in construing instruments <em>inter vivos </em>to be valid deeds and not invalid attempted wills, it is believed that they should draw a line somewhere.” He recommends that the distinction should be recognized. He says “There does seem to be a real difference between taking the principal under the trust, without affecting its existence, and revoking the trust and thereafter consuming the capital sum.” It is stated that if it should be decided that these two processes are in legal effect the same, the remedy should be to change, by statute. Professor Scott in his Law of Trusts, Yol. 1, section 57.2, page 343, holds to the contrary. He says: “This distinction would seem to be rather finespun.” In footnote 10, it is stated: “To the effect that it is immaterial whether the settlor reserves a power to revoke the trust or power to require the trustee to transfer the trust property to him at his request, see Keck v.
