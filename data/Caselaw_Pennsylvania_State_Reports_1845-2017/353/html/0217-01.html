The controversial topic is the <em>revival </em>of a prior will by the revocation of a later will. Extensive discussions on the question appear in the decided cases, legal encyclopaedias and articles in law <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>magazines and reviews, including one by a recent member of tbe United States Supreme Court written when an active lawyer and law school professor. To the already difficult problem decedent has added another question which has never before been squarely raised and decided in Pennsylvania, viz: does a distinction exist between a later revoked will containing an <em>express </em>clause of revocation and one where the revocation is occasioned because of <em>inconsistent </em>provisions? It is upon this subsidiary question that the litigation hinges.</p>

L. 403, 20 PS section 181. He decided that under <em>Ford’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1126447" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0183-01">301 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20789" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="151 A. 789">151 A. 789</a>, the evidence clearly indicated that decedent did not intend to revive the earlier will. He decreed that probate of the earlier will should be set aside. A majority of the court in banc reversed in an opinion by President Judge Van Dusen. It was decided that because there was no <em>express clause </em>of revocation in the later-will the earlier will was revived. Judges Hunter and Sinkler dissented. This appeal followed.</p>

Decedent, a layman, in his late eighties, with a modest estate of |3500, was employed by, and had a desk in the office of, a highly respected member of the Philadelphia Bar. He was unmarried. His nearest of kin was a cousin. In a search for a will after the death, there was found in a locked drawer of his desk at the office, a mass of testamentary papers in decedent’s handwriting consisting of between 50 and 60 sheets. None of the papers bore his signature except a will of 1906 and a will of 1939 in which the signature had been cancelled. There was also a note addressed to his executor, but it contained no testamentary dispositions. These papers constitute decedent’s testamentary effort. The will of 1906 was the only paper susceptible of probate. It was probated.</p>

    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[221,630,1150,1078]]]'>A will is defined by Blackstone, Yol. II — *449 as “The legal declaration of a man’s intentions, which he wills to be performed after his death.” It has been declared that this definition stands unchallenged for its simplicity and accuracy: <em>McCune’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/265/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="265 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="1051924" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0523-01">265 Pa. 523</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20156" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="109 A. 156">109 A. 156</a>; <em>Gibson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/128/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="128 Pa.

In determining whether any particular testamentary writing constitutes a will, it must first be ascertained whether it is a <em>legal </em>expression of the decedent’s testamentary intentions. Thus, where a decedent had executed a probatable will, which he later revoked, and then had cancelled or revoked such revoking will, must the first will be accepted as the exclusive expression of the decedent’s testamentary wishes? Frequently it appeared that the first will had been lost, misplaced or forgotten, or in destroying or revoking the later revoking will, decedent really intended to die intestate. Whether circumstances or expressions indicative of such intent are admissible to establish that decedent did not intend to <em>revive </em>the first will is a troublesome question.</p>

The ecclesiastical courts decided that the revocation of the first will took effect <em>at the execution </em>of the second one, but that the first will might be <em>revived </em>if the evidence disclosed this to be the testator’s <em>intention. </em>The common-law courts, on the contrary, took the position that a revocation of a prior will was <em>ambulatory </em>and therefore did not take effect until the death of testator; if the revoking will itself was subsequently revoked the former will stood as if the later will had never been executed. Two statutes were enacted by the English Parliament: <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. 11 (1676), C. 3, section 6, providing that no written will should be revoked “but by writing”; and the Statute of Victoria, 7 Wm. IV &amp; 1 Vic. C. 26, section 20 and section 22, which provided that “No will . . . which shall be in any manner revoked, shall be revived, otherwise than by the re-execution thereof. ...” The English statutes settled the question in that country. Since the adoption of .the Statute of Victoria, in England, once a will is revoked it may not be revived except by a formal republication.</p>

An examination of the cases, text books and articles above noted convinces us that the conclusions reached in 28 Kentucky Law Journal, at page 229, et seq., explain the situation most accurately: “Due to hasty statements on the part of text-writers and ill-considered dicta on the part of courts there is much more confusion on this matter than is justified by the actual holdings of the courts. This confusion is due in no small part to the fact that decisions are so often affected by the various state <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>statutes and because different jurisdictions follow different rules.” And further, at page 233: “The question whether there is a distinction between a later will which revokes by express terms and one which revokes by implication, only, is inseparably connected with the proposition that express revocation is immediately effective. In many states this question is settled by statute. Although there are many dicta on the question only three states are generally conceded to distinguish between the two kinds of wills, and of these, only one has given ... an unequivocal decision in both respects.” The three states referred to by the writer are Texas, Michigan and Wisconsin. It is also interesting to note that this question was considered by the Hon. Roscoe Pound, a commissioner to the Supreme Court of Nebraska and later the Dean of the Harvard Law School, in <em>Williams v. Miles, </em><a href="/neb/68/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="68 Neb. 463" data-case-ids="2819224" data-case-paths="/neb/68/0463-01">68 Neb. 463</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20L.R.A.%20383" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="62 L.R.A. 383">62 L. R. A. 383</a>. Commissioner Pound recommended, and it was adopted by the Supreme Court of Nebraska: “. . . if the testator destroys a subsequent will revoking a former one either expressly or by implication, such act, of itself, will not operate to revive the former will. .. whether the former will is revived, depends upon his <em>intention which is to he deduced from all the </em>circumstances” (italics supplied).</p>

As noted above, the common-law theory was that a clause of revocation, like a dispositive provision, was ambulatory in nature and was therefore not effective until death. The ecclesiastical courts regarded the revocation as <em>immediate, </em>but held that testator’s intention <em>not </em>to revive could be shown. The few states which make this distinction regard the revocation by inconsistency as ambulatory. Logically there is no basis for such distinction. If a will is effectively revoked under any <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>of the terms of the Wills Act, the intention of the testator concerning the revival or non-revival of the prior will should he permitted to be shown. Apparently the first case in the United States to promulgate the distinction was <em>James v. Marvin, </em><a href="/conn/3/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Conn. 576" data-case-ids="6755830" data-case-paths="/conn/3/0576-01">3 Conn. 576</a>, but this case was subsequently overruled by <em>Whitehill v.

It is true that in the opinion in <em>Ford’s Estate </em>are quoted cases and text-book writers which make a distinction between express revocation and revocation resulting from later inconsistent provisions. This discussion is, of course, a <em>dictum, </em>as <em>Ford’s Estate </em>concerned a will in which there was an <em>express clause of revocation. </em>There is no difference <em>in principle </em>between a revocation by an <em>express clause </em>or by <em>inconsistent provisions. </em>If a testator bequeaths his estate to A, but subsequently concludes to give it to B, there is no fundamental difference in the expression of intention if testator says in the later will, “I revoke the bequest to A and give it to B”, or if he says, “I give all my estate to B.” In either instance testator has effectively revoked his former will in accordance with the provisions of the Wills Act. <em>McClure’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/309/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="309 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1141655" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0370-01">309 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=165%20A.%2024" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="165 A. 24">165 A. 24</a>, specifically ruled that an inconsistent will operates as a revocation of the former will. Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice) said (page 375): “A will which makes a complete disposition of all the property of the testator is clearly incompatible with the existence of any former will, and it must operate as a revocation of all wills previously executed (1 Jarman on Wills, page 333), or, as stated in Teacle’s Est., <a href="/pa/153/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="153 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="840262" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0219-01">153 Pa. 219</a>, ‘must operate as a revocation without express words to that effect.’ ”. We re-affirmed this principle, and cited <em>McClure’s Estate </em>with approval, in <em>Hartman’s Estate </em>(No. 1), <a href="/pa/320/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="320 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="1163644" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0321-01">320 Pa. 321</a>, 326, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20234" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="182 A. 234">182 A. 234</a>. Because a revocation is effectively accomplished either by an express clause of revocation or by inconsistent provisions, it <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>follows that in either case, proof of the revocation may be established by the production of the later written will with testator’s signature, duly cancelled, even though not susceptible of probate. It is not correct to state that proof of a revoked, unprobatable, <em>inconsistent </em>will is an extension of the doctrine of <em>Ford’s Estate. </em>It is merely <em>applying </em>the doctrine.</p>

She wrote a later will in 1779. Both wills were kept in the possession of a third person. At the death of testatrix the later will of 1779 was not found, although the will of 1775 remained intact. The contents of the will of 1779 were not proven and it was not established that it had revoked the former one. The syllabus concisely states: “The fact of the execution of a second will, not found at the decease of the testator, and the contents of which are not shown, is not, <em>ipso facto, </em>the revocation of a former one; to have that effect, its existence must be shown, at the death of the testator, or that he cancelled the latter will, with an intent to die intestate.” McKean, the Chief Justice, wrote (page 290) : “Here is a good <em>subsisting </em>Will properly attested: There is no way to defeat it, but by proving it was revoked by another will, <em>subsisting </em>at the death oí the Testatrix, <em>or that she cancelled the latter Will, so revoking all former ones, with a mind to die intestate” </em>(italics supplied). It will thus be noted that as early as 1792 this Court stated that upon proving that a later will revoked the former one, the earlier will was not revived <em>where the testator was shown to have an intent to die intestate.</em>

Where a second Will is made, containing an express clause of revocation, the preceding Will, though not formally cancelled, is revoked. 2d.

Morrison, 2 Dali. 286, that the destruction of a will which repealed or superseded a previous one, leaves the first as if the second had not existed, <em>unless it he clearly proved that the second was destroyed with a view to die intestate. </em>Such is the result whether the second contain a elapse of revocation or not; <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>for neither of them takes effect till the testator’s <em>death; </em>the revocation of the second restores the first to the footing on which it stood before the second existed; and the first necessarily, as well as naturally, takes effect at the death, <em>unless the testator had signified by some decisive act or declaration, at the time of the revocation, an intention to die intestate.” </em>(Italics supplied). The Chief Justice also said that testimony indicating testator’s intention to revive or not to revive the former will must relate to “the time of destruction” of the later will, otherwise it would be a parol revocation forbidden by statute (i. e. Wills Act of 1833). The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Coulter, J., affirmed the ruling of Chief Justice Gibson. Justice Coulter stated that if it was clearly proven that the testator, at the time he cancelled the posterior will, <em>intended to die intestate </em>(i. e. not to revive the earlier will) such evidence was admissible as part <em>of </em>the <em>res gestae. </em>He also stated that the <em>act of the ■preservation of the prior will </em>was evidence of intent to revive. But the Justice also said (page 90) that the prior will had been preserved by testator <em>“entire, and without intentional or apparent blemish”, </em>(Italics supplied.) which, as has been shown, is not the fact in the present case.</p>

This contention was rejected. Justice Schaffer pointed out that the revocation of the earlier will was established by a cancelled will signed by testator. While this will was not dispositive because of its mutilation, it nevertheless constituted “another writing” under the Wills Act.

It was revoked by writings admittedly signed by the testator, which writings so signed are produced. The court below says they are to be disregarded as writings to revoke the earlier will because as wills they could not be effective until he died, and neither for legal reasons was so effective. Dispositively this is so, but as ‘other writings’ which could be and were proved in the manner wills are, they were facts, which established that by solemn written declaration the decedent had wiped out the will of 1924. As against this we are asked to presume that when he tore and directed the further tearing of the pages of the 1927 will and thus revoked it, he intended to revive the one of 1924 when every circumstance in the record indicates that he did not.”</p>

      <em>Ford’s Estate </em>was decided on September 29, 1930. This Court construed the 20th Section of the Wills Act of 1917, supra, and held an unprobatable will, signed by a testator, was “another writing” within the Act. This decision, unless changed by the legislature, has the same effect as if written into the body of the statute.

It was overwhelmingly established that testator did <em>not </em>intend to revive the 1906 will. In addition to the completely different disposition in the will of 1939, testator wrote the words “Invalid” and “N. G-.” on the will of 1906 (then thirty-three years old); he wrote letters, produced in evidence, that he was engaged in preparing a new will; and together with the many other reasons recited by the hearing judge the intent <em>not </em>to revive appears most conclusively. It is clear that testator preserved the mass of writings merely as memoranda and guides to his future contemplated testamentary “masterpiece”, on which, according to his letter, he was then already engaged. As the hearing judge has stated, “The one circumstance in favor of the will of 1906 is its mere existence.” Testator’s intention will not be defeated by a groundless distinction between a later can-celled will containing an express clause of revocation and one making a completely inconsistent disposition. The earlier will in either case is <em>presumptively </em>revived.

He was a layman, and for 33 years was employed by and had a desk in the office of a member of the Philadelphia bar. In the drawer of this desk he constantly kept his will of 1906. It may properly be assumed that he had some knowledge of the law of wills, and purposely destroyed the will of 1939. He left an estate of $3,500. From all the facts and circumstances Burtt, the decedent, departed this life in the firm belief that he would die testate.

In the same drawer were found 50 or 60 pages of testamentary writings. Among these were six sheets of paper held together by a metal clip, constituting in part a cancelled will without a first page containing the usual formal directions and revocatory clause, executed some time in August, 1939. Decedent’s signature thereon, as well as those of the two witnesses, had been canceled by testator by pen strokes through the respective names. The date of cancellation does not appear. The majority <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>and minority opinions of the orphans’ court and the majority opinion of this Court concede that the will of 1906 was the only subsisting and probatable will. Numerous interlineations and cancellations appear thereon. Certain paragraphs had been crossed out, and in the handwriting of testator, at the top of the will, were written “Invalid” and “N. G.” On the outer cover of the will he wrote the word, “Invalid.” Unsigned marginal notations in testator’s handwriting explained the cancellation of various paragraphs of the will or portions thereof, e. g., where the beneficiary died there appeared the word “deceased”, and in the body of the will the name of such beneficiary was stricken out; the executor named in the will having died, a marginal notation appeared that another executor was to be appointed.</p>

A majority of the court <em>en bane </em>reversed the hearing judge and held, not as the majority opinion points out, “that because there was no <em>express clause </em>of revocation in the later will the earlier will was revived”, but, that the will of 1906 <em>had never been revoked </em>and was, therefore, properly admitted to probate as the last will and testament of Thomas Burtt.
