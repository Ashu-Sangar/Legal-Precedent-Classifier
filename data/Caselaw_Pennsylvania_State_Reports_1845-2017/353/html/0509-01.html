He willed the residue of his estate to his <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>nephew,' Glenn Decker, then about 26 years of age. The residuary clause of the will reads as follows: . . The said property, real and personal to be held in trust however, and the income therefrom to be turned over to Glenn Decker at periodic intervals. Said trust to continue until Glenn Decker reaches the age of forty years and at that time the said property is to be turned over to my said nephew, Glenn Decker, absolute.” He appointed A. Emerson Howell as Trustee for the proper execution of this bequest. Later, the Honesdale National Bank became the substitute Trustee.</p>

Super. 579" data-case-ids="884193" data-case-paths="/pa-super/41/0579-01">41 Pa. Superior Ct. 579</a> rules that question. There a testator provided legacies for his three grandchildren, but in a subsequent clause in his will, he directed that the legacies should be placed in trust as long as the father of the legatees lived, the income to be paid to the legatees, and upon the death of the father, the principal to be paid to them; no active duties were imposed upon the trustee. It was held that the trust was void and the legatees were entitled to the principal of the legacy, irrespective of the trust. In that case, the Superior Court said: “The will does not impose any express duty on the trustee nor direct in any way the manner in which the fund shall be held except as may be implied from the requirement that the income be paid over. No discretion is vested in the trustee, nor is authority given to expend any part of the principal or income. That a legacy, thus sepa<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>rated from the rest of the estate and given to a trustee for the use of the legatee without more is a vested bequest, we think is clear. The gift is absolute to the legatee, and no interest therein exists in any other person. In such a case a trust gives to the party beneficially interested a right to possession, control and disposal of the property, and the legal estate becomes executed in him except where it is necessary that it remain in the trustee to preserve it for the cestui que trust or to transmit it to others as directed. If the case were one of an active trust a legal estate would remain in the trustee to the end that he might discharge the duties imposed by the donor. But the clause under consideration does not create an active trust, as we have seen. The principle is well recognized that a passive trust does not continue the estate in the trustee except for such useful purposes as the law will protect, as in the case of a trust of a married woman to protect her estate from her husband, or a trust for a spendthrift to protect it from creditors. Where a gift is made to a person absolute in terms a provision postponing payment thereof is void in pursuance of the general rule that it is against public policy to restrain one in the use or control of property in which he alone is interested: Gray on Perpetuities, sec. 120; Shallcross’ Estate, <a href="/pa/200/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="200 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="924420" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0122-01">200 Pa. 122</a>.”</p>

This he did not do. The law of this Commonwealth treats a trust like the one before us exactly as if the testator had willed the property directly to the donee, making him the sole owner of it, by providing that the donee should receive the income, but should not use the principal until he attained a certain age. In such a situation the law is that the donee is entitled to the full enjoyment of the legacy at once. It is the policy of this Commonwealth, as declared in a <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>long line of decisions, to treat a legacy like the one now before us as an absolute gift to the donee, and that means, of course, that he has the right to the immediate possession of it upon demand.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This policy so long adhered to has become with us a rule of law affecting the devolution of property.
