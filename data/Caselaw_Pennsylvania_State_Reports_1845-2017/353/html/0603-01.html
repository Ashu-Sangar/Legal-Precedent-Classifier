Bullock was married in 1895 to Anna Hooley, and by ber had one child who predeceased him leaving no issue. In 1903 he left Philadelphia, where he had previously resided, and. went west; in. 1920 he established his domicile in- Elkhart County; Indiana, where he lived for the remainder of his life, a. period of nearly 24 years. ■. In 1907 he began a cohabitation with one Margaret Omlor which continued .until his death, and by her had-nine children; the last of whom was born in 1923 and-of whom seven survive; these seven, claiming the share of the income previously enjoyed by their father, are the present appellees. Their legitimacy depends primarily upon the validity of a divorce from his wife Anna which Bullock obtained in 1929 and which is the target of-the Skinner attack. Promptly after that divorce was granted Bullock married Margaret Omlor, and appellees claim they were legitimated by reason of that marriage.</p>

The Indiana law then in force (Act of March 13,1879, ch. 45; p. 124) provided that “If it sháll appear by the affidavit of a disinterested person that the defendant is not a resident of this State, the clerk shall give notice of the pendency of such petition by publication for three successive weeks in some weekly newspaper of general circulation, published in such county, . . . Provided; That the plaintiff shall, in case such notice is to be given by publication as aforesaid, before the same is given, file his or her affidavit with the clerk, stating therein the residence of the defendant, if such residence be known to the plaintiff, and if such residence be unknown to the plaintiff, such affidavit shall so state; .and in case such affidavit state the residence of the defendant, the clerk shall forward, by mail, to such defendant the numbér of the paper containing such notice, with the notice marked.” It is not contended that such a provision for notice by publication <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>runs afoul of the requirement of due process; our own Divorce Law of 1929, P. L. 1237, §29, provides for a three weeks’ publication if the respondent cannot be personally served (see also <em>Nixon v. Nixon, </em><a href="/pa/329/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="329 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1181467" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0256-01">329 Pa. 256</a>, 266, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%20154" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="198 A. 154">198 A. 154</a>, 160). But appellants assert-that the affidavit which Bullock filed, in pursuance of thelndiana statute, that his wife’s residence was unknown to him, was false and designed to prevent-hen from receiving actual notice of the proceedings: This contention involves a question of fact, and it is only fair to say that it would have been possible under the testimony for the auditing judge to have found that the affidavit was indeed false; however, the finding which he did make, after a careful and exhaustive analysis of all the evidence, was likewise justified, especially when it is borne in mind that the burden of proving the falsity of the . affidavit was upon those who asserted it. In any .event, the’ court in banc having sustained the auditing judge’s finding that Bullock did not know his wife’s address at the time he filed the affidavit and was not guilty of any fraud, wé must-accept that finding as cdnclusive: It is urged that the attorney who represented Bullock in certain warrant-of-seizure proceedings in the Municipal Court of Philadelphia which Bullock’s wife instituted in November, 1928, undoubtedly had definite knowledge «concerning her place of residence and that his knowledge should be imputed to Bullock, but the ordinary rule of agency to that effect is not applicable here where ■ the • question is one, not of constructive, but of actual knowledge on Bullock’s part. It is further urged that Bullock could readily have ascertained his wife’s address if he had made inquiry of his Philadelphia attorney, but, as the court below properly pointed out, the Indiana statute did not require the making of any investigation before filing the prescribed affidavit; in that connection it is interesting to noté that by an amendatory Act of March 14, 1929, ch. 177, p. 575 (enacted after Bullock’s divorce was granted) provision was made for alternative affidavits, either that the de<a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>fendant’s residence was unknown or that <em>upon diligent inquiry </em>it was unknown. An affidavit filed by Bullock’s Indiana attorney in the divorce proceedings that the defendant was not a resident of the State of Indiana is attacked on the ground that the attorney was not a “disinterested” person within the meaning of the statute; the court knew, however, that he was Bullock’s attorney and therefore its acceptance of his affidavit as satisfactory indicates a judicial construction of the act contrary to that urged by appellants; moveover, Bullock’s wife was not at any time a resident of Indiana and the affidavit was admittedly true. Objection is raised to the publication of the proceedings because made in a newspaper published in a small village of the county, but it is not suggested that such publication did not meet the statutory requirements. In short, notwithstanding the earnest efforts of appellants to find flaws, there is nothing of sufficient substance in their objections to invalidate the decree. While Bullock’s conduct toward his wife was extremely reprehensible and arouses a natural feeling of sympathy for her misfortunes, that fact has no bearing upon the present issue, which is not between Bullock and his divorced wife, both of whom are now deceased, but between appellants and Bullock’s innocent children contending for shares in the trust estate.</p>

Bullock’s wife, although she admittedly knew of the decree against her within a few days after it was rendered, made no attempt to avail herself of this statutory right, but in July, 1929, she filed a bill in equity against Bullock in the Municipal Court of <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>Philadelphia setting forth the fact of the decree, alleging that she had had no notice of the proceedings while they were pending, claiming that Bullock had deserted her and that she was entitled to support, and asserting that they had agreed through their respective counsel that a decree might be entered directing him to pay her $1,000 per annum for ten years out of the income from the trust estate. The Municipal Court entered a decree accordingly and those payments were subsequently made.. The Bullocks say that the settlement thus agreed upon was merely to make up for the support which Bullock had failed to furnish his wife prior to his obtaining the divorce; the Skinners, on the other hand, assert that the settlement and the decree entered thereon constituted a virtual admission by him that the divorce had not been validly obtained and was ineffective and void. But just as the failure of the wife to institute proceedings in Indiana to upset the decree within the two years after it had been granted could not, as against appellants, effect its validation if in fact it was void for want of jurisdiction over her, so the order for support entered in the Municipal Court could not invalidate the decree of divorce if in fact valid when rendered, and Bullock could not, by acquiescence in the support order, impair the rights of his children which had previously vested by reason of the decree of divorce and his subsequent marriage.</p>
