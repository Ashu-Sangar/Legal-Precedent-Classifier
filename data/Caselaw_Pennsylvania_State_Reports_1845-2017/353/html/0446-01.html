It has five plants in Allegheny County, the largest being the East Pittsburgh Works; it conducts also a research laboratory. In its manufacturing establishment it employs approximately 16,000 persons engaged in productive labor and plant maintenance; these are represented by the defendant union, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (CIO) Local 601. Another union, Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees, represents some 200 technicians and clerks employed in the research laboratory and upwards of 6,000 employes in the manufacturing plants, — mostly industrial engineers, draftsmen, salesmen, patent attorneys, cost accountants, clerks and stenographers. There is a third group of about 1,000 employes made up of the Company’s executive officers, supervisors and scientists ; this latter group is not represented by any labor union.</p>

Protracted negotiations to settle the <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>controversy proved abortive, and a strike began on January 15, 1946. Neither the Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees nor the third group of employes previously mentioned have any present dispute with the Company and are not on strike. The defendant Union immediately established and has since continuously maintained a picket line at each and every gate of the Company’s plants and the research laboratory. The Company filed a bill in equity for a preliminary injunction to restrain the officers and members of the defendant Union from interfering, by mass picketing, violence or intimidation, with employes of the Company engaged in the operation and maintenance of its plants, and from preventing persons, whether employes or others, from entering or leaving its plants and properties. The court below denied the motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the bill.</p>

Under such circumstances, if the record discloses a fundamental misconception of the controlling law, the ordinary rule that the granting or refusal of a preliminary injunction is within the reasonable discretion of the court of first instance becomes inapplicable: <em>Casinghead Gas Co. v.

In Pennsylvania the Labor Anti-Injunction Act of June 2, 1937, P. L. 1198, prescribed that such injunctions should issue only when certain <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>conditions existed and certain requirements were met; for example, the court must find that the public authorities were unable to furnish adequate protection to the complainant’s property; also, the complainant must have made every reasonable effort to settle the labor dispute. Plaintiff admits that in this instance not all the conditions stipulated by that act exist nor have the necessary findings been made by the court, and therefore, if that statute controls, it is not entitled to an injunction; (cf. <em>DeWilde v. Scranton Building Trades &amp; Construction </em>Council, <a href="/pa/343/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="343 Pa. 224" data-case-ids="1208366" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0224-01">343 Pa. 224</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20897" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="22 A.2d 897">22 A. 2d 897</a>). Plaintiff relies, however, upon the amendatory Act of June 9, 1939, P. L. 302, which provides that the 1937 act should not apply in any case “Where in the course of a labor dispute ... an employe, or employes acting in concert, or a labor organization, or the members, officers, agents, or representatives of a labor organization or anyone acting for such organization, seize, hold, damage, or destroy the plant, equipment, machinery, or other property of the employer with the intention of compelling the employer to accede to any demands, conditions, or terms of employment, or for collective bargaining.” Plaintiff contends that the acts of defendants, as established by the testimony, amount to a seizure and holding of its plants and properties, that therefore the restrictions imposed by the Act of 1937 do not apply, and that the picketing is illegal and should be enjoined.</p>

None of the officers, agents or members of the defendant Union, except those who are continuing their employment in the plants in order to protect and maintain them, has actually entered any of the Company’s properties or laid a hand upon any equipment, machinery or other property therein contained. There has been no “sit-down” strike in the sense that any members of the Union have barricaded themselves within any of the plaintiff’s buildings or established themselves there in possession and occupation. But, when the ¡strike was in contemplation and before <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>it liad actually started, a number of meetings were held between officers of the defendant Union and representatives of the plaintiff corporation in the course of which the former requested the latter to prepare a list of persons who might be deemed necessary to protect the Company’s plants, defendants being willing, because of their interests as well as that of the Company, to safeguard the physical maintenance of the machinery and equipment. However, as an official of the Company who was present at these meetings testified, they “made it quite clear that anyone not agreed to on the list would not get admittance through the picket line . . . they would not be admitted to the plant unless their name was on a list in the Union office.” And, as another such official testified: “In reference to the lists we were informed that they would have to be the very minimum number of employes to have consideration by the Union, that it was to include no person who would pursue any productive work, that it had to do only with plant protection.” In response to a question as to how defendants intended to conduct the strike and whether they intended to let into the plant those people who were not on strike “their reply was to the effect that people Avould be permitted to enter, but only on passes issued by the Union. . . . They stated it was their intention to permit nobody to enter the plant except those who had passes issued by the Union, and that it was their intention to picket the plant 24 hours a day”. A list was prepared by the Company which was carefully examined by the Union and a large number of the names rejected by it; it approved about 300 in number, two-thirds of whom belonged to its membership, and it issued passes on a weekly basis to those persons; later, when the case came on for hearing before the court, defendants agreed to add to the list 71 other names of employes who were not members of the Union and who, it was agreed, could be admitted on identification cards of the Company; still later, during the course of the hearings, an addi<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>tional 48 names were added to those of the persons whom the Union would permit to enter the plants.</p>

Thus, W. C. Bow-land, manager of one of the divisions of the East Pittsburgh Works, testified that when he sought admittance to that plant a “captain” of the pickets told him that “if I wanted to get in I would have to get a pass from the Union”. He then tried other entrances, but always the same statement was made to him and he was refused admittance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> John Wood, a foreman or supervisor, testified that he was denied admittance to this same plant by those picketing the entrance gates; a “lieutenant” of the pickets “produced a list . . . and found that we weren’t on it, and he said ‘Well, your name isn’t on the list’, and we said ‘What does that mean? Does that mean we don’t get in?’ and he said ‘You’ll have to go to the Union office for a pass’ ”, The same thing happened again later, this time both a “captain” and a “lieutenant” of the pickets telling him that he “would have to go to the Union office and receive a. pass from the Union”, and that otherwise the pickets would not allow him to enter. He also testified that a nurse from the Company’s medical department was likewise refused admittance because she did not have a Union pass. Another witness, G. M. Crawford, a patent <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>attorney employed by the company, testified that he was barred from entering the plant, the pickets saying that his name was not on the list and “they were under orders to admit no one except those on this list”. August Mayer, a maintenance supervisor, testified that a “captain” and a “lieutenant” refused him admittance; the “captain”, after looking at his list, said: “You aren’t on my list, so you can’t get in;” on another occasion this same experience was repeated, the “lieutenant” stating, after looking at his list: “I’m sorry, boys, your name isn’t on the list, you can’t get in ... Go to union headquarters and get a pass if you insist on going in.” M. Hetenyi, a research engineer, and Dr. Joseph Slepian, an associate director of research, both testified that they were denied admission to the research laboratory because a Union pass was demanded of them and they did not have any. J. A. Hutcheson, also an associate director in the research laboratory, and John F. Hooper, a staff supervisor, testified to a similar demand by the pickets, with the same unfavorable result.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

During the early days of the strike the number of pickets in the line at each entrance varied from as few as 8 or 10 to as many as 50, 75,100 or even 150; later, by the time of the hearings the number had been substantially reduced, but was always apparently subject to augmentation if those forbidden to enter attempted to do so. The pickets walked closely behind one another at each gate in a compact circle or elliptical formation and so near to the entrance <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>that it would have been impossible for anybody to edge in without running the gantlet thus established. In some instances employes seeking to enter were prevented from so doing by force and violence, in others, those who were more cautious resigned themselves to the inevitable and —reluctant to engage in a scuffle that might possibly lead to bloodshed — departed in peace. Without attempting to reproduce the great mass of testimony in detail it is sufficient to say that its cumulative effect is to establish beyond any doubt that the pickets of the defendant Union never intended to let any person enter any of the Company’s properties without their consent and that they enforced that intention and that policy by means of persuasion when such methods were sufficient, but also, when necessary, by intimidation and threatened violence. That there were thousands of employes ready to work is demonstrated by a letter which was offered in evidence,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> written, when the strike first started, by the President of the Association of Westinghouse Salaried Employees to an official of the plaintiff corporation, in which it was stated that they (the members of the Association) were willing and wanted to work and would report for that purpose unless forcibly prevented from doing so.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[237,1610,1150,649]],["BL_487.1",487,[192,282,1153,2079]],["BL_488.1",488,[247,267,1146,375]]]'>The question then arises: Do the facts thus established indicate a seizure and holding of the Company’s property by defendants within the meaning of those terms in the Act of 1939? We answer that question unhesitatingly in the affirmative. Defendants argue that at the time of the enactment of the 1939 amendment there had arisen an occasional practice on the part of strikers of taking possession of the employer’s factory by physical entry and occupation — the so-called “sit-down” strikes, — and that it was that kind of seizure and holding that the framers of the amendment had in contemplation. But, while the technique employed <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>in such strikes may have changed, it is obvious that the seizure of a plant may, from a realistic standpoint, be effected in ways other than by actual entry into the building itself. It certainly is not necessary in order to constitute a seizure and holding that each and every brick and stone, each and every room and floor, be physically grasped and possessed. If the owner be deprived of the use and enjoyment of the property so that it becomes utterly valueless to him it is effectively seized and held whether the force employed for that purpose be exerted within the building or immediately without. The control of the entrances is the control of the plant. Surely defendants would not deny that, if 5,10, 50 or 100 of their members stood directly <em>within </em>the gates and prevented the owners and their employes from entering, this would constitute a seizure of the property within the ordinary meaning of that word, and how is it less a seizure and a holding if the same number of persons, for the same purpose and with the same effect, stand immediately in front of the gates instead of behind them? Would defendants deny that, if they locked and bolted all the entrance doors and thereby prevented ingress and egress, such action would constitute a seizure and holding of the plant within the normal connotation of those terms and therefore within the meaning of the statute? But what difference is there between such a method of seizure and that of holding the gateways closed, not by mechanical devices, but by a chain of human beings stretched across those gateways and thereby even the more effectively preventing access to the property and its use by the rightful owner? And even if it were technically to be held that the force which accomplishes the seizure must be applied on the very premises of the employer, that technicality is satisfied when the pickets operate from positions in front of the gates, because ordinarily the title to property abutting on a public highway extends to the center of the highway, the sidewalk being for all intents and pur<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>poses a part of the owner’s premises subject only to the public’s easement of passage: <em>Duquesne Light Co. v.

Even the Act of 1937 in specifying the acts which could not be enjoined, was careful <em>not to countenance the use of violence </em>or any other kind of wu-peaceable methods to attain the ends for which employees went on a strike. For example, Sec. 6 of the Act declares that “no court . . . shall have . . . power in any case involving a labor dispute to issue any restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction which . . . restrains . . . any person . . . from doing, whether singly or in concert with others . . . any of the following <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>acts: (a) . . .

Justice Brandéis, in reviewing the questions which had been decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona in the case <em>then </em>before thé Supreme Court of the United States said that the Supreme Court of Arizona “made its decision on four controverted points of law”. After briefly referring to the first three of these “points”, which have no bearing on the instant case, he said: “The fourth question requiring decision was whether peaceful picketing should be deemed legal.

To keep defendants’ representatives out of the plaintiff’s plant by a show of force as was done in the instant case by defendants’ agents, (for example, by a “captain of pickets” and others) was an assumption of dominion over another person’s property and was, in legal effect, a lawless seizure of that property. It was as much a lawless seizure of another’s property as would a striking chauffeur’s forcible refusal to let his employer or the latter’s family enter the employer’s automobile. That the defendants claimed the right to control ingress to plaintiff’s plant and maintained that claim by hostile force, is completely proved. It was shown that at one gate “a chain of thirty or forty pickets was marching in a circle” directly in front of it. They excluded from the plant the Director of the Laboratory, and many other laboratory officials and employes. At another gate, 13 pickets and two of their “officers” blocked ingress. As another laboratory official attempted to enter the gate, the “captain of pickets” said to him: “You aren’t on our list so you can’t get it . . . The boys in the picket line will keep you out . . . Are you looking for trouble?” But even if the number of pickets “amounted to not more than a corporal’s guard” (as has been asserted) <em>that </em>would be wholly immaterial to the issue before us. If there was only <em>one </em>picket and if he succeeded in blocking ingress to the plant by a display of force, his act would be lawless and enjoinable.

He declared, in substance, that he found in the “Labor Act” of 1935 “no protection for unlawful activity.”</p>

Counsel for the complainant freely so conceded both in their brief and in their oral argument at bar. That those restrictions are. applicable continues to be my opinion as heretofore expressed: <em>Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp. v.

It is inconceivable to me that the legislature intended in the 1939 amendment to cast out entirely, with one fell swoop, the public policy as declared and effectuated by the Act of 1937. Yet, such is the result which this Court imputes to the <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>1939 amendment. Henceforth, it can be only a lawyer of less than average skill who will not be able to draw injunction affidavits that may be fitted to one or more of the situations described in the four lettered paragraphs of the 1939 amendment. And, so, the procedural requirements of the 1937 Act may now be obviated at any time in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute.</p>

It represented a considered and matured opinion, produced by the debates, discussions and writings of scholars and public men, including many eminent lawyers, over almost a half-century on the question of the evils of “government by injunction” in labor disputes. Within three years of the granting of the first injunction in a labor case by a federal court, a bill was introduced in Congress (1894) to restrict the equity jurisdiction of federal courts in limitation of their power to grant such injunctions and, from then on, the subject was bruited perennially. It merited a place in a National Party platform in a presidential campaign as early as 1896. The arguments in favor of the limitation of equity’s jurisdiction in such regard were well summarized by Mr. Justice Brandéis in 1921 in his dissenting opinion (wherein Mr. Justice Holmes joined) in <em>Truax v. Corrigan, </em><a href="/us/257/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="257 U.S. 312" data-case-ids="3678391" data-case-paths="/us/257/0312-01">257 U. S. 312</a>, as follows at pp. 367-368, — “It was asserted that in these proceedings [for injunctions in labor disputes] an alleged danger to property, always incidental and at times insignificant, was often laid hold of to enable the penalties of the criminal law to be enforced expeditiously without that protection to the liberty of the individual which the Bill of Bights was designed to afford; that through such proceedings a single judge often usurped the functions not only of the jury but of the police department; that, in prescribing the conditions under which strikes were permissible and how they might be carried out, he usurped also the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>powers of the legislature; and that incidentally he abridged the constitutional rights of individuals to free speech, to a free press and to peaceful assembly.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[228,446,1147,971]]]'>“It was urged that the real motive in seeking the injunction was not ordinarily to prevent property from being injured nor to protect the owner in its use, but to endow property with active, militant power which would make it dominant over men. In other words, that, under the guise of protecting property rights, the employer was seeking sovereign power. And many disinterested men, solicitous only for the public welfare, believed that the law of property was not appropriate for dealing with the forces beneath social unrest; that in this vast struggle it was unwise to throw the' power of the State on one side or the other according to principles deduced from that law; that the problem of the control and conduct of industry demanded a solution of its own; and that, pending the ascertainment of new principles to govern industry, it was wiser for the state not to interfere in industrial struggles by the issuance of an injunction.” (Footnote omitted.)</p>

The court below found, and I believe the evidence supports the finding, that no property damage was actually threatened or done; that no violence occurred in the sense that any physical injury was inflicted on any one at any time although sixteen thousand workmen were on strike; and, that, except for the first several days of the strike, the pickets amounted to no more than a corporal’s guard. In the one instance in which police aid and protection was availed of at the complainant’s rented building at 601 South Avenue, Wilkinsburg, the picket line permitted nonstriking workmen to enter the employer’s property without molestation, according to the complainant’s witnesses. Nor am I able to find in the record any competent proof that “there were thousands of employees <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>ready to work”. The letter which the majority opinion says so demonstrates was, in my opinion, very properly excluded by the trial judge. It was patent hearsay.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Yet, an injunction issues although the complainant neither averred nor offered a word of proof to support a finding, prerequisite to the granting of an injunction in such a case as required by the amended Ac,t. of 1937, “That the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant’s property are unable to furnish, adequate protection.” For the importance of such an averment and finding in fulfillment of the public policy legislatively declared, see opinion of Judge Hutcheson in <em>Carter v. Herrin Motor Freight Lines., Inc., </em><a href="/f2d/131/0557-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="131 F.2d 557" data-case-ids="1150422" data-case-paths="/f2d/131/0557-01">131 F. 2d 557</a> (C.

It accepted the conditions of the complainant’s offer “to pay all members” of AWSE and stated that at a meeting of the Executive Committee of AWSE, it had been decided that the members of that union would work “unless forcibly prevented from doing so.” RealisticaUy, the letter neither gave, nor in the nature of things could have given, any assurance that a single one of the members of AWSE would cross the most attenuated and peaceful of picket lines at any time. The respect which a member of organized labor pays to a picket line, even one not of his union,,may well be “judicially noticed”, There is also evidence in the record that the members of the defendant union had refrained from crossing AWSE’s picket lines whén that union’s members were out on strike át a former time.'</p>
