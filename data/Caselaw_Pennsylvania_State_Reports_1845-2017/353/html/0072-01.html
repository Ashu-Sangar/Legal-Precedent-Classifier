He reduced the assessment from $298,110 to $254,510. The owner excepted and the exceptions were heard by a court in banc consisting of Judges Mc-Naughee, Thompson and Soffel, who dismissed the exceptions. The owner then appealed to this court.</p>

By deed dated May 25, 1942, and recorded June 2,1942, in Deed Book Yol. 2739, page 45, the property in question was conveyed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to John A.
