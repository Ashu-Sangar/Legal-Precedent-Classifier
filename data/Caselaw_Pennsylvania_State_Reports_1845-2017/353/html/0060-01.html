Hitherto, the city has furnished sewerage service out of general taxes without direct charge to the user; it has become necessary now to make a charge. The power to regulate rates for public service is in the Commonwealth. The Act of May 14, 1937, P. L. 630, 53 P.S. 1030 et seq. provides a method of enabling municipalities to comply with the Commonwealth’s demand for improvement in the disposition of sewage. It authorizes the city to collect sewerage charges “apportioned equitably among the properties served by” the sewerage system. The Net permits an aggregate charge sufficient to produce (a) the cost of operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, inspection, depreciation or other expenses in relation to the sewerage system; (b) an amount annually sufficient to provide for the amortization of the debt incurred in the construction or acquisition of the system, with interest on that debt to make the improvements self-liquidating, and (c) a sum sufficient to establish a margin of safety of ten per centum. The question in this case is whether plaintiff, suing as a taxpayer, has shown that the city’s compliance with the statute will result in actionable detriment to the taxpayer.</p>

There are about 1800 miles of sewers, 1100 miles being single conduit or combined sewers and 700 miles double conduit or separate sewers.

Private schools and charitable institutions pay at the rate of six cents per thousand cubic feet pursuant to the ordinance of 1916. Philadelphia Housing Authority and Federal Housing Authority, under an ordinance of 1938, pay a water rate of forty cents per thousand cubic feet.

There is no suggestion that a five-year construction period is unreasonable, and it does not appear that the annual percentages chargeable during the period are not apportioned equitably. The present system, while urgently needing improvement, is available for use and in fact is in use by almost the en-tune city. More than 60% (the percentage payable in the first year) of the system which, when completed, will be represented by the bonded indebtedness then outstanding, is now in use.

They gave further evidence that in the remaining 700 miles of collecting sewers, two separate conduits, one for storm water and the other for sanitary and industrial sewage, were enclosed in one larger trench, so that the extra cost installing the storm water portion of the system in for those 700 miles was not more than 30% of the whole.

In making the estimate of the sum required to comply with the statute, it was of course necessary to forecast probable gross revenues for the required years. Appellant’s brief suggests that revenue in the future may be in excess of the estimates on which the challenged calculation was made. The question is whether the statute has been complied with.
