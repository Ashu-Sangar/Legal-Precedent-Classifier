    <p id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.8",196,[257,617,1151,1729]]]'>The bill was brought by the School District of Zerbe Township and the Township of Zerbe against the County, the County Commissioners, the County Solicitor, the County Mining Engineer, a former County Commissioner, and a number of corporations and other individuals. It alleged that nearly half a million dollars of delinquent taxes are due — the larger portion to plaintiffs — upon certain coal lands described in the bill, that these lands were, purchased by the County at County Treasurer’s sales in 1943 and 1945, that coal is being mined therefrom by defendant coal companies, that timber is being cut and removed by some of the defendants, that the County Solicitor, the County Mining Engineer and the former County Commissioner have secret interests in these coal companies and are obtaining profits and royalties from their operations, that none of the income is being paid to the County Commissioners or any of the taxing districts, and that this situation has been called to the attention of the County Commissioners but they have refused to take action to protect the public interests. Accordingly the bill prayed for an injunction to restrain the alleged waste, for the appointment of a receiver, and for an accounting. The court, upon affidavits, issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants (other than the County and the County Commissioners) and appointed a temporary receiver to take possession of the mines and to manage and conduct them. Defendants took a rule to show cause why the bill should not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The Court, after hearing argument, discharged the rule, accompanying its decision by a comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion.</p>

The argument that plaintiffs do not have a “contingent interest” in these coal mines and therefore do not come within the Act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 208, so as to entitle them to an injunction to restrain waste, and the argument that they are not “purchasers” within the meaning of the Act of July 2,1937, P. L. 2790, so as to entitle them to a writ of estrepement, merely go to the question whether the court should grant them the relief they seek and have nothing to do with the question of the court’s jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action. Likewise defendants’ protest against the appointment of a temporary receiver and the vesting in him of the extensive powers enumerated in the court’s decree is not a subject for present consideration. The same observation applies to the contention that plaintiffs, if they have any standing at all, must pursue their remedy on the law side of the court either under statutory provisions or in mandamus proceedings. The question with which we are now concerned is merely whether the Court of Common Pleas of Northumberland County has jurisdiction, not whether it can grant equitable as opposed to legal relief. There are not <em>two </em>courts in Northumberland County, one of law and one of chancery, but, as was said by Judge Lowrie in <em>Adams v. Beech, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%2099" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Phila. 99">1 Phila. Rep. 99</a>, 101, only <em>“one </em>court, having power to administer redress under the common law or chancery forms, according as the same are appropriate.” Section 4 of the Act of 1925 provides that “The right of appeal here conferred is not intended to cover questions of jurisdiction which go to the form of the action alone as between law and equity, such as provided for in the Act of June seven, one thousand nine hundred and seven, (Pamphlet Laws, four hundred and forty).” The procedural principle underlying this provision had been asserted even before the passage of the act. “Whether a case may be brought in the chancery form is only a question of form [of action] and not of jurisdiction ... It <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>must be taken advantage of by demurrer and not by objection to the jurisdiction of the court.” <em>Pennsylvania R.

It not only has such jurisdiction, but it has also the general power and jurisdiction granted by the Act of June 16,1836, P. L. 784, §13, to prevent or restrain “the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law, and prejudicial to the interests of the community, or the rights of individuals.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Defendants insist that the object back of plaintiffs desire to prevent waste is the collection of taxes and that therefore a court of equity is powerless to interfere. As previously pointed out, this contention goes only to the form of remedy, not the jurisdiction of the court; it may not be amiss, however, to state that equity is not deprived of its jurisdiction to restrain waste merely because these coal lands were originally acquired in the course of the collection of taxes by the County of Northumberland. The sale of the lands by the County Treasurer and their purchase by the Commissioners ended the collection proceedings so far as the taxpayers were concerned; there was left to the latter merely a right of redemption; with the County’s acquisition of the title new problems arose with regard to the management of the mines and the distribution among the interested taxing authorities of the proceeds realized therefrom, and to that new phase of the <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>situation there is not applicable the conventional and dogmatic proposition that equity will not interfere in proceedings for the collection of taxes.

Barnett Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/332/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="332 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="1186548" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0174-01">332 Pa. 174</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20758" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 A.2d 758">2 A. 2d 758</a>, the plaintiff school district had not completed its collection of taxes from a coal company by a sale of the latter’s property nor had it even obtained judgments in actions brought for that purpose; accordingly it was held that a bill in equity would not lie to compel the payment to it of funds of the coal company in the hands of a mortgagee but that the statutory methods prescribed for the collection of taxes had to be pursued and that the school district had not obtained any such interest in the taxpayer’s land as would entitle it to an injunction against the commission of waste. There the action was against the taxpayer; here the question is one solely of the respective rights and inter-relationship of the taxing authorities in regard to property purchased and held by one of them for the satisfaction of the taxes due to all.</p>

The County held the lands which the Commissioners had purchased at the County Treasurer’s sales as trustee for the benefit of all the taxing authorities concerned. In <em>Andrews Land Corporation's Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/149/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="149 Pa.

Judge Keller said (p. 214, A. p. 701): “The county took title ... as trustee for the benefit of all the taxing authorities, county, city, borough, town, township, school district or poor district, which had valid, enforceable claims for unpaid taxes against said <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>land, in proportion to their respective interests.” (See also <em>Lackawanna County Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/157/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="157 Pa.

L. 787, which provides that the taxing authority that has purchased the property may compromise with the former owner the amount of taxes, penalties, interest, and costs due thereon, and may sell the property at private sale, but only upon notice to all the. taxing authorities having tax claims against the property of a hearing to be held by the court, the court to grant its approval only if satisfied that the proposed compromise or sale will be to the advantage of all the taxing authorities in interest, and the proceeds of such compromise or sale to be distributed to the respective taxing authorities in proportion to their tax claims. The amendatory Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 282, went still further by providing that the petition to compromise the taxes, penalties, interest, and costs due, or to sell the property at private sale, may be presented to the court not only by the taxing authority which has purchased the property but by “any taxing, authority having an interest therein”. It is clear, therefore that on this additional ground of enforcing the obligation of the County and its Commissioners as constructive trustees the court has jurisdiction of these proceedings in equity.</p>
