Killian, Jonathan T. Borer and Samuel W. Harrison, as Liquidating Trustees, appellants in Appeal No. 170, by Nicola Perletto, appellee, to recover the balance of money due him as a withdrawn shareholder, notice of withdrawal having been given at a time when the appellant-association was alleged to have been solvent and had, on the effective date of the withdrawal, funds sufficient to lawfully pay in full the amounts due <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>appellee and all prior withdrawn shareholders. The case was tried by a judge without a jury. He found in favor of appellee. The court <em>en banc </em>dismissed appellant’s motions for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>and for a new' trial. Upon appeal to the Superior Court the judgment of the court below was affirmed. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, appellant in Appeal No. 171, petitioned the Superior Court for leave to intervene and for a reargument. The intervention was allowed, but reargument was refused. This Court allowed appeals.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[220,818,1149,919]]]'>In January, 1929, Nicola Perletto, appellee, subscribed for five double shares of installment stock in the Lancaster Avenue Building and Loan Association. Monthly dues of $10 were paid thereon until October 15, 1931, when notice of the withdrawal of said stock was given to the association. The stock at that time had -a value of $241.88. Said withdrawal notice was accepted and approved by the said association and acknowledged by its secretary. The shares were marked withdrawn on the appellant’s books and records and placed on the withdrawn list. Upon the effective date of said withdrawal notice — thirty days subsequent to its acceptance — the total amount necessary to pay all withdrawals to and including appellee was $14,437.47. On July 24, 1940, Perletto instituted this action to recover $176.82, the balance allegedly due him after having given credit for dividends received from the association.</p>

These allegations were denied in an affidavit of defense. The trial judge found that at the time notice of withdrawal was given the “Association was solvent, and that for a period of thirty days after the notice of withdrawal was given and for some time thereafter there were sufficient funds in the treasury of the association, not only to meet his <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>demands, but the demands of prior withdrawn stockholders . . .”. Appellee introduced in evidence admittedly correct copies of the reports filed by the association with the Department of Banking for the years 1931 to 1936, inclusive. These reports set forth the assets, liabilities, receipts, and disbursements. The report for the year ending March 16, 1932, carried an item entitled “Earnings due shareholders in the amount of $34,835.28.” The association alleged, however, that these figures did not represent a true picture of its financial condition for the reason that the stated values of certain assets were in excess of the actual or market value. No proof, however, was introduced to establish the true value although the trial judge requested the same. Appellants rely upon a letter dated January 29, 1932, from the Secretary of Banking to the association instructing them to pay no withdrawals or maturities until further notice. This letter, however, resulted from a special investigation and examination made by the Department “because of alleged irregularities in another association, of which the Secretary of this Association had formerly been connected.” The examiner’s report contained no intimation that the association was insolvent. It merely suggested errors due to apparent carelessness.</p>
    <p id="b401-3" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[212,1599,1148,703]]]'>In May, 1934, the banking department issued a segregation order pursuant to the provisions of section 80S of the Building and Loan Code of 1933, P. L. 457, as amended, 15 P.S. section 1074-808. Subsequent thereto payments in the nature of dividends of five percent were made in 1934 and 1935. Appellee’s dividends were based upon his claim as a withdrawn shareholder. In the latter part of 1936, with the approval of the banking department, the association began voluntary liquidation. Further dividend payments were made in 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. These latter payments to appellee were made on the same basis as before liquidation began, clearly treating appellee as a withdrawn stockholder.</p>
