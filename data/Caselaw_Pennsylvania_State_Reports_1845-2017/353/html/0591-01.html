This proposition was accepted by defendant, and, on March 20,1920, a more formal and comprehensive agreement was executed whereby plaintiff assigned to defendant all her right and interest in two other patents owned by her (Nos. 1,323,423 and 1,326,993), together with all improvements upon the inventions there described, and also all patents on flexible couplings and on future improvements on flexible couplings which might thereafter be granted to her; defendant in turn, granted plaintiff the exclusive right to make and sell, <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>under these patents and subsequent improvements thereon and under any patents owned or to be owned by defendant, flexible couplings to be used in connection with automobiles, trucks and tractors.</p>

Plaintiff was thereupon induced to enter into an oral agreement whereby defendant was to continue to pay her the ten per cent royalties based on the gross income from its sales of couplings under the patents, but all other provisions.of the contracts between them, were cancelled and. nullified. When the new stock was issued plaintiff purchased and paid for 50 shares at their par value of $100 per share, and when, after this parol rescission of the agreements, defendant made and sold couplings for use on automotive equipment, plaintiff made no claim to the profits of such sales to which she would otherwise have been entitled under the reservation of her rights in that regard in the 1920 contracts.</p>

This proposition was accepted by defendant, and, on October 26, 1939, while the draft of the agreement to be executed by the parties was still in the course of preparation, she assigned to defendant the exclusive right, for the United States and all foreign countries, to the application filed on September 2, 1937, to another application which she ■ had filed on August 8,. 1939 for a patent for emergency supports for flexible couplings, and to any patents that might be issued on those applications. On November 26, 1939, the formal contract was executed embodying the terms which had been agreed upon in January. One of its provisions was that plaintiff would assign to defendant “her <em>entire- </em>title, right and interest in and to all pending applications, patents, or applications which may be filed in the future and in and to any inventions therein set forth which relate in any way to flexible couplings.” Subsequently the patents (Nos. 2,182,711 and 2,251,722) which were granted on the two applications of. September 2, 1937 and August 8, 1939 were issued to defendant pursuant to the assignment which plaintiff had executed, and from then on defendant paid plaintiff the royalties provided for in the agreement of November 26, 1939. In June, 1943 defendant requested plaintiff to reduce the royalties, and, after several months of negotiations, a supplemental contract was entered into on November 26, 1943 which provided that defendant was to assign to plaintiff all of its right, title and interest in and to the patents Nos. 2,182,711 and 2,251,722, and plaintiff, in turn, was to grant to defendant, for the life of those patents, an exclusive license to make and sell flexible couplings thereunder and under an application for another patent which plaintiff had filed on March 6, 1943. In lieu of the royalties provided for in the agreement of November 26, 1939, defendant was to pay. to plaintiff, <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>retroactively effective as of July 1, 1943, a royalty of six per cent of the invoice price of all couplings and parts thereof manufactured and sold by it, the'maximum royalties in any one year not to exceed $80,000. The provision in the former agreement that plaintiff would assign to the company all applications that she might file in the future relating to flexible couplings was cancelled. Except as thus modified the- contract of November 26, 1939 was to remain in full force and effect.

In any event, we are bound by the allegations of the pleadings which assert that there was such a cancellation, and,. plaintiff’s obligations under the 1920, agreements having thereby ceased, no question of lack of consideration to, support the 1939 and 1943 agreements can arise.</p>

Even if there had been no parol -agreement, of cancellation in 1929, the 1920 agreements terminated, in our opinion, with the. expiration in 1937 of the life of the patents which constituted their subject-matter. .It <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>would seem incredible that, in assigning the three original patents to defendant for a royalty fee of ten per cent on the gross sales, and in agreeing tp assign all future improvements and all patents that might thereafter be granted to her, the parties contemplated that, after those patents were no longer in force and plaintiff would not be receiving any further royalties therefrom, she would nevertheless remain bound, during the entire balance of her life, to assign to defendant, free of any claim for royalties thereunder, any and all patents for flexible couplings which she might thereafter acquire. What the parties undoubtedly intended was that, <em>as long as the patents assigned under the 1920 contracts remained in force, </em>defendant was to have the benefit of' all improvements thereon invented by plaintiff and of all patents obtained by her ; she herself would profit therefrom by continuing to receive the ten per cent royalties on the sales of the improved’ couplings. Where there is no express provision in a contract as to its duration the intention of the parties in that regard is to be determined from the surrounding circumstances and by the application of a reasonable construction to the agreement as a whole. Thus considered, it seems to us perfectly clear that the 1920! agreements were not in force when the 1939 agreement was made.</p>

With that question, we, of course, are not concerned.

Francis E. Tower, </em>327 U.S. -- (decided February 25, 1946). The defendant may be sure that no matter, what-is done in'this case, on the basis of state law it will neither hamper nor becloud the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Tax Court in correctly identifying the tree which grew the taxable fruits: cf. <em>Lucas v. Earl, </em><a href="/us/281/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="281 U.S. 111" data-case-ids="3914322" data-case-paths="/us/281/0111-01">281 U.S. 111</a>, 115.</p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[235,1107,1152,1133]]]'>To paraphrase an apt-expression of Mr. Justice Drew in <em>Kahn v. William Goldman Theatres, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/341/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="341 Pa. 32" data-case-ids="1204559" data-case-paths="/pa/341/0032-01">341 Pa. 32</a>, 34, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20340" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="17 A.2d 340">17 A. 2d 340</a>, all that the parties to the instant pror ceeding sought was the confirmation of. the opinion of their respective- attorneys who were in .amiable agreement on the matter. They hoped for a court opinion favorable to the plaintiff and for nothing else, substantially an -advisory opinion although “. . . -such opinions are not contemplated under this legislation”: see <em>Kahn </em>case, supra, at p. 36. In <em>Taylor v. Haverford Township, </em><a href="/pa/299/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="299 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1122305" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0402-01">299 Pa. 402</a>, 406, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20639" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="149 A. 639">149 A. 639</a>, this ¡court said that “We are determined that the Declaratory Judgments Act, an excellent piece of legislation when kept within proper bounds, shall not be used in cases to. which it is not properly- applicable.” In my view, the benefits of declaratory judgment jurisdiction will best be safeguarded by a strict.observance of the caution laid down in the <em>Taylor </em>case. As the instant case does not present ‘‘an actual controversy”, I should reverse the judgment and remand with directions to dismiss the proceeding for want of jurisdiction.</p>
