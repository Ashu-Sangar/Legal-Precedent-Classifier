Eep. 379. The defendant then answered the petition. At the pre-trial conference it was agreed that the parties should stipulate the questions to be passed on. After hearing, the court ordered the Board “to pay . . . the annuity payments to which we have found him to be entitled in the amount provided by law.” The order was supported by an opinion also written by Judge Woodside : 56 Dauphin Co.

    <p id="b114-8" data-blocks='[["BL_114.8",114,[223,1419,1154,863]]]'>It will be observed that while retirement allowance is defined as the total of the State annuity and the member’s annuity, the Board’s authority to discontinue, in the circumstances stated, related not to the entire allowance, but only to the element known as the State annuity. As the plaintiff was not restored to active service, there was no authority to discontinue payment of the member’s annuity. The Act does provide, section 12 (3), that if the disability annuitant refuses to submit to the physical examination for a specified time, “all his or her rights in and to the State annuity constituted by this act shall be forfeited.” Plaintiff submitted to the examination and therefore did not forfeit the allowance. The learned Court was right in holding that plaintiff was entitled to the member’s annuity for life from the date at which that annuity was discontinued by the Board.</p>

The Board presented another element of defense in the nature of setoff, asserting that plaintiff received disability allowance in excess of what he was entitled to receive, though he received only what the Board awarded. The Board contends that during part of the time for which he received this disability allowance he was not in fact disabled. The fact was not established but was assumed for the purposes of the decision below. There is no suggestion that plaintiff misrepresented any facts to the Board, nor is there any allegation of fraud. The Board contends that plaintiff should voluntarily have discontinued receiving the allowance or at least part of it. The Board admits it did not exercise its light to have plaintiff examined. Section 15 of the Betirement Act (71 PS 1745) provides: “A member’s annuity, a State annuity, or a retirement allowance, granted under the provisions of this act shall be paid in equal monthly installments and shall not be increased, decreased, revoked, or repealed except as otherwise provided in this act.” There was no action by the Board until it discontinued the retirement allowance in 1938. It is well settled that money, not legally due, but paid voluntarily cannot be recovered back: <em>Sebastianelli v. Prudential Ins.
