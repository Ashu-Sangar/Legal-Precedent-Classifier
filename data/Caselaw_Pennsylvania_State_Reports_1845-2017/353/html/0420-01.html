These employes who were allegedly barred from plaintiff’s plant were not engaged in tbe work of producing steel and were in no sense of tbe term “strike-breaker's”. None of the manufacturing and. productive facilities at tbe Homestead Steel Works have been in operation at any time during tbe strike. Thése barred-out employes were assigned to tbe work of maintaining tbe power-houses, tbe boilers, tbe pumps, tbe steam lines and the sprinkler system, and to guard against tbe constant hdzard of fire and to prevent tbe freezing of water lines essential to water cooling systems in tbe plant. Tbe steam lines and water lines in tbe plant total several hundred miles in length. The work of these maintenance men was essential to tbe keeping of tbe steel plant in condition to resttme tbe production of steel as soon as tbe steel strike should come to an end. Tbe maintenance employes are membefs of tbe labor union which is conducting tbe strike. Tbe maintenance of tbe plant also required the presence inside of'the plant of superintendents and foremen and their assistants to supervise tbe work of tbe maintenance men. That tbe property of the plaintiff, which represents an original investment of over $60,000,00.0 and which is now valued at approximately $120,000,000 must be protected and maintained at all times, even when production is stopped by strikes, is, self-evident. Eleven of the fifty-eight open hearth, furnaces at tbe Homestead Works of tbe steel corporation are tbe property of tbe Reconstruction Finance Corporation, that is, they belong to. the. American people.. The cost <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>of the Government owned facilities of this plant is.said, to be $90,000,000.</p>

M., January 26, 1946, it would no longer permit access to the Homestead Steel Works, of any of the supervisory personnel of the plaintiff below the level of department superintendents and has since that date uniformly denied access to said properties of all assistant foremen, foremen, assistant general foremen, and general foremen and assistant department superintendents and other employes of plaintiff”.. The complaint further sets forth that “pickets have continued to congregate at said gates [leading to th.e plaintiff’s steel plant] in larger groups numbering up to two hundred (200) persons, and through mass picketing, standing.shoulder to shoulder several deep, have refused entrance and access to said Works to all supervisory and other personnel employed by the plaintiff who have sought to enter said Works, excepting only the Works Superintendent and the Department Superintendents.” .</p>

On January 29, 1946, at <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>8:30 in the evening (after suit had been instituted in the instant proceeding), Arthur H. McGurk, who desired to enter the Homestead Plant for the purpose of securing some equipment from his locker, was grabbed by pickets at the 48" mill gate and forcibly detained within the boundaries of the plant. He was escorted from company property by pickets, across the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and up a bank to a point on a driveway near Eighth Avenue. He was placed, against his will, in the seat of a red open-body truck, between the driver and another picket, and taken to a point in front of and across from the Union headquarters at Eighth and Dickson Streets. Upon alighting from the truck he attempted to make a break, stumbled and fell— one of the pickets falling on top of him, injuring his left knee and left breast and tearing his clothes. He was then forcibly taken into custody, escorted into the Union hall, where a great number of individuals were present, and was then taken into a private office and the door locked. The door was later opened by a man identified as John Bresko. McGurk was then released and went directly to his home, arriving there about 9:30 P. M. E. J. Horgan was on the night of January 29, 1946 admitted by the pickets to the plant and was told by one of the pickets, James R. Conroy, that any supervisors who used the 48" mill gate would be taken out of the <em>plant; </em>that threats were made by others in the group “that there would be bloodshed if management did not stop making use of the 48" Mill Gate.” William E. Crouch, Jr., in his injunction affidavit, states that on the 26th day of January, 1946, at 2:15 A. M., while attempting to enter the Homestead Steel Works between the hot metal bridge and the 48" mill gate, an unknown picket grasped his arm and later six or seven other pickets forcibly prevented his progress toward the mill, escorted him across the tracks, up the bank, searched him, and then placed him in an automobile, seating him <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>in the hack seat between two pickets. He was forcibly restrained by the pickets and the captain of the pickets he identified as- a man' called “Red;” The threatening attitude" of the pickets and the suggestion- that he was lucky he had'not been beaten up caused him to answer theiA questions. He was restrained by the pickets for an hour or an hour and a quarter and was released later through the efforts of. Mr. Feit. ’</p>

It does not seem admissible to impute to the legislature an intent in the amendment of 1939, thereby to work a virtual repeal of the mandate in the Act of 1937 that a hearing must precede the issuance of an injunction in any case “involving or growing out of a labor dispute.” In fact, the legislative intent appears to be quite the contrary. Nor am I unmindful that the amendment of 1939 provides “That this act shall not apply in any case” involving one or more of the situations described in the immediately ensuing paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d). Until the legislature speaks more plainly and directly than it has to date, that it is <em>its </em>intention to do away with the hearing required by the Act of 1937, I have no alternative but to abide by the law as, in my opinion, it is written.</p>

For that situation, the legislatively prescribed rules of statutory construction, by which we are bound, pertinently provide that “Whenever a section or part of a law is amended, the amendment shall be construed as merging into the original law, become a part thereof, and replace the part amended and the remainder of the original law and the amendment shall be read together and viewed as one law passed at one time; . . . ”. See Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, Art. Y, Sec. 73, 46 P.S. § 573. Thé amendment of 1939 is, therefore, to be interpreted and applied in the light of the public policy declared by the Act of 1937 which the amendment of 1939 in nowise repudiates. Indeed, the amendatory Act' of 1939 expressly confirmed the procedure for the issuance of injunctions (where permissible) in cases growing out of <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>labor disputes, as well as tbe public policy declared by the Act of 1937.</p>

In part here important, it was that “Equity procedure that permits a complaining party to obtain sweeping injunctive relief that is not preceded by . . . notice to and hearing of the responding party ... or that permits sweeping injunctions . . . upon written affidavits alone and not . . . upon examination, confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses in open court is peculiarly subject to abuse in labor litigation. . . .” In effectuation of the public policy thus declared, the legislature thereupon directed that <em>no </em>order or temporary or permanent injunction should be issued by a court of this State in a case growing out of a labor dispute except after the hearing provided for by Section 9 to which reference has already been made. No one will deny that the right to declare and, within constitutional bounds, to subserve public policy lies exclusively with the legislature.</p>

To overcome its restrictions on the court’s power to grant the relief sought in such instance, the complainant must establish the existence of the conditions said to make that Act’s restraints inapplicable. The merit of such matters is to be determined after a full hearing of all parties to the record in open court as provided for . by the Act. Until that is done, no court can competently adjudicate that there are present the conditions which render inoperative the restrictions of the Act of 1937 on the court’s jurisdiction or power. It is not enough simply to <em>aver </em>that such conditions are present. To: say that a court can remove itself from the restrictions of the Act of 1937 on the basis of ex parte affidavits and so obviate the hearing required by the Act. is .a “bootstrap-lifting” proposition.</p>

The amendment of 1939 does not say that, upon <em>an, averment </em>of such seizure^ etc., the Act of .1937 shall not apply. The Act provides that, “Where in the course of. a labor dispute . . . employes ... seize, hold,.damage, or destroy the plant . . .’’ of the employer, then.the Act of 1937 shall not apply. But, until.the,existence of that condition is found by the court as a result of the hearing required by the Act, the Act of 1937 continues to obtain in full, force and effect; and. a preliminary restraining order or. temporary injunction may not be issued on ex parte affidavits.</p>

      <em>It. </em>may well be that, upon such a hearing, the court could justifiably find that the employer’s plant has. been <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>seized, is being held or is threatened with damage or destruction. Upon such finding, competently made after the required hearing, the Act of 1937 by its terms, as amended, allows for the issuance of an injunction for the protection of property and the owner’s right to the use of it. Picketing to be lawful must be peaceful. Where picketing consists of people massed about a plant or its entrance gates with the compactness of a Macedonian phalanx, the fact that the picketing remains peaceful may be so only because no one can with safety attempt to go through the line. In such circumstances, it could hardly be thought a violent legal conclusion to hold that the plant had been seized and was being held against the owner’s right to it. But, failing the hearing required by the Act, that condition has not yet been shown to exist in this case as the court below actually found.</p>

Henceforth the Anti-Injunction Act of 1937 can be by-passed at any time by a mere averment in an untested affidavit in an ex parte proceeding, regardless of whether the affidavit is ultimately sustained by proof or not. If it is not so sustained, the abortive injunction will none the less have created and maintained an unwarranted status in the meantime. The majority opinion plainly states that “The [amendatory] Act of June 9, 1939 . . . completely restores to the courts of common pleas the equitable powers exercised by them since the Act of June 16, 1836 . . . for causes which fall within the terms of the 1939 Amending Act.” It follows, therefore, that any affidavit drawn to depict a situation that may be ascribed as fitting “the terms of the 1939 Amending Act” (even an allegation of an agreement which, as here, is not requisitely shown to exist), is sufficient to justify the is<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>suanee of an injunction upon ex parte affidavits in a case growing out of a labor dispute. Thus, by an amendment of tbe Anti-Injunction Act of 1937, that Act, as now construed, becomes for all practical purposes a dead letter. That, I think is regrettable, and especially so, as I am unable to perceive any basis in law or logic for the construction now placed upon the amended Act.</p>
