Plaintiff, a mortgagee of this property, instituted foreclosure proceedings and purchased the property at sheriff’s sale, at which time she was required to pay all the taxes levied against it for the year 1913. Her counsel thereupon addressed a letter to the Board asking that, in the appeal proceedings then pending, she be substituted as the new owner of the property, and shortly thereafter she filed with the Board a formal petition to be permitted to intervene and to succeed to the rights of the former title holders. The Board heard the testimony of witnesses whom she produced, but, so far from consenting to accept her as an <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>intervened' or as a successor in interest to tlie prior owners, granted the latter permission to withdraw their appeal. Plaintiff then filed in the Court of Common Pleas a petition for a writ of alternative mandamus commanding the Board to allow her to intervene or be substituted in the appeal proceedings and thereupon to continue with the hearings and determine the proper assessment. The court denied the writ, holding that plaintiff had no standing to intervene and that the prior owners had the right to withdraw their appeal.</p>

The right of intervention should be accorded to anyone having title to property which is the subject of litigation, provided that his rights will be substantially affected by the direct legal operation and effect of the decision, and provided also that it is reasonably necessary for him to safeguard an interest of his own which no other party on the record is interested in protecting. Equity Rule 25 and Pa. R. C. P. 2327<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> are recognitions of this principle. The right of intervention or of substitution especially arises when a beneficial interest in the cause of action is acquired pendente lite, as by purchase of the property during the course of the litigation: <em>Loughborough, Admr., v.
