Upon the execution of the agreement the Crescent Company, having made the initial payment, immediately went into possession as it was permitted to do under the contract, drilled and tested the land for minerals, and made subleases to various tenants. On November 7, 1929, it paid the second instalment of $7500 with interest, and thereupon defendant delivered to it the deed for the property. The agreement had provided that upon receiving the deed the purchaser was to execute and deliver a bond and mortgage to secure the final instalment of $7500; instead of making such delivery the Crescent Company gave defendant a receipt which stated that the deed was being delivered in escrow and was not to be considered as delivered until defendant was given the bond and mortgage in accordance with the agreement. The bond and mortgage have never been given, but the Crescent Company has made payments of interest on the unpaid instalment of $7500.</p>

In 1943 plaintiff sent the deed of the property back to defendant with the statement that the bond and mortgage would not be executed and that no further payments would be made on account of the purchase money because of a defective title to the land. It did not, however, surrender, or offer to surrender, its possession, but shortly thereafter it filed a petition for a declaratory decree to determine whether the title was marketable, whether the contract was binding upon it, and what its rights were in the premises because of the payments theretofore made under the contract. The <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>court heard testimony, filed an adjudication, and entered a decree to the effect that defendant at the time of entering into the contract had a marketable title to the land except as to the coal underlying part of the tract, but that the defects in the title had been cured by adverse possession for more than 21 years, and that, upon repossessing itself of the- deed which it had returned to defendant, plaintiff would be seized of a good and marketable title in fee simple; also, that plaintiff, by going into possession, paying part of the purchase price, and accepting a deed, had forfeited the right to set up any alleged defects in the title as a defense to. any action by defendant for the balance of the purchase price, being remitted to a suit on the warranties in the deed in case there was ever an actual ouster or loss due to any such defects. From that decree plaintiff appeals.</p>

The title in Ross passed to one Wiley and his wife in 1894. By various conveyances, culminating in a deed in 1911 from one McGinnis, the fractional interests in the coal became vested in Mrs. Wiley. By deed of October 28, 1920, all the land together with the underlying coal was conveyed by the Wileys to défendant. The records in Beaver County, however, are not entirely clear and complete in regard to one or possibly two fractional interests in the coal, and, for present purposes, it may be accepted as a fact that the title conveyed to the Crescent Company was not, to that extent, a good and marketable one. But it further appears that defendant went into possession in 1917, which was three years before receiving a deed for the property, and during the seven years of his occupancy he enjoyed the exclusive use ©f the land and not only mined the coal thereunder but for some short period made leases to others to mine and sell <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>it. During tlie ownership of the Wileys they also had taken out coal for their own use. When the Crescent Company went into possession it drilled and tested the land for minerals, made leases of the premises, collected the rentals therefrom, and paid taxes on the entire property, there being no separate assessment of the surface and the coal. The learned chancellor found as a fact that during the successive occupancies of defendant, the Crescent Company, and plaintiff, they and each of them maintained actual, constant, continued, uninterrupted, exclusive, distinct, visible, notorious and hostile possession of all the land, including the coal, and that, during all that period of 27 years, no adverse claim to any interest in the coal was ever made by anyone.</p>

Here, the deeds from McGinnis to the Wileys in 1911, from them to defendant in 1920, and from defendant to the Crescent Company in 1929, amounted to claims of complete ownership of the coal, and those deeds were attended by a continuing adverse possession, for, while there was not a period of 21 years of actual day-by-day mining, there were substantial operations of drilling, testing, mining and leasing from time to time during such period. The court, therefore, was justified in its conclusion that the title which defendant conveyed to the Crescent Company, even if it may originally have been defective as to the coal, has ripened by adverse possession into one that is good, marketable and wholly unassailable.</p>

In 1929 the Crescent Company, as has been stated, accepted a deed for the property. It is true that in its receipt it declared that the delivery was in escrow and was not to be considered final until it gave to defendant the bond and mortgage <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>provided for in the agreement of sale. Nevertheless the title passed under the deed. “An agreement to deliver a deed as an escrow to the person in whose favor it is made, and who is likewise a party to it, will not make the delivery conditional. If delivered under such an agreement it will be deemed an absolute delivery, and a consummation of the execution of the deed”: <em>Simonton’s Estate, </em><a href="/watts/4/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Watts 180" data-case-ids="1842779" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0180-01">4 Watts 180</a>, 181.

It is obvious that the condition that the delivery should not become effective until the Crescent Company executed and delivered a bond and mortgage to defendant was solely for the latter’s benefit, and it is not for the Crescent Company, or for plaintiff as its successor, to claim that it did not acquire title because of the non-fulfillment of a condition which it itself was obligated to perform. As, therefore, the deed effectively transferred the title, plaintiff is met by the well established principle of law that while the purchaser, <em>before </em>delivery of the deed, may set up that the title is unmarketable, <em>after </em>the delivery “he must show that it is positively bad, by proving a superior indisputable title to the land in a third person or party, <em>who is asserting his right thereto by virtue of such title; </em>otherwise it may be that the purchaser will never be disturbed in his enjoyment of the land by reason of it; or if he should, he may have his remedy on the covenants contained in the deed of conveyance made to him; . . . in order to make such outstanding title a good defence ... it must be clearly shown to be indubitably good, <em>and that the land is actually claimed under </em>it”: <em>Ludwick v.
