The Prothonotary and County Commissioners of Westmoreland County were also joined as defendants.

L. 774, and authorized therein to condemn lands for highway purposes, appropriated certain lands in Westmoreland County, being a part of a tract of 6889 acres of which James S. Blair et al., hereinafter referred to as the Blairs, claimed to be the owners. In a viewers’ proceeding the Turnpike Commission named the Blairs as the owners of the land. During April, May, June, July and August, 1939, the Turnpike Commission entered and improved the land taken as a right of way. The lands were unseated and had been sold to the County. Commissioners at various times for delinquent taxes, the last sale being on June 13,1938.</p>

The Commissioners filed a disclaimer in which they said they disclaimed “. . . all title or claim of title or of right to or interest in or possession of the premises described in the Petition and Statement of Claim . . . and to every part thereof, now or at any time heretofore, and we do likewise disclaim any interest or property in the damages caused by reason of the condemnation of all or of any part of the said premises by the said Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.” The Commission then made a motion for judgment on the record on the ground, that the Blairs had no interest in the land and that the <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>title was in the County. This motion was overruled, the decree leaving the question of ownership open to be disposed of at the trial of the issue.</p>

In the case at bar there is no dispute as to any material fact, only a difference of opinion as to whether the lands were redeemed, the application of redemption acts and a question of the validity of the disclaimer. In <em>Richmond v. Bennett, </em>supra (p. 474), this <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>Court said: “It is true that in actions respecting real property, where the plaintiff's right has not been established at law or is not clear, he is generally not entitled to remedy by injunction; but where in a proceeding in equity the plaintiff's title is clear, and all the evidence relating to it is of such a character that a judge in a trial at law, upon the same evidence, would not be at liberty to submit the question of the plaintiff’s title to the jury, equity will grant relief although there has been no adjudication of the title at common law.” In this case the owner of the lands after the tax sales and at the time of the condemnation is determined by public records. There can be no question of the tax sales and the purchases by the County Commissioners. There could be no submission of the question of title to a jury. In a trial at law the court would be bound to give binding instructions in favor of the County.</p>

The right to redeem these lands existed thereafter for a period of two years as provided by the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 141. Since title passed conditionally to the County at the time of the tax sale, June 13,1938, the owners had until June 13,1940, to pay the <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>taxes and redeem the lands. At the time of the condemnation, October 10, 1938, the title passed conditionally from the County to the Turnpike Commission, and became absolute at the expiration of the statutory period of redemption. It was not until February 3, 1942, that the taxes were paid and an attempt made to redeem the property. It was then too late to do so, it was long after the period of redemption fixed in the statute had expired. The money received for the lands from the Turnpike Commission was therefore the property of Westmoreland County, from which source the title to the Turnpike Commission was directly derived. The Blairs lost all interest in the lands when they did not redeem within the statutory period, and for the same reason they never had any claim or right to the condemnation money.</p>
