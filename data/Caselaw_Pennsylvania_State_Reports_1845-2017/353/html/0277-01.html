Ml, appellant alighted from a northbound trolley car at the intersection of Fifth and Chew Streets, Philadelphia. Each street is 50 feet wide. There are no trolley tracks on Chew Street. Appellant proceeded to the southeast corner of said intersection, waited until the traffic light was green in his favor, and then started across Fifth Street. He observed appellee’s southbound trolley car about 75 to 80 feet north of the intersection of Fifth and Chew Streets, or stepped into the south-bound trolley track when an automobile going east on Chew Street turned directly in front of him and proceeded south on Fifth Street. .This car came within two feet of striking appellant and he paused for.two or three seconds to allow it to pass. Thereafter appellant looked for the trolley and saw it 15 to 20 feet away, it having ignored a red traffic signal <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>light and continued into the intersection.. He immediately turned to his left and took a step backwards when he was struck by the oncoming trolley and thrown 20 to 30 feet through the air. The trolley had been traveling about 35 miles per hour as it proceeded toward Chew Street. It slowed, down to about 30 miles per hour as it crossed the intersection. . , ■ r ■</p>

Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant and giving him the benefit of all inferences which might be deduced therefrom, it cannot be said that he was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter, of law in failing to remove himself from the track in sufficient time to prevent being struck. Appellant was not; bound to anticipate that a trolley car 125 feet away would disregard a traffic signal, continue through the intersection, and strike him when -he, having committed himself to the crossing with the traffic signal in his favor, , stopped for two or three seconds to allow a vehicle to pass, in front of him.
