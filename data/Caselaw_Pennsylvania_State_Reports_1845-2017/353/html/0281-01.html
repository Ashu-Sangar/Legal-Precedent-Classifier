This principle has been frequently reiterated by this and other courts. The United States -Supreme Court said in Y. <em>W. G. H. v. French, </em><a href="/us/187/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="187 U.S. 401" data-case-ids="6141247" data-case-paths="/us/187/0401-01">187 U.

The clearly-expressed purpose of a testator is not to be overborne by modifying directions that are ambiguous and equivocal, and may justify either of two opposite interpretations. Such directions are to be so construed as to support the testator’s distinctly announced main intention.”</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[246,775,1153,1195]]]'>The court below, in interpreting the will in question, said: “The disposition of the estate in the second sentence was not a gift of the remainder after a life estate, but was a substituted or alternative absolute gift if the absolute gift first given to the husband could not take effect by reason of his being dead when the testator died.” This conclusion is reached by interpreting the phrase “in case of the death of both of us” as meaning “if my husband predeceases me” (that is, the testatrix). This would obviously be the correct interpretation if the testatrix had written “in case of the death of my husband.” Appellant contends that the phrase should be interpreted as meaning “when both my husband and I aré dead.” This latter interpretation impresses us (1) as being more nearly justified by the language used, and (2) as being-more nearly conformable to reason, by taking into consideration the situation of the testatrix and the circumstances surrounding her at the time the will was executed, as this court said in <em>McGlathery’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/311/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="311 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1146311" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0351-01">311 Pa. 351</a>, 355, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20886" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="166 A. 886">166 A. 886</a>, (quoting from Jarman on Wills, 7th ed., 749) a judicial interpretation of a will should do in seeking a testator’s intention.</p>

If it was the latter contingency she had in mind, she would have undoubtedly written “if my husband dies before I do.” Almost any lit<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>erate husband or wife knows how to express in a will a contingency that the other spouse may die before the maker of the will dies. We decide that this testatrix did <em>not </em>intend to say that only in the event of her husband’s death before her will became operative by her own death should Eobert L. Sutliff “get 1,000 dollars” and her sister, “Minnie C. Deardorff or her heirs . . . [get] the estate . . .” We decide that she meant that when the time should come when “both of us,” that is, her husband and herself were dead, the two persons named in the last sentence of the will should get what she “willed” them to have.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[196,957,1152,1416]],["BL_318.1",318,[257,289,1146,418]]]'>No one contends that the last sentence in the will is meaningless. It obviously was meant to describe one of three possible contingencies, to-wit: (1) The death of the husband before the will became operative by the maker’s death, (2) the death of both husband and wife at the same moment, and (3) the time when both husband and wife were dead, even though they did not die simultaneously, and the estate would because of that fact be of no avail to either of them. We reject the first interpretation (contended for by appellee) because (as above stated) of the use of the phrase “both of us.” “Both” is a word of well known meaning and as here used it clearly refers to the death of both spouses. The use of the phrase “in case of,” which is often used to describe a contingency that <em>possibly </em>will <em>not </em>happen, i. e., a chance event, did <em>not </em>indicate that the testatrix had any doubt that the time <em>would </em>come when <em>both </em>she <em>and </em>her husband would be dead. We reject the second possible interpretation because the simultaneous death of husband and wife is of such rare occurrence that a husband or wife in making a will seldom think of that contingency and in those cases where they do they always make clear what they have in mind by using such a simple phrase as, e. g., “in case of my wife’s and my death at the same time.” If they are a married couple who do considerable travel-ling in conveyances subject to hazards which make fatal <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>accidents not unlikely the husband may use in his will the phrase: “In case of the death of my wife and myself in the same accident, I devise and bequeath my property in manner following.” The third possible interpretation is the one which impresses us as being expressive of the testatrix’s intention .in . testamentarily recording her wishes as to what was to be doné with her property when <em>“both” </em>she and her husband were dead.</p>

Keefer’s mind when she made this- will:' (1) she inherited her estate from her-father; (2)- she “did not. care for’.’ her husband’s relatives, and she had no .children; (3)' Minnie C. Deardorff was her sister and her nearest blood relative; (4) the testatrix had declared on several occasions prior to executing her-will-that-she intended that her estate should ultimately go to <em>her </em>relatives and not to her husband’s relatives. To these record circumstances may be added the circumstance ¡that it is a: matter of general knowledge that every married woman.knows that if she predeceases, her husband Ahere is a possibility-of his <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>marrying another woman (as did this testatrix’s husband), and it is reasonable to believe that any married woman prefers, after providing for her surviving husband’s maintenance during his remaining years, -that what is left of <em>her </em>estate should then go to her close kindred rather than to her husband’s second wife.</p>

It must be conceded that no intent could ordinarily be attributed to any married woman to bequeath her estate to her successor. But this is <em>not </em>the problem which confronts us.

He does not refer to death as an event which is certain to occur, but as an event which may or may not occur. <em>Caldwell v.

In <em>Rapson’s Estate, </em>supra, Mr. Chief Justice Frazer said (page 589) : “. . . since there is an express and unambiguous gift of the residue to testatrix’s husband, a mere doubt as to the effect of subsequent clauses in reducing the quantum of his interest must be resolved in favor of the vesting of an absolute estate in him.” In Restatement, Property, section 263, comment a, it is stated: “A limitation which comes within the rule stated in this Section refers to 'death,’ not as an event which is certain to occur, but as an event which may or may not occur. Since death itself is an event certain to occur, the contingency, thus provided for, can only exist with respect to the timing of the death referred to, that is, with respect to whether this death will occur before some other event. When the limitation fails to specify this other event, the death of the testator is the only other event to which the death of the devisee can reasonably be related. Consequently, in such limitations the substitutional construction provides the only mode of giving effect to the contingency expressed by the language of the limitation.”</p>

I cannot agree with the statement in the majority’s opinion that “. . . the simultaneous death of husband and wife is of such rare occurrence that a husband or wife in making a will seldom think of that contingency” and <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>that when they do they express their intent in plain language. An examination of joint and reciprocal wills over the past decade, in our records, will reveal that this contemplation is apparent with increasing frequency, and such intent is not always expressed in clear and unambiguous language. Whether a husband and wife are, or are not, extensive travelers seems immaterial. The public news increasingly report such common disasters from fires, explosions, and travel in automobiles, airplanes, railroad trains, steamships, etc. I disagree that in these modern days married testators do not contemplate death in a common disaster.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[197,953,1150,318]]]'>In <em>Rapson’s Estate, </em>supra, common disaster was clearly in testatrix’s contemplation. She used words much stronger than those now before us. Her words were “In case of my husband dying <em>before </em>me, or (in a common disaster) or ‘after me’ ”, we ruled that a preceding absolute gift to the husband had not been cut down.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[195,1283,1153,867]]]'>But whether testatrix by use of the words “In case of the death of both of us” meant deaths in a common disaster, or (as held by the majority) upon the inevitable deaths of both, or as an event which may or may not occur, she has <em>not </em>expressed her intent in the clear and unambiguous language required to cut down the absolute estate previously given to her husband: <em>Harris Estate; Haydon’s Estate, </em>supra. That such words are ambiguous is most apparent. Indeed Mr. Chief Justice Maxey, in the majority opinion says <em>“But there was ambiguity in the terms used in this will </em>. . .” and then resolve the ambiguity in favor of a construction that by the words used in all the surrounding circumstances testatrix intended the contingency to be that of the inevitable death of both. This, to my mind, is in clear disagreement with our previous cases.</p>
