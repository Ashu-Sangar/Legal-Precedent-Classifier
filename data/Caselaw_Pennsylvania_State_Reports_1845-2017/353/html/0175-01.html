The city had converted what had been the City Poor Farm, located in Shenango Township, about <em>3y2 </em>miles from the city, into a municipal golf course, designating it as a “park, playground and recreation center.” We quote from the brief of the county solicitor this description of the golf course: The Sylvan Heights Golf Course “has four buildings located on the grounds. The first is an old type brick building converted into an auditorium or club room, a small locker room, and ladies’ bath, and restaurant. In this building, sandwiches, soft drinks, golf balls, golf clubs, cigarettes, and cigars are offered for sale. Meals are also served, the charge being according to the menu selected. At times the club room is used by clubs at a fixed charge. A second building is an old barn used for the storage of equipment for the Golf Course, such as tractors, trucks, and tools. A third is a brick building in which is located an office for the manager of the Golf Course, space for golf racks for customers, a repair shop, and on the second floor, two small bedrooms, a locker <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>room and showers, and a rest room. The fourth building is a small stucco house formerly used as a pest house, but not used for any purpose since the property was converted into the Golf Course. The three buildings which are in use are used as incidental to the operation of the Golf Course. All of the 131 acres comprising the tract are occupied by the Course. None of it is adaptable to or available for use as a recreation park. It can be used only by Golf patrons. A fixed charge is made for playing either for 9 holes of play, 18 holes, by the day, or by the season. The season memberships are divided into senior memberships, junior memberships, etc., and different rates charged for each. The Golf Course is open to the general public, whether residents or nonresidents of the City of New Castle, residents or nonresidents of the township of Shenango, Lawrence County, where the Course is located. Fees are charged just as in the use of any ordinary Golf Course privately owned.”</p>

Without now considering what the effect of such a fact might require, we limit our consideration to the record which does not support the fact of business activity on which the theory is based and which must therefore be rejected. Referring to this subject, Judge Dickey said in his adjudication, “It is to be regretted that the record in this case affords little aid to the Court in determining whether this course is operated in direct competition with commercial golf courses in the neighborhood. It has all the earmarks of a commercially operated golf course. It has never returned a profit, but we are acquainted with but few municipally managed properties that are profitable.” While, as he said, the record afforded “little aid” to him, the court in banc went further: “We are not aware of our appellate courts yet having held a golf course to be property used for public or governmental<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> purposes. Furthermore, the Sylvan Heights Golf Course, though municipally owned and operated was in direct competition with private enterprises of the same type and kind situate within Lawrence County. The use of public property in competition in <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>the same business with private property is not and ought not to be looked upon with favor.

It appears to us that the Sylvan Heights Golf Course was used mainly for the convenience of the restricted class of individuals who play golf rather than for a general public purpose.” The record does not support those inferences ; the evidence which Judge Dickey “regretted” was not in the record cannot be made the basis of inference.</p>

A taxing authority must declare exempt any property within its taxing district if it is public property used for public purposes because the legislature has exempted such property, not because the city has selected the site for a public park. The state’s agencies for governmental purposes have no vested right in the taxing power which cannot be affected by general laws. As the taxing power of counties and townships was subject to legislative control, there is nothing to support the argument that by establishing public parks, exempt because they were public parks, the city unconstitutionally affected the power of the local taxing authority.</p>

They are created, governed, and the extent of their powers determined by the legislature, and subject to change, repeal, or total abolition at its will. They have no vested rights in their offices, their charters, their corporate powers, or even their corporate existence. This is the universal rule of constitutional law, and in no state has it been more clearly expressed and more uniformly applied than in Pennsylvania.”</p>
