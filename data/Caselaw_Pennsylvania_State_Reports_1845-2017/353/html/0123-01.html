Tbe bill states that tbe earliest of tbe checks Upon which tbe insurance company seeks to recover is dated January 16, 1935, and tbe last, March 25, 1941.

This remedy, the learned court held, was pre-trial conference: Rule 212, 332 Pa. xlviii. We cannot agree that pre-trial conference supplies a full, complete and adequate remedy ousting the power of equity to order discovery. The Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, section 13, as amended, 17 PS sections 282, 283, confers upon the courts of common pleas “The power and jurisdiction of courts of chancery, so far as relates to: . . . III. The discovery of facts material to a just determination of issues, and other questions arising or depending in the said courts.” The subject was considered in <em>Yorkshire Worsted Mills v. National Trans. Co., </em><a href="/pa/325/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="325 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1172319" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0427-01">325 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.%20897" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="190 A. 897">190 A. 897</a>, in which the scope of relief was thus stated (omitting references to cases) : “Although equity has plenary jurisdiction to afford the relief which appellant seeks, there is a fundamental limitation upon the character of information <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>which may be so obtained. The purpose of the discovery is to enable the party seeking it to make out his cause of action or his defense, not to pry into the case of his opponent and to anticipate it . . . The matters about which inquiry is made must bear pertinently upon the matters which he will be required to prove affirmatively at trial . . .”</p>

Yellow Cab Co., </em><a href="/pa/283/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="283 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="1090508" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0488-01">283 Pa. 488</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=129%20A.%20563" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="129 A. 563">129 A. 563</a>, an action for breach of contract to purchase from plaintiff all the motor fuel to be consumed by defendant between certain dates, the plaintiff prayed discovery of the extent of defendant’s purchases of fuel between the specified dates. The court below dismissed the bill on the ground that plaintiff was entitled only to nominal damages and therefore did not require discovery; we reversed, holding that the information asked for “is most ‘material’, for otherwise it [plaintiff] can neither properly prepare its statement of claim, nor successfully prove its case at the trial.” That case was cited with approval by Mr. Justice Cardozo, in <em>Sinclair Rfg. Co. v. Jenkins Co., </em><a href="/us/289/0689-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="289 U.S. 689" data-case-ids="3917634" data-case-paths="/us/289/0689-01">289 U. S. 689</a>, in considering a similar bill. In the <em>Sinclair </em>case, discovery was “demanded as to the number of cracking stills constructed by the defendant under the Isom patent; as to the' extent and time of operation; and as to the amount of gasoline and other petroleum products yielded thereby, with an inspection of the relevant designs and drawings.” The opinion stated.: “The law of discovery has been invested at times with unnecessary mystery. There are few fields where considerations of practical convenience should play a larger role. The rationale of the remedy, when used as an auxiliary process in aid of trials at law, is simplicity itself. At times, cases will not be proved, or will be proved clumsily or wastefully, if the litigant is not permitted to gather his evidence in advance. When this necessity is made out with reasonable certainty, a bill in equity is maintainable to give him what he needs. <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>Equity Eule 58.” At page 696 the opinion continues: “To hold that the plaintiff in an action at law may have discovery of damages is not to say that the remedy will be granted as of course, or that protection will not be given to his adversary against impertinent intrusion. . . . The court may decline to open the defendant’s records to the scrutiny of a competitor posing as a suitor, if the suit has been begun without probable cause or as an instrument of malice. It is all a matter of discretion. Good faith and probable cause were here abundantly established.”</p>

Henry, </em><a href="/pa-super/50/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="50 Pa. Super. 440" data-case-ids="428502" data-case-paths="/pa-super/50/0440-01">50 Pa.

Defendant discontinued the agency and plaintiff sued in assumpsit. He was unable to prepare his statement of claim without first seeing defendant’s records to ascertain the amount due him; these records defendant refused to furnish.

Perlow and Harry L. Creditor.” As the insurance company denies that the Employers’ Liability has paid the loss, we think an order requiring the production of this correspondence before trial should not be made on this record.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[229,1374,1150,753]]]'>Paragraph 8 asks for the “reports of the investigators employed by the defendant to investigate the affairs of its McKeesport, Pennsylvania, office, which resulted in the disclosure that the said Arthur J. Perlow and Harry L. Creditor had been guilty of making false and fraudulent claims and obtaining the money on the checks for which defendant is seeking to recover from the plaintiff.” That is too general to support an order for plaintiff; the requirements of the case will be satisfied by the production of the papers heretofore ordered to be produced. Paragraphs 9 and 10 were considered earlier in this opinion. Paragraph 11 is too general. We have considered all the preliminary objections but can find no ground for sustaining any.</p>

        <em> Bidder v. Bridges, L. </em>R., 29 Ch. D. 29, contains an interesting discussion of discovery sought by a defendant from the plaintiff after the action was at issue; plaintiff was required to answer part of the interrogatories. <em>Shirk v. Lancaster City, </em><a href="/pa/313/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="313 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1152606" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0158-01">313 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20557" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="169 A. 557">169 A. 557</a>, involved the reasonableness of water rates charged the defendant municipality. We said that the defendant must submit its records to the plaintiff. At page 170, the opinion states: “The court, however, may require the city to furnish to complainants’ engineers, a complete inventory of plant equipment, water mains, where the same is situated or located, its cost and all items entering into value. Taxpayers having an interest, similar in this regard to shareholders, may compel such disclosures where the charge is, as here, mismanagement.”</p>

The Supreme Court of Missouri declared that it was ‘a very wise provision of the code of procedure . . .

The rationale of this attitude is, of course, not only that the court wants to know the truth, but also that it is good for both parties to learn the truth far enough ahead of the trial not only to enable them to prepare for trial, but also to enable them to decide whether or not it may be futile to proceed to trial.’ ”</p>
