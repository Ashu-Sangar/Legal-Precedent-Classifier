He owned a property in Johnstown, the value of which was about $7500. On December 1, 1926, he gave his grandson, Anthony Lima, his bond for $10,000 to “become due and payable at the date of the death of Tony Cancilla, mortgagor, with interest from the said date of death of Tony Cancilla, at six per cent per annum”. He also executed a mortgage in favor of Lima upon this Johnstown property reciting the terms of the bond and stating that the mortgage was for the purpose of securing its payment. On May 24,1929, he gave Lima another bond for $3000, payable in five years from the date thereof with interest at six per cent per annum, and accompanied it with a <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>second mortgage on the property; this bond and mortgage contained a clause that “should the mortgagor at any time during his lifetime make sale of the mortgaged premises so that he may use the proceeds thereof for his own maintenance and support, that not only this mortgage, but also the bond it secures shall be absolutely void.” The evidence is clear that no consideration was received by Cancilla for either of these bonds or mortgages.</p>

In his will he devised the Johnstown property to Lima and his residuary estate to the plaintiff, but he did not own anything at the time of his death except the mortgaged premises. On April 10, 1941, Lima assigned the two bonds and mortgages to Stephen J. Bondy, who paid therefor the sum of $6400 and in addition was obliged to pay several hundred dollars of delinquent taxes, making the total consideration approximately $7500. On July 12, 1941, Bondy assigned the bonds and mortgages to the Moxham National Bank as security for an obligation on a note. Previously thereto, on May 6,1941, he had issued a scire facias against Cancilla on the $10,000 mortgage, with notice to plaintiff and to Lima. The sheriff properly served plaintiff in accordance with the provisions of the Act of July 9, 1901, P. L. 614, sec. 1, cl. 10, but she made no defense and did not participate in any manner in the proceedings. On May 26, 1941, Bondy took judgment for $10,553.33 against Cancilla, and also against Lima and plaintiff as “sole devisees and terre tenants for want of an appearance.” A sheriff’s sale was had on September 5, 1941, at which Bondy purchased the property, presumably for the benefit, of himself and the bank as their interests might appear; he has since received a title deed from the sheriff. More than a year thereafter, on December 10, 1942, plaintiff filed an election to take against her husband’s will, and then brought the present bill in equity against Lima, Bondy <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>and the bank, praying that an undivided one-half interest in the property, to which she claimed to be entitled, be declared free from the lien of the mortgage judgment, and that the bonds and mortgages, the judgment, and all subsequent proceedings thereunder, including the sheriff’s sale, be declared fraudulent and void as against her. A decree pro confesso was obtained against Lima; the court dismissed the bill as to the other defendants.</p>

The mortgages were therefore voidable as to her.' Did Bondy acquire any less vulnerable title to them as assignee? A bona fide purchaser from a fraudulent grantee is protected against the equities of third persons not arising out of the instrument, a bona fide purchaser being understood to be one who gives consideration and takes without either actual or constructive notice of the rights of others in the property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> But neither Bondy nor the bank offered any evidence to prove that they were in that class. True, they gave consideration for the assignments, but the burden was upon them to establish not only that they did not know that the bonds and mortgages had been executed by Cancilla without any consideration, but also that there was nothing to put them on inquiry as to that fact; this burden they made no attempt to meet. The terms of the instruments on their face were sufficient to put any prudent purchaser on guard as to whether or not such consideration had been given; in the first bond and mortgage the principal was not to be paid until after the obligor’s death and was <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>not to bear interest until that time, and in the second bond and mortgage the obligor was to be allowed to sell the property at any time he desired in order to use the proceeds for his maintenance and support and in that event the bond and mortgage were to become “absolutely void”; such terms and provisions are rare, not to say unique. Moreover, the amount of even the first bond and mortgage alone was plainly in excess of the value of the property. It must be concluded, therefore, that the title to the bonds and mortgages in Bondy and in the bank was no better than it was in Lima, the original mortgagee.</p>

We refer to the fact that although in the foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage plaintiff was given notice and served with the writ, she made no defense and allowed judgment to be entered against her, the property to be sold, and title to be given by the sheriff’s deed to Bondy. Even before the Act of July 9, 1901, P. L. 614, sec. 1, cl. 10, which provided that the real owners should be made parties, it was held that, if terre tenants were actually served or intervened, and if their title was derivative from that of the mortgagor, they were bound by the result of the proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> If, on the other hand, they claimed title superior to that of the mortgagor, they were not obliged, or even allowed, to interject their title as an issue in those proceedings, but could assert it only in a subsequent action of ejectment or possibly, under certain circumstances, by a bill in equity,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and notwithstanding the passage of the Act <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>of 1901 the same distinction is still maintained, so that any party summoned as a real owner will not be required or permitted to prove a title in himself superior to, or wholly independent of, that of the mortgagor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The reason why a superior title cannot be asserted in foreclosure proceedings is that the party owning such a title need not be concerned therein, for his rights will remain unaffected; as the mortgagor had no power whatever to lien the property the <em>mortgage </em>cannot possibly be good as against the holder of a paramount title. But in a case Avhere, as here, a right of dower is involved, the widow <em>is </em>interested in the validity of the mortgage since her husband <em>has </em>the power to create a valid mortgage upon his property which would ordinarily destroy her dower interest and Avhich would be ineffective in that regard only if given without consideration in fraud of her rights. Therefore her interest is not wholly paramount to, but has “connection with” his title (see <em>Colwell v. Easley, </em><a href="/pa/83/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="83 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1050791" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0031-01">83 Pa. 31</a>, 34) and she would be “prejudiced by the judgment” obtained on the mortgage (see <em>Catlin v. Robinson, </em><a href="/watts/2/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Watts 373" data-case-ids="1840074" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0373-01">2 Watts 373</a>, 379). This makes it imperative upon her to assert her claim in the foreclosure proceedings and there test the validity of the mortgage as to her right of dower, the determining factor on that question being whether or not the mortgage had been given for a <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>consideration. She must raise and meet that issue to prevent the entry of a judgment against her; it is, as to her, a defense against the mortgage arising out of the instrument itself, and therefore she cannot ignore the foreclosure proceedings, allow the mortgagee to obtain title to the property by sheriff’s deed, and then attempt by later independent proceedings to establish that the mortgage had been given by her husband without consideration and in fraud of her rights.
