On November 12th, 1943, the clerks certified their findings to the Return Board, basing them on the total of tally strokes appearing on the general tally return sheet and not on the strokes appearing on the minority inspector’s copy. The Return Board confirmed these findings and issued a certificate to Rehrig. On December 6th, 1943, Koch presented a petition pursuant to Section 1701, Article 17, of Act of June 3rd, 1937, P. L. 1333, 25 P.S. 3261 for a recount of the ballots.

On February 21st, 1944, the rule was dismissed and an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court. In our opinion reported in <a href="/pa/351/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="351 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="462768" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0544-01">351 Pa. 544</a>, the lower Court was reversed and Koch was allowed to appeal nunc pro tune. Such an appeal was taken, and on the hearing which followed the appellant offered in evidence the findings made in the recount of December 8th, 1943 for the purpose of showing that Koch had received 234 votes and Rehrig 214 votes in the Second Ward, thereby giving him a majority of votes in the Borough. To this offer, counsel for Rehrig objected on the ground that this recount having been made “later than five (5) days after the completion of the computation and canvassing, of all the returns of the County by the county board”, the evidence was incompetent.</p>

Counsel for Koch then renewed his offer to show the <em>result </em>of the December 8th recount, asserting that since the ballots themselves were unavailable, the record of the recount of them should be received as evidence. The Court rejected this offer on the ground above stated. Later the Court dismissed the appeal from the “action of the Computation Board relative to its computation of the vote and the County Board <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of Election’s action in issuing a certificate of election to Gran-ville F.

The board completely neglected to carry out its statutory duty. Had its duty been complied with, a recount would have been ordered and appellant would have been notified. Furthermore, the county board failed to publicly announce by posting at its office the final result of the election on November 20, 1943, as expressly required by Section 302 (1) of the Election Code, 25 P.S. Sec. 2642. Again, had this been done, appellant would have received notice of the erroneous result before the statutory limitations barred his remedies”.

We cannot accept this reasoning or its conclusion. If, for example, there had been photostatic copies made of the ballots before the recount got underway and the original bállots themselves had then been destroyed,- it would have been unjustifiably technical to hold that the photostatic copies could not be received as the basis of the recanvass because they were not in fact the actual ballots. Properly accredited secondary evidence is always received in evidence in lien of nonexistent primary evidence unless the reception of such evidence is positively forbidden. In the instant case, the secondary- evidence offered: consisted of “the findings of the recount the Board made on December 8, 1943”. The correctness of these findings was not challenged; they weré denied' as evidentiary character because the recount on which they were based <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>was made “later than five (5) days after the computation and recanvass of all the returns . . .” The lateness of the recount certainly did not destroy or impair the probative value of its revelations. A recount having in fact been made,, the aggrieved party obtained a rule to show cause why an appeal from the action (obviously erroneous) of the Computation Board should not have been allowed nunc pro tunc.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[237,717,1150,858]]]'>The order of the court below discharging that rule was reversed by this Court.

At the ensuing hearing no competent and relevant evidence of the fact in issue should have been rejected. The official record of the recount of December 8, 1943 was competent and relevant. The fact that the recanvass was made five days after the computation and recanvass of all the returns did not affect the probative value of the record of that count. The statutory five day limitation should have been invoked (if it was to be invoked at all) when the petition was presented to open the ballot box, [under Sec. No. 1701 of the Election Code of 1937, 25 P.S. 3261 (Eor the five day limitation see Section 1703, 25 P.S. 3263).]</p>

Blackstone in his Commentaries, Book III, 368, said: “The one general rule that runs through all the doctrine of trials is this, — that the best evidence the nature of the case will admit of shall always be required, if possible to be had; but, if not possible, then the best evidence that can be had pbnll be allowed.” Thayer in. his “Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law”, says p. 530: “The rules of evidence should be simplied; and should take <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>on the general character of principles, to guide the sound judgment of the judge, rather than minute rules to bind it. The two leading principles should be brought into conspicuous relief, (1) that nothing is to be received which is not logically probative of some matter requiring to be proved; and (2) that everything which is thus probative should come in, unless a clear ground of policy or law excludes it.” He also says: (p. 490) “The true meaning of the rule of law that requires the greatest evidence that the nature of the thing is capable of is this, that no such evidence shall be brought which ex natura rei supposes still a greater evidence behind in the parties’own possession and power.” . . . (p. 491) “In 1740, Lord Hardwicke declared that ‘the rule of evidence is that the best that the circumstances of the case will allow must be given. There is no rule of evidence to be laid down in this court but a reasonable one, such as the nature of the thing to be proved will admit of.’ ” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The hearing was concerned with a recanvass, computation and' return of the votes cast as disclosed by the <em>ballots; </em>and the tabulation did not qualify in any sense as secondary evidence of the <em>ballots. </em>It was at best but a computation of the number of marks appearing on the ballots opposite the respective names of the contending nominees for the office of school director. But, a ballot discloses far more essential to a recount than is shown by a tabulation of the vote for a particular office. A ballot contains'the evidence of its own validity or invalidity in general. It must have been marked not otherwise than by a pencilled cross or crosses within an appropriate square or squares. It may not contain the ballot-number stub of the elector and remain valid. Nor may it have any other distinguishing marks capable of identifying the elector.' One defect on a ballot (not in respect of the vote for the <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>
      <em>particular </em>office which the appellant caused to be recounted) might invalidate that ballot in its entirety. It is manifest, therefore, that unless the ballots or facsimiles of them can be produced, it is not possible to have what can be thought to be a recount of the ballots; and such a recount was what the allowance of an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>in this case contemplated. That does not mean that, upon a recount for a particular office, the votes for all offices must be retabulated. But, if there is an invalidity in any part of a ballot, its effect on the whole ballot must be considered and correctly reflected. The illustration given in the majority opinion as to photostatic copies of ballots goes directly to the point here made. If such copies of the ballots were available and the ballots themselves had been lost or destroyed, the copies <em>would </em>constitute secondary evidence of the ballots and, as such, be admissible in the circumstances supposed. But, figures cannot in my opinion be said to be secondary evidence of the ballots.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[253,1309,1151,637]]]'>The importance of the question here involved ought not be obscured by the apparent merit of the appellant’s contention that more votes were cast for him than for his opponent. The principle which allows for the reconstruction of what ballots are supposed to show by making use of figures as to the number of ballot markings for a given office, which figures were obtained upon a recount that never legally achieved an effective role in the <em>official </em>canvass and return of the vote, is fraught with such possibilities of danger to the integrity of the ballot that I find myself unable to concur in the ruling now made by the majority.</p>

But, it is not to be overlooked that he has been far less than alert in protecting his rights. The equity which he stressed upon his application for leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>lay entirely in what others had failed to do in the discharge of their <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>official duties aud without consideration for -what <em>he </em>could have done but did not do. His most crucial dereliction-was, perhaps,, his failure to have the ballots preserved, as he could easily have done by an application to the court for an order to that effect: see Sec. 309 of the Act of 1937.</p>
