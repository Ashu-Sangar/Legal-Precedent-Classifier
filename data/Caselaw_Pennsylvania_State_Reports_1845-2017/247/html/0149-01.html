According to the evidence the girl was accompanied by henmother and they were about to board a Frankstown car in the City of Pittsburgh, at an hour in the evening, when the car was crowded and there were a large number of persons attempting to get on. The girl was assisted up the steps of the car by her mother and had hold with one hand of the small rail on the inside of the door. The door was thereupon closed, the little girl withdrawing her arm but her knee was caught by the doors, the result of which was to make her leg stiff and make her permanently lame. It did not appear whether the conductor saw the girl or not, and this does not seem to make any difference. The car was stopped at a proper place to take on passengers and a number of people were crowding into the car, and it. was negligence to close the door upon them without seeing that the doorway was <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>clear. We are unable to see any contributory negligence either on the part of the girl or her mother.</p>
