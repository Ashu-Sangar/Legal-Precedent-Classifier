    <p class="summary" id="b379-8" data-blocks='[["BL_379.8",379,[209,1185,1150,748]]]'>It seems the intention of the testator was to provide for his wife during widowhood by giving her the income of his whole estate, or, if she remarried, by giving her one-third absolutely, her life interest to terminate. In making this alternative provision, it is evident that the testator thought that if she remarried and thus terminated her life estate, she would still have an interest in his real estate, as he expressly stipulated the gift should “be in lieu of her dower at common law.” It must be presumed, however, that he knew that this interest would terminate at her death. The reason for making the gift would then be eliminated and the inference seems to be that the gift of one-third of his estate was conditional upon her remarriage.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[285,912,1162,1284]]]'>In discussing the question, Mr. Justice Rogers said: “The strict grammatical sense is not always regarded, but the words of a will may be transposed to make a limitation sensible and to carry into effect the general intention of the testator......Here the general intention of the testator was to make a comfortable provision for his daughter Ann during her life......It is contended that the words 'surviving heirs’ applies to her death as well as,marriage and that she is a surviving heir in the contemplation of the testator,., although she is dead. But this is a palpable absurdity for which no rational reason has been given; for there is nothing in the suggestion that the testator was desirous that she should have power to dispose of her share of the estate to those who might be heirs to her. Of this there is nothing in the will. It is but a fanciful notion resting, on conjecture merely. But by a transposition of the lan-. guage we give every word in the will its proper and legitimate signification. Thus by applying the words 'Ann to be considered as one of the heirs’ to her if she married, we effectuate the intention of the testator by giving her $500 and equal dividend of the property sold and thus producing an equality, as he intended, among his children.”</p>
