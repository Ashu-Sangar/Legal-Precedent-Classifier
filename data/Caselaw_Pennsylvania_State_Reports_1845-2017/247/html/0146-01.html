    <p class="summary" id="b181-4" data-blocks='[["BL_181.10",181,[169,1133,1151,1025]]]'>These cases were founded upon the same contract, being brought for installments falling due at different times. The action is founded upon a contract, a copy of which is attached to the statements of claim, between the plaintiff and Gulick, McNulty and Harry Davis, Gulick and McNulty being now dead and the action brought against their personal representatives, and Davis being discharged in bankruptcy. The plaintiffs were the managers and lessees of the Gayety Theater in Pittsburgh, and the defendants owned and controlled the Bijou and Alvin theaters in the same city. The agreement is to the effect that the plaintiffs should change the style of attraction then given at the Gayety and continue that change for six years, and that the defendants in consideration of their doing so were to pay them $10,000 a year in the event of the plaintiffs having no competition, and $15,000 a year if they had competition, it being now admitted that during the whole time there was competition.</p>

Testimony was offered by both parties as to what is meant in the theatrical world by “burlesque and burlesque combinations,” and it was claimed by the plaintiffs that the definition of these two terms was to be sought by ascertaining what attractions were being given at that time in the Star Theater, and that the contract meant that whatever was given in the Star Theater at that time was to be deemed to be burlesque and burlesque combinations ; while the defendants contended that the contract did not mean to define burlesque and burlesque combinations so as to include in it everything that was then given at the Star Theater, but only to designate the burlesque and burlesque combinations as being of the same kind as those which were then being given at that theater. Evidence was given tending tó show that the plaintiff had presented attractions at the Gayety Theater which were not within the definition of burlesque or burlesque combinations testified to by witnesses for the defendants. The whole matter was submitted to the jury and they found that the plaintiff had failed to keep its contract, and therefore found for the defendants.</p>
