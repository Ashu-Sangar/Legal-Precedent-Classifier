And by deed dated June 7th, 1836, said Darlington and his wife conveyed the undivided one-half of said tract of land to William Hays, of Pittsburgh, Pa. Some time between the time when Darlington acquired title to the land, and May 21, 1841, a small part of said tract was plotted into town lots with streets and alleys by said Hays and Darlington. The said plot was recorded in the recorder’s office of Beaver County, Pa., on May 21, 1841, in Deed Book Yol. T. 19, page 473. Upon the face <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>of the plot is written: “Plan of the Town of Mahoning, Beaver County, Pa.,” and in the deeds by Hays and Darlington for lots in this plan of lots the plot is referred to as the Darlington and Hays plan of lots in the Town of Mahoning. The plan does not show when it was made, but we conclude it was adopted by Hays and Darlington on June 7th or 8th, 1836, for the reason that Hays did not acquire title to the undivided one-half of the land until June 7,1836; and on June 8,1836, he and Darlington join in the conveyance of Lot No. 5 in said plan and use the following language: “Being lot No. 5, situate in said Benjamin Darlington and William Hays’ plan of lots in the Town of Mahoning,” thus indicating that on June 8,1836, when this deed was made, the plan had been adopted and it is scarcely probable that the plan was adopted by Hays until he acquired an interest in the land on June 7, 1836.</p>

L., 369, the Legislature of Pennsylvania incorporated the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company, and a canal was constructed through the lands of Darlington and Hays that was plotted into town lots. The evidence does not show when this canal was constructed nor do we know, but we conclude it was constructed before the land was plotted because the plan of lots shows the canal. The canal company took only an easement over the land under the Act of the Assembly (Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co. v. Bruce, <a href="/pa/102/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="102 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="502730" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0023-01">102 Pa. 23</a>,) and there is no evidence that it acquired a fee by gift or purchase. The fee therefore was in Hays and Darlington. The plan of Hays and Darlington embraced sixty-two lots with four parallel streets running north and south and three parallel streets running east and west with alleys in the rear of the lots. South of the canal were ten lots and but one of the streets running north and south, viz: Walnut street, is <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>shown south of the canal. This street runs between lots Nos. 36 and 37 south of the canal. All of these ten lots face on Lacock street, which runs east and west and is south of, parallel with, and contiguous to the canal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[308,564,1157,1785]]]'>Just north of the canal, parallel with and contiguous to it, is Canal street, upon which face fourteen lots, being the south row of lots in that part of the plan which lies north of the canal. The canal is indicated on the plot by four unbroken parallel lines running from east to west through the whole plan, the outside lines being 14-20 of an. inch from each other and the inside lines being 10-20 of an inch apart, while the space between the middle lines and the outside lines is 2-20 of an inch. Between the middle lines are written the words “crosscut canal” and we take it that the space between the middle lines was the canal bed, while the parallel strips on either side were the tow paths. Just next the towpath on the north is Canal street and next the towpath on the south is Lacock street. Three of the north and south streets, viz': Spruce, Cedar and Liberty streets are shown on the plan to begin at Canal street and extend northward to Cherry alley, — while Walnut street extends from said Cherry alley, southward to said Canal street, and then from Lacock street, which is just south of the canal southward between Lots Nos. 36 and 37. There are no lines drawn across the parallel lines indicating the canal, showing that Walnut street was continued as such over and upon the canal. The plot shows only that Walnut street opens into Canal street on the north and into Lacock street on the south, but does not show that it extended over and across the canal for the four parallel lines mentioned above as indicating the canal are unbroken, nor are there any intersecting lines at this point. From this plan we cannot say there is evidence of intention on the part of Darlington and Hays by platting to dedicate Walnut street upon and across the canal.</p>

But the plat does not show that it was a street — that it was dedicated as a street throughout its entire length including the space over the canal. The plat not showing this, then it is competent to show that there was such a user as would indicate an intention to dedicate the street over the canal. But was there such a user as would indicate such an intention at the time the several lots were sold by Darlington and Hays, or either of them, to their predecessors in title of the plaintiffs? Was the street used over and across the canal to such an extent that the predecessors in title of the plaintiffs had good reason to believe the street was dedicated to public use throughout its entire length? We think not. Prior to 1854 there was no street, at least there was no means of crossing over the canal at Walnut street. There was nothing upon the ground to indicate that the street was dedicated over and across the canal, nor did the plat show such a street at this point. But so far as the evidence goes, the title to the lots now owned by plaintiffs passed out of Darlington and Hays before that time. The deed from Darlington and Hays dated June 8, 1836, to James S. Crawford is the first, and that of Hays to James McCullough, dated November 12, 1847, is the last that was offered in evi<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>dence showing conveyances by Hays and Darlington, or either of them, to the predecessors in title of the plaintiffs. Up to 1854 there was no bridge over the canal at Walnut street, so that when the predecessors in title of the plaintiffs acquired title to their lots there was no street in use over the canal and they would have no right to conclude from a user that such a street had been dedicated from Hays and Darlington over the canal. There being no evidence by long continued use of a dedication of the street over the canal at the time the titles to the several lots of the plaintiffs passed out of Hays and Darlington, and the plot of said lands not showing an intention to so dedicate, we are led to the conclusion that Hays and Darlington did not dedicate Walnut Street over and across the canal, at least that such a dedication is not established by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
