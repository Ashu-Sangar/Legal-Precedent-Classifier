    <p class="summary" id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[296,462,1159,859]]]'>This will was evidently written by a lawyer. It is expressed clearly in apt words. It is unnecessary to supply any words to discover the testator’s intention. To hold that this is a devise to a class of persons at the death of the first taker, means that we must supply the words “survivor” or “survivors,” or say that when the testator devised to his “other children” in the several paragraphs of the will, he intended to say “my surviving child or children.” But when the testator used the descriptive words “my other children,” if we say that these were the equivalent of “surviving child or children,” it leads us to a point in the analysis of the will where “other children” refers to but one child, for, by the death of three in succession, but one was living, and to describe this one as “my other children,” is surely.an awkward way of saying “my surviving child.”</p>

If these were class devises who takes the fee?

This will, which is in all other respects expressed with finical precision, will not be mutilated so as to give its words a meaning which is not apparent. If the whole <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>will indicates that it was the testator’s intention that the estate devised should vest in a class of persons to be determined at the death of the first taker, the rules of law which aid in the construction of wills would not be invoked; but where that intention cannot be gathered from the whole will, it is our duty to apply the settled rules of construction and to interpret this will thereby.</p>

Hazeltine, the daughter is now deceased, and that to give effect to the testator’s use of the words “my children,” we must say that the words include granchildren as well; but this is not the proper construction. It is not necessary to hold that the word “children” includes “grandchildren” at all, for, if the estate vested at the testator’s death, it vested in all his children nominatim. Nor is there any significance favoring a class devise in the use of the term “at his death.” It cannot be said that the testator willed that this devise would vest “at the death” of the first taker; but it is clear that the testator intended that when the first taker was deceased, his child or children, if any, should take the fee which had vested “at his death,” and if the first taker had no “child or children” there was a remainder in fee in the testator’s “other children”: Bassett v.
