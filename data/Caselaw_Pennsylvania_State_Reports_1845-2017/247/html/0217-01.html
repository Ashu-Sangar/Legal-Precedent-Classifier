Whether a railroad company was negligent in running a locomotive without warning over a grade crossing, where the approach to the crossing was concealed by a building close to the track, and if negligent whether its negligence was the proximate cause of the death of a child of tender years who was struck by the locomotive in attempting to cross the track, were questions for the jury, where there was evidence that the child was familiar with locomotive signals and that none were given as the engine approached <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>and . though warned by a playmate started over the tracks declaring that he would “beat it across.” Because of the absence of signals the child might have believed that no locomotive was approaching, notwithstanding his playmate’s warning, and his expression as he started over might have been used in a slang sense and did not necessarily show that he was aware of the proximity of the train.</p>

    <p id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[290,1172,1158,1243]],["BL_255.1",255,[184,330,1151,1735]]]'>The question of the negligence of the defendant company was for the jury; but the appellant contends that, even though its negligence be admitted, yet, since one of the girls gave the boy warning of the approach of the train, it is clear the failure on its part to give such warning was not the proximate cause of the accident. In disposing of this contention, we cannot do better than to quote from the charge of the trial judge, where he stated, “If you find that the whistle was not blown or the bell rung, that would be an act of negligence...... but that would not warrant you in stopping there and saying ‘now the 'company is responsible,’ because there are other questions that you have to consider; for instance, the purpose of these signals is to give warning and if persons approaching a crossing receive warning, it does not make any difference whether the bell was rung or not......, and the railroad company says that because the plaintiffs’ witnesses have said that the children who were with this young boy told him at the time tjiat a train was coming,......it makes no difference whether the bell was rung or not. That would be true .......if this had been a grown person, but we leave it to you to say whether it is equally true in the case of this <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>child; would it have made any difference to the child if the bell had been rung and the whistle blown, and might that have stopped the child in his effort to cross the track? The child, it seems, had been living there for some time in the vicinity of this crossing; had he become familiar with the running of the trains and the signals that were usually given? Did he think, notwithstanding the fact that his playmate said to him, ‘the train is coming’ — ‘Well, I know the signals of the train and I will go on anyhow’? Was that what impelled him to cross the track? All these things are for your consideration......If you find that the signals were not given and that the child was thereby induced to go across this track because of the absence of such signals ......that would charge this company with negligence.” On the other hand, the jury were told that if they found to the contrary their verdict should be for the defendant. Thus it may be seen that the questions of the defendant’s negligence and whether or not it was the proximate cause of the accident were both submitted fairly to the jury and answered against the appellant. None of the children actually saw the approaching train, and it well may be that this little boy did not appreciate the danger of the situation as he would have done had he heard the bell or whistle of the locomotive. His alleged remark to the effect that he would “beat it across” may have had no connection with the train; as contended by the appellees, it might have been a mere use of the slang expression “beat it,” meaning to get away quickly — here, to get across the track quickly without reference to the train; however that may be, the whole matter was properly placed before the jury.</p>

The parents were poor working people; there was no testimony concerning the mother, and while the father was at. home and knew that his child was playing in the street, yet the boy was with other children, several of whom were old enough to take charge of him.
