    <p class="summary" id="Aj83" data-blocks='[["BL_496.16",496,[282,1509,1159,913]]]'>Prom the record it appears that Charles F. Walthers entered into a contract on April 18, 1911, with the Borough of McKees Rocks to construct a garbage incinerator for $4,600. Certain amounts for extras were to be paid if approved by the borough engineers, and those furnished were so approved. On July 26th the borougstarted to burn garbage in the furnace and continuously did so until November 22d, but during that time made no test to determine whether the furnace would burn ten tons in ten hours as required by the contract. Defendant contended that the incinerator did not have the capacity for doing the work, and that due to negligence in construction there were cracks in the furnace and the roof broke in. Plaintiff introduced evidence showing that the borough had operated the furnace with inexperienced servants and in a negligent manner, thus producing the defects complained of.</p>

      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>On the question of substantial performance the trial judge charged the jury as follows: “If he (plaintiff) used improper materials, or constructed this improperly, then he has failed in his contract, and yet if he substantially performed it, he would be entitled to recover. That is, if it was a comparatively unimportant matter that could be remedied and charged up against him, where evidence could have been given here of how much it would cost, then he would be entitled to recover, because we have not that evidence. And the same principle, without going into it, applies to the question of the cracks. On the question of the capacity, the test is not what was actually done there, but what could be done if properly handled — if the furnace was properly handled. If it had the capacity to do ten tons in ten hours, that is the end of it, whether it did it or not.”</p>
