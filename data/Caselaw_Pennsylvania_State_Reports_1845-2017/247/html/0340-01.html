    <p class="summary" id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[202,869,1150,369]]]'>On the part of the contestants, Doctor Bansom, who attended the decedent for a short period some three months before he died, the treatment being for an ulcer, stated that the decedent suffered from paresis. He did not give a fact upon which to base it other than that the pupils of his eyes were dilated. He detailed no act, conversation or habit, upon which to base his conclusion.</p>

Beyond stating that the testator was sick; that at times he did not know whom he conversed with; that he did not seem to be properly cared for, no fact is deducible from the nature and character of their testimony, showing either undue influence or want of testamentary capacity at the time the will was made.</p>

Neither from the nature of her testimony nor the manner of testifying, can any weight be given to her statements. She is manifestly mistaken with respect to the date when she says the will was signed, it clearly being a much later period when a note transaction took place.</p>

He made special examination with respect to possible mental trouble, knowing the past history of the decedent and fully described the tests which he applied for loco-motor ataxia, paresis, and like affections; from these; and from the circumstances and facts, conversations and instructions passing between him and the decedent, he was emphatic in stating that the testator’s mental faculties were unimpaired.</p>

It was explained to the testator that none of the banks in which his moneys were deposited acted in the capacity of executor, whereupon testator called to mind one of the principal officers in the bank in which was his largest deposit; with this officer, Mr. Fendrich, the testator was acquainted and expressed a preference that he should act as executor. The scrivener by the direction of the testator saw this official; he called at the testator’s house on the 7th of February, where after conversation, testator expressly requested Mr. Fendrich to act as executor. The latter stated that he seemed to be in perfect mental health, although weak physically; he recalled particularly Mr. Wiles’ request to see that $500 of money were sent to him at once, and outlined the manner in which it should be drawn, explaining for what purpose he needed it.</p>

There is enough in the testimony to indicate that the surroundings and their manner of living is not worthy of emulation; but, there is nothing to indicate from the evidence any influence exerted by her over him which in any way constrained his will. Meretricious relationship of itself is no such evidence.</p>
