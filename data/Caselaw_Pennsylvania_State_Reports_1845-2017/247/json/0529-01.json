The life tenant died without children, being pre-deeeased by his sister, one of testator\u2019s three children named in the above provision. It was contended by the two children of the testator who survived the life tenant that they were entitled to the remainder, to the exclusion of the children of their deceased sister. Held, the court did not err in decreeing that the two children of the testator surviving the life tenant were each entitled to one-third of the fund and that the remaining one-third be divided among the children of their deceased sister.\nArgued Oct. 26, 1914.\nAppeals, Nos. 110 and 111, Oct. T., 1914, by Robert W. Patterson and Thomas H. Patterson, from decree of O. O. Allegheny Co., Sept. T., 1913, No. 391,' distributing fund in Estate of Joseph Patterson, deceased.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Potter, Elkin and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Trimble, J., filed the following opinion:\nJoseph Patterson died March 25th, 1868, testate, and by his will made the following devise, inter alia:\n\u201cSeventh. I give and devise......to my son, Joseph N. Patterson, for and during his natural life, and at his death, I devise the same to his child or children in equal parts in fee, and in default of such, then to my other children, Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, Thomas H. Patterson and Robert W. Patterson, in equal parts in fee.\u201d\nBy three other devises, similar in expression, he gave to his daughter, Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, and to his other two sons, Thomas H. Patterson and Robert W. Patterson, other portions of his estate.\nThe testator left to*survive him the following:\nFirst, (a) Hetty H. Patterson, his wife, who died April 9th, 1909;\n(b) Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, daughter, who was born September ...., 1840, and died March 29th, 1891;\n(c) Joseph N. Patterson, a son, who was born December 24th, 1843, and died April 5th, 1913, without issue;\n(d) Thomas H. Patterson, a son, who was born March 1st, 1849, and is still living;\n(e) Robert W. Patterson, a son, who was born December 28th, 1850, and is still living.\nSecond. Elizabeth H. Hazeltine had three children and died intestate, leaving two children and her husband surviving as follows:\n(a) Her husband, Charles F. Hazeltine, who is still living;\n(b) Esther H. Hazeltine, born April ...., 1864, and who married Charles S. Carstairs, from whom she was subsequently divorced, and thereafter married Felix F. Tuckerman, and who died January 15th, 1907, leaving to survive her husband, Felix L. Tuckerman, who is still living, and the following children, viz: Charles Hazeltine Carstairs, Carroll C. Carstairs, James Steward Carstairs and Elizabeth Holmes Carstairs, who are living and of full age.\n(c) Miss L. S. Hazeltine, born December 29th, 1867, and died February____, 1882;\n(d) Caroline M. Hazeltine, born September____, 1873 (now Caroline H. Valentine), who intermarried with Abram S. Valentine, and is still living.\nA petition was presented to this court under the Price Act for the sale of a portion of the land devised by the seventh paragraph of the testator\u2019s will to Joseph N. Patterson, for his life, and after all the interested parties were brought upon the record, the trustee, who was appointed to make the sale, consummated it. Joseph N. Patterson the devisee of the life estate having died on the 5th of April, 1913, the trustee filed its account, and one-half of the balance of said account is now before the court for its determination of the ownership thereof.\nThe question involved is whether a fee vested in Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, Thomas H. Patterson and Robert W. Patterson at the death of the testator under said paragraph of his will; or whether when this devise is considered in connection with the devises of the sixth, eighth and ninth paragraphs, the fee vested in the testator\u2019s children as a class at the death of the first takes in default of issue.\nThis will was evidently written by a lawyer. It is expressed clearly in apt words. It is unnecessary to supply any words to discover the testator\u2019s intention. To hold that this is a devise to a class of persons at the death of the first taker, means that we must supply the words \u201csurvivor\u201d or \u201csurvivors,\u201d or say that when the testator devised to his \u201cother children\u201d in the several paragraphs of the will, he intended to say \u201cmy surviving child or children.\u201d But when the testator used the descriptive words \u201cmy other children,\u201d if we say that these were the equivalent of \u201csurviving child or children,\u201d it leads us to a point in the analysis of the will where \u201cother children\u201d refers to but one child, for, by the death of three in succession, but one was living, and to describe this one as \u201cmy other children,\u201d is surely.an awkward way of saying \u201cmy surviving child.\u201d\nAgain if three of the children have issue and are deceased, and the fourth dies childless, what becomes of the fee of the land in which this fourth child has a life estate? If these were class devises who takes the fee? It must be the sister and brothers as remaindermen, and then so interpreted, his description of those who take the fee as \u201cmy other children\u201d has a certain and sensibl\u00e9 meaning, but if we say that \u201cmy other children\u201d means the survivor or survivors living at the termination of the life estate, and there is no survivor, the absurdity proves that it is a false deduction.\nIt was very easy for the testator to say that this devise was to take effect at the termination of the life estate, and to vest in his child or children then surviving; and we believe that if it had been his intention that this devise should vest in a class of persons he would have used language which would have left no- doubt about it. This will, which is in all other respects expressed with finical precision, will not be mutilated so as to give its words a meaning which is not apparent. If the whole will indicates that it was the testator\u2019s intention that the estate devised should vest in a class of persons to be determined at the death of the first taker, the rules of law which aid in the construction of wills would not be invoked; but where that intention cannot be gathered from the whole will, it is our duty to apply the settled rules of construction and to interpret this will thereby.\nIn support of the affirmative that the devise is to vest in the testator\u2019s surviving child or children after the termination of the life estate, it is argued that the fee must vest in grandchildren, because Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, the daughter is now deceased, and that to give effect to the testator\u2019s use of the words \u201cmy children,\u201d we must say that the words include granchildren as well; but this is not the proper construction. It is not necessary to hold that the word \u201cchildren\u201d includes \u201cgrandchildren\u201d at all, for, if the estate vested at the testator\u2019s death, it vested in all his children nominatim. Nor is there any significance favoring a class devise in the use of the term \u201cat his death.\u201d It cannot be said that the testator willed that this devise would vest \u201cat the death\u201d of the first taker; but it is clear that the testator intended that when the first taker was deceased, his child or children, if any, should take the fee which had vested \u201cat his death,\u201d and if the first taker had no \u201cchild or children\u201d there was a remainder in fee in the testator\u2019s \u201cother children\u201d: Bassett v. Hawk, 118 Pa. 94; Chew\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 23.\nNor can it be said that the word \u201cthen\u201d is a temporary adverb, signifying the time when the fee would vest. It is a conjunction and is synonymous with \u201cin that case.\u201d\nMoreover when the testator named his children in whom the fee would vest in default of issue to the first taker, he showed clearly that he did not intend that this devise was to a class of persons.\nIn Williams v. Neff, 52 Pa. 326, quoting from page 333, the court says:\n\u201cThere is no survivorship, for it is not given to his sons as a class, but to them and each by his own name; as the term sons simply identifies the individual persons meant.\u201d\nAnd in Harrison\u2019s Est., 18 Pa. Superior Ct. 588, on page 593, it is said:\n\u201cWhen the devise is to a person by name, it is conclusive as to the intention of the testator that the person should take, and the intention of the testator being-established, the subject of the devise or bequest will upon the death of the testator be good and available in favor of the issue, when the primary devisee or legatee has died during the lifetime of the testator.\u201d\nThe cases relied upon by counsel pressing this view of the case, are Woelpper\u2019s App., 126 Pa. 562, and Steinmetz\u2019s Est., 194 Pa. 611. But it is apparent that these eases are widely divergent from this case, because the testator plainly expressed that the fee should vest in the surviving members of the classes which were to be determined after the death of the owner of the life estate.\nWhen we interpret the seventh clause of testator\u2019s will, standing alone, it is as near parallel to the case of Bassett v. Hawk, 118 Pa. 94, as will cases are likely to be. In that case the devise was as follows:\n\u201cTo my son Daniel, to his use as long as he shall live and to his legal heirs, if he have any, at his death; if my son, Daniel, do not have any legal heirs at his death, then, and in that case.-----1 will it to be given to my grandchildren, Charlotte, Mary and Columbus.\u201d\nIt was decided that the remainder was in abeyance until the decease of the life tenant, and that the contingency was not attached to the capacity of the remaindermen to take, but to an event independent of and not affecting either their capacity to take, or to transmit the right to their representatives. In reaching this conclusion the court relied upon Kelso v. Dickey, 7 W. & S. 279, and Chess\u2019 App., 87 Pa. 362.\nPennock v. Eagles, 102 Pa. 290, followed in Hyde v. Rainey, 233 Pa. 540, is to the same effect.\nMany, cases can be found in which it is held that the law favors vested estates rather than those which are contingent: Chew\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 23; Bradley\u2019s Est., 166 Pa. 300.\nOur conclusion is that Joseph Patterson devised an estate for life to his son Joseph N. Patterson, the fee to the life tenant\u2019s children, if any, and if not, to the testator\u2019s other children nominatim. The owner of the life estate having died childless, the remainder which was vested in the testator\u2019s children at his death, became absolute, and distribution of the fund realized will be made to the children of Elizabeth H. Hazeltine, one third; Thomas H. Patterson, one third; and Robert W. Patterson, one-third.\nThe court decreed that of the fund realized one-third should be paid to Thomas H. Patterson; one-third to Robert W. Patterson, and one-third to the children of Elizabeth H. Hazeltine. Robert W. Patterson and Thomas H. Patterson appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was the decree of the court.\nJ. M. Freeman, of Watson & Freeman, with him John Cadwalader, Harry F. Stambaugh, and Patterson, Crawford, Miller & Arensberg, for appellants.\nE. W. Smith, of Reed, Smith, Shaw & Beal, with him Henry C. Quinby, Q. Plant\u00f3n Middleton, John Blakeley, and John F.
