J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the plaintiff at the time of the accident had been ordered by the defendant firm to put tile upon, and around the base, of a column in a building which was being altered and repaired; that in the floor there were a number of holes and that when the plaintiff went to work he noticed the holes, endeavored to cover them and then went to work. After working three-quarters of an hour he stepped into one of the holes and was seriously hurt; he explained that he had overlooked this hole because it was in the dark.\nAt the close of the plaintiffs case the court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in refusing to take oil the nonsuit.\nCharles E. Asnis, Avith him David Bortin, Jacob \u25a0Singer and Emanuel Eurth, for appellant.\nA. L.
