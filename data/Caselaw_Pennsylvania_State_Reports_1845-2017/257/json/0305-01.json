Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, Appellant.\nWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act \u2014 Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board \u2014Findings of fact \u2014 Appeal.\nUnder Section 409 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P.'L. 736, findings of fact by a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board upon appeal from a referee are final and cannot be disturbed by the courts.\nArgued Feb. 13, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 372, Jan. T., 1916, by defendant, from, order of C. P. Schuylkill Co., July T., 1916, No. 319, dismissing appeal from Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, in case of Frances Polusldewicz v. The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from finding of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.\nBechtel, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThis case comes before us on an appeal taken from the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board by the defendant. The appellant files six exceptions to the decision of the board. These six exceptions involve but one question \u25a0 whether or not the facts warranted the findings by the referee and the compensation board.\nThe referee found the facts against the defendant and allowed compensation. The defendant, thereupon, appealed to the compensation board which sustained the findings of the referee. It, thereupon, took an appeal to this court. The plaintiff claims, that the court has no jurisdiction to reverse the findings of fact made by the referee and the compensation board. Even if we had jurisdiction .to revise the findings as made in this case, we feel, in the absence of any express provision in the act of assembly that our actions should be governed by the rules laid down by our higher courts, relative to the findings of fact in equity cases. It is a well settled doctrine that in the absence of fraud or a gross abuse of discretion, the appellate court will not reverse the findings of fact by a chancellor, and it has been held that these findings should be sustained if there be any evidence to justify such action. We would hesitate to go that far with this record.\nSection 409 of the Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, provides: \u201cA referee\u2019s finding of fact shall be final unless the board shall allow an appeal therefrom as hereinafter provided. The board\u2019s findings of fact shall in all cases be final. From the referee\u2019s decision on any question of law an appeal may be taken to the board and from any decision of the board on a question of law an appeal may be taken to the courts as herein provided.\u201d\nSection 419 provides for an appeal by the aggrieved party to the board on two grounds, the second of which is \u201cthat the findings of fact and ruling or disallowance of compensation were unwarranted by the evidence,\u201d and Section 421 defines the powers of the board relative to such appeals. Section 425 provides for the method of hearing appeals taken from the board to the courts, but distinctly limits such appeals to questions on matters of law. We, nowhere in the act, find any express provision authorizing the courts to reverse the findings of fact of the compensation board. It is very significant that the act provides that the board\u2019s findings shall be final in all cases and that in the section providing for an appeal to the courts, distinctly states, on questions involving matters of law. We do not think that it was the intention of the legislature, nor do we think that the plain language of the act giVes to the courts the right to reverse the findings of fact of the compensation board. That is the one question involved in this case.\nThe court dismissed the appeal. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in dismissing the appeal.\nGeorge Goioen Parry and John P. Whalen\u25a0, with them George Ellis, for appellant.\nM. A. Kilker, for appellee.\nMarch 23, 1917 :"
