        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nOn October 16, 1915, plhintiff, while a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s electric street railway cars, was injured by a collision which occurred near the City of Chester between the car and another car on the same track. Plaintiff was standing in the aisle and the collision caused him to fall, by which he sustained some \u25a0 injury to his arm and head. On the next day, Sunday, one of the defendant\u2019s claim agents called on plaintiff at his home in Milmont and secured from him for the consideration of $15 what purports to be a full and complete release for all damages resulting to plaintiff from the accident. The release, .admittedly signed by plaintiff, was supported by the testimony of the claim agent, which was to the effect that after some negotiations they agreed upon $15 as the amount of damages, which was paid to plaintiff and the release executed. The agent and a daughter-in-law of plaintiff signed same as witnesses. At the argument some doubt was expressed as to the validity of the release because given on Sunday. But if the transaction ^pas completed by the execution and delivery of the release and payment of the consideration it became an executed contract and binding upon the parties. The law will not lend its aid to enforce an executory contract made on Sunday; but if fully executed on that day, the law leaves the parties where it finds them and gives no relief to either.\n\u201cAn executed contract is a contract which has been fully performed since it was made, or which was performed at the time it was made so that nothing remains to be done on either side.\u201d 9 Cyc. 244.\nA judgment- entered upon a warrant of attorney contained in a note given on Sunday will not be opened: McKee v. Verner, 239 Pa. 69; Baker v. Lukens, 35 Pa. 146. Where property is sold, delivered and paid for on Sunday the transaction is valid: Chestnut v. Marbaugh et al., 78 Pa. 473. The delivery on Sunday of a deed previously made will pass title to the property: Shuman v. Shuman, 27 Pa. 90.\nAccording to the evidence for defendant, the release here in question was executed and delivered and the consideration paid, and, if so, nothing further remained to be done and the transaction was closed. Under such circumstances in our opinion the contract although made on Sunday is executed and binding upon the parties, and if otherwise valid discharged the defendant from liability to the plaintiff on account of the matters therein stated. However, plaintiff seeks to avoid the effect of such release by the averment, supported by some testimony, that he was on that day mentally incompetent to execute a release; and that as a result of said injury to his head he became so dazed and mentally confused as to wholly incapacitate him from doing any business; and that such condition long continued. Some of the medical evidence on behalf of the plaintiff tends to show that he is still suffering from traumatic-hysteria or traumatic-neurosis. Admittedly he had prior to the accident, and now has in a more advanced stage, arterio-sclerosis; and defendant\u2019s medical evidence tends to show that his mental impairment is the natural result of that disease. Dr. Taylor, the family physician, was called to- see plaintiff on the-day after the release was signed. He was a witness for plaintiff, and during the course of his examination in chief was interrogated as follows, viz:\n\u201cQ. \u2014 Between three and four on Sunday, the seventeenth \u2014 from the history of the case, as you have it, and from the testimony of the witnesses on the stand, and from what you learned that day and saw of him that day, from your examination, was or was not Mr. Williams mentally capable on Sunday, the seventeenth, to know the contents of a paper?\nBy Mr. Schaffer: That is objected to......\nBy Mr. Alexander: In your opinion, doctor, was Mr. Williams on the seventeenth of- \u2014 taking into consideration what you know about the case\u2014\nBy the Court: You have .already preceded that with what occurred, and what he saw?\nBy Mr. Alexander: And what is the testimony here as to his condition \u2014 was he able to comprehend by reading a paper or by having somebody read it to him, the contents, the purports of a paper?.......\nBy the witness: On Monday, the eighteenth, at 5: 30, when I examined him, I should say he was not responsible.\nBy the Court: You mean he was not responsible?\nA. \u2014 He was not responsible to know what he would be reading or signing. I saw him at 5: 30 on Monday.\nQ. \u2014 That is not quite the question that is asked you. Mr. Alexander asks you from what yo.u saw of him then, observing his mental condition, and from what you have heard of this testimony here, whether or not you are able to say \u2014 express any opinion about his capacity to understand a paper read to him or submitted to him to' be read by himself? A. \u2014 I should say he was not......\nBy Mr. Alexander: That is, you say, on the seventeenth, he was not? A. \u2014 In my judgment.\u201d\nThis examination was taken under objection and exception,. and constitutes the third assignment of error. Plaintiff\u2019s mental ability to transact business at the time he signed the release was a vital question in the case, and was for the jury under the evidence; and yet, as to that, the doctor was permitted to express an opinion under such circumstances as to render it impossible to know upon what such opinion was based. From the course of the examination it may have been upon information communicated to the doctor on the day of his visit; we do hot know what nor by whom; it may have been upon some evidence which he heard in court; we do not know to what part if any of the evidence he had listened; or it may have been upon kis own professional examination of the plaintiff. A question calling for an opinion should be so framed as to indicate the basis upon which the opinion is sought, so that the court may determine its competency and the jury its value. In such case, questions including both competent and incompetent sources of information as the basis of the opinion sought are bad. It follows, that the admission of the opinion of Dr. Taylor, under the circumstances disclosed, was prejudicial error.\nThe learned trial judge was right in holding that if plaintiff was injured in the collision, and had not released his right of action, he was entitled to recover; as there is a prima facie presumption of negligence against a street railway company where a passenger is hurt by a collision of its cars: Madara v. Shamokin & Mt. Carmel Elect. Ry. Co., 192 Pa. 542; Abel v. Northampton Traction Co., 212 Pa. 329, 336. The nature of plaintiff\u2019s malady, and to what extent if at all it is referable to the accident, are questions for the jury. Of course, under no aspect of the case can defendant be held liable for the arterio-sclerosis with which plaintiff was afflicted before the accident, nor for its natural progress thereafter.\nThere was some evidence that the accident had left plaintiff in a hazy mental condition, from which at the time of tl)ie trial he had not recovered; and also that as a result of the accident he had the nervous trouble above mentioned, and that his prospects for recovery were not favorable. While this was strongly contradicted, we cannot say that the court erred in submitting to the jury the question of damages for future pain, suffering and inconvenience. In an action for personal injuries, evidence tending to show mental and nervous impairment, as a result of the accident complained of, is for the jury, although it may seem improbable and be strongly contradicted.\nThat part of the charge embraced in the eighth assignment of error, referring to the question of damages, is subject to criticism. The thought in the mind of the court does not seem to find expression in the language as reported. However, that and any inadequacy in the charge can be corrected on another trial.\nTbe assignments of error except as herein stated are not sustained.\nThe judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.",

The law will not lend its aid to enforce an executory contract made on Sunday, but if fully executed on that day the law leaves the parties where it finds them and gives no relief to either.\n\u00a12. A release of damages, although executed and delivered and the consideration paid on Sunday, if otherwise valid, discharges the releasee from liability to the releasor on account of the matters therein contained.\n3. In an action to recover damages from.a street railway company for personal injuries sustained by a passenger of a trolley car in a collision, where defendant relied upon a release of all damages,' obtained by defendant\u2019s claim agent shortly after the accident, but where plaintiff sought\" to avoid the effect of the release by averring that on the day when the release was executed he was mentally incompetent to transact'business of any kind, it was reversible error to permit the physician who examined the witness the day after the release was signed to express his opinion as to plaintiff\u2019s mental condition at the time of the signing of the release, in the absence of anything to show-upon what information the physician based his opinion. .\n4. As there is a prima facie presumption of negligence against a street railway company where a passenger is hurt in a collision, the trial judge in such case properly -decided that if the plaintiff was injured in a collision, and had-not released his right of action, he was prima facie entitled to recover, and that the nature of plaintiff\u2019s malady, and to what extent, if at all, it was referrable to the accident, were questions for the jury.\nDamages \u2014 Future pain, suffering and inconvenience.\n5.

Schaffer, with him John J. Stetser, for appellant.\n\u2014 The evidence of plaintiff\u2019s mental impairment at the time when he executed the lease was not sufficient to warrant its submission to the jury: Laird v. Union Traction Co., 208 Pa. 574; Spritzer v. Penna. R. R. Co., 226 Pa. 166; Baranski v. Wilmsen, 56 Pa. Superior Ct. 153; Penna. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198; DeDouglas v.
