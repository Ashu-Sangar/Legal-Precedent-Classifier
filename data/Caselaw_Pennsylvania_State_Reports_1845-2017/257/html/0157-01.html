There was one seat on the truck and this was too small for three men to sit on comfortably and leave room for the driver to operate the car. Plaintiff, who was the last, of the three men to get on the truck, first sat partly on the center of the seat between the driyer and the other occupant of the <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>car and partly on the latter’s lap. There was a canvas curtain on the front of the car with mica squares in front on a line with the driver’s eyes. Plaintiff testified that from his elevated position on the seat his head was too high for him to see through the mica square in the curtain and as it was necessary to him to' be on the lookout, as the exact location of the fire was not known, he assumed a seat on the floor of the truck with his legs hanging over the ledge of the body of the car, but not extending out as far as the wheels. His legs were sufficiently far from the front wheel and axle that had the wheel turned against the body of the car it could not have touched his legs or feet.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[263,1027,1151,754]]]'>The defendant’s large oil tank truck approached the gas company’s truck from the opposite direction, and although it was six o’clock and dark plaintiff and his companion noticed the defendant’s truck when the two cars were 500 feet apart. Although the evidence was undisputed to the effect that the small truck approached on its right side of the highway and gave ample room for the large truck to pass, a collision occurred between the two machines, the left hind wheel of the defendant’s truck striking the hub cap of the left front wheel of the small truck, forcing the front axle of the latter from its fastenings and pushing it back so that the wheel or axle pressed the plaintiff’s leg against the body of the small truck and seriously injuring it.</p>
