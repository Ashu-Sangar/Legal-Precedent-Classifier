Nothing more appears from the evidence than that certain administrative officers of the city had permitted the temporary use of part of the property by the Play Ground Association for playground purposes. But this was not sufficient for recovery by the plaintiffs. The defendant is a city of the second class, governed by the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, which provides that it shall have the power to lease, sell, and convey its real property, to make all contracts in relation thereto, to provide and enforce suitable general market regulations, to contract with any person or persons, or association of persons, companies or corporations, for the erection, and regulations of market houses and market places, on such terms and conditions, and in such manner as councils may prescribe. This legislation places the custody of market house property in the exclusive control of councils, and the disposition,' regulation and use of the same can be effected only by the corporate act of councils and the mayor, by an ordinance <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>duly enacted. There is no proof whatever that the councils authorized the acts upon which the plaintiffs rely for recovery, either directly or by any delegation of power to an administrative officer; and it cannot be successfully contended that the unauthorized act of an administrative officer of a municipality can divest its title to valuable property. As plaintiffs are claiming a forfeiture, they must clearly and strictly establish it. Courts of law lean against it, and it is so odious in equity that it will be enforced only in a clear case, and never in a doubtful one: Newman v.

Though the record is voluminous and the assignments of error very numerous, the whole situation is thus well briefly summarized by the learned court below in its opinion denying the motions for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto: “The plaintiffs’ case then rests on an attempt to show that the councils and mayor had notice of and ratified the temporary and unauthorized use, and thereby committed a breach of the condition of the deed and a forfeiture of the title. Much latitude was given in the reception of evidence in order to show notice, if any, to council and the mayor or of any affirmative act on the part of the proper constituted authority of the city that would show any ratification of the <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>temporary use of the land for playground purposes. The evidence shows that no notice of any kind was given to or received by council for the use of the land for playground purposes or-that any action was ever taken in relation to the use of the land for other purposes than those of a market house. The only affirmative act of the council which had any indirect bearing on the issue involved was that council made general appropriations in quite large amounts for recreation grounds or recreation purposes; for example, in the year 1910 the sum of $65,610 was an item in the gen-eral appropriation bill for recreation grounds. No appropriation was ever made by council to any playground association. The city had a number of recreation grounds and they were located in many different places within the city limits. The only specific act in relation to the matter of appropriations and to the playground association is the drawing of small amounts on request of the playground association that the controller considered, and that actually was, a trespasser on the city property. There is no evidence in the case that council had any knowledge when the appropriations were made that any part of the Adams market property was being used for playground purposes. The burden was on the plaintiff to show that this particular playground was included as one of the particular subjects of the appropriation for recreation grounds. The city defendant cannot be bound by an unauthorized act of the city controller or his interpretation of his authority in. paying out money on a question affecting the city’s right to its real estate which would cause a forfeiture thereof.
