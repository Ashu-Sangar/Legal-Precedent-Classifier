    <p id="b391-3" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[179,389,1161,1409]]]'>On October 16, 1915, plhintiff, while a passenger on one of the defendant’s electric street railway cars, was injured by a collision which occurred near the City of Chester between the car and another car on the same track. Plaintiff was standing in the aisle and the collision caused him to fall, by which he sustained some ■ injury to his arm and head. On the next day, Sunday, one of the defendant’s claim agents called on plaintiff at his home in Milmont and secured from him for the consideration of $15 what purports to be a full and complete release for all damages resulting to plaintiff from the accident. The release, .admittedly signed by plaintiff, was supported by the testimony of the claim agent, which was to the effect that after some negotiations they agreed upon $15 as the amount of damages, which was paid to plaintiff and the release executed. The agent and a daughter-in-law of plaintiff signed same as witnesses. At the argument some doubt was expressed as to the validity of the release because given on Sunday. But if the transaction ^pas completed by the execution and delivery of the release and payment of the consideration it became an executed contract and binding upon the parties. The law will not lend its aid to enforce an executory contract made on Sunday; but if fully executed on that day, the law leaves the parties where it finds them and gives no relief to either.</p>

    <p id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[278,444,1157,1349]]]'>According to the evidence for defendant, the release here in question was executed and delivered and the consideration paid, and, if so, nothing further remained to be done and the transaction was closed. Under such circumstances in our opinion the contract although made on Sunday is executed and binding upon the parties, and if otherwise valid discharged the defendant from liability to the plaintiff on account of the matters therein stated. However, plaintiff seeks to avoid the effect of such release by the averment, supported by some testimony, that he was on that day mentally incompetent to execute a release; and that as a result of said injury to his head he became so dazed and mentally confused as to wholly incapacitate him from doing any business; and that such condition long continued. Some of the medical evidence on behalf of the plaintiff tends to show that he is still suffering from traumatic-hysteria or traumatic-neurosis. Admittedly he had prior to the accident, and now has in a more advanced stage, arterio-sclerosis; and defendant’s medical evidence tends to show that his mental impairment is the natural result of that disease. Dr. Taylor, the family physician, was called to- see plaintiff on the-day after the release was signed. He was a witness for plaintiff, and during the course of his examination in chief was interrogated as follows, viz:</p>

Plaintiff’s mental ability to transact business at the time he signed the release was a vital question in the case, and was for the jury under the evidence; and yet, as to that, the doctor was permitted to express an opinion under such circumstances as to render it impossible to know upon what such opinion was based. From the course of the examination it may have been upon information communicated to the doctor on the day of his visit; we do hot know what nor by whom; it may have been upon some evidence which he heard in court; we do not know to what part if any of the evidence he had listened; or it may have been upon kis own professional examination of the plaintiff. A question calling for an opinion should be so framed as to indicate the basis upon which the opin<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ion is sought, so that the court may determine its competency and the jury its value.
