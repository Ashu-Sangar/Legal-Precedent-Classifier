One of two sureties on the bond of a treasurer of a corporation made a loan of $5,000 to the corporation on the latter’s note. Subsequently such surety made an assignment of his property, including the $5,000 note, to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors. A receiver, appointed for the corporation, filed an account and an auditor was appointed to make distribution. The treasurer of the company in the meantime had defaulted and the corporation brought suit against the treasurer and his two sureties. The estate of the second surety paid the amount of the default. The executors of the second surety contended that they were entitled to be subrogated to the right of the other surety for the amount of the dividend awarded by the auditor on the $5,000 note, in preference to the other surety’s general creditors whose claims arose <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>before the treasurer defaulted. <em>Held, </em>that as the dividend on the $5,000 note was an entirely separate matter from the suretyship obligation, the estate of the surety who had paid the principal debt was merely a general creditor of the other surety and had no preference in such dividend over the latter’s other creditors.</p>

On April 28,1913, receivers were appointed for the Fibre Specialty Company, a corporation. Prior thereto, on. July 23, 1912, the company for value gave George W. Taft a demand note for $5,000. J. W. Brainard was official treasurer of the company; and in 1903 gave a bond in $5,000, with Taft and James W. Worrall (now deceased) as sureties, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties as such treasurer. June 26, 1913, Mr. <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>Taft made an assignment of his estate, specifically including the $5,000 note, to Harry W. Chalfant, for benefit of creditors. In 1914, the receivers filed an account and an auditor was appointed to make distribution thereof; to whom the Taft note was presented by the assignee, and a dividend amounting to $2,157.15 awarded thereon. Mr. Brainard while treasurer of the company made default, by reason of which the receivers brought suit against him and Ms sureties on the bond in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, at the January term, 1915, and recovered a verdict for $3,-809.02, on which judgment was entered and affirmed by this court, in case of Marshall v. Brainard, <a href="/pa/253/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="253 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1024035" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0035-01">253 Pa. 35</a>. Brainard and Taft being insolvent, this judgment was, on April 20, 1916, paid by appellants as executors of James M. Worrall, deceased; to whom one-half of the judgment was thereupon assigned.</p>

The receivers in a subsequent final account charged themselves with the $2,157.15 dividend, which the auditor thereafter awarded appellants by way of contribution from Taft as their cosurety. The learned court below sustained exceptions to the auditor’s report, and by final decree ordered the dividend paid to Chalfant on the Taft note. And from that decree this appeal was taken. The $5,000 note was a matter entirely separate and apart from the treasurer’s bond and had no connection with Mr. Brainard or Ms account with the company. Appellant’s right to contribution or subrogation arose when they paid the judgment. Then they were equitably entitled to an assignment of the judgment, and also of any collateral or other property held by the receivers to secure the payment of the bond. But they were not entitled to the divi<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>dend awarded to the Taft note as that was an entirely separate matter. The note was a part of Taft’s general estate and appellants had no .special equity in that. Except as to matters connected with the bond appellants are merely creditors of Taft to one-half the amount they paid on account of the surety bond; and they only became such creditors when they paid the judgment on April 20, 1916. Prior to that time they had no claim against Taft. See Modern American Law, Vol. VIII, page 224.</p>
