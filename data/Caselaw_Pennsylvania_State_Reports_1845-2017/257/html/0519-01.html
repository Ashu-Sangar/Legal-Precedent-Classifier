They planned to ride a certain freight train without paying their fares. They entered the train yard by the street entrance, passed the railroad watchman, asked him about the train, walked to a nearby point in the yard and awaited the train. They boarded it while moving and the train did not stop until halted a few minutes later to take off the boys. Their intention to board the train or their presence on it were known at once. The railroad officers were notified by telephone that the boys were on it and were "ordered to take them off. The man who did the shooting boarded the train at or about the same time they did. When the train stopped a few minutes later, the boys were found on the bumpers between different cars some distance apart. Upon seeing one of the boys the officer who did the shooting drew his revolver and told that boy to come down. He did so. In company with "the second officer he walked that boy forward and seeing the plaintiff between the two cars said, “Here is another fellow,” and without further word pointed his revolver at the plaintiff and shot him as he turned to get off the car on the opposite side.</p>

If there is to be a verdict against the defendant, you may, besides giving the young man compensation for the pain and suffering up to the present endured, and such as may come on him in the future, an allowance in respect to diminution of his earning power; that is, you may compensate him for his future loss of earnings. As to what those will be the case is not very clear. He may live to be an old man, he may be cut down in his prime, he may die young. Just what he would earn as a machinist’s helper —I think that was his original occupation — I cannot say. You have heard what the witnesses have said on that point and will take it into account.</p>

    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[274,396,1149,1134]]]'>This case was for the jury, and the learned trial judge would have erred if he had affirmed defendant’s point asking that a verdict be directed in its favor. Complaint is made of certain portions of the charge as inaccurately referring to the testimony. If any fact was inaccurately or erroneously stated in the instructions to the jury, it was the duty of counsel for defendant to call the trial judge’s attention to his inadvertence, that the same might be corrected before the jury retired: Nowlis v. Hurwitz, <a href="/pa/232/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="232 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="977812" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0154-01">232 Pa. 154</a>. We discover no error in the trial judge’s comment on the testimony, as he left it to the jury to freely determine what the real facts were, and to return their verdict in accordance therewith. While there was no evidence of what the plaintiff had earned before he was injured, there was testimony that after the accident, and before his disability became permanent, he was earning eight dollars per week. That was sufficient for the instructions which are the subject of the fourth and fifth assignments of error. The jury could well have found that the plaintiff’s earning capacity before he was crippled was at least equal to what it was afterwards.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[275,1539,1143,91]]]'>The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
