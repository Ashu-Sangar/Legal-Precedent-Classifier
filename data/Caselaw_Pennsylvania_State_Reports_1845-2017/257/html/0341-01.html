After execution of certain of the bonds by the president and secretary, the secretary, who was also the treasurer, at the suggestion of the president made out a receipt as treasurer for them and handed the bonds and receipt to the president. The president sent the receipt and bonds to the trust company for certification with directions to send the bonds to a certain bank for delivery to him. The trustee, relying upon the treasurer’s receipt, sent the bonds to the bank designated, and the president of the water company subsequently obtained possession of them and embezzled them. The water company brought an action against the trust company to recover the value of the bonds. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

After their execution by the president and secretary, Richwine suggested that Shaffer, as treasurer, send a receipt along with the bonds, which were to be forthwith certified and delivered.

Dale Shaffer, treasurer, and sent to the trust company, defendant, acknowledging the receipt of $100,000 of the Reynoldsville Water Company bonds, was clearly designed and intended by the treasurer of the company to be his official and final acknowledgment of the receipt of that amount of the bonds from the trust company, after it should have certified them, and was so regarded by the trust company. Shaffer sent no request and gave no direction in connection with the receipt, to the latter.......The man who sent the receipt to the defendant, and requested that the bonds be sent to him, and who got them, was the president of the water company, and also a director. These men (the president and treasurer), chosen by its stockholders, were the executive officers of the water company, who, for it, executed the bonds .and mortgage, and who at the time of this transaction were deemed worthy of trust and confidence, and unsuspected of any motive but' the interest of the company at whose head they stood.”</p>
