When a contract for advances or for the assumption of future obligations accompanies a mortgage it is not essential to its validity that the engagement governing the advances be placed upon record or. even expressely referred to in the mortgage. When such a contract obligates the mortgagee either to make advances or assume future responsibilities on behalf of the mortgagor, this lends a sufficient consideration to the mortgage and the lien of payments made under such an agreement relates back to the date of the mortgage, and this is true even though the advances are liquidations of assumed responsibilities incurred after the date of a subsequent or junior encumbrance placed upon the mortgaged premises.</p>

At the time of the execution of the mortgage but $32,000 had been loaned to the mortgagor by the mortgagee; at that time the mortgagor gave the mortgagee a demand note wherein it was agreed that “the securities hereby pledged together with any that may be pledged hereafter shall be applicable in like manner to secure the payment of any future obligations of the undersigned held by the holders of this obligation, and all such securities in their hands shall stand as one general continuing collateral security for the whole of said obligation.” Thereafter the mortgagor gave the trust company a bond to indemnify it against loss which it might sustain by issuing a title policy in favor of the mortgagee of certain other property owned by the mortgagor. Thereafter the mortgagor gave a second mortgage upon the property covered by the $40,000 mortgage. The second mortgagee had notice that only $32,000 was loaned on the first mortgage. The mortgagor became indebted to the trust company for a large amount under the provisions of his bond. The mortgage was subsequently foreclosed and the property sold. The trust company and the second mprtgagee each claimed the amount remaining after the payment of the $32,000.

On the other hand, Mrs. Bergdoll contends that, when she took her mortgage, in 1913, although the trust company then held the $150,000 bond executed by Mr. Shoemaker, and had issued its policy of title insurance in connection therewith, yet, at that date, its liability on such policy was merely potential; that the trust company never paid any actual losses thereunder until May, 1914, some months subsequent to the date of her mortgage ; hence, that she has a prior lien and is entitled to the fund in court.</p>

They may be reduced to these: (1) When the trust company, in 1912, accepted and became the holder of Mr. <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>Shoemaker’s $150,000 bond, did it, by issuing the policy of title insurance recited therein, to the holders of the mortgage in that transaction, bind itself, in effect, to Mr. Shoemaker and his then present mortgagees, to advance to the latter, on the former’s account, such sums of money as might be necessary to indemnify the mortgagees against loss by reason of noncompletion of the building covered by their mortgage? (2) If this was the effect of the transaction just referred to, then should the contract made in 1912, Avhen the trust company accepted the $150,000 bond and issued its title policy, fie treated as a supplement to the'original agreement of 1909? (3) If, as a matter of law, it should be so considered, then, as against Mrs. Bergdoll’s mortgage of 1913, should this contract of 1912 be given the same effect as though its terms originally had been expressly incorporated into the agreement of 1909?</p>
    <p id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[273,1248,1158,1136]],["BL_253.1",253,[201,328,1152,1632]]]'>We think all the propositions just enumerated must be answered in the affirmative. The bond accepted in 1912 was an obligation of Mr. Shoemaker, the original mortgagor, which recited the’title policy issued by the trust company as part of the agreement then entered into; hence, both of these instruments must be considered in deciding as to the nature of that agreement; and, when so considered, it seems plain that the agreement in question 'formed a binding contract on the part of the trust company, if called upon so to do, to pay on Mr. ^ Shoemaker’s behalf any losses which his default in finishing the building described in the bond and title policy might cause to the parties insured by the latter instrument; which, in effect, was a contract to make future advances. For these advances Shoemaker was liable to the trust company on the $150,000 obligation, to secure which the latter held the $40,000 mortgage as collateral. We make this last statement, as the agreement of 1909 was that the mortgage in question should stand as collateral not only for Shoemaker’s $32,000 obligation, but also for any future obligations of the debtor which might <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>come into the • mortgagee’s hands. This contract was in full life when the trust company accepted the $150,000 bond, which instrument fell squarely within thei definition of a “future obligation”; and, at the time of the acceptance thereof, the company agreed in connection therewith to make the advances already referred to. Under these circumstances, there is no reason apparent why, after 1912, this agreement should not be considered just as effective between the parties thereto, and all others dealing with the property covered by the $40,000 mortgage, as the original contract executed in 1909 when the mortgage was first taken as collateral. Had the terms of the 1912 agreement been originally incorporated into the contract of 1909, there can be no question as to their effect, for it is now established in Pennsylvania that, when a contract for advances or the assumption of future obligations accompanies a mortgage, it is not essential to its validity that the engagement governing the advance be placed upon record, or even expressly referred to in the mortgage (Moroney’s App., infra) ; it is also established that, when such a contract obligates the mortgagee either to make advances or assume future responsibilities on behalf of the mortgagor, this lends a sufficient consideration to the mortgage, and the- lien of payments made under such an agreement relates back to the date of the mortgage; furthermore, this is true even though the advances or liquidation of assumed responsibilities occur after the date of a subsequent, or junior, encumbrance placed upon the mortgaged premises : see authorities, infra.</p>

We are convinced, however, that neither the facts of this case nor the applicable principles of law call for or necessitate such a ruling. When Mrs. Bergdoll negotiated with Mr. Shoemaker in 1913, she knew there was at that time a first mortgage of $40,000 upon the property offered as security ; she also had actual notice that the loan made at the date of this mortgage was only $32,000 — all of which was sufficient to put her on inquiry as- to the exact status of the $40,000. encumbrance to which she in express terms made her $18,000 mortgage subject. Had she exercised ordinary care in this respect, she would have ascertained that, in addition to the $32,000 actually paid out when the $40,000 mortgage was created, the trust company, under a binding supplemental agreement, entered into when accepting from the mortgagor a “future obligation,” had agreed to make advances on his behalf, if called upon so to do, to an amount more than sufficient to cover the remaining $8,000. Under the circumstances, the auditor did not err in holding that, as between Mrs. Bergdoll and the trust company, the former’s encumbrance was subject in all respects to the $40,000 mortgage held by the latter; and, hence, that the trust company had a first lien on the fund for distribution.</p>
