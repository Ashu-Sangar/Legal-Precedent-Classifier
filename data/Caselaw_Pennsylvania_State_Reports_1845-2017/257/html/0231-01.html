It had not been considered by this court or its auditor, for the reason that it had not been raised either here or before him. The learnéd auditor found that the rule in Shelley’s Case applied to the devise and that therefore an absolute estate vested in Evan R. Penrose, the first taker. This court did not agree with him in his conclusion, but held that the said Evan R. Penrose took but an equitable estate, the testatrix having created an active trust to preserve- the remainders given in the alternative in her will. This conclusion was not contested upon the appeal.</p>

It is limited to take effect upon the “dubious and uncertain event” of the line of Evan R. Penrose becoming extinct. It does not vest in the event of his issue failing to reach the age of twenty-one. The testatrix has prescribed the additional condition that his issue must die before that age without issue. It cannot therefore be said that under the provisions of this will the interest of the monthly meeting must vest not later than twenty-one years after a life in being at the creation of the interest. The rule is. thus stated in Gray on Perpetuities, Sec. 201: “No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.” In Coggins’ App., <a href="/pa/124/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="563106" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0010-01">124 Pa. 10</a>, Paxson, C.

    <p class="summary" id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[270,779,1172,1572]]]'>Under the language employed by the testatrix, can it be said that the interest given to the monthly meeting must vest within the limit of time fixed by the rule ? Had Evan R. Penrose died leaving a son who lived to be twenty and then died leaving a son who died at twenty, the vesting of the interest given to .the monthly meeting would have been postponed'beyond the period of twenty-one years following the death of Evan R. Penrose, That this did not happen is immaterial. That it could have happened and postponed the vesting of the interest given by the will to the monthly meeting beyond the limit of time fixed by the rule against perpetuities is fatal to the •gift in remainder. Even if we accept the contention of the appellee that “issue” as used by the testatrix means “children,” we encounter the same difficulty in trying to escape the operation of the rule. We then find the testatrix providing a possible postponement of the vesting of the remainder in the monthly meeting until after the death of possible great-grandchildren under, the age of twenty-one. We find in this will no such case of doubt as must be resolved in favor of the vesting of the remainder. We conclude that this will provides a gift over on an indefinite failure of issue. “In Pennsylvania a gift over on failure of issue when the failure must take place within the periods prescribed by the rule is good, while a gift over on indefinite failure of issue is bad. The rule is the same, whether the subject-matter of the &gt; gift is real estate or personal property”: Foulke on Rules Against Perpetuities, Etc., page 196.</p>
