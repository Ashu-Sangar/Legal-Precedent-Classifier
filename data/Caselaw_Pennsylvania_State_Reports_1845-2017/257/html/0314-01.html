A petition for an issue devisavit vel non alleged that fraud had been practiced upon testator by substituting the paper offered for probate for another which had been drawn- for him as his will, that he lacked testamentary capacity, and 'that undue influence had been exercised over him. The evidence of fraud was insufficient to warrant a finding that fraud had been practiced upon testator. Ten or more witnesses called by proponent had had business dealings with him and many of them had known him for years; after stating what they knew of him they expressed the opinion that he had testamentary, capacity. There was no evidence that decedent’s mental faculties were impaired, and the only evidence of undue influence was that there was an opportunity for the exercise thereof. <em>Held, </em>the court did not err in refusing the issue.</p>

    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[309,564,1152,1734]]]'>This is an appeal from the refusal of an issue devisavit vel non. One of the reasons given in asking for it was that a fraud had been practiced upon the testator by substituting the paper in controversy at the time he signed it for another which had been drawn for him as. his last will and testament. We have not been convinced that the learned court below erred in holding that the testimony was “wholly insufficient to support any such finding.” Nor have we been convinced that error was committed in disposing of the other two branches of the case, as to which the learned court said: “Some ten or more witnesses were called by the proponent to establish testamentary capacity of the decedent. They were men who had business dealings with him, friends and his neighbors, many of whom had known him for years. They were in a position to hear him talk, to observe his actions and conduct, and note any change in him. Before expressing an opinion as to his mental- capacity, they qualified themselves by stating facts upon which it was based. The evidence adduced by the contestant in our opinion does not show any impairment of the decedent’s mental faculties, and there can be no question under all the evidence that there was any. Therefore the burden of proof is upon the contestant to show undue influence......On this branch of the case it is enough to say that the testimony is wholly insufficient to support a finding that Mrs. Conway exercised any influence over the mind of the cleeedent at the time of the making of the will. The most that can be found from the testimony is that there was an opportunity for the exercise of influence, and this is held insufficient to submit to a jury in Tyson’s Estate, <a href="/pa/223/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="223 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="960990" data-case-paths="/pa/223/0596-01">223 Pa. 596</a>.”</p>

But if the testimony is such that the judge would feel constrained to set aside a verdict against the will as contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, determined according to relevant legal standards, it cannot be said that a substantial dispute has arisen” : Phillips’ Est., <a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>. “This simple and only safe test is supported- alike by reason and authority”: Appeal of Knauss et al., <a href="/pa/114/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="114 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="549988" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0010-01">114 Pa. 10</a>, 20.</p>
