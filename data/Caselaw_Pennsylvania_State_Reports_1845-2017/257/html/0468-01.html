The original residuary bequest to Mr. Hallstead and his child contained in the will was revoked by the codicil, and thereupon the alternative residuary bequest to the next of kin took effect. This thought is emphasized by paragraph nine of the codicil, wherein testatrix expressly continues in full force all of the terms of the will except as revoked or modified. Now the codicil revoked all portions of paragraph fourteen of the will by which any property was given or bequeathed to Mr. Hallstead or to his surviving child, which revoked all of the paragraph down to and including the words “then all of said estate to go to said child absolutely,” and thereby he was deprived of the bequest as sole residuary legatee. But only so much of the paragraph was revoked as gave something to Hallstead or his child. The original will gave them nothing as next of kin, for by its express terms nothing was given to the next of kin until after the death of both Hallstead and his child. The codicil by its terms revoked only what had been given in the will and did not attempt to revoke the rights of the next of kin, which arose by virtue of the codicil itself and had no prior existence. She did not revoke that which had no existence until after the revocation. Whatever rights the next of kin have as residuary legatees had their inception in the codicil, because the will gave them noth<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>ing as such except upon a condition that never occurred, to wit, the death of Hallstead and his child during the life of testatrix. But the codicil was a republication of the will as modified, and thereby the residuary estate was given to all the next of kin as they would have taken under the intestate laws, with the single exception that the brother was excluded therefrom. At the time of such republication, Mrs. Potter undoubtedly knew that appellant was one of her next of kin and had she desired to exclude him could have so stated, or had she then intended to give all of her residuary estate to the two nieces that could have been stated in the codicil. But the mere fact that testatrix revoked the clause making appellant sole legatee, without more, does not preclude him from sharing in the gift to the next of kin of which he is one. Construing the will and codicil by the language used, we find nothing to prevent appellant from so sharing. He is excluded neither by express language nor by necessary implication; in fact, as the express exclusion includes the brother only, the implication would be the other way; as it also would because of the fact that the residuary estate is given to the next of kin as a class and not to any particular individuals. Because Mrs. Potter did not desire appellant to have the entire residuary estate does not change Ms status as next of kin or deprive him of the right to share with the others as such: See Hitchcock v. Hitchcock, <a href="/pa/35/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="35 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="990440" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0393-01">35 Pa. 393</a>; Waln’s Est., Vaux’s App., <a href="/pa/156/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="156 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="844935" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0194-01">156 Pa. 194</a>; Gorgas’s Est., Robinson’s App., <a href="/pa/166/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="166 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="864253" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0269-01">166 Pa. 269</a>; Fuller’s Est., <a href="/pa/225/0626-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="225 Pa. 626" data-case-ids="965344" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0626-01">225 Pa. 626</a>.</p>
