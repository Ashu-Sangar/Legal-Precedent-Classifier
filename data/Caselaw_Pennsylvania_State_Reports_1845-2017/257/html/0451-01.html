The purchaser of a lot abutting upon the park fenced in a part of the land which had been dedicated to the public. The encroachment existed for more than thirty years. Such property owner was proceeding to make additions to a building so as to extend it over the land lying in the park when he was prevented by the city officials. He brought a bill in equity to restrain the city officials from interfering with his additions to the property. It appeared that the city had passed an ordinance years before, providing for the condemnation of the land occupied by plaintiff, but no viewers were appointed and no further steps were taken. Plaintiff claimed that the city was estopped by such action to allege that the land was not his and also that he had acquired title by adverse possession. <em>Held, </em>the lower court did not err in dismissing the bill.</p>

Lots appear on the map, which were conveyed bounded by the Parade. For nearly fifty years, prior to 1890, the Parade was used generally by the public as a passageway and for all purposes of a public common. Meantime streets had been opened on the borders of the Parade, Main street on the west, Sixth avenue on the south and Park Place on the northeast. In or about the year last mentioned the city constructed an iron fence around that part of the Parade inclosed by these streets, and therein was placed a monument and a fountain; and, at about the same time, the cartway in <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>Sixth avenue was paved. Church street extends in a northerly and southerly direction and is a short distance east of the intersection of Park Place and Sixth avenue. It is about 455 feet from Main street to Church street, and the land facing on the south side of the Parade (now Sixth avenue) was subdivided into lots as a part of the original plot.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[293,706,1150,1125]]]'>In 1843, the company sold one of the lots facing sixty-five feet on the Parade to James Clarkson, a part of which by sundry conveyances is now owned by plaintiff, and thereon is a two-story frame building, which stands about one foot back from the south line of the Parade as originally dedicated. However, from the time of or shortly after the purchase by Clarkson down to this time the owners of the lot have had adverse possession of a strip of land some five feet in width extending in front of the lot and within the lines of the Parade as dedicated. This strip of land was inclosed for many years as part of the lot by a fence, and near the west end thereof was formerly a well, and toward the east end for about thirty years last past a porch stood thereon in front of the building, and some of the strip of land has been used as a lawn and flower bed. The owners of some of the other lots have also made encroachments upon the south side of the Parade. The original deed to Clarkson describes his lot as being 130 feet in depth, from the Parade south, which it is exclusive of said five feet.</p>
