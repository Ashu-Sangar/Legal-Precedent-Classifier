In an action against a railroad company for unlawful discrimination in allowing plaintiff’s competitors rebates on shipments of coal, there was evidence that plaintiff purchased coal from a- firm of individuals at the price at the mine plus freight charges, that the freight charges were added to the price of the coal and paid by plaintiff to the firm; a witness testified to having seen an agreement between the defendant and the firm providing for the collection of freight from consignees by the firm, for which service the firm was to receive a commission from the railroad company. There was also evidence that freight on coal purchased from other persons was paid direct to the defendant, but on purchases from the firm the freight was paid to the firm. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the firm was the agent of defendant for the collection of the freight.</p>

Mere silence or the failure to keep a promise is not sufficient to stop the running of the statute of limitations, but where some affirmative act of concealment takes place it is not material whether the concealment is previous or subsequent to the beginning of the cause of action. The question is whether there was a design to prevent the discovery of the facts which gave rise to the action and whether the act operated as a means of concealment.</p>

In an action against a railroad for unlawful discrimination it appeared that the claim was made for damages sustained by plaintiff more than six years before the action was brought. It also appeared that during such period plaintiff had complained to an official of defendant that rebates were being allowed, and such official denied it. The plaintiff relied on the statement of such official and the fraud was not discovered until one year before the action was brought. There was further evidence that after the discovery of the fraud by plaintiff, defendant’s officials had told plaintiff’s competitor to destroy all his records showing rebates. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence of concealment was sufficient to toll the statute of limitations until the discovery of the fraud.</p>

In such case the statement of claim alleged that the plaintiff claimed damages to the extent of'$100,0(T0 by reason of the fact that defendant charged plaintiff for the. transportation of coal a sum in excess of that charged oth^r persons upon like conditions, and allowed concessions to a competitor of plaintiff not allowed to plaintiff in violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and the statutes passed in pursuance thereof. Afterwards the statement was amended so as to allege that defendant’s acts were in violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania- and statutes passed in pursuance thereof and particularly the Act of June 4,1883, P. L. 72. At the trial which took place more than six years after the discovery of the fraud an amendment was offered but refused by the court claiming damages to the amount of $400,000, and alleging that plaintiff is entitled to and seeks to recover three times the actual damages suffered by him in accordance with, the statutes in such case made and provided. Subsequently plaintiff moved to treble a verdict for single damages rendered by the jury. Held, (1) that the amendment increasing the damages to $4'00,000 did not introduce a new cause of action and should have been <em>allowed; </em>(2) that the amendment made before trial referring to the Act of June 4, 1883, P. L. 72, although making no express claim for treble damages, sufficiently notified defendant that the action was brought to recover the penalty imposed by the statute and entitled the plaintiff to recover treble damages on motion.</p>

The action was brought February 1,1906, and the damages claimed were for a period of alleged discrimination between June 1, 1891, and July 23,1901. The original statement claimed damages to the extent of $100,000, which plaintiff alleged he suffered by reason of the fact that defendant “did charge, demand and receive from plaintiff for the transportation of said coal a sum in excess of that charged and received by defendant from .divers other persons upon like conditions, under similar circumstances and during the same periods of time, and allowed such other persons, firms and corporations concessions in rates and drawbacks which were not allowed to plaintiff, all in violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>and the statutes passed in pursuance thereof.”' There is a further averment that defendant also paid the rent of the coal yard and offices of <em>a </em>favored shipper of coal; and the statement then sets forth that, by reason of fraudulent concealment by defendant, plaintiff was prevented from discovering the fact of overcharge until within a year prior to beginning suit. An amended statement was filed in 1909, in which plaintiff charged defendant’s acts were “in violation of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and statutes passed in pursuance thereof, and particularly the Act of June 4, 1883, P. L. 72.” Issue was joined on the pleas of-not guilty and the statute of limitátions. A stipulation signed by counsel was filed in which it was agreed the total number of tons of coal consigned to plaintiff during the period of time named was 268,136.05 of which 52,525.05 tons were shipped within six years of the beginning of suit, and 215,611 tons previous thereto. Of the former amount 36,092,19 tons, and of the latter amount 174,175.16 tons, were purchased from James Boyd &amp; Company, alleged agents for defendants; the remainder elsewhere. The court charged the jury that if there was a fraudulent con-' cealment which prevented plaintiff from making the discovery of rebates prior to the time of such alleged concealment, accepted by counsel as November 1, 1893, they might find damages that had accrued at that time, and also damages for rebates allowed within six years of the time suit was commenced. There was a verdict for plaintiff for $25,870.62 single damages to which the jury added $25,219.17, as damages for delay in payment, making a total of $51,089.79. The effect of this verdict was a finding that Boyd &amp; Company were defendant’s agents, and the statute of limitations had been tolled by reason of fraudlent concealment as to shipments before November 1, 1893. Plaintiff subsequently moved for judgment for treble damages as to shipments included in the verdict, and also as to other-shipments previous to the six-year period, but subsequent to November 1, 1893. <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>This motion was denied and judgment n. o. v. was entered for defendant for all of the verdict above the snm of $3,624.69, representing the rebate paid to Downing Brothers, as to which amount judgment was entered for plaintiff. The effect of this judgment is to hold plaintiff’s evidence of Boyd &amp; Company’s agency insufficient to submit to the jury, and, consequently, plaintiff could not claim damages on coal bought from them; that evidence of concealment of rebates was insufficient to toll the statute; and that no claim for treble damages or for damages for delay could be allowed. From the judgment entered as above stated both plaintiff and defendant appealed. As the various questions involved in the two appeals are more or less dependent upon each other, and require joint consideration in disposing of them, they will be considered together in this opinion.</p>

Defendant contends the coal sold plaintiff by Boyd &amp; Company was sold at a price delivered in Philadelphia, and that Boyd &amp; Company paid the freight, hence plaintiff was not injured by the alleged rebates; there being no contractual relation between defendant and plaintiff, the right of action, if any, was against Boyd &amp; Company. This view was sustained by the court below on demurrer to plaintiff’s original statement of claim. In his amended statement plaintiff averred payment of the freight by him to defendant. It appears, from the testimony of Downing and plaintiff’s clerk, Smedley, that both plaintiff and Downing Broth<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>ers received from Boyd &amp; Company the coal billed at the price at the mines, pins freight tp Philadelphia.

In the former case the inquiry concerning the acts referred to the time of the interview, and not to the time the wrongful acts were committed, and there was no fraudulent concealment of the prior act. In the latter case, there was a promise to plaintiff that in the future he would receive the same concessions as other shippers, and a breach of this promise was held not such a fraudulent concealment as would toll the statute. Mere silence, or failure to keep a promise, is not sufficient to stop the running of the statute of limitations. There must be a separate and distinct act of concealment: Smith v. Blachley, <a href="/pa/198/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="198 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="920254" data-case-paths="/pa/198/0173-01">198 Pa. 173</a>; Cloyd v.

While no rebates may have been given at the precise moment plaintiff and Joyce met, and the statement may, therefore, have been true in a literal sense, yet plaintiff’s inquiry, and Joyce’s answer, were not limited to that exact time, but referred to a general prac<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>tice of rebating, both before and after their interview. The statement was, therefore, untrue in a broader sense, and the one in which plaintiff must have understood it, and amounted to an affirmative act of concealment of a course of Rebating which the jury found existed before, at the time of, and subsequent to the conference. The answer tended to disarm suspicion and prevented inquiry as to past, present and future rebating. In addition to the evidence of the interview with Joyce, there was evidence that about the same time Boyd, found by the jury to be defendant’s agent, told plaintiff all dealers were getting the same rates, and Downing testified the rebates to him were paid through a third person in order to conceal the transaction, and that in 1907 he was directed by one of defendant’s officials to destroy all his records showing rebates. While the instructions to destroy the records were subsequent to the time of the discovery of the fraud by plaintiff, they may properly be considered as tending to support other evidence of bad faith from the beginning: Cummings v.

There is no express reference in this statement to the Act of June 4, 1883, P.

The proposed amendment of April 18, 1913, increases the damages claimed in the first paragraph of the statement of claim to $400,000.

An action under a statute like the one in question is brought to recover the penalty imposed by the act, and an amendment changing the form of action from one at common law to an action under the statute for a penalty has been uniformly considered by our courts as setting up a new cause of action, and therefore not allowed if the statute of limitations has run at the time the amendment is offered : Mitchell Coal &amp; Coke Co. v.

The trial in this case occurred more than six years after suit was begun and unless the claim for treble damages was included within the scope of the original statement of claim, or the amendment of 1909, the claim for treble damages cannot be allowed. The original statement of claim contains no express reference to any particular statute, but merely refers to the violation of the provisions of the Constitution and statutes passed in pursuance thereof.

The common law rule is that where an offense is created by statute and a penalty inflicted, the mere statement of the facts constituting the offense will be insufficient, for there must be an express reference to the statute, as by the words “contrary to the form of the statute,” etc., in order that it may appear that plaintiff grounds his case upon, and intends to bring it within, the statute: 1 Chitty Pleading, 16th Ed., *237. And where the act or omission which is the foundation of the suit was not an offense at common law, it is necessary in all cases to conclude “against the form of the statute” or “statutes,” or to show at least that the declaration is founded on the statute by introducing the words “de plácito transgressionis et contemptus contra formam statuti”: 1 Chitty Pleading, 16th Ed., *387.

The t remedy given by the Act of 1883 is penal in character and will not be construed to include other damages not covered by the wording of the act. In Hughes v. Stevens, <a href="/pa/36/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="36 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="992227" data-case-paths="/pa/36/0320-01">36 Pa. 320</a>, it is said in regard to a similar statute: “The statutory action is cumulative to the common law remedy, or perhaps rather an optional or alternative remedy ; for a resort to either would be a bar to the other.” In Dunbar Furnace Co. v. Fairchild, <a href="/pa/121/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="121 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="561321" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0563-01">121 Pa. 563</a>, which was an action to recover damages for cutting timber, it was held error for the court to treble the amount of a verdict which included interest as well as single damages. This case was followed in McCloskey v. Powell, <a href="/pa/138/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="138 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="11252045" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0383-01">138 Pa. 383</a>, where it is said (page 400): “The jury found the value of the timber trees, and computed interest thereon at $641.88. The court directed judgment to be entered for three times the value of the timber, and excluded the interest therefrom. The precise point was ruled in Dunbar Furnace Co. v. Fairchild, <a href="/pa/121/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="121 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="561321" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0563-01">121 Pa. 563</a>, and is clear upon principle. The treble damages are given as a penalty, and we know of no case in which a <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>penalty bears interest until <em>the </em>plaintiff’s right to it has been settled by judgment. The learned judge of the court below was right, therefore, in excluding the inter-' est, and entering the judgment for three times the single value of the trees cut and carried away.’’ Under the above decisions the allowance of damages for delay is inconsistent with the action for statutory penalty under the Act of 1883 and must be disallowed.</p>

The trial judge charged that if defendant, or its agents, paid rebates or allowances to any other person, which were not also allowed plaintiff, the latter might recover the difference between the amount paid him and the amount he would have paid at the lowest rate charged or received from any person for like services and under similar circumstances and conditions. The correctness of this ruling must depend upon a proper construction of Section 2, of the Act of June 4, 1883, P. L. 72, which provides that “no railroad company or other common carrier, engaged in the transportation of property, shall charge, demand or receive from any person, company or corporation, for the transportation of property or for any other service, a greater sum than it shall charge or receive from any other person, company or corporation for a like service, from the same place, upon like conditions and under similar circumstances; and all concessions in rates and drawbacks shall be allowed to all persons, companies or corporations alike for such transportation and service upon like conditions, under similar circumstances, and during the same period of time. Nor shall any such railroad company, or common carrier, make any undue or unreasonable discrimination between individuals, or between individuals and transportation companies, for the furnishing of facilities for transportation. Any violation of this provision shall make the offending <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>company or common carrier liable to tbe party injured for damages treble the amount of tbe injury suffered.”</p>

Co., <a href="/pa/156/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="156 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="844919" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0220-01">156 Pa. 220</a>, an action was brought by a coal dealer to recover tbe amount of a rebate of a certain sum per ton wbicb was paid to a manufacturing establishment by defendant. Tbe lower court there instructed tbe jury that plaintiff’s measure of damages would be tbe difference between tbe charge to tbe manufacturing company and to plaintiff. This court held tbe instruction erroneous, saying (page 244) : “It does not at all follow that tbe amount of injury suffered is tbe difference in tbe rates charged. It might be, or it might not be, but, in any event, it must be a subject of proof, and there was no proof in tbe case of tbe actual damages sustained.” Mitchell Coal &amp; Coke Co. v. Penna. R. R., <a href="/pa/241/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="241 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="976054" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0536-01">241 Pa. 536</a>, seemingly contradicts that decision. There, tbe complaint was by one coal shipper of a rebate allowed another, under tbe same circumstances and conditions, and tbe referee stated tbe measure of damages was tbe amount of concession wbicb would have been paid plaintiff bad be received tbe same rebate as tbe favored shipper. Tbe Hoover case was cited before tbe court at that time; tbe finding of tbe referee was, however, affirmed, this court saying (page 540) : “Tbe effect of tbe rebate was to cause damage to tbe plaintiff to tbe extent of tbe rebate. Tbe services of tbe defendant company to tbe Gallitzen Colliery after October, 1899, were similar to those rendered tbe three favored companies, Altoona, tbe Glen White and tbe Mil-wood, and tbe plaintiff was injured to tbe extent of tbe rebates allowed these companies.” A comparison of tbe facts in tbe above cases shows tbe decisions are not inconsistent with each other. In tbe Hoover case plaintiff was a coal dealer, and tbe favored company a manufacturing establishment, and it was held in that case there was no equality of conditions wbicb would justify plaintiff in demanding tbe same rate given tbe manufacturing company. In tbe Mitchell Company case tbe <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>discrimination was made between companies operating under like conditions and circumstances. The “injury suffered,” within the meaning of the term used in the Act of 1883, may be either the difference in the rates charged under the provisions requiring the allowance of the same concessions and drawbacks to all persons “upon like conditions, under similar circumstances, and during the same period of time” as in the Mitchell Company case, or it may be the injury suffered by reason of “undue or unreasonable discrimination” though the conditions differ, in which case the injury would not necessarily be the difference in charges, but would be the damage suffered by reason of failure to furnish equal facilities or other requirements of shippers. The case of Union Pacific Ry. v. Goodridge, <a href="/us/149/0680-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="149 U.S. 680" data-case-ids="3569986" data-case-paths="/us/149/0680-01">149 U. S. 680</a>, involved the construction of a Colorado statute similar to our own statute requiring railroads to make the same concessions to all persons alike. It was there held the measure of damages was the amount of the rebate allowed other shippers. The case of Penna. R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., <a href="/us/230/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="230 U.S. 184" data-case-ids="3664334" data-case-paths="/us/230/0184-01">230 U. S. 184</a>, relied upon by defendant as establishing a different rule, is distinguishable from the present case as it involved a construction of the Interstate Commerce Act, which makes the published rates the legal rate, and provides a penalty for departing therefrom. In the present case, as in the Goodridge case, the question involved is the construction of a state statute which makes the lowest rate of freight the legal one, and requires all concessions to be made to all persons alike, providing the conditions and circumstances are the same. This distinction was pointed out in Penna. R. R. Co. v. International Coal Mining Co., supra. Under the above authorities, there was no .error in the charge in regard to the measure and proof of damages.</p>

In Clark Bros. Coal Mining Co. v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/241/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="241 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="976010" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0515-01">241 Pa. 515</a>, the various decisions were discussed by the court below in a’n opinion which was affirmed on appeal, and it was said the coal, which it appeared was sold f. o. b. cars at the mines, did not become <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>the subject of interstate commerce until actually in transit to points without the State. In this respect the cases are within the express provisions of the-Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, 24 U. S. Stat. 379, <em>c. </em>104, and its amendment of June 29, 1906, 34 U. S. Stat. 584, c. 3591, which prevent the application of the act to the “transportation of passengers or property, or to the receiving, delivery, storage or hauling of property wholly within one state and not shipped to or from a foreign country, from or to any state or territory as aforesaid.” In the present case the subject-matter is discrimination in rates" by the allowance of rebates on coal actually transported, and is clearly within the regulations established by congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission if the passage outside of the State, in the course of its journey from one point to another within the State, is sufficient to bring it within the definition of interstate commerce, and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts. This question was decided in the negative in Commonwealth v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/129/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="129 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="568066" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0308-01">129 Pa. 308</a>, and affirmed in Lehigh Val. R. R.

It appears in that case the matter objected to was taxation on transportation receipts on goods hauled between points within the State, but passing for a short distance outside the State. This case was commented on, and limited in its effect, by the United States Supreme Court in Hanley v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., <a href="/us/187/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="187 U.S. 617" data-case-ids="6143193" data-case-paths="/us/187/0617-01">187 U. S. 617</a>, 621. It was there pointed out that the Lehigh Valley R. R. case (<a href="/us/145/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="145 U.S. 192" data-case-ids="3561642" data-case-paths="/us/145/0192-01">145 U. S. 192</a>) was merely one of a local tax on property within the State, based on receipts from transportation wholly within the State, and without including receipts on property which passed outside its borders, in the course of carriage between intrastate points. The rule laid down in the Hanley case has been followed in later cases: West Virginia Rail Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co., 26 I. C. C. Rep. 622; United States v. Del., Lack. &amp; Western R. R. Co., 152 Fed. Repr. 269. In the latter <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>case it was held the word “wholly” as used in the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, which declares it shall not apply to “transportation of property or to the receiving, storage, delivery or hauling of property wholly within one state,” includes within the act shipments which pass outside the State in the course of their journey between points within. Since the subject-matter in the present case is one on which congress has legislated and the goods in transportation come within the Interstate Commerce Acts by virtue of their passage outside the State, the State courts have no jurisdiction for the recovery of damages as to such part of the goods which were carried through New Jersey.</p>
