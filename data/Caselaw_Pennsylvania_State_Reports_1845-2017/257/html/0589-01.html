A bill in equity filed by taxpayers and property owners of the City of Philadelphia averred that in pursuance of a city ordinance the city and the defendant railroad companies entered into a contract for railroad relocation and improvement under which the city increased the municipal debt beyond the then legal borrowing capacity; that no sufficient prior appropriation was made to meet the obligations thereby incurred, as required by the Act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 130; and that the lands intended to be taken were greatly in excess of the needs of the railroad companies for the present and many future years. Complainants prayed that the ordinance and contract bo declared void, that the city and the railroad be enjoined from spending any money or otherwise proceeding thereunder, and that the railroads be restrained from taking any lands under condemnation proceedings in pursuance of said ordinance and contract. It appeared that the purpose of the development was the abolition of railroad grade crossings, the location of well situated sites for municipal' piers and docks and the unifying and improving of one railroad system in conjunction with others in the city. It appeared that the injunction was not applied for until the expiration of two years and three months from the date of the ordinance, and until after more than $2,000,000 had been actually raised and appropriated and a large part of it Spent by the city, and a loan for the balance of the estimated cost, amounting to nearly $9,000,000, had been authorized by councils and approved by the people at a special election. The project had been given widest publicity, but no previous attack had been made on it in the courts. There was no competent evidence that the amount of land to be taken was in excess of probable future freight yard requirements of the defendant companies. The lower court dismissed the bill. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

Thus it may be seen that the funds required by the city had been either actually appropriated or specially dedicated to the purposes of the contract and ordinance before the municipality’s right to borrow the money was questioned’ in this action; moreover, the legality of these loans has never been attacked either directly or indirectly in any other proceeding. That is to say, while the plaintiffs dallied, the city proceeded to raise the necessary funds, and a substantial part of the money had actually been spent, in accordance with the terms of the ordinance, before the present proceeding was instituted.</p>

As already indicated, the agreement between the municipality and the railroads is very comprehensive in character, and thereunder, perhaps, the former may in the end be found to have assumed obligations to a total of $10,940,120, according to the estimate of the proper city authorities (Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/251/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="251 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="1019656" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0028-01">251 Pa. 28</a>, <em>38); </em>only one million dollars of this amount being appropriated in the ordinance now under attack. The ordinance in question is carefully. drawn to avoid legal pitfalls, particularly the prohibition of the third section of the Act of June 11, 1879, P. L. 130, relied upon by appellants, which calls for previous appropriations whenever municipal contracts requiring the expenditure of money are made. The plaintiffs contend that the present case falls within this act, while the defendants claim otherwise. The court below decided, however, that the agreement did not impose an immediate obligation upon the city to the extent of the <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>total estimated expenditures which the latter eventually might make thereunder; but that, according to its terms, the obligations of the municipality, beyond the million dollars presently appropriated, would arise only from time to time, as other appropriations were actually made to carry on the work and perfect the purchases referred to in the ordinance.</p>

Here, the plaintiffs waited for more than two years before filing their bill, and, in the meantime, vast sums of money had been raised and spent under the ordinance; so that, to stop the undertaking at this time would work a great public evil.

Counsel for the appellants well says, “The bill might, perhaps, have been objected to on the ground of multifariousness,” since it endeavors to have determined at one and the same time the separate rights of taxpayers and property owners; while we shall not stop to discuss the matter, yet, in passing, we note it is apparent that the bill was filed to protect the particular individual property rights of the plaintiffs, rather than their general rights as taxpayers. The rule of laches applies, however, from whichever point the proceedings may be viewed — whether as a taxpayers’ or property owners’ bill; and, when the facts call for its.application, the rule may control even in a case where there is involved a public improvement constructed without lawful authority (which we do not hold to be the fact in the present case): Becker v.

The agreement incorporated in the ordinance provides that two of the railroads are to surrender and the city is to purchase the former’s present yards, when the latter makes appropriations sufficient for that purpose, these properties to be used for and in connection with new and much needed public docks and piers, to be constructed and maintained by the city; it also provides that lands for yard facilities equal to those abandoned by these railroads shall be taken up by them in a designated section on the line of the improvement, the cost thereof to be borne equally by <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>the city and the corporations in question, but any additional real estate needed for yard purposes to be paid for solely by the latter. The map prepared by the city, and introduced in evidence by plaintiffs, shows two large tracts of land, one marked “Space required for Pennsylvania Railroad Terminal Yard,” and the other, immediately south thereof, designated “Space required for Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Terminal Yard”; these are the tracts owned by the plaintiffs. It is plain from this last mentioned piece of evidence, and other proofs in the cáse, that the railroads and the city agreed between themselves that the condemnation of this land for railroad yards was a necessary and essential part of the general improvement contemplated by the ordinance.</p>

(2) If so, then can they lawfully take therefrom an acreage greater than required for their present needs? The prayer of the bill is “that said defendant railroads, and each of them, be restrained......from taking any lands under condemnation proceedings, in pursuance of said illegal ordinance or contract.” When the case came to trial, however, the plaintiffs seem to have assumed the position that the corporations which were required to surrender their present freight yards, might lawfully condemn other lands to take the place of those given up, but only such as are necessary for their “actual needs”; further, that it was the province and duty of the chancellor to determine whether the railroads were about to “take and condemn [for freight yard purposes] any of the plaintiffs’ said lands arbitrarily <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>and without regard to their [the railroads’] actual needs.” The court below held that, the city and railroad authorities having acted in the matter, it would not overrule their judgment.</p>

I offer to prove by this witness the extent of its [the railroad’s] business now being carried on......, as a step in the proof that the taking of this approximate mile of river front in lieu of the front to be abandoned......., is an arbitrary taking, and in no wise necessary for railroad purposes in connection with the present plan of abolishing grades in South Philadelphia or otherwise.” The overruling of this offer forms the basis of the principal assignment of error in support of the “question involved” now under consideration.</p>
