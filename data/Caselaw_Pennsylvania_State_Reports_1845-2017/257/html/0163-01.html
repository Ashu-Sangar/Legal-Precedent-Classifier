On these findings, he concluded as a matter of law that the State was not entitled to the taxes claimed; the court below decreed accordingly, and the attorney general has appealed.</p>

It has been held, under circumstances closely approximating those at bar, that prior notice of an intention to assess such taxes is not essential: See Com. v. Runk, <a href="/pa/26/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="26 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="977327" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0235-01">26 Pa. 235</a>, 236, 237.</p>

L. 228, Sec. XVI, authorizes and requires these- officials, “at the request of each other or of the party” (meaning the party taxed), to “revise any settlement made by them, except such as have been appealed from......., if such request be made within twelve months of the date of settlement......,” and the Act of April 8, 1869, P. L. 19, authorizes a board consisting of the auditor general, State treasurer and attorney general, to revise any tax settlement, even after the year’s limit: Com. v.

Under these <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>two statutes, a practice of tax revision has grown up and become established (recognized in the recent Act of April 9, 1913, P. L. 48) which affords ample protection to corporate taxpayers who, because of neglect to make the prescribed reports, have had accounts for taxes settled against them, without right of appeal: see Act of June 1,1889, P. L. 420, as amended by the Act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 229, p. 236. In instances where appeals are allowed from tax settlements, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County is the only tribunal with original jurisdiction to hear such cases: see Section XI, Act of March 30, 1811, supra, and the Act of April 7, 1870, P.

While there is a line of decisions holding that, where a municipal subdivision, or other governmental .agency possessing a limited power to tax, endeavors to make a levy upon a subject-matter over which it has no right of taxation, the courts generally have jurisdiction in equity to restrain this usurpation, yet we have been referred to no case where a Pennsylvania court sitting in equity has undertaken to stay the hand of the Commonwealth from the collection of a duly settled State tax upon a subject-matter within the general jurisdiction of its taxing officers, much less where, on the audit of an account, a Common Pleas Court, in the exercise of its general authority, has, in effect, attempted so to do; which is the case at bar.</p>

L. 673 (675), and the Act of July 22, 1913, P. L.

On this last point see Com. v. Lehigh Valley R. R.

The officials who made these settlements being vested with appropriate power, no other tribunal, unless one duly authorized, would have the right to inquire into or set aside their findings of fact; which, in effect, is what the court below was obliged to do in order to gain jurisdiction of this case. In brief, the Common Pleas of Delaware County had neither authority to entertain an appeal from the tax settlements here involved nor jurisdiction to restrain the State from proceeding to collect the taxes assessed therein; hence, it was beyond the power' of that tribunal to accomplish by indirection that which it could not do directly; therefore, the decree appealed from, so far as it affects the taxes claimed by the Commonwealth, must be reversed and set aside.</p>

We take occasion to say, however, that, if the facts are as found by the auditor, and not denied by the appellant, the State should grant some form of relief in this case; for, as said in Com. v. Penna. Salt Mfg. Co., supra, “the Commonwealth does not ask that which is against good conscience.”</p>
