The action of the court below is clearly not a final decree. ' No judgment or decree is final that does not terminate the litigation between the parties to the suit: Pennsylvania Steel Company’s App., <a href="/pa/161/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="161 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="854197" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0571-01">161 Pa. 571</a>. The appeal is, therefore, quashed, at appellant’s costs, without prejudice to her right to raise, in this court, on appeal from a final decree against her in this proceeding, or by a proper independent proceeding to be instituted by her, the question of the right or franchise of the appellant to take her property.</p>
