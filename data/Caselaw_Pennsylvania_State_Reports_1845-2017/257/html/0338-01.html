Geissler, deceased, in which he attempted to create a trust estate for his children and grandchildren. The property in-question in this suit is no part of the estate of the said Henry C. Geissler, deceased, attempted to be placed in trust, but belongs to that designated in hi^ will as the “rest, residue and remainder of my estate.”. The only clause in the will that refers to this residue of the estate is Item 11, which is:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[172,1124,1151,253]]]'>“As to the rest, residue and remainder of my Estate, I suggest that the Real Estate be taken by my children at the appraisement as herewith enclosed and hereinbefore referred to, also the securities, at the then market values.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Agu" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[170,1399,1153,479]]]'>The claim of the plaintiffs-is that the testator, having-out of his estate made provision for the erection of. a monument, the payment of his debts and a trust estate, by this Item 11, recognizes, that without a specific bequest of the residue of his property, it, upon his death, would pass to his four children in equal shares, under the intestate laws; that the'only purpose of this clause is to give a suggestion of a valuation of the real estate to facilitate an equitable distribution thereof.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.7",373,[170,1890,1150,536]]]'>The only two constructions that can be placed upon this Item 11 are that it merely fixes the price at which the children are to take the residue of his estate under the intestate laws — as contended for By the plaintiffs; or, second, that it is broad enough to give to the children the real estate at the price fixed. For the purposes of this case it is immaterial which of these is correct, as under.either of them the children of Henry Geissler, deceased, have an estate in fee simple in the property described in plaintiff’s declaration.</p>
