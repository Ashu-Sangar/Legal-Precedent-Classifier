L. 387, which provides for extraterritorial service where the suit concerns “any charge, lien, judgment, mortgage or encumbrance” upon lands, tenements or hereditaments within the jurisdiction of the court directing the service, the motion of the defendant must prevail. The simple question is then raised whether the suit concerns any charge, lien, judgment, mortgage or encumbrance upon land in Lebanon County. The purpose of the bill is to compel the defendant to certify and deliver' to plaintiffs certain bonds in its hands secured by a mortgage given by the plaintiff to the defendant as trustee. Unless there is some reason to the contrary, the plaintiff is entitled to the bonds. Should there be some good reason for the withholding of the bonds it must be owing to some default upon the part of the plaintiff. The lien of the mortgage stands unaffected by the determination of this question, except in as far as the other bondholders under the mortgage may have an increased value attaching to their bonds as long as a part of the bonds are unissued, but to say that because the bonds are secured by a mortgage, or because the value of outstanding bonds may be affected as long as a part of the bonds are unissued, their delivery or nondelivery concerns the lien of the mortgage which is given to secure the bonds, is placing a strained construction upon the plain language of the said met of assembly. The suit concerns the bonds alone and not the mortgage or the lien of the mortgage. We can only conclude that the service is not good under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of April 6,1859.</p>
