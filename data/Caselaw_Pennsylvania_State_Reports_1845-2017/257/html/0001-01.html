On Monday, Thursday and Saturday nights Mosby and Foreman, who rent the hall on the third floor of the stable building known as Thomas’ stable, have dancing-parties that begin at nine o’clock and continue till twelve o’clock. On Wednesday night they teach dancing from 8: 30 o’clock to 10:45 o’clock. On Tuesday and Friday nights the hall is not occupied by the dancing school in any way, but the lessees sublet it (with the consent of the owner, Mr. Thomas) for concerts, balls, and so on as they can obtain a tenant. During the fifteen months the defendants have occupied the hall they have rented it for the above purposes fourteen times.</p>

During the many years of the existence of this stable it has been occupied as such, both for the stabling of private teams and the hiring of horses and carriages to the public. The hall on the third floor' has for over thirty years been rented out as a dancing-school, for parties, concerts and for different kinds of public meeting's, political and otherwise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-3" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[167,724,1149,803]]]'>8th. The neighborhood is no longer a strictly residential one.

    <p class="summary" id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.7",38,[284,1044,1150,257]]]'>The complaint raises the question as to what hour a dancing school, party, concert or ball should close its doors. The answer must depend upon the neighborhood, and the facts of each particular case, as there can be no general rule on the subject.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.8",38,[283,1313,1150,535]]]'>Considering the fact that I have found this not to- be a strictly residential neighborhood, but one that has changed into a partly business one, I do not consider it unreasonable to keep open the dancing school till 12 o’clock. The hours of entertainment are not what they used to be. Everything is later, and, as times change, we must change our habits with them. Everything has been done by the proprietors of the school to lessen the sound of the music after 11 o’clock, and I see no reason to interfere with the dancing school.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-9" data-blocks='[["BL_38.9",38,[282,1858,1149,371]]]'>As <em>to </em>the parties or balls that are held on other evenings, while not very many in number, another question presents itself. Considering the neighborhood and the admitted fact that on an average of once a month an entertainment of some kind is given which continues till two o’clock in the morning, is it proper to issue an injunction?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-10" data-blocks='[["BL_38.10",38,[284,2240,1146,100]],["BL_39.1",39,[177,347,1150,205]]]'>This question is not without difficulty. That it is an annoyance to the plaintiffs to have their sleep broken by <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>these gatherings is undoubtedly true. Those who live in cities must take what goes with it, however. Those who live in business neighborhoods cannot expect or demand the quiet of the suburbs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-2" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[177,565,1150,363]]]'>As the neighborhood changes they must take the consequences. If it changes for the worse and personal discomfort follows, that must be submitted to. The running of street cars and the noise of the automobiles all night long are among the few annoyances that all sections of the city are now subjected to, but would some years ago have been considered a nuisance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-3" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[178,948,1149,98]]]'>Applying the principle that an injunction should not issue in doubtful cases, I would not issue one here.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b39-5" data-blocks='[["BL_39.7",39,[175,1221,1152,698]]]'>As I have found that the defendants’ entertainments bring together an assemblage of respectable, well-behaved people, and that the noises in the street are not of a kind that are induced by or encouraged by the defendants’ parties, I see no reason for a Court of Equity to act. This is a matter for the police to see to. We would not hesitate to enjoin the gathering of disorderly, dissolute, drunken or depraved persons, whose coming together must necessarily annoy the residents of nearby houses, but the saying of parting words by respectable people and the calling to friends as they leave the hall, is a matter for the police to regulate, rather than for a court to dispose of by injunction.</p>
