The affidavit of defense alleged that the formula was worthless to the defendant in its business; that plaintiff was guilty of fraud in inducing defendant to make the contract; that a rescission of the contract was effected by a letter of defendant to the plaintiff under date of December 24, 1913, stating “as written you, we can do nothing as regards to sticking until Spring, ......When we again run into warm weather we may taire the subject up again with you, at which time we will resume our payments as per our agreement”; and that in view of the fact that both he and the plaintiff had memorized the formula, its return was not necessary to effect a rescission. On the trial, the jury disagreed. The lower court entered judgment on the record for the plaintiff for installments falling due prior to April 10, 1914. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>
