Dunlop, a sister-in-law, $10,000 per annum, during the term of her natural life; the remaining income, and, after the death of the annuitant, all income, to be divided equally between the testator’s wife, his son (the appellant) and a daughter, Pauline Disston, the share of the latter being placed in trust. The testator then provided that in the event of the death of either his son or daughter, leaving issue, during the lifetime of his widow, the share of income of the one so dying should be paid to his or her issue; that should either of his children die without issue, during the lifetime of his widow, the income of the one so dying should be paid in equal shares to the widow and surviving child, so long as the former lived; further, that, upon the death of such surviving child, without issue, during the lifetime of his or her mother, all income, subject to the payment of the before-mentioned annuity, should go to the testator’s wife. As to the principal, subject to the annuity, at the death of his widow, the testator gave one-half of his residuary estate to his son, providing, however, that should the son then be deceased, the share in question should go to the latter’s issue; the other half he directed should be retained by the trustees named in his will, the income therefrom to be paid to his daughter for life, with remainder to her issue; he then provided that if either of his children should be dead, without issue, at the decease of his widow, the share of the one so dying should be paid to or held for the survivor; finally, should both children be so deceased, he gave the principal <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>of Ms residuary estate to Ms nephews and nieces or their issue living at the time.</p>

The court below determined, however, that the son’s share must remain in trust so long as the widow lived, in order to prevent him from controlling the principal during that period, and to permit the alternative gifts in remainder to become effective should he die in his mother’s lifetime. The appellant claims this was error; that both his and his sister’s shares of the principal of the testator’s estate were accelerated by their mother’s election to take against her husband’s will; and that, after a sufficient sum is set aside to assure the payment of the annuity, he is entitled to an absolute award of one-half the residue.</p>

It is apparent from a reading of the will that the testator’s paramount intention was to create a trust during the life of his widow, so that she might enjoy the income from, not one-third of his estate, but one-third of the income from his whole estate, and that, after thus providing for his wife, the primary object he had in view was to benefit his children. In other words, the testator intended to leave his residuary estate, subject only to his sister-in-law’s annuity, for the benefit of his wife and children, the former to receive one-third of the income for her life, and each of the latter a like proportion for the same period; when his widow’s interest should terminate, he intended his two children to take the whole principal, the son’s share being absolute and the daughter’s continuing in trust; and it seems evident that he postponed this distribution until his widow’s death for the reason that he desired the entire estate held intact, to secure her one-third of the income therefrom, rather than to set aside one-third of the principal for her benefit. Finally, the alternative remainders, after the devises to his wife and children, are substitutionary in character, and inserted to prevent the occurrence of a lapse should either or both of the children die during the continuance of the trust created for the purpose just indicated. This being the evident scheme of the will, and the plan having been interfered with by the widow’s election to take her share under the intestate laws, the acceleration of the remainder interests given to testator’s children would carry out his principal intent, and also adhere to his general plan <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>better than continuing the trust so that the secondary objects of his bounty might be afforded an opportunity to derive a possible benefit in the future.</p>
    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[162,478,1149,972]]]'>In a case like the one before us, the effort must be to find and carry out the testator’s chief intent with a minimum disturbance of the general plan of the will. After his wife, the testátor’s children were the natural and primary objects of his bounty, not their issue, still less nephews and nieces or their issue, and the alternative provisions for others, after the testator’s children, were undoubtedly intended as substitutionary, in case the latter died during the life of their mother, should she take under the will; but, as said by Mr. Justice Mitchell, in Vance’s Est., supra (p. 209), a testator is presumed to know that a widow’s statutory rights are paramount, and that she may take against his will; to which we now add that a testator is presumed to know also the general rule that the election of a widow to take under the intestate laws is equivalent to her death, and that, unless his will plainly indicates a contrary intent, remainders are accelerated accordingly.</p>

Some of these exceptions, and the Pennsylvania cases dealing therewith, are well considered by Judge Porter, of the Superior Court, in a recent opinion handed down in Wyllner’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/65/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="65 Pa.

Where the widow, so long as she lives, is to receive a part of the income of the whole estate, and the balance of income, during her life, is given to testator’s children, with remainders of principal to the same children at the widow’s death, her election to take under the intestate laws will terminate a trust created for the purpose of holding the estate intact for her benefit, and accelerate the estates of the children just as effectually as though the provisions for the widow were that she was to enjoy the entire income during her life (Woodburn’s Est., supra); and the fact that the remainders given to the children may be contingent (Coover’s App., <a href="/pa/74/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="74 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1034681" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0143-01">74 Pa. 143</a>, 147), or that alternative remainders may be provided for in the event of the decease of such children in the lifetime of the widow (Wyllner’s Est., supra), will not take a case out of the operation of the general rule, if, <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>on a view of the whole will, or the particular part in question, such alternate remainders appear to be merely secondary or substitutionary in character; see other cases, supra. As already indicated, we are of opinion that the trust created by the present testator was not intended to continue until the actual death of his widow, but only so long as she might have an interest in the estate passing under his will; when she elected to take against that instrument, the testator’s full intent could not be carried out, and the trust came to an end to the same extent as though the widow had physically died; hence, the appellant’s interest was accelerated, and the learned court below should have so held.</p>
