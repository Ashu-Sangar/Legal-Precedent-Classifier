A manufacturing corporation,, having seven directors, voted salaries to three of. its executive officers who were also directors at $400 per month each. Each of these officers performed special services to the company which were valuable and resulted in financial success. Such officers had threatened to resign and the directors voted to give them from year to year, in addition to their salaries, 50% of the annual net gain on' the stock of the company after the regular 8% dividend had been set aside, and gave extra annual compensation to certain employees who were not parties to the suit. The directors interested voted for the resolution. The action of the directors was ratified by a large majority vote at a stockholders’ meeting. A dissenting stockholder who had voted against the ratification brought a bill in equity to restrain the directors of the corporation from paying the additional bonus to the directors. The <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>lower court found that $12,000 per annum was reasonable compensation for each of the three officers’ services, and restrained defendants from making full payment under the directors’ resolution, <em>but </em>allowed two of the defendants each one-third of 50% of the net profits of the current year in addition to $12,000, in order to compensate them for their failure to receive $12,000 per annum in previous years, but restrained defendant corporation from paying to such officers more than $12,000 per annum in future years. The finding as to the proper compensation of the directors for the current year was not assigned as error. <em>Held, </em>that the payments to the directors for the current year should be limited to the amount found reasonable by the .court and could not include compensation for passed years; that the court was not justified under the facts in prohibiting payment of any extra compensation to the third officer and three employees who were not parties; and had no authority to enjoin payments in future years when the circumstances might change; and the record was remitted with directions to modify the decree.</p>

There, as here, certain officers of a private business corporation held a considerable majority of its capital stock, and also constituted the greater number of its directors. The latter body increased the compensation of these officials, as president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer; and this action was subsequently ratified at a meeting of stockholders, the beneficiaries all voting for the ratification motion. A minority stockholder filed a bill in equity averring, inter alia, that the salaries as raised “were exorbitant, unreasonable and unfair, and that the increase was illegal because it could not have been made without the votes of......the incumbents of the offices.” The trial court sustained the contentions of the complainant and granted relief accordingly, but, on appeal, we reversed, holding that “the directors had a right to serve......in the capacity of officers or employees and to receive compensation for such services, if legally employed by the company” (Act of May 14,1891, P. L. 61; Act of May 20,1891, P.

In the course of our jopinion in that case, speaking by Mr. Justice Mestrezat, |we held, as a matter of law, that the action of the board | of directors in raising the remuneration of the officers in 'question, who' were members of the board and voted for ¡the increase, was voidable, but not void; hence that, in the absence of evidence showing overreaching or actual 'fraud, even though “the voting of the salaries by the directors constituted a technical or constructive fraud,” the action could be and was in fact duly ratified by the .stockholders; and this notwithstanding the majority of .the stock was held and voted by the beneficiaries of the ¿act approved.

The three material particulars, however, wherein the present case differs from Russell v. Patterson, are these: Here, after determining $12,000 each per annum to be a just and proper compensation for all the services rendered by Mr. Edgerton and Mr. G-enung, the court below awarded each of them, for the fiscal year 1915, $21,876.10; next, the final decree entered stipulates that hereafter, without limit of duration, the defendant company is restrained from paying either one of these <em>de-, </em>fendants “greater sums than with their fixed salaries will give to each $12,000” per annum; finally, the injunction, in effect, forbids any payments, over and above fixed salaries, to the successor of Edwin T. Moore and the three other employees voted extra compensation by the second resolution of May 17, 1915, although none of the latter are included as defendants, and no finding is made by the court below that their respective services did not merit the amounts awarded them by the board of directors of the defendant corporation, or that such sums <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>were more than reasonable compensation. These three matters raise questions which call for further consideration.</p>
    <p id="b455-3" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[191,496,1154,1904]],["BL_456.1",456,[272,321,1146,203]]]'>On the first of the above suggested points, it appears that Mr. Edgerton, Mr. Genung and Mr. Edwin T. Moore, from 1905 to 1913, inclusive, together with their regular salaries, each received an average compensation of about $11,000 per annum; but in 1914 they were paid only their salaries, there being no extra profits to divide. In 1915 the business of the boiler works was very prosperous, and the court below, by its decree, allows to Mr. Edgerton and Mr. Genung, respectively, $21,876.10 out of the profits of that year; and this is done on the theory that, when the amounts in question are spread over the whole period involved, including 1914 when no bonuses were paid, they give to each of these defendants only $12,000 per annum, the compensation which the chancellors found to be right and proper. The weakness of this position, however, is that the resolution of 1904 expressly stipulates the beneficiaries therein named shall in addition to their regular salaries, “participate from year to year” in the net earnings of the corporation, “as shown by the books at the close of each business year.” It appears that divisions were made from year to year in strict accordance with the terms of this resolution, and that the shares awarded to Messrs. Edgerton, Genung and Moore were, on each occassion, accepted by them. Under these circumstances, the question of compensation for passed years, so* far as the recipients are concerned, was closed; and the only issue which the trial court properly had before it was as to the compensation proposed to be paid them, or any of them, for the year 1915. As already stated, the finding on that score was that $12,000 per annum represented the amount earned by each of these defendants, and since, on the facts at bar, it was within the power of the court to make this finding, which was unappealed from, that sum marked the limit of the al<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>lowance of remuneration for the fiscal year 1915 which should have been made to Mr. Edgerton and Mr. Genung; hence, to this extent at least, the decree complained of must be modified.</p>

It is well established that directors may contract with agents or employees of their corporation, who are likewise directors, and that, though always subject to close scrutiny and voidable for fraud or overreaching, such contracts are not ipso facto void (Union Pacific R.

Therefore, generally speaking, in cases of this character, a court of equity may deal only with the facts presently before it, and thus determine the reasonable compensation actually earned. Exceptional cases may arise, however, where, contemplating a continuance of an ascertained state of facts, and guarding their decree accordingly, judicial tribunals may determine compensation to be paid in the future; but we see nothing in the case at bar to take it out of the general rule.</p>

Perhaps it may be said that the question of the right of the court below to fix the compensation to be paid in the future to Mr. Edgerton and Mr. Genung, is not raised by the appellants; but since, as already indicated, we must remit the record for modification of the decree along other lines, we deem it proper to call attention to this feature of the case.</p>

In reference thereto, it is sufficient to say that, while the court below may have been fully justified in refusing to sanction payment of <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>the full amount voted to Fred E.
