In 1911, she made a codicil to this will, merely changing two small legacies. By the document in controversy, the entire residue of the estate, after making other dispositions substantially as in her former will, is given to the defendant and she is named as solé executor. To the plaintiff are bequeathed “one-half dozen silver teaspoons marked ‘M. E.

These she gave to the plaintiff and the day following she stoutly asserted that the plaintiff had stolen them — had “snatched them out of her hands.”</p>

While there she expressed a desire to have some changes made in her will. She was taken to the office of B. A. Wirtner, Esq., a member of the Westmoreland County bar; she indicated to him the changes she desired to make and .in the course of their conversation she “remarked that her niece (the plaintiff) hadn’t treated her properly. She hadn’t treated her the way she thought she ought to be treated.” What she had in her mind she did not divulge to the scrivener. A new will — the paper in question — was prepared and executed two or three days following the visit to Wirtner. Later, the testatrix returned to West Chester, and April 15, 1914, took up her home with Mrs. Zaidee T. Leedom. Shortly thereafter, in conversation with Mrs. Leedom, the testatrix told her, in substance, that: “While she (the testatrix) was there (atplaintiff’s home) she (plaintiff) had ‘stolen spoons or forks,’ the witness could not recollect which, and followed the remark with the statement, ‘that was all she would ever get.’ ”</p>

That she believed that plaintiff had stolen from her is beyond question under the evidence. That no sane mind could entertain this belief in view of the circumstances is too clear for controversy. That she entertained this delusion when she expressed herself about the plaintiff to the scrivener is the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the remark she made, especially so when considered in connection with the threat contained in her letter of June 26,1912, to the plaintiff. That this delusion was a potent factor in her mind when she sought to dispose of <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>her property by the paper in question would seem to be plain when it is remembered that after the document was executed and she had returned to West Chester, she repeated the charges to Mrs. Leedom, specifying the articles stolen — spoons and forks — and said “that was all she (the plaintiff) would ever get.” She had then disposed of her estate in 'substantially this fashion so far as the plaintiff was concerned.</p>
