For, although it has been held that an administrator -pendente lite cannot distribute the estate of his decedent, that being the duty of the executor under the will or. the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. yet the very purpose of such an appointment is not only to gather together the assets of the estate but also to protect the creditors as well as distributees and legatees : Park v.

The claim of the estate of John Lough-ran was not a claim for distribution, as in Fow’s Est., 20 Philadelphia 128, but was the claim of a creditor of Bridget Loughran.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[274,651,1145,752]]]'>The claimants however rested quiescent until some time in 1911, nine years after the death of the testatrix and appointment of the administrator pendente lite, and two years after the appointment of the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. Meanwhile witnesses acquainted with the testatrix and her affairs and who could have been called to testify what she had done with the assets of the trust estate may have died, and the facts forgotten by those who are still living. It is for this very reason that the statute of limitations prevents the collection of claims unless an action is begun within six years from the time they accrue; and that statute, or a rule analogous to it, is enforced in the Orphans’ Court: York’s App., <a href="/pa/110/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="110 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="543759" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0069-01">110 Pa. 69</a>; Higgins’s Est., 22 Pa.

    <p class="summary" id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[272,1413,1145,752]]]'>And while it is true that in an injunction affidavit sworn to by the testatrix stated that she had conveyed this mortgage of $6,000 to Terrence Loughran without consideration and for the purpose of securing possession of the estate, it is also true that a demurrer to the bill was sustained and the bill subsequently dismissed with the consent of the plaintiff. The abandonment of the suit raises the inference either that the testatrix was mistaken in her allegation or that she was repaid the value of the mortgage. And the fact that at her death she left no' personal property of any kind raises the presumption that that which she had acquired from her husband was used by her under the ample powers given her by her husband’s will.</p>
