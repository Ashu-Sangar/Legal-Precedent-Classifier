With several companions he was coasting on a bobsled, which was struck by an automobile of defendant driven along a street intersecting the one down which the boys were sledding. The contention of appellant that the court below ought to have declared the defendant guilty of negligence as a matter of law, is utterly untenable. That was a question of fact to be determined from the oral testimony in the case, in the light of which learned counsel for appellee contended below and insist here that the trial judge would have been justified in directing a nonsuit or a verdict for defendant. Whether the verdict- was in his favor for this reason, or on account of the contributory negligence of the boy, does not appear.'</p>
