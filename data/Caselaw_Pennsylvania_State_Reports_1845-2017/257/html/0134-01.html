A meeting of the parties preliminary to the execution of the contract was held, and a contract submitted to the defendant was reformed at the suggestion of himself and his counsel. We conclude from the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>brief of counsel for defendant and Ms argument at the hearing that his interpretation of this contract is that the defendant may establish a retail coal business beyond the two-mile radius and deliver coal to customers living within the territory included in the radius of two miles from Main and Price streets. We need not here concern ourselves as to the motive or reason actuating the minds of the parties to the agreement, 'as to the limitation of time or territory as therein set forth. As we have already stated the purpose and requirements of the agreement are perfectly clear, and we cannot read into the agreement any mental reservation or mutual understanding not therein expressed at the time of the execution. The defendant contends that the plaintiff corporation by one of its officers acquiesced in the action of the defendant in securing a coal yard and placing a stock of coal therein at 7600 Germantown avenue. It appears from the correspondence between the defendant and the president of the plaintiff company, and from conversation with other officers of the company that the defendant desired to sever his connection with this company as an employee. There is nothing in the agreement requiring the defendant to continue as an employee of the company, and it further appears that the officers of the company desire the defendant to continue in the service of the company as an employee. The defendant further contends that the action of Mr. White, the vice-president of the plaintiff company, in advising defendant as to the method of constructing the coal pockets in defendant’s yard, amounted to an acquiescence of the company in defendant’s action in violating the terms of the agreement. We find as part of the agreement the following:</p>

The officers or directors of the plaintiff corporation appear to have been acting as individuals.
