The auditor has addressed to the solution of these questions a great deal of painstaking labor and research, and fortified his conclusion by an exhaustive citation of the authorities.

    <p class="summary" id="b277-9" data-blocks='[["BL_277.9",277,[207,1464,1150,692]]]'>The object to be obtained is the ascertainment of the intent of the testator, to be gathered from the language of his will, with the aid of his surrounding circumstances. He was a very wealthy man, and a bachelor. He executed his will in 1888 with a codicil in 1893, and died in 1914, seventy-three years of age.' At the date of his will his parents were dead. At that time and also at the date of the codicil, he had three living brothers and two sisters. One of these brothers, J. Lewis Crozer, died in 1897, without children. Another brother, Samuel A. Crozer, died in 1910, leaving children. His other brother, George K. Crozer, and his two sisters, Elizabeth C. Griffith and Emma C. Knowles survived him.</p>

Lewis, naming them, and then, conscious that he was about to give munificent legacies to his sister, Elizabeth C., and her children, and to his brother, George K., and his children, <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>and to his sister, Emma C., and her children, he takes occasion to say in his will that these legacies of ten thousand dollars are comparatively small, that is to say, compared with those about to be given to the others, and that they are made thus' comparatively small for reasons which he states, and then to avoid an inference that the distinction is attributable to any difference in regard for them, he says, “My love for all my brothers and sisters is strong and deep.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[280,848,1146,262]]]'>He then gives to his sister, Elizabeth C., naming her, and her children, legacies amounting to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, also to his brother, George K., naming him and his children, a like sum, and also to his sister, Emma 0., naming her and her children, a like sum.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[280,1121,1148,150]]]'>Then after a number of legacies come these two clauses, which have been referred to, and which produce this controversy:</p>

It would scarcely occur to the average mind that these gifts were otherwise than the ordinary gifts to them as individuals. What did the testator intend in 1888, when the will was executed? Did he have them in mind as a class? If he had in mind to treat them as a class then he intended that only those who survived him should take, and the children of those who predeceased him should be excluded; but he said that his love for all of them was' deep and strong. Moreover if a class were intended, it was not known in 1888, but that J. Lewis Crozer might be the only one of the class to survive him, and he had been childless for many years. What he might do with <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>the testator’s estate would be quite uncertain. This would provoke a critical commentary upon the testator’s expression of equality of love for all of his brothers and sisters. And that is not all, for if the whole class should predecease him, then he would die intestate as to the residue of his estate, a conclusion of construction most strongly to be avoided; a cardinal canon of construction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[199,688,1151,580]]]'>A class is indeterminate in number at the date of the will which may be enlarged or diminished, and finally determined at the death of the testator. We have here the definite number five, incapable of enlargement. True, the number may be decreased by death. But the number of shares remain the same, if those dying leave children. If those dying should not leave children, there would be an intestacy to that extent. But such intestacy as to a possible share or shares is not so serious as a possibility of an intestacy of the entire residue above alluded to.</p>

But that is quite a different case from this. There the gift was to brothers’ and sisters’ children, which could not be definitely fixed until testator’s death. Hence the children of a deceased brother and sister, dying before the testator, although living at the date of the will were excluded.</p>

If these were not class gifts, then this testator legally intended under the Act of May 6,1844, that if any of his brothers and sisters should die in his lifetime leaving children they should take their parent’s share, and that such was not his actual intent there can be no tenable question. He had them in mind as individuals; he names them in his will; he states their number; they were all the brothers and sisters he <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>had or could have; he individualizes them by sex; they were all personally near to him; it was not that sisters should take if the Mothers were dead, nor that brothers should take if the sisters were dead, but it was sisters and brothers who were to take; it was not that one sister was to take if the other were dead nor that one or two brothers were to take if one or two- were dead, but it was his two sisters and three brothers who were to take.</p>

The same reasoning was applied by the same judge to the brothers and sisters of a legatee for life: Wenzel’s Est., 12 Pa. D.

There has never been a moment of time since May 6,1844, to the present time, when it has not been the law that a legacy by a testator without lineal descendants to a brother .dying during testator’s life, leaving' issue surviving the testator does not lapse, but enures to such issue.
