The rule that after the lapse of twenty years debts by specialty are presumed to be paid is a rule of convenience and policy resulting from a necessary regard for the peace and security of society, and also for the debtor, who should not be called upon to defend stale claims at a time when witnesses are dead and papers lost or destroyed. This presumption does not bar the debt, however. Unlike the statute of limitations, it is merely a rule of evidence affecting the burden of proof, and no new promise is required as the basis of an action. Within twenty yéars the burden of proving payment is on the debtor, after that time it shifts to the creditor. To rebut the presumption any competent evidence tending to show the debt is not in fact paid will be received. Although it need not be of the same quality as required to remove the bar of the statute of limitations, it should, however, be clear qnd convincing, es<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>pecially where suit is not brought until after the death of the debtor.</p>

Woodside and her three daughters, Virginia, Geraldine and Fannie, executed a bond and mortgage to Peter W. Sheafer, to secure the payment of $2,650 in two years, covering property owned by them in the Borough of Pottsville. The mortgage was duly recorded in the office for recording deeds in Schuylkill County on June 24, 1876, in mortgage book 1 A H, page 395. Peter W. Sheafer, the mortgagee, died in 1891, leaving a will in which Arthur W. Sheafer and Henry W. Sheafer were named as executors. At the time of his death the bond and mortgage above referred to were found among his papers; the bond having endorsed thereon, in the writing of Peter W. Sheafer, a payment of $56, under date of December 22, 1877. There is no evidence that demand for payment of the indebtedness secured by the mortgage was made until after the death of the last survivor of the mortgagors, when the executors of the estate of Peter W. Sheafer, on August 25, 1915, issued a scire facias, to which the administrator of the estate of Geraldine Woodside, the last survivor, pleaded payment, and, in support of this plea, at the trial relied upon the presumption of payment by reason of lapse of time, and presented a point for binding instructions for defendant. The trial judge reserved <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>the point, and submitted to the jury the facts presented by plaintiff to rebut presumption of payment. A verdict was rendered in plaintiff’s favor for the amount of the mortgage with interest aggregating, after deducting the payment endorsed on the bond, the sum of $8,'727.87. Judgment was subsequently entered in favor of defendant, non obstante veredicto, whereupon plaintiff appealed.</p>

Dr. O’Hara, a practicing physician in Pottsville for twenty years, called by plaintiff, who had’ been a family physician of the Woodsides, although only Fannie and Geraldine were living when he first attended them, testified that in 1914, shortly after the death of Fannie, Geraldine, the survivor, spoke to him in reference to the mortgage due the Sheafer Estate, and, while the witness was unable to recall the exact language of the conversation, he stated — “she told me she did not know what would happen to them or what would happen to her, or would become of her, I do not exactly know the verbatim statement, but she wept, and so forth, and she said that the Sheafers held a mortgage or that she was in a great debt to them, in other words.” He testified further she told him — “she did not know what would become of them now; she did not know whether Sheafers will push the mortgage or not, and she was in a very nervous state, not knowing what would become of her.” He also testified the family had been in straitened financial circumstances, and had received assistance from neighbors, and further that Geraldine requested him to speak to the Sheafers about the mortgage, which he subsequently did by informing Lesley Sheafer that— “one of those Miss Woodsides is worried to death about what will become of her now since the other sister is gone; she did not know what will become of the place now.” Lesley Sheafer, called as witness by plaintiff, corroborated Dr. O’Hara’s testimony as to the conversation <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>in relation to the Woodside mortgage, and testified to bringing the subject to the- attention of A. W. Sheafer, one of the executors of the Sheafer Estate, who-, following that conversation, on December 22, 1914, wrote Miss Woodside, as follows: “Dear. Miss Woodside: Information has come to us through Dr. O’Hara that you are worried'in regard to the mortgage which we hold on your property at 219 South Center street. We therefore, take this opportunity of assuring you that we have no intention of in any way endeavoring to collect this mortgage or any interest thereon during your lifetime or so long as it remains your property. We trust, therefore, that you will not allow this matter to trouble you in the least. Extending to you our sympathy in your recent bereavement, we are, yours very truly, A. W. Sheafer, for the executors of estate of P. W. Sheafer, deceased.” A copy of this letter was also sent to Dr. O’Hara, who subsequently saw Miss Woodside, and was informed by .her of having received the letter from Mr. Sheafer, and that it gave her much relief.</p>

Fisher, <a href="/watts/9/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="9 Watts 441" data-case-ids="1850001" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0441-01">9 Watts 441</a>, that one of the intervening circumstances which may rebut the presumption is the inability of the debtor to pay within twenty years, and proof of a continued inability to pay was recognized in Taylor v. Megargee, <a href="/pa/2/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="2 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="951409" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0225-01">2 Pa. 225</a>, as sufficient to rebut the presumption. There are convincing reasons for the ruling that proof of the insolvency of the debtor alone will not rebut the presumption. An insolvent may be possessed of property or be in receipt of an income, and have the means of <em>payment; </em>but proof of positive inability to pay is in effect proof that payment could not have been made.”</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[160,1593,1151,699]]]'>In the present case we have proof of a long continued inability of the debtors to pay; that the surviving debtor recognized the existence of the' indebtedness in 1914, stating in effect her inability to pay, and requesting the witness to see the creditor and ask indulgence; that the witness complied with the wishes of the mortgagor, and, as a result of the interview, the debtor received the letter in evidence, informing her that no steps to enforce payment of the indebtedness would be taken during her lifetime, or so long as the property remained in her possession. This evidence the jury accepted as true, and was sufficient, under the decisions, to overcome the presumption of payment arising from lapse of time.</p>
