A nonresident testator owning personal property worth $30,000 and real estate in Pennsylvania, after bequeathing legacies aggregating $65,000 gave $100,000 to a charitable institution and made such institution his residuary legatee, providing that should his estate prove insufficient to meet all the bequests the deficiency should be deducted from the $100,000 bequest. He gave his executor “full power to sell any or all of my real estate, either at public or private sale, at such time or times and upon such terms and for such price or prices as to him shall seem best and upon such sale or sales to execute and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers deeds of conveyance in fee simple or any Jess estate as the ease may be.” The register of wills assessed the real estate in Pennsylvania for collateral inheritance tax. The executor contended that the will worked a conversion of the real estate and that it was therefore not liable to' collateral inheritance tax in this State. <em>Held, </em>the Orphans’ Court did not err in affirming the decision of the register of wills.</p>

    <p id="b149-5" data-blocks='[["BL_149.6",149,[174,408,1152,922]]]'>The question in this case is, Does testator’s will work an equitable conversion of his real estate? Dr. Leander T. Chamberlain, a clergyman of the City of New York, made his last will in 1909, and died in 1913, and thereafter the will 'was duly probated. It was drawn by testator, contains fourteen paragraphs, and provides for the payment of his debts and funeral expenses and for the care of his burial lot; bequeaths a niece all his personal chattels; makes bequests aggregating $65,000, to certain named religious, benevolent and scientific organizations; also gives to a certain institute, located in Turkey, which he had projected and which was under his fostering care, a bequest of $100,000, and makes the institute his residuary legatee. The will further provides that, should testator’s estate prove insufficient to meet all of the devises and bequests, the deficiency to be deducted from the $100,000 bequest.</p>
    <p id="b149-6" data-blocks='[["BL_149.7",149,[174,1341,1151,587]]]'>When the will was made the testator’s personal estate amounted to about $30,000, and at his death to about $10,000; and he was the owner of real estate situate in Colorado, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Dr. Chamberlain’s income was sufficient to meet his personal expenses, and he also derived a small revenue from the sale of books of which he was the author. Prior to the making of his will, and as a result of the San Francisco fire, he had suffered financial losses from shrinkage of the value of stocks held by him in certain fire insurance companies.</p>
    <p id="b149-7" data-blocks='[["BL_149.8",149,[174,1941,1150,428]]]'>His estate was derived from his wife, the late Frances Lea Chamberlain, who died in 1891; and his several charitable bequests were given largely to perpetuate her memory, and to the institutions in which she had shown special interest. John T. Dooling, Esq., of New York, was made sole executor of the will; and authority to sell real estate was conferred upon him in the following language:</p>

Dr. Chamberlain may have intended to dispose of parts of his real estate in his lifetime, as in fact he endeavored to do.
