    <p class="summary" id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.12",308,[284,879,1148,751]]]'>This case was argued before the court in banc on a rule to strike off the nonsuit entered by the trial judge. It presents but one question, which is rather unique. The suit was an action of trespass brought by Eliza J. Black and Edward Black, her husband, against the defendant for injuries sustained by Eliza Black, on the 28th day of July, 1908. The suit was brought in September, 1913. It is admitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the right of Eliza J. Black to sue has been barred by the statute of limitation of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, but contended that the right of the husband to maintain the suit is not barred, by reason of the fact that he has six years in which to bring his action, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of March 27,1713,1 Sm. L. 76.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.7",309,[209,1171,1166,1086]]]'>The Act of May 8, 1895, P. L. 54, provides that the’ right of action in case of injury done to the person of the wife shall be tried both for the husband and the wife in one suit, and provides for the rendition of verdicts for each of them, and also contemplates a verdict in favor of one and against the other <em>• </em>and it is therefore contended by counsel for the plaintiff that the husband’s rights are not affected by the statute of limitations of 1895, supra. The contention of counsel for the plaintiff is that' the husband’s right of action is not for injuries to his person, and that therefore it is not governed by the Act of 1895. We cannot agree with this contention. The act does not sky for injuries wrongfully done to his person, but for injuries wrongfully done to the person. The suit in question is certainly based upon injuries wrongfully done to the person, the person of plaintiff’s wife. It is difficult to understand how one suit should be maintained by both of these plaintiffs, founded on the one cause of action, and that cause of action be barred by the statute of limitations, and yet the one plaintiff be permitted to recover.</p>
