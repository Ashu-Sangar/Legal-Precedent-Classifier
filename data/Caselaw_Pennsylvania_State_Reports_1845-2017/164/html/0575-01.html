The most serious objection raised is the fourth in the case stated, viz, that the scire facias upon the lien was issued against the administrator of Mary Reece alone, and without her husband and heirs at law being either named or served. The question raised by this objection does not seem to have been passed upon by the Supreme Court. The act of assembly upon which defendant relies to sustain this objection is that of February 24, 1834, which provides that ‘In all actions against the executors or administrators of a decedent who shall have left real estate, where the plaintiff intends to charge such real estate with the payment of his debt, the widow and heirs or devisees and the guardians of such as are minors shall be made parties thereto.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b602-8" data-blocks='[["BL_602.8",602,[249,2029,1170,394]]]'>“ Is the proceeding on a mechanic’s lien an action within the meaning of this act ? It has been decided that a scire facias on a mortgage is not such an action, because it is a proceeding under another act of assembljr making special provision therefor. The mechanic’s lien act also makes provision for proceeding thereon, and for the same reason that proceeding may not be considered an action within the meaning of the act of 1834.</p>

      <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>“ It has also been decided that a scire facias to revive a judgment against a decedent obtained in his lifetime does not come within the act, for the reason that the lien was obtained before the death of the defendant. So in the case of a mechanic’s lien, the lien attaches from the date of furnishing the material and doing the work, and the filing is for the purpose of preserving it, and for the same reason it would seem to be unnecessary to make the heirs at law parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[222,805,1159,349]]]'>“ The lien, too, as filed, is against the building—in rem and not in personam—and it would seem that the act was intended to apply when a judgment is sought to be obtained. A mechanic’s lien is not such an action, but, as stated, is a proceeding in rem. It is not sought therein to charge real estate of decedent generally, the lien is against the building, and the only real estate charged is incidental to the building.</p>
