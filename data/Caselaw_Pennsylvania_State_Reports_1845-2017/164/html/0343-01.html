Evidence for plaihtiff'tended to show that the land formerly belonged to the defendant; that it was bought in at a sheriffs sale by a creditor, and subsequently conveyed to defendant’s son who was not in the state at the time; that the control of the property continued in the defendant, who was at the time insolvent; that a sale of the timber on the land was effected by defendant, and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the debt of the creditor who bought in the land at the sheriff’s sale. There was also evidence that another tract of land was conveyed to another son of defendant under circumstances which seemed to indicate an intent to cover up the title. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury. - ,</p>
