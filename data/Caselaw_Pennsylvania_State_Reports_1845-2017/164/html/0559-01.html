He fired a shot, which missed her, when she immediately rose and fled towards a door. He pursued, and, when about five or six feet from her, he fired the second shot which took effect in her back. She shrieked, and, falling against the door, it opened. As she was in the act of falling he shot her again. There was also testimony that the prisoner had previously threatened to kill his wife, and that, immediately after the shooting, he said to the person who held him: “I know I shot my wife, I intended to do this long ago,” and afterwards when informed that she was dead, he said he was glad of it. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of murder of the first degree.</p>

Objected to : (1) As incompetent and irrelevant; (2) that the offer is not directed to the condition of the defendant at the time of the alleged offence, and (3) so far as the witness on the stand is concerned it appears by his testimony that he had not seen him subsequently to August, 1893, eight months prior to the commission of the offence.

It is not the duty of the commonwealth to prove affirmatively that this man is sane, because that is presumed, but where it is claimed it devolves upon the defendant to prove that he is insane and incapable of rational action to such an extent as to render him irresponsible. This proof, as I say, must be furnished by the defendant. He is not bound to prove it beyond reasonable doubt, but simply by the weight of evidence, simply by the preponderance of evidence, to satisfy you that he is insane and therefore irresponsible. ...</p>

Upon this subject our court has said: ‘ Insanity is mental or moral, the latter being sometimes called homicidal mania, and properly so. A man may be mad on all subjects and then, though he may have a glimmering of reason, he is not a responsible agent. This is general insanity; but if it be not so great in its extent or degree as to blind him to the nature and consequences of his moral duty it is no defence to an accusation of. crime. It must be so great as to entirely destroy his percep<a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>tion of right and wrong, and it is not until that perception is thus destroyed that he ceases to be responsible.

He continues to be a legitimate subject of punishment although he may be laboring under a moral obliquity of perception, as much so as if he was laboring under air obliquity of vision. Again, the law is that, whether the insanity be general or partial, the degree of it must be so great as to have controlled the will of its subject and to have taken from him the freedom of moral action.</p>

Almost immediately thereafter, he purchased cartridges, and then going into the basement of. a saloon, he there loaded the weapon. Thus armed, he went directly to tlie Pittsburg Market House, and arriving at the end of the stall where his wife, in a stooping position, was in the act of waiting on a customer, he fired the first shot, which, missing her, struck the wall of the market house. She immediately arose and fled towards a door. He pursued, and, when about’ five or six feet from her, he fired the second shot, which took effect in her back. She shrieked, and, falling against the door, it opened. As she was in the act of falling he shot her again. One of the shots struck her below the shoulder blade, inflicting a dangerous wound and one that probably would have proved fatal. The other entered the back of her neck and passed through the spinal column, at the base of the brain. The latter, according to the testimony of a professional witness who examined the wounds, was necessarily and almost instantaneously fatal. In addition to the procurement, preparation, and use of the deadly weapon upon the person of his wife, there was testimony to the effect that, while being taken to the work house to serve a sentence for sixty days, the prisoner declared he would kill his wife when he came out. When arrested, immediately after the shooting, he said to the person <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>who held him : “ I know I shot my wife; I intended to do this long ago; ” and afterwards, when informed that she was dead, he said: “I am d— glad of it.”</p>

    <p id="b588-6" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[241,933,1162,757]]]'>As stated by the learned judge, the only answer that was made to the case presented by the commonwealth, was “ that the prisoner was not, at the time, capable of forming any purpose that was criminal, or at all events was not capable of exercising the deliberation and premeditation that is necessary to constitute the crime of murder of the first degree: that he was insane and therefore not responsible for his act at all, but that, if responsible, his insanity was of such a character as would reduce the offence from murder of the first degree to murder of the second degree at least.” As to this line of defence the court very properly instructed the jury that the burden of proof was on the prisoner; and he afterwards added: “ It is for you to say whether there are any circumstances in this case that justify you in finding as a fact, upon the weight of testimony, that this man was at that time insane.”</p>
    <p id="b588-7" data-blocks='[["BL_588.6",588,[242,1698,1163,199]]]'>In this connection, it may be remarked that there was no error in excluding the offers of testimony stated in the last three specifications. The objections to said offers were well taken and rightly sustained.</p>

The fact of the killing with a déadly weapon, procured and loaded for the purpose, having been clearly established, and not controverted by the prisoner, it was unnecessary to dwell at any considerable length on the circumstances attending the commission of the crime. Assuming it to be true that the prisoner’s wife died from the effect of the pistol shot wounds or wound inflicted by him, the court instructed the jury, inter alia, that the presumption of law, arising therefrom, would be that- the offence was murder <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>at common law, or murder of the second degree under our statute ; and hence, in order to justify a conviction of murder of the first degree, it was incumbent on the commonwealth to show circumstances that would justify such a finding: in other words, that the burden of raising the degree from murder of the second to murder of the first degree was on the commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b589-3" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[216,748,1174,813]]]'>The defence interposed by the prisoner, together with the law applicable thereto, was very fully and fairly submitted to the jury. On that branch of the case, the charge was more favorable to the prisoner than the testimony warranted. After correctly explaining the law relating to different forms and degrees of insanity, he concluded thus: “ Now this is the principle upon which you will act, and you will apply the evidence to that. If you find under the testimony of the commonwealth that he is guilty of murder of the first or second degree, as I have indicated, then you are to ascertain whether he is responsible under the principles that I have just read, or, if he is not wholly exonerated, whether his mental condition was such as to reduce the grade of the crime from murder of the first degree to murder of the second degree by reason of the fact that he was incapable of that deliberation and premeditation which the law requires.”</p>
