The contest here concerns only the sum of $150. The contest is directly between <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>the mortgagor and the assignee of the mortgage, and arises in this wise : On Sept. 18, 1877, A. T. Peterson, one of the mortgagees, gave an order to one Archibald Fletcher for $150, which order was accepted by George W. Geiger the same day, ‘ payable as soon as that amount shall be due in my hands.’ The mortgage was due at the death of Elizabeth Peterson, which occurred June 1, 1893. Thirty-six days after the acceptance of said order, to wit, on Oct. 19, 1877, the said A. T. Peterson, for value received, assigned all his right, title, interest and claim in said mortgage to James Rumbaugh, who had no notice of the said order. There is nothing to show collusion between George W. Geiger and A. T. Peterson. Fletcher, the payee, is not a claimant here for the amount of the order. Rumbaugh claims the full amount, the $2,000, with interest, by virtue of the assignment of Oct. 19, 1877, and Geiger claims the sum of $150 on account of his acceptance of the order on Sept. 13, 1877. By such acceptance, George W. Geiger became directly liable to Archibald Fletcher, the payee. It seems clear that the drawer could not have recovered this amount from the mortgagor without taking up the order, or offering to return it: King v. Kelley, for use, <a href="/pa/51/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="51 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="999831" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0036-01">51 Pa. 36</a>. It was a virtual payment of the mortgage to the extent of $150. And until the mortgagee relieved Geiger of his liability on such acceptance there would be no justice in requiring the mortgagor to pay the same amount to Peterson, the drawer of the order and the mortgagee. The rule is well settled that the assignee of a mortgage takes the same subject to all equities between the mortgagor and mortgagee: Morgan’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="126 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="968894" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0500-01">126 Pa. 500</a>; Theyken v.
