The <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>only corroboration of Mr. Smiley’s version of the contract is found in the lease which is made to four persons, and the presumption is that each had an equal interest in the leasehold estate thereby created. But a knowledge of the oil business, the manner in which leases are taken and working interests in wells are carried, and the fact that the consideration is a royalty of the oil produced by labor bestowed upon the leasehold, to some extent weakens this presumption, and it is not as strong as where land is conveyed in fee simple for a fixed sum, which, on the face of the deed, appears to have been paid by all the parties jointly. In such a case equalit}r of ownership arises out of the supposition that each party paid an equal part of the purchase money, but the privilege to drill for oil or gas may be, and usuall}*- is obtained on the covenants of the lease -to deliver a certain proportion of the oil produced, and the expenditure of money by the lessees in operating the lease; and the proportion each puts in for this purpose is frequently made the basis for calculating their respective interests in the production. But over against this presumption, giving it full weight, and the testimony of the plaintiff, we have the testimony of the two Gallaghers corroborated by that of James O’Donnell and Edward Morely, and the weight of the testimony as a whole is clearly against the plaintiff.</p>

We have no doubt that [he made the same agreement with the Gallaghers that O’Donnell did,] [4] that when the lease was executed and delivered by the McDonald Bros, to the four lessees-, this contract between them existed, [and that Smiley, when he refused to sign the writing that O’Donnell signed and denied the agreement therein set forth, was already bound by a verbal contract, the terms of which are the same as that contained in the writing signed by O’Donnell,] [4] and which, having been acted upon by the Gallaghers, could not be repudiated by him.</p>

The way this venture turned out it may be that the Gallaghers had the best of it. But it might have turned out so that the bargain made would have been most advantageous to O’Donnell and Smiley.
