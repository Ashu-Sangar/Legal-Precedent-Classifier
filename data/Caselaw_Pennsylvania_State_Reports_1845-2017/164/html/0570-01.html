Defendants admitted that the milk had been furnished, but claimed that plaintiff had entered into an entire contract with them to furnish milk during the Whole year from April, 1892, to April, 1893, and as he had failed to comply with his contract after the month of May, he was not entitled to recover. Defendants’ evidence was that the contract was made “from April 1,1892 to 1893,” at specified rates per gallon, “ for whatever he had to ship.”</p>

This view of the case, gentlemen, we cannot recognize, under the testimony. It was not a contract to furnish so many gallons of milk for so much time in a round sum, but it was an understanding between them that this plaintiff should ship what milk he had to <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>ship, whether more or less, during the year, that is, assuming the defendant’s contention with regard to the contract to be correct. It was simply an agreement that this plaintiff should ship whatever milk he had to ship, be it more or less, or be it none, to him, during the year. And upon the defendant’s contention that it should be paid for at the rate of 15 cents per gallon during April; then 12 cents per gallon until October, and then 15 cents per gallon during October and 18 cents per gallon during the remainder of the year until the 1st day of April, 1898. The defendant did not agree to take any specific quantity of him. There was no quantity mentioned. It was simply an agreement between them that whatever milk this man had to ship during these months should be paid for at these rates.” [1]</p>
