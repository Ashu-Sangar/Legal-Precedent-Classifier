Originally it was entirely in the hands of individual underwriters, and certainly there is no greater instance of the encroachment of corporate power than this, where they have not only acquired all the rights of persons, partnerships and associations, but have absolutely divested the latter of the power of exercising them. And even foreign corporations are allowed to engage in a business denied to our own citizens. That no citizen can agree to indemnify another against loss by fire, is certainly a most startling proposition. The most odious species of monopoly is where a government grants to a body of men any particular trade or business. If the power exists, the legislature could grant to one corporation the exclusive right to sell dry goods, inflicting penalties upon any one who interfered with it, and thus destroy that free competition which is the life of all healthy trade.</p>

The state may also prohibit certain kinds of business by individuals, because the public convenience demands that they should be carried on by agents of the government. The carrying of the mails and the supply of gas and water under the public streets are instances of this. See New Orleans Gas Company v. Louisiana Light Company, <a href="/us/115/0650-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 U.S. 650" data-case-ids="3514779" data-case-paths="/us/115/0650-01">115 U.

But the business engaged in must be shown, either by the common law or by appropriate legislation, to be deleterious or from necessity governmental.

The very act itself only forbids contracts of indemnity against ‘ fire and lightning,’ while policies of insurance on lives, accidents, by way of guaranty, marine, against storms, tornadoes and explosions, are left free to every one, so that it must be something prejudicial to the communit}r, in individuals entering into contracts against loss by fire and lightning as opposed to other contracts of insurance. What that can be, it is difficult to imagine. If carried to its legitimate result, it would probably prevent a citizen from erecting a lightning rod for a neighbor, as being a guaranty against loss from lightning.</p>

Little more has been attempted by the courts of this country than to determine that a particular subject does or does not fall within the range of this power. An illustration is afforded by the Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, <a href="/us/97/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="97 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="3376606" data-case-paths="/us/97/0025-01">97 U.

Its exercise may be limited by the frame or constitution of a particular government, but its natural limitations, in the absence of a written constitution, are found in the situation and necessities of the state, and these must be judged of in the first instance by the government itself. It corresponds to the right of self-preservation in the individual. When the dangers that threaten the state come from without, the right of self-preservation is exercised in gathering armies and the means of public defence. When the dangers arise within the state, self-preservation requires their suppression. This is accomplished by the exercise of the police power which deals with all forms of disorder, and provides for the public welfare, and the protection of citizens against the violence and the fraudulent conduct of each other.</p>

' In disposing of it, the legislature is subject to no limitations except such as the constitution of the state may impose. Within the lines set by constitutional provisions, the power of the legislature is practically absolute; but if it is alleged that a given police regulation violates the fundamental law, a question is raised for the determination of the courts, whose duty it is to apply the constitutional tests and adjudge the law to be void if it is in conflict with them. In this case we are to appfy the first section of the bill of rights to the act of 1870 in order to determine whether it can be enforced. If the act denies the inherent and inalienable right of the citizen to acquire, possess and protect propertjq which is asserted by this section of the bill of rights, then the judgment of the court below was right and this appeal should be dismissed; but if this right is not denied, and the effect of the act of 1870 is merely to regulate its exercise, then the judgment should be reversed and the defendant 'should suffer the penalty of the law he has disregarded.</p>

The legislature has considered the question and passed .upon it and this makes a prima facie case in favor of the law. We observe in the n,ext place that this question is to be considered upon the state of the law as it is when the question' is ’raised. Since 1870 the constitution of the state has been remodeled and many of its new provisions have been enforced by suitable legislation. Our question is not, therefore, whether the act of 1870 was valid under the constitution as it then stood, but whether it was valid when its provisions were invoked against the defendant in 1894. Our third observation is that the question is not controlled by common law maxims. The police power must necessarily enlarge its range as business expands and society develops. The proper office of statutes is to remedy the defects and modify the operation of common law rules to meet changed conditions in society and increased volume and improved methods in business.</p>

The states of the Union have severally entered upon legislation regulating insurance. In. each an insurance department of the state government has been organized. A general supervision and control of insurance companies has been assumed by the states, and exercised through the insurance department. In our own state this system of legislation began as early as 1810, and it has grown in bulk and importance with the groAvth of business and the development of the resources of the state. It fixes the minimum of actual capital necessary to the organization of a corporation for insurance against fire, on the stock plan, at one hundred thousand dollars. It provides for a reserve fund for the security of .policy holders. It prohibits the division of profits in dividends to the injury of the reserve fund. It regulates the form of policy and requires the application to be attached to, or made part of, the policy. It requires each company to submit detailed statements of the business done, of its assets and liabilities, and to show its financial condition. It requires companies, organized under the laws of other states or countries, to make certain deposits in this state to secure those who are insured by them, and to appoint some suitable agent on Avhom process may be served in actions brought against them. These regulations have been made from time to time as their importance has been felt by the public. They are all easy of enforcement against corporations. Some of them cannot be enforced against private persons or partnerships. As matter of fact the business has for many years been left to the corporations, and regulations made to affect corporations have therefore met fully the public need. <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>At this time, however, private capital is seeking employment in this field, and it signalizes its entry upon the field by a denial of the power of the state over it. This question has been raised by the corporations of other states, but I recall no case in which it has been raised by individuals. In Doyle v. The Continental Insurance Company, <a href="/us/94/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="94 U.S. 535" data-case-ids="5645962" data-case-paths="/us/94/0535-01">94 U. S. 535</a>, the Supreme Court of the United States stated the general rule thus : “ A state has the right to impose conditions, not in conflict with the constitution of the United States, on the doing of insurance business within its territory by an insurance company chartered by another state,’ or to exclude it altogether.” It would seem to follow logically that the state might require all persons desiring to enter upon the business to comply with the same conditions and, if necessary, to obtain a charter of incorporation in order to such compliance.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[251,1133,1165,960]]]'>An effort is made to distinguish between regulation and prohibition and to hold that the act of 1870 is a prohibition operating upon all natural persons for the benefit of corporations, who are thus given an oppressive monopoly of the business of insurance against fire. But the prohibition is only such as is necessary to give effect to the regulation which the act prescribes. The act implies a declaration by the legislature that the business of insurance against fire affects so many persons, and involves such large sums of money, as to make it necessary for the public protection that it be subjected to the supervision and control of the government; that the supervision required is such as private persons cannot be compelled to submit their business conduct to; and then expressly declares that all persons desiring to embark in the business must procure a charter of incorporation for that purpose because corporations are subject to the supervision and control of the state that creates them. This is regulative. It directs the business into the only channel that admits the necessary measure of control and it necessarily prohibits the business outside that channel.</p>

Here, as in the act of 1870, we find permission to those who comply with the regulation, and prohibition to those who do not. The practice of <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>medicine, the sale of drugs, and many other .sorts of business are regulated by law; but the regulation would be without effect if it did not include a prohibition directed against those not qualified, and enforce it with suitable penalties. The police power of a state may be exerted for the complete or the partial control of a given business. It may prohibit it absolutely to all persons for the purpose of suppression. It may permit it to some persons and under certain restrictions in order to secure control over it and hold it within proper bounds: Stone v. Mississippi, <a href="/us/101/0814-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="101 U.S. 814" data-case-ids="5630283" data-case-paths="/us/101/0814-01">101 U. S. 814</a>. The;Sunday laws, the laws against gambling, against lotteries, against disorderly houses, the sale of liquors, the sale of oleomargarine, the sale of drugs, and many similar laws afford instances of the exercise of the police power for the complete suppression of a given line of employment, or for its restriction and control.</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[191,1152,1165,646]]]'>The act of 1870 belongs to the latter class. It does not prohibit the business of insurance but regulates it. It says to all persons interested, “ If you wish to embark in this business you must secure a charter of incorporation so as to subject your business to the visitorial power of' the state. If you will not do this you must not engage in insurance against fire at all.” This is not prohibition of the business, for the business is distinctly authorized. It is an effort to bring it under state supervision and control, by requiring all who wish to enter the business to put themselves in a position where the insurance legislation of the state will reach them, and the insurance department of the state can supervise their business, and compel observance of the law.</p>

The right to limit the transaction of the business of fire insurance to incorporated associations, is not, in express terms, forbidden. But the right of natural persons to make contracts of indemnity against loss by fire or shipwreck was, for centuries before the adoption of the constitution, a common law right. All the authorities, without a single exception, hold that, under the constitutional light to acquire, possess and protect property, there is necessarily included the light to make reasonable contracts concerning it, which contracts are protected by the constitution. In this, all agree. And all agree, further, that the legislature may, in the exercise of its police power, absolutely .forbid contracts which are inimical to public interests; and, second, may adopt suitable regulations of contracts for the protection of the public.</p>

It may -require that all who desire to transact business with the public, shall take out a license, shall make frequent reports of their financial condition; have fixed places of business where service of process can be had on them; that they shall deposit with the treasurer, or other officer of the commonwealth, bonds or other securities in sufficient amount to guarantee those with whom they contract against loss.

But no one contends that it is. On the contrary, it is admitted it is to the advantage of the publie. The legislature admits this by expressly authorizing artificial persons to conduct it. If such contracts be not injurious to the public, and may not be altogether prohibited, then where is the authority to prohibit one class, natural persons, from entering into them, and specially empowering another and numerically- a very much smaller class, artificial persons, to make them ? In so doing the state grants a monopoly in a particular business -to a particular class.</p>

But to carry on this business at all involves a right of eminent domain, which the state alone can exercise or grant, and therefore it ought not to be exercised by private individuals. There is not, and never was, a right in the individual to take private property for the construction and operation of a public highway, on which to conduct for profit the business of transportation ; but there never was a time that the individual had not the right to make a contract to indemnify his fellow against loss by fire. This act is not obnoxious to the constitution because it authorizes corporations to' insure against fire, but because it prohibits individuals doing a like business. It grants a monopoly of a particular business to a particular class; prohibits all others from engaging in it. This the legislature may, in the exercise of its police power, in some cases do. It may declare that females shall not be employed in some avocations ; that children under a certain age shall not be employed in mines or factories; that none but men of good repute shall sell liquor by retail; and the wisdom of such legislation is not a question which the courts can consider; for it is adopted to promote the health, morals and good order of the public.</p>

The banking intended to be restricted by the New York act, was issuing of notes, receiving of deposits and discounting. In People v. Utica Ins.

That an individual was not prohibited from doing a banking business, except as to issuing bank notes. It has always been held to be within the police power of the legislature to restrict the issuing of notes, intended to pass as money, to corporations. It is a matter which concerns the entire public, who have no opportunity, in the hurry of every-day business transactions of life, to ascertain the value of the promise which is tendered as money. Butin a contract <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>of indemnity, why should not the citizen make his contract when and where the price and security suits him best ? Why should the legislature take from the whole people their common law right of contract for insurance, and grant it to a particular class ? Where is there the semblance of the constitutional exercise of the police power in this ? Under the corporation act of 1874, and supplements, corporations for almost every business are authorized, such as supplying ice, printing and publishing, conducting hotels, drove-yards, livery-stables, lumbering, quarrying, mining, brewing, distilling, improvement and sale of real estate. In fact, almost evéry kind of business can be transacted by incorporated companies. All concern the public. If this act be constitutional, the legislature can prohibit the transaction of any business, if not conducted by corporations under the act of 1874, and under the pain of imprisonment forbid the individual engaging in any business whatever.</p>
