It is incumbent upon the plaintiff therefore to show in this suit all that it would have been necessary for Eli B. Went-worth to show in order to recover the premises from Warner; It is not enough that Warner was evicted from the possession of the land, but it must affirmatively appear that he was so evicted by a title paramount to that conveyed by the defendant. Until this is done it is a matter of no importance whether Harmon, at the time of his conveyance, had any title or not. The plaintiff here must recover upon the strength of Eli B.

Hé did offer a survey and patent for the tract of land, but does not even claim that the land therein described can be identified so as to include the land in question. Unless the recital in the deed from the executors of Huidekoper to McKinney, to the effect that their testator was seized in his demesne .as of fee, is evidence in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant, there is no evidence of title out of the commonwealth, unless it may be safely assumed, as it is intimated by: the present Chief Justice in Jones v.

But if the recital may be regarded as such evidence it seems to me sufficient to establish that fact. It is in the nature of an admission’ or solemn declaration that before the date of the deed containing this, recital the title was out of the commonwealth, since otherwise it could not have been vested in H. J. Huidekoper. The recital is undoubtedly evidence against the grantors in the deed and all their successors in title. It'is not conclusive, amounting to an estoppel,- except as against, themselves and their privies and in favor of persons in privity with them. But when set up by a stranger, though not conclusive, it is evidence subject to be rebutted as other evidence-may be, and, in the absence of any countervailing proof, is sufficient to establish the fact.

This is also a necessary' postulate from the admission of the defendant’s counsel that the land sold covered 53 acres of the land concerning which this controversy has arisen. The payment of taxes before the sale and the redemption of the land after the sale are matters which are proper to be shown in avoidance of a title under a tax sale. It is not necessary that one who claims under such sale should affirmatively prove the non-payment of taxes or the non-redemption <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>of the land.

If the tract contained precisely 197 acres, it is possible that there was included in this payment or redemption some portion of the 74 acres, claimed by Wentworth. But in the absence of any evidence we cannot assume this to be so, nor locate what part, if any, of the 74 acres was redeemed. The assessment of the land, and the fact that taxes did not appear by the record to have been paid at the time of sale, is sufficient to sustain the tax title ; and the evidence failing to show that any part of this particular land was redeemed, or intended to be, we are constrained to hold that the tax title, under the first sale at least, was valid as to the entire piece of land.</p>
