Plaintiff’s evidence tended to show that the abutment of the bridge on defendant’s side of the Loyalhanna creek was approached by a curve which descended by a considerable grade to the bridge. There was no guard-rail or wall on the lower side of the bridge. There was evidence that the bridge had been in this condition for some time prior to the accident. Plaintiff, in describing the accident, said: “ Just when we got over the bridge, barely across the bridge, the horse suddenly shied and just plunged, himself over the abutment.” Steele Mechesney testified: Well, as we drove off through the bridge, as soon as the horse got off the plank of the bridge he frightened at something, and jumped over the side of the abutment.”.</p>
