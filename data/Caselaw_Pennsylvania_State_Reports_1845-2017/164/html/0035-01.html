Calling it.a penalty is some evidence that it was so intended, but this is overcome if equity demands that it shall be treated as liquidated damages. In determining the equities of the particular case, the relation which the sum bears to the extent of the injury provided against will be considered, and where there are a number of covenants, and the sum named would be payable for a breach of any one of them, even the least, it is a penalty.</p>

Held, (1) that the penal sum mentioned in the contract was a penalty, and not liquidated damages; (2) that it was not the intention of the parties that defendant was to have the privilege of practice on the payment to plaintiff of four hundred dollars; (3) that as there was an utter uncertainty in any calculation of damages from the breach of the covenants, and the measure of damages was largely conjectural, equity would intervene because of the inadequacy of the remedy at law; (4) that plaintiff was entitled to an injunction for the specific performance of the contract.</p>

He then returned to Lehman Centre and formed a partnership with Colley in the practice of medicine.

Three years before, he had sold out his practice to one Dri Hise, stipulating verbally that, at the end of three years, lie would cease practicing. Hise’s purchase included, besides Colley’s practice, his property in Lehman Centre, valued at $1,525, and Hise for the same consideration sold to Wilkinson. Colley, at the end of the three years, stopped practicing about three months, then, disregarding his agreement with Hise, commenced again, and continued to February, 1888. On the 6th of that month, he and Wilkinson entered into another agreement, this time in writing, whereby, in consideration of two hundred dollars, Colley covenanted: 1. That he would not practice as a physician at Lehman Centre, or within eight miles thereof, for a period of ten years. 2. That he would use his influence in favor of Wilkinson, and remain at Lehman for three months, so as to prevent opposition. 3.

It is unnecessary to examine the numerous authorities in detail, for they are neither uniform nor consistent. No definite rule to determine the question is furnished by them, each being determined more in direct-reference to its own facts than to any general rule.

The words were: “ And each party is hereby held and fully bound in the sum of $300 for the faithful fulfilment of the above contract.” This was held a penalty, the court saying, the defendant has no equity that language which technically provides a penalty shall be treated as liquidated damages. That, where the parties call it a penalty, it will be so construed, unless equity demands otherwise.</p>

Williams, says, the presumption is that a lump sum named by the parties to a contract is a penalty rather than liquidated damages ; the name by which it is called is of slight weight, the controlling elements being the intent of the parties and the special circumstances of the case. Where there are numerous covenants of the most varied kinds and importance, and yet the sum named is payable for a breach of any, even the least, it is a penalty.</p>

And that, in determining the equities of the particular case, the relation which the sum bears to the extent of the injury .provided against, will be considered. That where there are a number of covenants, and the sum named would be payable for a breach of any one of them, even the least, it is a penalty.</p>

Colley, by the death of his father, found it necessary to remove and locate in Columbia county. In consideration of $200 he covenants not to practice in Lehman Centre for ten years. He was a physician forty years of age; his practice was well established and valuable to another physician, especially to a young man, who had graduated but a short time before ; it was of but small value to Colley, for he must abandon it, and take up his residence in another county, even if he gets nothing for it. Its sole value to the purchaser, however, depends on Colley remaining away, in which event it is of very great value. It is of no value at all, if Colley soon returns. Is it reasonable to suppose, that Wilkinson intended Colley should have the privilege of resuming practice on payment to him of a sum equal to $40 per year, about the value of the patronage of a single patient ? Colley admits, in his testimony, that many of his old patients have come back to him since his return, and he was there less than a year before testifying. The sum is so out of proportion to the whole damages which Wilkinson would sustain by a breach of it, that it seems to us improbable that it was intended as liquidated damages by him. But, change the action to one for damages, and suppose that Wilkinson had brought suit against Colley for selling a single phial of medicine for a dime, which Colley covenanted not to do; would Colley have submitted to a judgment of $400 in liquidated damages for the breach, or would he have invoked equity to relieve him from the gross extravagance and hardship of the full penalty, wholly out of proportion to the nature and extent of the injury? Or, if he had returned four days before the end of the ten years, and commenced practice, would the $400, or at the rate of $100 per day, have been the liquidated damages for the violation of the covenant ? Yet the sum named here is payable for the breach of any one, even the least of these covenants.</p>

He first sold out his'property and practice for a large sum to Dr. Hise, and Wilkinson bought from Hise. Then defendant resumed practice ; then again, by the most explicit agree1 ment in writing, he sold to Wilkinson, and deliberately violated his covenants, to the manifest injury of Wilkinson, and, on his own showing, he did this because it paid him better to break his contract than to keep it. The equities of the case, therefore, are all with the plaintiff. We hold that the $400 stipulated here is a penalty only. The contradictory parol evidence is without significance, in view of the plain terms of the contract, and the circumstances surrounding the parties when they entered into it; we do not attempt to reconcile it, because the contract itself is not ambiguous, and the circumstances under which it was made are undisputed; these are the controlling facts in settling its interpretation.</p>

As we do not concur with him in this view, the question remains, whether, treating it as a penalty, in equity the plaintiff is entitled to a specific performance of the contract. That plaintiff could maintain an action at law for damages, for breach of the contract, there is no doubt. But it is a well settled rule, that although the action at law will lie, yet if there is an utter uncertainty in any calculation of damages from the breach of the covenants, and the measure of damages is largely conjectural^ equity will intervene because of the inadequacy of the remedy. The plaintiff claimed damages to the amount~bf~!one hundred dollars per month, up to the hearing of the case before the master, and offered evidence to establish this claim. But there was no full hearing on the merits of this branch of the case, nor any finding of fact by the master, and we pass no opinion on this evidence. It remains open, for further proceedings in the court below, to determine the amount of damages sustained by plaintiff, between the return of defendant to Lehman Centre and the issuing of this injunction. We only determine that from the very nature of this contract an action at law is a wholly inadequate remedy for its <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>persistent violation during the ten years, and therefore equity will specifically enforce performance of it by injunction: Palmer v. Graham, 1 Parsons, 476.</p>
