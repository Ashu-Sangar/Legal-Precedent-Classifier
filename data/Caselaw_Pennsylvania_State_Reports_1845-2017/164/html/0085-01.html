Defendants appealed and filed a transcript of the alderman in the court of common pleas. Plaintiff, alleging that the appeal had not been taken in time, obtained a rule to strike off the appeal, and this rule was subsequently made absolute.

Here the judgment was merely opened and an issue awarded. Until the issue is tried and the court acts on it, a final judgment is not entered. It would be intolerable to have an appeal on the opening order, and then an appeal on the determination of the issue and final decree of the court.” See also Campbell v.
