The shares of all, except Mrs. Butts, were bequeathed to David M. Butts as trustee; he was also appointed sole executor. In less than a year after the execution of the will, the testatrix died. The legatees, except Mrs.' Butts, contested the will, on the ground that the testatrix was of unsound mind at the date of its execution, and that she had been induced to make it by the undue influence of her son-in-law, D. M. Butts. Much testimony was taken, and, after due consideration, the orphans’ court directed an issue to be tried in the common pleas, to determine whether the testatrix was possessed of sufficient mental capacity to execute the will, but refused an issue to determine whether it had been procured by undue influence.

The court apparently resolved itself into a sort of debating society, each member maintaining his side of the question by an opinion filed of record, with the not unusual result of this kind of debate, the further it proceeded the more remote was the end <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>of it; this was probably interesting to the debaters, but whether the suitors, who foot the bill, have the same measure of enjoyment out of it is at least doubtful. Section 11 of our Bill of Bights suggests a course of conduct in litigation which should be present in the minds of those who hold judicial station in this commonwealth. That section says : “ All courts shall be open, and every man, for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and right and justice administered without sale, denial or delay.” The real interests of the parties to this contention would have been best promoted bjr a final judgment in the court below, without delay. Each party wanted a judgment; neither was specially concerned in the reasons for it ; the judges seem to have been specially interested in their rights and reasons, and -less in a speedy judgment. It was the judgment of this court, on the evidence presented when the case was here before, that a jury should pass on the questions of testamentary capacity and undue influence. If the evidence at the trial was the same, or substantially the same, .it was then for the court below to carry our judgment into effect, not grudgingly, but with that fairness and impartiality which, in the performance of a plain dut}*-, becomes a tribunal intrusted with the judicial administration- of justice.</p>

In the commencement of these proceedings, before the first trial in this court, the president judge was of the opinion that there was evideiicé for the consideration of a jury as to testamentary capacity, and he awarded an issue to try that disputed fact; but he refused an issue on the question of undue influence, and on that refusal was based the first appeal. On review here, we concurred with him as to the issue awarded, but thought tire evidence on both questions so blended, that the issue should be directed for trial of both. The question then, as to testamentary capacity, went before the jury, from the judgment of the court below and of this- court, on the preliminary evidence. After a full trial in presence of the court and jury, with every opportunity of cross-examination and judgment of credibility from appearance and manner of witnesses, the court submitted the evidence on this instruction: <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>“ The witnesses on part of the contestants, testified, generally, that Mrs. Armor not only was a very old woman, but that for years and years she seemed to have lived within herself; that she would sit quietly and converse but little, and that it was only when her attention was called directly by conversation that they could interest her in it. But these same witnesses all testified, with perhaps one or two slight exceptions, that when they did call her attention directly to any matter, the answers were rational; and when they gave her answers on the stand, they were seen to be so. I do not recollect any irrational expression, proven by any witness in this case, that Mrs. Armor made. If there were any, you must recall them from the testimony; but the court recollects of no irrational remark that Mrs. Armor made, as detailed by any witness in the case. They also described her physical condition; that she would wave her hands; that she would talk to herself; and that she would drum on the window. They also described her conduct in the garden, and that she did once cut off the cabbage in September; and when her attention was called to it, she did not deny it, but made some slight remark to the effect that it didn’t matter much. Now, whether that was an act showing imbecility of mind or mental disease, or a pre-occupied mind, or whether it showed a little spirit of mischief or vandalism, would be for the jury to determine under all the facts in the case. She did not justify'- the act when her attention was called to it, and just why that act was done, we cannot aid you in ascertaining. You are to determine it as far as it is a fact, in connection with the other facts in this case.”</p>

What was noticed by the learned judge, was called to the attention of the jury, and they were instructed that they were to determine the question in connection with the other facts in the case. It is true, there was much evidence tending to contra-<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>diet this evidence of contestants, and, certainly, the learned judge did not permit the jury to forget it, for he brought it specially to their notice, and did not neglect to emphaticallv express his opinion as to its force. Nevertheless, the jury found a verdict for defendants, on the ground that the testatrix was not of sound and disposing mind and memory at the time she executed the will. Then, on the reserved point, the learned president judge in vacation entered judgment for plaintiff, notwithstanding the verdict, on the ground that the inference of incapacity was not warranted from the facts alleged to be proven. This was precisely the error for which this court reversed the court below in North American Oil Co. v. Forsyth, <a href="/pa/48/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="48 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="422283" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0291-01">48 Pa. 291</a>. The court there submitted the contradictory evidence of a fact to the jury, and after the jury found the fact, on a point reserved, entered judgment non obstante veredicto, on the ground that the facts did not warrant the inference drawn from them by the jury. This Court says: “ It may be, as stated by the learned judge in his opinion upon the reserved points, that there was nothing in the evidence from which readiness to pay on delivery could properly be inferred, but under his instruction, this was a fact submitted, and if improperly found, the remedy was a new trial.”</p>

At the very most, his opinion only shows that, from the weight of the evidence, the jury ought to have found a different verdict.</p>
    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[177,1917,1179,449]],["BL_106.1",106,[259,385,1160,96]]]'>His answer is not responsive to his point reserved. That is, “ whether there is any evidence on which defendants are entitled to recover ? ” The answer is, that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in inferring that the testatrix was lacking in testamentary capacity. Whether warranted or unwarranted, the jury believed defendants’ witnesses, and, on the facts testified to by them, drew the inference, which the court, instructed them they might draw, if they thought it was warranted. 'The court cannot now draw an opposite one, and neg<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>ative the verdict.

    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[258,486,1167,1326]]]'>But the judgment on the reserved point necessarily involves another error. The evidence on both questions, that of mental capacity and undue influence, was submitted to the "jury, and at the close of the charge they were instructed thus: “ And in drawing out your verdict, if you say you find for the defendants, then write out in full what you mean by that, whether you find she was not of sound mind and memory, or that she was acting under undue influence.” The verdict was for defendants, and that she was not of sound mind. But not a word is said as to the question of undue influence. It is assumed, the silence of the jury is a finding for plaintiff. This may or may not have been the case; there is nothing in the charge; or upon the record, to show that the jury passed on that question; the probability is they did not. They were instructed to find generally, and then, if for defendants, state one or other of the grounds in support of the finding, but not instructed to return their findings on both grounds. It is not an unwarranted assumption that the jury, when they retired to deliberate, in considering the testimony as to mental capacity, found for defendants ; in the absence of instructions to return findings on both questions, they went no further, and at once made up their verdict. In so doing, they literally obeyed the instructions of the court. If this was the case, then the reserved point, and the judgment upon it, did not embrace the issue, and for that reason the judgment entered by the learned president judge could not be sustained.</p>

It is not necessary to discuss their powers and functions as individual members of the court at the trial. It is not going too falto assume that there was consultation of the court at the close of the evidence, its weight and significance discussed, and that the charge, which submitted it to the consideration of the jury, was the charge of the court, and not the charge of a single member of it. After the rendition of the verdict, the record <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>does not show that the same court entered a single one of the four judgments, or ever met for that purpose.</p>

Then, after adjournment, they confmenced to act, not as a court in eonsultatipn over a grave question involving-both fact and law, but as individuals. Without consultation-with the associates, the president judge proceeded to his home, and there determined, there was no evidence of mental incapacity to submit to the jury, although, presumptively, the court composed of himself and the associates, had agreed there was such evidence, and so charged the.jury. Then, without consultation with the associates, he filed in vacation this opinion as the judgment of the court.</p>

There was a special court held, for the trial of special causes, at which the president judge of another. district presided, and the two associates sat with him.
