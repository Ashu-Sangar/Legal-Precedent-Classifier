H. Leard and C. Leard, his father, after which announcement was made that the title would be made good or the money paid refunded ; the sale then proceeded, and the property was sold to P. P. Burford for the sum of $795, he being the highest bidder. It also appears that the title to the land thus sold was in W. H. Leard, C. Leard and J. S. Leard, each owning a one-<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>third interest. The purchaser, P. P. Burford, now contends and asks that the sale be set aside by reason of his having to pay for the title of J. S. Leard in this property in addition to the bid at the assignee’s sale before he can obtain a full and complete title to the land.</p>

Burford at the time of the sale knew that the title to this property was not wholly in W. H. Leard, and knew that the title was in W. H. Leard, C. Leard, and J. S. Leard. Had he not known these facts after the statement had been made, as shown by the evidence, that the title would be made good or the purchase money refunded, he would be entitled to have the sale set aside. It also appears from the evidence that after the sale was made he had some arrangements or negotiations concerning the purchasing of the J.. S. Leard title; and from these circumstances and facts we conclude that he was not deceived in any manner by the statements that the title would be made good, or the money refunded. The exceptions are therefore dismissed and the sale confirmed.”</p>

Leard, appellant became one of the successful bidders ; and the assignee, having made return of the sale accordingly, asked the court to confirm the same, etc. Exceptions to the confirmation, filed by appellant, having been overruled, the sale was confirmed; and thereupon this appeal was taken. In his opinion overruling said exceptions the learned judge says that, at the time of sale, appellant <em>u </em>knew that the title to this property was not wholly in W. H. Leard, and knew that the title was in W. H. Leard, C. Leard and J. S. Leard. Had he not known these facts, after the statement had been made—as <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>shown by the evidence—that the title would be made good or the purchase money refunded, he would be entitled to have the sale set aside. It also appears from the evidence that, after the sale was made, he had some arrangements or negotiations concerning the purchasing of the J. S. Leard title ; and from these facts and circumstances we conclude that he was not deceived in any manner by the statements that the title would be made good, or the money refunded.” These findings of fact were warranted by the testimony and must now be accepted as verities. As such, they are a conclusive answer to appellant’s contention that he was deceived by said statements, etc.</p>
