Whether this latt.er opinion was correct or not is not now before us, and the former is immaterial, for it is conceded that if the tax title to Oscar Fox in 1859, under which the plaintiffs .claim, is valid, any title in the defendants’ grantors under the former sale was cut off. The question therefore-was whether the plaintiffs had shown a valid title in themselves, and as the evidence consisted wholly of deeds and records, the force and effect of which it is the duty of the court to declare, both parties required the opinion of the court upon the points of law'involved by written requests, and with the concurrence of the counsel on both sides the facts in evidence were stated on the record and a verdict taken for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court upon-the law of the case.</p>

No formal entry of any adjournment to that day appears, but it shows an adjournment of sales to Dec. 28,1858,. and there is a note of the sale to Fox on the 24th of January, 1859. There is another set of entries which show the sales, adjourned from the 28th of September, 1858, to the 28th of Dec., 1859, many months after the sale to Oscar Fox purports-to have been made. But as the sales book is not a record required by law, but merely a book kept for the convenience of the treasurer, we think it ought not to outweigh his solemn declaration in the deed which the law does require, and which is done under the sanction of his. official oath. If the sales-book was positive in the declaration that there were no adjourned sales between Sept., 1858, and Dec., 1859, a question of fact might have been raised which we should have submitted to the jury; but the two sets of entries are inconsistent with, each other, and the most that can be said is that one or the other is a mistake, and there is no means afforded by the evidence of determining with certainty which one is correct. The probability is that the December, 1859, should be December, 1858, but at all events there is' no such contradiction of the-recitals in the deed as would justify the submission of the deed and the book to a jury.</p>

This book also exhibits a most lamentable inaccuracy in the prothonotary then in office. Under the heading dated ‘Tuesday the 28th day of September 1858 ’ there is an entry that Charles J. Fox, treasurer of Forest county, acknowledged in open court certain deeds, among which is a ‘ deed to Oscar Fox for 100 acres warrant No. 2995,’ which is the land in dispute. The entry recites, however, that this acknowledgment was on Tuesday the 27th day of September, 1858. The defendants claim that this shows that the deed under which the plaintiffs claim was not in fact acknowledged in open court, since the only entry of an acknowledgment to Oscar Fox is several months prior to the sale recited in the plaintiffs’ deed, and to the date thereof. The figure ‘ 8 ’ in the year of the last date above referred to is manifestly written over an erasure. A reference to the almanac shows that the 27th of September, 1858, fell on Monday and not on Tuesday; and that in 1859 it fell on Tuesday. These facts lend some color to the argument that the original date was September, 1859, which would be in harmony with the deed, and would thus supply the date to the certificate on the deed. If it is to be considered merely ás a question of contradiction, what we have said in respect to the sales book would be equally .applicable. The uncertainty of the minute docket would not overthrow the certainty of the certificate on the deed, which, though failing to give the date, is positive to the fact that the deed was acknowledged in open court. The presumption is that the deed was executed at its date, and that it was signed before it was acknowledged. But if the record of the acknowledgment is essential to the validity of the deed, then we think it cannot be said that such a record exists. As we cannot contradict or supply the record by parol, we must treat it as correct, and the deed which it declares was acknowledged Sept. 27, 1858, cannot be the deed dated Jan. 24,1859, or if so, then the record clearly shows that it was acknowledged before the sale took place or the deed was executed.</p>

Subsequent laws transferred the duty from the sheriffs to- the county treasurers, but without affecting the mode of proceeding. The acknowledg<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ment of the deed, in both cases is a judicial act, and passes the title of real estate from the former owner to another by 'operation of law. In the case of sales for taxes the registry of the acknowledgment in open court is the only record which the law requires to be kept from which any person interested, former owner or intending purchaser, can learn whether the land has or has not been sold for taxes. True, there may be a book kept in the treasurer’s office, which will give notice, and there may be a record of the deed in the recorder’s office, but the former is not required, and the latter was not authorized until 1846. The courts have uniformly given to the record of acknowledgment in open court the same effect, whether the deed was made by the sheriff or treasurer. See Duff v. Wynkoop, supra.</p>

The acknowledgment is something more than a mere authentication of the treasurer’s signature; it is a judicial act, -the completion of the process by which the land of a citizen is taken for his debt to the public. The law gives him two years in which to redeem, and the test of regularity in many cases has been whether or not the owner, coming to examine, would learn of the sale of his land. As we have said already, the minute of the acknowledgment is the only public record required by law which will afford that information. Moreover, though the sale may be irregular, even though no surplus' bond were taken, the limitation in the act of assembly bars the owner from recovering his land after five years from the delivery of the deed to <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>the purchaser.
