If Mrs. Richmond had already had a policy on the life of her husband', with annual premiums heretofore paid, whjr would not that policy, with a money value readily ascertainable, be her separate property ?

The Court, Green, J., says, ‘The theory that because she borrowed the money with which to pay for the horse, it was a purchase on credit and therefore the horse belonged to the husband, has no force, first, because the wife paid her own money for the horse, and, second, she did not get the money from her husband, but borrowed it from a third party.
