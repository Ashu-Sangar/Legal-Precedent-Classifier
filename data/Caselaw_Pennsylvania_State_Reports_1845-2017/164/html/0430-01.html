This was only another way of expressing the same power given to the executors in Grant v. Hook, to sell ‘ all such part as may be necessary to pay my debts and educate my children,’ and in that case the will intimated the existence of personal assets for the payment of debts ; in this case the will in a previous clause directs the payment of debts by the executrix, thus indicating the existence of debts, but not intimating, except in the general bequest, the existence of personal property. Again, if a purchaser is not required to see to the appropriation of purchase money to the education of minor children because of its impossibility, how could he see to its appropriation to their maintenance? And how could he ascertain the extent of the «necessity existing to sell for their maintenance ? The language employed by Richard Sharp in making provision for the payment of his debts and the maintenance of his family does not differ in effect from that employed in hundreds of wills authorizing the sale of real estate for these purposes, the implication or inference in all such is that a sale is only to be made in case of necessity, and yet it would be unprecedented to require a purchaser, or a subsequent owner, at the suit of an heir, to prove that the necessity existed in order to hold the land. The same rule that excuses him from looking to the application of the purchase money would excuse him from that. The executrix of Richard Sharp could have obtained an order of sale from the orphans’ court to sell real estate for the payment of debts or for the maintenance of his family (consisting at the time of his death of nine children, the oldest of whom was but thirteen years old), had there been no such provision in his will; it is presumed that he was aware of this provision in the law,, and it is apparent that he imposed special confidence and trust in her, and in her judgment and management, and he did not wish her to be required to go into court and give security and undergo the incident expenses, therefore he authorized her to sell, and the difficulty she would experience in finding a purchaser need only to be mentioned to be appreciated. If, under the law, that purchaser would be required to investigate whether the necessity existed, he might conclude that it did exist, she might conclude that it existed, and yet if the law be as contended for by plaintiff, his title would depend on the verdict of <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>as many juries as there were surviving children, and in this case that would be nine; one jury might hold the evidence, offered to show that a sale was necessary, sufficient, and another jury might hold it insufficient, and we cannot conceive of the law placing such impediments in the way of an executrix authorized to sell by such language as that employed by Richard Sharp; to do so would be to defeat his purpose plainly expressed, and he might as well have died intestate, as no oue could be found who would buy, or as Justice Duncan concludes his Opinion in Grant v. Hook, supra: ‘ It would re'nder the power a useless one, for no prudent man would buy under such a load of responsibility.’ ”</p>
