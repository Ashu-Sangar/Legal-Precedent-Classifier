Petty, Esq., as examiner and master, from whose report it appeared that, on July 1, 1889, plaintiff and defendant entered into a partnership for the purpose of engaging in the business of buying and selling real es<a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>tate and collecting rents. Defendant had previoudy been in the business, and plaintiff had been an employee. The articles provided that defendant, the party of the first part, should have a two thirds interest in the business, and that plaintiff should have a one third interest. Plaintiff agreed to pay eight thousand dollars to defendant with interest upon so much of the principal as was unpaid, for his one third interest in the partnership. Upon a dissolution, all of the personal property, books, papers, maps, plans and unexecuted orders of the partnership were to become the property of defendant, for the purpose of enabling him to continue the business previously done by said partnership, in his own name, and for his own benefit. In the event of a dissolution at any time, or for any cause, the value of plaintiff’s interest was to be ascertained as follows: “ The interest is considered as valued at eight thousand dollars, based on annual gross receipts, from the rent-collecting department, of eight thousand dollars. At the time of dissolution, therefore, the said interest shall be valued by the gross receipts from said department for the twelve months previous to dissolution. If the gross receipts therefrom are greater than eight thousand dollars for that period,, the valuation of the second party’s interest is to be increased accordingly; if the gross receipts therefrom are less than eight thousand dollars for that period the valuation is to be decreased accordingly. When the valuation is ascertained in the foregoing manner, then from said valuation is to be deducted the amount still owing by said second party to said first party on account of said interest, and the balance, if any, paid to the said second party.” The death of defendant should not operate as a dissolution, but his representatives should succeed to all of his rights under the agreement, and continue the partnership until dissolved, when they should be entitled to continue the business, paying plaintiff for his interest in the manner above specified. In case of the death of plaintiff the partnership was to be dissolved, and defendant was to settle with plaintiff’s representatives in the manner above set forth.</p>

As to them, the agreement provides thus: “In the event of a dissolution of the firm, from any cause, all the personal property, books, papers, maps, plans and unexecuted orders belonging to or in the possession of such partnership shall become the property of the said first party, for the purpose of enabling said first party to continue the business, previously done by said partnership, in his own name and for his own benefit.” In the next succeeding clause of said agreement, provision is made for ascertaining the second party’s interest in the partnership, in the event of a dissolution thereof, by taking as a basis “the gross receipts from ” the rent-collecting “ department for the twelve months previous to dissolution,” etc., as therein specified.' When the firm business had been prosecuted for about six months, both' partners united in effecting a sale of their rent-collecting department for $20,000; which sum they treated as profits and divided according to their respective interests in the firm,— plaintiff receiving one third and defendant the residue. They thenceforth confined their efforts to buying and selling real estate. While the effect of disposing of the rent-collecting department of their business was to render inoperative the provision aforesaid for ascertaining plaintiff’s interest in the firm, it did not in any manner interfere with defendant’s right to the books, papers, maps, plans etc. which, under the .clause above quoted, were to become his “property” “in the event of a dissolution of the firm, from any cause.” That provision was not altered or annulled by the sale aforesaid. It was never contemplated that defendant should account for the value of the books, papers, maps, plans, etc., specified in the clause referred to. Those articles were to be used in the prosecution of the firm’s business until a dissolution took place ; and there<a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>upon they reverted to defendant, for the purpose of enabling him “ to continue the business .... in his own name and for his own benefit.”</p>
    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[188,537,1165,450]]]'>We are therefore of opinion that there was error in treating said articles, valued by the master at $700, as partnership assets; and the decree should be modified accordingly. As to the other items of assets, we are not prepared to say there was any error. We are also of opinion that defendant should not be required to pay more than two thirds of the costs. .The proceedings appear to have been necessary to the settlement of matters in dispute between the parties respectively, and each should therefore bear his proportionate share of the costs, etc.</p>
    <p id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[189,996,1165,401]]]'>Decree reversed: and it is now adjudged and decreed that, in lieu of the sum specified in said decree, the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of four hundred and sixty-four dollars and sixty-seven cents ($464.67), with interest from September 16,1893; and it is further ordered that the costs, including the master’s fee ($200), stenographer’s bill ($125), and costs of this appeal, be paid, one third by plaintiff and the remaining two thirds by the defendant.</p>
