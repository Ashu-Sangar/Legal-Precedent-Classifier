In such a case Smith would not be ixxtex-ested in the contract of purchases and sales made by Kaxnmerer on the board but would be only interested in the rise or fall of th'e maiket between the time of purchase and sale.

In other words, Smith would be betting with Kammerer that purchases and sales that he made with other brokers on the board, at his direction, would be profitable; if Smith won, he took the profits, less Kammerer’s commission; if he lost, he paid Kammerer the loss and commissions.

    <p id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[198,980,1169,649]]]'>We are satisfied from an examination of the pleadings and evidence that there is no substantial error in either of the findings of fact complained of in several of the specifications; nor do we think there is any error in any of the material conclusions drawn therefrom. All the questions involved in the assignments of error have been so fully considered and satisfactorily disposed of by the learned president of the common pleas that little if anything can be profitably added to what is contained in his opinion sent up with the record. On that opinion the-decree discharging the rule to show cause why the judgment-should not be opened and the defendant let into a defence, etc., is affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>
