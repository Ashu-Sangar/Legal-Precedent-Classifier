Baeder Glue Co. for $9,980.55. The glue company was a partnership composed of William A. Baeder, Howard R. Kern and Louis C. Haughey. William H. Kern, the father of Howard R. Kern, had loaned money to the firm, for which he held its notes, to the amount of $12,000, and had indorsed for them to the amount of $14,721.87, for which he held paper made or indorsed by the firm, none of which would mature prior to March 21, 1890. H. R. Kern then delivered to W. H. Kern a promissory note of the firm for $6,000, dated Jan. 11, 1890, at thirty days; a promissory note, signed by J. D. Hall &amp; Co., of. which H. R. Kern was a member, for $3,346, to the order of the W. A. Baeder Glue Co., dated Jan. 20, 1890, payable at four months, which he indorsed to W. H. Kern, and a promissory note of Schimpf &amp; Richards to the order of the W. A. Baeder Glue Co., dated Jan. 21, 1890, for $2,500, at four months. It was claimed by plaintiff here that these three notes were conveyed to W. H. Kern for the purpose of defrauding the firm by increasing the apparent claim from $26,721.87 to $38,567.87. It appeared that H. R. Kern was individually indebted to his father in a large amount. On March 2, 1890, Baeder and H. R. Kern delivered to W. H. Kern, as collateral security for the firm debt, personal property, including 2198 barrels of glue stored in New York, for some of which the latter had received warehouse receipts in 1889.</p>

Kern against the firm and that judgment would be obtained within a few days and execution issued, urged him to obtain money to make good his capital in the W. A. Baeder Glue Co. At this time a Miss Mary C. Raridan, a relative of ^Haughey, was an inmate of Haughey’s home in Pittsburg. She owned forty-four shares of the capital stock'of the Indianapolis National Bank, worth about $4,400. At the solicitation of Kern and Haughey she agreed to loan this stock to them to be used for the purpose of obtaining money for the use of the firm, and gave them an order on a relative in Indianapolis for the stock. H. R. Kern then at once went to Indianapolis, taking Haughey with him, and by like representations obtained the forty-four shares of stock and also $14,996.18 of promissory notes of the Indianapolis Glue Company from Haughey’s father. H. R. Kern then returned from Indianapolis to Philadelphia and delivered to W. H. Kern this bank stock and the promissory notes which had been obtained from Haughey's aunt and father to assist the firm, and returned to Pittsburg, where he arrived March 10, 1890, and entered of record two confessed judgments in favor of W. H. Kern, one of them signed “ The William A. Baeder Glue Company, by H. R. Kern,” for $26,721.87, and the other dated Jan. 6, 1890, signed by each of the three partners, “ William A. Baeder, H. R. Kern, L. C. Haughey,” for $26,721.87. At the same time H. R. Kern entered a judgment in favor of Emily L. Bentz, an inmate of his house and the guardian of his minor children.</p>

The sale by Mr. Kern was for a little less than six cents a pound net. It was subject to the warehouse charges at that time and was sold without the payment of any commission by him. Howard R. Kern has testified in that connection, just before the sale of this glue he was asked by his father what it was worth. He told him it would be well sold if he got $24,000 for it. Howard' R. Kern at that time represented the owners of the glue, The Baeder Glue Company, subject to the claim that William H. Kern had upon it.

It caused an attachment execution to be issued upon its judgment and summoned William H. Kern, among others, as a garnishee. He pleaded “ nulla bona,” and a trial was had upon the issue so raised. The question presented by this issue and actually tried in the court below was whether Kern was indebted to the glue company, or had in his possession any of its property for which he was liable to account. It appeared from the evidence that he had a large demand against the company and had received property belonging to it as collateral security for this demand. The principal item of the property so received by him was a warehouse receipt for about twenty-two hundred barrels of glue stored in the city of New York. He sold the glue for twenty-four thousand dollars to one who within a few days sold it for thirty-two thousand dollars. Three questions were presented upon these facts: First, what was the true amount of the demand held by Kern against the glue company ? Second, what amount had he received from the company in securities, or from the sale of col-laterals, which was applicable to the payment of the debt due him? Third, did the sums so received by him satisfy his just demands against the company and leave a balance in his hands for which he ought to account ? If so, what was the amount of such balanoe ?</p>

Kern; but if this was eollusively done it did not bind the creditors of the company. The holder of collateral securities is not bound to obtain the highest possible price for them, but he is bound to the exercise of common business prudence and of good faith in his management and conversion of them. His debtor may acquiesce in, and assent to, his fraudulent conduct for himself, but he cannot bind his creditors by such acquiescence or consent. They have a right to demand, what he ought in good conscience to demand, an account from his creditor for the collaterals placed in his hands. This disposes of the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh assignments of error.</p>
    <p id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.5",40,[259,1339,1174,495]]]'>The admission of the testimony of Nagle and Pearce is complained of in the third, fourth and fifth assignments. This testimony was offered as bearing upon the good faith of William H. Kern in dealing with the warehouse certificates, and as tending to show collusion between him and his son, who was an officer and stockholder in the Baeder Glue Co., for the purpose of covering the assets of the company and placing them beyond the reach of creditors. We think it was competent for this purpose, and the errors assigned to its admission are overruled.</p>

Kern, to account for the sum of $3,850 paid through Hood Gilpin. This money was paid by L. C. Haughey to relieve himself from a criminal prosecution for the embezzlement of moneys belonging to the Baeder Glue Co. Howard R. Kern was the prosecutor acting in behalf of the company. A settlement was made with him and the prosecution discontinued by his leave. The presumption is that what he did as prosecutor he did on behalf of the company he represented. He-<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>had no right to sacrifice the company or its just claims for his own private advantage, and if he was base enough to engage to do so, or to permit the prosecution for the embezzlement of the money of the company to be discontinued in consideration of a bribe paid to him as an individual, he ought not to be heard to allege his own turpitude. The money paid should go, where it of right ought to go, to the party whose money was embezzled and whose officer conducted the prosecution. We see no error in this record that requires us to reverse the judgment, and it is now affirmed.</p>
