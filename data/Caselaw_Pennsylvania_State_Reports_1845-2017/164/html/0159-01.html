And there are many cases in which similar language is used.

The same language, except the provision for appeal, is found in the act of 1867, under which no appeal was allowed. The appeal is now given by the act of the 18th of June, 1874, and is to be taken within thirty days after the ascertainment of the damages, or the filing of the report thereof in the court, and not afterwards. These provisions are the law governing other cases referred to in the act of 1891 and are to be read into it.</p>

Tn November, 1892, they had given notice that they would surrender the possession at the termination of the lease. In January, they resolved to take the land under the authority of the act of assembly. And February 13th the petition from which I have quoted was filed. March'31st, they settled with the respondent and paid her the rent in full to the first of April. [The auditor finds that they continued in the possession after the first of April, as they had been before, until the 22d of that month, when they gave notice to the respondent that they abandoned the same and surrendered the possession to her. From the 1st to the 22d of April, therefore, the petitioners were in the actual possession and occupation of the land under a claim of ownership, for hospital purposes, and not as tenants under the lease. The situation was the same as if the trustees, by virtue of the right of eminent, domain, had entered upon the farm of respondent, in the possession of her tenant, taken the possession from such tenant, and kept it exclusively for nearly a month, while proceedings for the assessment of damages were in progress. The situation does not appear to be affected by the fact that the trustees were themselves the tenants of Mrs. Wood, since they took so -much pains to leave no doubt of their intention to terminate the relation of landlord and tenant, and to hold thereafter under the right of eminent domain.] [1]</p>

Municipality, 11 Rob. (La.) 97, is cited, to which I have not access. I cannot therefore determine how far the statutes of Louisiana differ from that now under consideration. But Judge Dillon (section 479) states the general rule as follows: ‘ So it is generally held that such a party is entitled to payment when the report of the commissioners of assessment has been finally acted upon and confirmed, or when, before confirmation, the municipal authorities have taken and retained the actual use of his property.’ In Funk’s Administrators v. Waynesboro Sehool District, supra, Mr. Justice Gordon is careful to notice that there had been no actual possession taken, and strongly intimates that such possession would have produced a different result. The question was not raised in Moravian Seminary v. Bethlehem, the only question there being upon the effeet of an irregular judgment.- In Grangle v.

Bub so far as the trine of the vesting of title was concerned, no such point was involved in the case, and there was no provision in the law for security, public or otherwise, which would be a sufficient reason for the ruling at all events: Keene v.

But it is equally clear that there is nothing in the law which makes it obligatory upon them to await the final settlement of the damages before devoting the land to public use. The state is expressly made security for the damages, and the act expressly authorizes the taking of possession without any qualification as to time. If in addition to the actual possession and occupation, buildings had been pulled down, meadows plowed up, or the character of the premises otherwise materially changed, there could be no doubt that the proceedings could not be abandoned.

When such actual possession is taken it must be presumed that it was intended to be an absolute taking of the land for permanent use, and not, as in the case of formal entry for a survey and designation of boundaries, not followed by actual occupation, a mere declaration of intention to take in the future.

Assuming for the present that leave to discontinue and abandon the proceedings for assessment of damages was rightly refused, it may be remarked in this connection that the record discloses no error in the trial or in the proceedings leading up thereto that would warrant a reversal of the judgment. The validity of the latter therefore hinges on the question above stated.</p>

The act also provides, among other things, “ that a fee simple title to all lands acquired under the provisions of this act shall vest in ” said trustees.</p>
    <p id="b191-5" data-blocks='[["BL_191.4",191,[222,1200,1166,494]]]'>As evidenced by the record of their proceedings, the first official action taken by the defendants was their resolution of January 81, 1893, wherein, after reciting their inability to agree with plaintiff for the purchase of her tract of fifty acres, more or less, adjoining the hospital lands, they resolved to forthwith, by their president and'secretary, take possession of, mark off, use and occupy the same for specified hospital purposes, and authorize said officers to institute all necessary judicial proceedings for the valuation thereof, etc., in accordance with said act of 1891.</p>

In the meantime, on June 5, 1893, before the issue on the appeal was tried, the trustees petitioned the court “ for leave to withdraw all proceedings and discontinue this case and pay all costs accrued thereon.” In that petition, after referring to their original resolution to take, occupy and use plaintiff’s land for hospital purposes under the act of 1891, they declare “ that, in pursuance of such resolution, your petitioners took formal possession of said premises,” etc., and on February 13,1893, presented their petition for the- appointment of viewers, etc. They also aver that they “ have done no injury to said premises; that they are desirous of withdrawing •from their act appropriating and occupying said premises for hospital purposes, and have passed a resolution to that effect,” etc. Afterwards an auditor, appointed for the purpose, took testimony and reported the facts to the court, so that, in disposing of the rule to show cause, the learned president of the common pleas had before him all the facts in relation to the taking and occupancy of plaintiff’s land by the defendants for hospital purposes.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[242,1912,1165,502]],["BL_193.1",193,[211,377,1173,761]]]'>We have thus referred at some length to the salient facts of the case for the purpose of showing that the action of the trustees cannot be consistently regarded in any other light than as an absolute and permanent taking, appropriation and occupancy of plaintiff’s land for hospital purposes under the act of 1891; such a taking and occupancy as by operation of law invested the trustees with title to the land, and divested plaintiff of every right thereto save that of compensation guaranteed by the constitution. For the payment of that, the state, by express terms of the act, is made surety.. There is no ground <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>whatever for the position that defendant’s entry and occupancy of the land was tentative or temporary, for the purpose of designating boundaries and initiating proceedings looking to a future appropriation and condemnation of the same for hospital-purposes. The occupancy of the defendants under the lease had terminated, and thereafter they were in possession by virtue of their taking and occupying as owners under the right of eminent domain. They in effect so declare, in substance at least, in every step that was taken prior to their application for leave to discontinue. In that they declare, “ they are desirous of withdrawing from their act appropriating and occupying said premises for hospital purposes ; ” and in the notice of April 22d, to plaintiff, they say, “ That from this time the said trustees have no further claim upon said land, and now: surrender their possession of and every claim upon said land.”</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.4",193,[211,1147,1169,811]]]'>If, in the face of their unequivocal acts and declarations, defendants had a right to discontinue, and had been permitted to do so, there would have been nothing to prevent them from inaugurating new proceedings, and in like manner withdrawing therefrom; and thus they might commence and abandon new proceedings from time to time with the view of obtaining an award that would be satisfactory to themselves. Corporations and others invested with the power of eminent domain should not be permitted to thus experiment with judicial proceedings for any such purpose. Whenever it clearly appears,'as it does in this case, that there has been such an actual taking under the power of eminent domain, as invests the donee of the power with title, and gives to the landowner a vested right to compensation, the former should not be permitted to discontinue without the consent of the latter. Any other rule would be productive of oppression and other mischievous results.</p>
