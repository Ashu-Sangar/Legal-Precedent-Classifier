Ernst.” On the next day the defendant paid to Highlands the amount of his interest in the judgment, and confessed judgment on the sci. fa. to Coffey for the amount due him, $3,140.</p>

The award of the auditor was sustained by the learned judge of the common pleas, who considered the question involved as governed by Dietrich’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/107/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="107 Pa. 174" data-case-ids="8856838" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0174-01">107 Pa. 174</a>.
