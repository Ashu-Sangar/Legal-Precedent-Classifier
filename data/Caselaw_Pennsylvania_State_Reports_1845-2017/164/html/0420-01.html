Each of these lines of proof is important in strengthening the other, and both together seem necessary to constitute full proof. In such a case fraud being charged, the latitude of proof must be necessarily wide.</p>

Attached to the petition was a paper purporting to be a copy of the will. The petitioner prayed that this paper should be admitted to probate, and that letters of administration previously granted should be revoked. Certain of the next of kin filed -an answer to the petition denying that the decedent ever made a will, in the manner and form alleged by petitioner. The register certified issues of fact to the orphans’ court, and that court referred the matter to the auditor.</p>

There is however no direct evidence of this. They depend on a number of circum <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>stances which they say sustain their position. Sdme four or five days before his death he expressed a desire to have Mr. Summerville come; he said he had. some business he would like to have fixed, or changes made '■ in his business or will; and, on the witness offering to go for him, he said the roads were muddy and he thought his brother James would be there that night and he would have him write. James Gardner did come that night, and the next morning asked him if he had his business finished, and if he wanted Mr. Summerville. He replied that he did, and on that day James Gardner wrote to Summerville to come up. He says he wrote to ‘ come and finish Lot’s will business,’ and Summerville says he wrote to ‘ come and finish the unfinished portion of brother Lot’s business which you have already commenced.’ Summerville did not receive the letter until after the death of Lot Gardner, and the letter cannot be found. On the second evening before he died he said he did wish Summerville would come. On the Saturday before his death L. T. Baker went to his house for the purpose of lifting a note, and Dr. James Gardner got the key of his trunk to get the note, but the trunk was not opened. The key remained in the possession of James Gardner and Mrs. Nancy Fulton from that time until the day after the funeral, when the search was made for the will. When the undertaker was there to lajr out the body, Dr. Gardner had some one help to take the trunk to another room to look for clothes to dress him in, and Mrs. Fulton opened the trunk and took out a suit of clothes. On the same morning P. H. Bailey and another witness saw Dr. Grardner standing by the window in.the room to which the trunk was carried, reading a paper; the paper was about the size of a sheet of foolscap; he was there five or ten minutes, and could have seen the persons who saw him if he had looked. Part of the time there was an old lady standing beside him. One witness says it was not a newspaper he was reading; the other says he cannot tell whether it was a newspaper or writing paper. On the same morning another witness says he went into the house and heard some persons in the room overhead, in the room in which James Gardner was seen standing by the window reading a paper; he heard their voices but could not tell who they were, and does not know whether it was the voice of man or woman that he heard; he also says that he heard them rummag<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>ing among papers. Another witness says that before the death of- Lot Gardner, Dr. Gardner intimated that there were some of the people Lot had forgotten in his will. On the day after the funeral, when the}’ were searching for the will, Mrs. Fulton said she had heard many stories about wills being lost and destroyed, and that she almost knew that her poor brother’s will was lost; she said that if it should not be found she did not want them to blame her. From the testimony of Summerville it would appear that this was before they looked for the will; he also says that she did not want to open the trunk because she felt positive that the will was not there ; she was afraid that everything would be disturbed in the trunk. Jesse F. Gardner also testifies that she spoke of having heard of wills being destroyed ; but he says that she also said she had the key of his trunk and would open it, and if the will was there they could have it. When they opened the trunk Summerville picked up a note or check, and Mrs. Fulton said that she jhad seen that paper. Mrs. Fulton had said that she had never been in the trunk ; but in her testimony she says she opened the trunk to get a suit of clothes and that she then saw a check for $1,000.</p>

There is also some evidence that Mrs. Fulton saw some one have a paper which was said to be Lot Gardner’s will. This is too indefinite to be taken into consideration, and besides it is contradicted by Mrs. Fulton.</p>

How is that? They are brother and sister to the decedent and would receive more of his estate under the intestate laws than under the alleged will; but that being the case, and the fact that they had the key of his trunk, unless followed by evidence going to show that they, or one of them, destroyed the will, is of but little or no weight.</p>

Neither is the fact that Dr. Gardner inquired who should read the will of any weight, unless it would go to prove that he thought there was a will.</p>

She was at that time an old lady, and was evidently nervous and somewhat excited.</p>

Youndt, <a href="/grant/3/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="3 Grant 140" data-case-ids="229262" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0140-01">3 Grant, 140</a>. The theory of proponents being that of concealment or destruction, the latitude of proof must have been necessarily wide. Fraud is rarely capable of proof in a direct way. “ It is the chain of less direct circumstances, all pointing in the same way until there seems no other reasonable mode of reconciling them, that must usually be depended on in reaching a conclusion: ” Eichenlaub v. Hall, <a href="/pa/163/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="163 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="859048" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0201-01">163 Pa. 201</a>. The issue demanded here was whether or not there had been a revocation of the will of Lot Gardner, and was of right unless the whole evidence of the fact alleged was so doubtful and unsatisfactory that a verdict in favor of the validity of the will would not be permitted to stand. The question was one of sufficiency of evidence.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[250,1051,1165,1011]]]'>The fact that Lot Gardner’s long settled plan of testamentary disposition was expressed in this will; that he was a man of strong character and tenacity of purpose; that so short a time elapsed from the date of the will until he died; that after he found he would be unable to distribute the rest of his estate, as he had intended, during his lifetime, and up to the point of time when his physical condition rebutted any presumption of access to the trunk in which he had placed his will, he repeatedly expressed a wish that the scrivener who had drawn, would come and make “changes” in his “will,” and the suspicious conduct of those who surrounded him and whose interests would plainly be subserved by intestacy, would, standing unexplained and uncontradicted, have amply justified submission to the jury. Against these facts stand the presumption of revocation arising from nonproduction of the will, and the testimony of the witnesses whose suspicious conduct had put them on the defensive, and whose explanation was for the jury. No one claimed to have seen or heard the testator speak of the cancellation; it rests solely upon the rebuttable presumption arising from nonproduction.</p>
