The wreck occurred about noon, and the same day the railroad company had him removed to the Riddell House, in the town of Bradford. He received some attention the same evening, and the next morning, when about to leave for his home, was visited by Mr. Wilmoth, the agent of the railroad company, and Dr. Benninghoff, the company’s surgeon, who persuaded him to sta}1- and be treated by the company’s surgeons. About eleven o’clock in the forenoon of the same day, Dr. Benninghoff, accompanied by Drs. James and Stewart, two <em>other </em>surgeons, again visited him to make an examination of his injuries, and apply such remedy as was demanded. Anaesthetics, chloroform and ether, to the extent of bringing about insensibility to pain and unconsciousness, were administered ; the examination was made, and the shoulder given such treatment as the nature of the injury called for. He was insensible from the anaesthetics for from twenty-five to thirty minutes, and in this time the surgeon’s work was finished; consciousness returned, in five to ten minutes after; he then talked rationally; told the surgeons they would find some of his clothing in his satchel, then in the room, and seemed, if not entirely restored, to be rapidly regaining a normal condition. The surgeons then left. In about three quarters of an hour Dr. Stewart returned to the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>room, and remained from five to ten minutes.; inquired as to his condition, and he replied he was feeling well, except some pain in his shoulder; he seemed then to have completely recovered. Between four and five o’clock in the afternoon of the same day, J. D. Hancock, Esq., solicitor, and B. J. Wilmoth, agent of the companjq called upon him for the purpose of settling and obtaining a release of any claim he had for damages against the company because of his injuiy. They informed him of their object, and talked with him about his injury, and the basis of computation for payment. He thought he ought to have his wages while unable to work, at the rate of $1.50 per day, and possibly the cost of caring for him while getting well. He named $150 as a reasonable sum, covering his loss of earnings ; Mr. Hancock thought this was not enough, considering the probable loss of time before he would recover from such an injury, and suggested the payment of $240, and he willingly accepted the offer. A release was drawn, read to him, and he affixed his signature. He expressed an intention of immediately returning home, but yielding to their persuasions and suggestion that he would have better treatment in the hospital at Bradford, lie agreed to rémain. The $240 was handed him in money; he requested Mr. Hancock to take his pocketbook out of his hip pocket; he did so ; plaintiff then counted over the $240, took a small sum of his own out of the pocketbook, and put all together back in the pocketbook. Mr. Hancock told him that all his bills would be paid, and when about leaving the room, plaintiff said : “ If it should happen I don’t entirely recover the use of my limb, I will expect this company to give me a place.”</p>

The rule of evidence is the same here as if defendant had pleaded a release, <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>but alleged the instrument was lost, and had then given secondary evidence of its contents ; then plaintiff had replied that no such paper had ever been executed. The contention would have been one of pure fact, involving no equities requiring the interposition of the conscience of a chancellor, who enforces contracts, not always because of right, but of grace, and will refuse a decree destructive of the effect of a deed, on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness. Here there is not a spark of evidence of any misrepresentation, fraud or overreaching in the procurement of the contract; there is, however, the positive oath of the plaintiff that, from the effects of the anaesthetic, his intellectual faculties were in a state of paralysis, so complete that he had no knowledge of the contents of the paper, or that he was signing any instrument whatever. If this were the fact, then it could not bar his recovery any more than if it had no existence; the plaintiff’s claim was of right according to law, and not of grace according to equity. The dispute was as to the fact of a deed, not as to the equities under it. Whether the fact was established, was to.be-answered by the conscience of the jury; whether their finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence, was for the determination of the court on a motion for a new trial, and not by binding instructions on the evidence. Nevertheless, we cannot but think that the court would have performed only a plain duty, by expressing to the jury its opinion on this evidence, at the same time telling them they were not bound by it. In two opinions of record, the learned judge, in unmistakable language, has declared the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. A careful perusal of every word of this evidence prompts us to a like conclusion ; but he had far better opportunities than we for forming an opinion; during the course of the trial, he had the advantage of observation of the witnesses on the witness stand. Here were five disinterested witnesses, with every means of observation, on the day the paper was executed, testifying positively to the mental capacity of the plaintiff, at the same time describing his conduct, and giving his conversation. Four of them were men whose professional knowledge and experience must have so sharpened their perceptions, that mental incapacity was not likely to escape their notice-; not a suspicion of their credibility is suggested; yet <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>the uncorroborated contradictory testimony of the plaintiff, on whose oath depended a verdict, is accepted by the jury as the truth. We say uncorroborated, because the testimony of Nolan does not contradict that of the defendant’s witnesses, and, if significant at all, it tends to prove that plaintiff’s conversation, after the operation, was connected and rational. The best that can be said of the verdict, on this first question, is that the credibility of witnesses was passed on by the jury, and that they, in face of all probability, decided that the testimony of one pecuniarily interested witness was more worthy of belief than that of five pecuniarily disinterested ones, and thus the functions of the jury were preserved, while it is somewhat doubtful whether the functions of the court were. In this there was no error which we can correct on review. To what length the trial court shall go, in efforts to correct injustice by granting new trials, is in their discretion, not ours.</p>

The last seen of the $240, before he went to the hospital, was when plaintiff was yet at the Riddell House, in his room; then he placed it in his pocketbook with $10 of his own; this was Wednesday evening; on Friday he went to the hospital; the same day, tiie pocketbook, with the money, was delivered to Miss M. D. Whitney, the matron, by one of the nurses. She then took it to plaintiff for the purpose of giving him a receipt for it, which she did, and he said to her, naming the amount, it was the money he got from the railroad company in settlement for his injury; afterwards he told her the railroad company had offered him work. He said to Mrs. Ellen Lee, about ten days after his admission to the hospital, that he had settled with the railroad company, and they had paid him ; she was there visiting another patient, D. P. Smith, an inmate of the hospital; Smith and plaintiff also talked together concerning a settlement with the railroad company. Plaintiff said he had settled with the railroad company, and they had paid him $240, and agreed to- pay his expenses while at the hospital; that they had talked together three or four different times on the same subject, and plaintiff expressed his satisfaction with the settlement. Dr. A. M. Straight visited him in the hospital two or three weeks after his admission, <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>and plaintiff told him he had settled with the railroad company for $240, and they were to pay his expenses until he got able to be out; the doctor suggested a further operation on his shoulder, and plaintiff requested it to be done soon, as he was there at the expense of the railroad company. He said to Dr. Benninghoff, about two months aftér he had been in the hospital, that Wilmoth, the agent of the company, had promised to get him a situation. As has been noticed, in discussing the first question raised by the assignments of error, solicitor Hancock and agent Wilmoth had made him a conditional promise of a situation at the time the release was signed. On this subject, Mr. Wilmoth testifies that, about' three 'months after the accident, he received from plaintiff, while he was still in the hospital, a letter, which is now lost, in which he asked for a position on the railroad. He made application, and secured the situation of watchman for him at Olean; then, in a few days, informed plaintiff, who said he was first going home, and then would tell him if he would accept it. The witness further stated that the company paid all the bills at the hotel and hospital.</p>

You said nothing to her about where you got the money? A. Not that I know of; the question was not asked me.” When asked if the conversation occurred as testified to by Drs. Benninghoff and Straight, he answered: “Not that I know of.” j When asked if the conversation narrated by Daniel Smith had been had, he answered: “Not that I know of,” but, further on, said he told him there was $240 left there, but he did not know who left it. Then is this question : “ State how you thought that $240 got into your pocketbook? A. I don’t understand the question.” Then, on the question being repeated, he said: “ I don’t know how I thought it got in there. I can’t remember my thoughts at that time; I didn’t write them down.” He further testified that he never saw Mrs. Lee, that he knew of. He admitted that at the first trial he had said “ he didn’t know, but supposed” the company had given it, for he had more money than he had be<a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>fore.- He further stated, at' the close of his testimony, that he had never said to anyone, lie had settled with the railroad company; that what he did say, was, that the railroad company claimed they had settled with him, but that he hadn’t settled with the railroad company, to his knowledge.</p>

He received no surgical or medical attention until the next morning when the company’s surgeons called on him and, at about eleven o’clock in the forenoon, in a small bedroom without any outside windows for ventilation, administered an anesthetic, and, as far as possible, reduced the fracture.

That release was interposed as a bar to plaintiff’s recovery in this action. In response to that, plaintiff alleged and testified that he was not aware he had executed the release, and was not conscious of anything that transpired from the time the anesthetic was administered until he awakened in the evening. In this, he was strongly corroborated by several facts and circumstances referred to in the testimony.

No attempt was made by the plaintiff to amend, alter or rescind the release in question.

It is necessary that both mind and will shall co-.operate in the execution and delivery of the instrument. Tbe testimony on behalf of plaintiff, direct as well as circumstantial, tends strongly to prove that there was no such co-operation in this case. If there was not, then, in contemplation of law, there was no execution and delivery of the alleged release. A substantial question of fact was thus presented which it was the exclusive province of the jury to determine in the ordinary way. The case is much the same as if the plaintiff had alleged the release was a forgery and had introduced testimony tending to prove that fact. Surely in such case the court would be bound to submit to the jury, even on plaintiff’s unsupported testimony, the question of the genuineness of his signature! If authority for so plain a proposition be required, there is an abundance of it to be found. In Dixon v. Brooklyn City, etc. Ry. Co., <a href="/ny/100/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="100 N.Y. 170" data-case-ids="2199614" data-case-paths="/ny/100/0170-01">100 N. Y. 170</a>, the defendant set up a release, executed by plaintiff, of all claim for damages. There was testimony tending to show that at the time the release was executed, plaintiff was in a condition of mind that rendered him incompetent to appreciate the character of the instrument which he signed. The court held that it was for the jury to determine whether it was his free act, done with full knowledge, at the time, of the facts, and with a full appreciation of what he was doing. To the same effect are George v. Railroad Co., 1 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 297, and Railroad v. Lewis, <a href="/ill/109/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="109 Ill. 120" data-case-ids="2852651" data-case-paths="/ill/109/0120-01">109 Ill. 120</a>.

Referring to the release that was set up as a bar in that case, he says : “ It is to be further observed that there was no attempt to reform or contradict the release. The paper was admitted, but the allegation was that it had been procured by fraud, which is quite another matter.” So in this case, there was no attempt to reform or contradict the release. The plaintiff merely sought to show, by his' own and other testimony, that such was the condition of his mind at the time that he was wholly incompetent to execute the release,—that he was unconscious of what he was doing at the time.</p>

If the release was obtained at a time when plaintiff was incapacitated to contract, it was void ab initio, as between the parties, and could not stand in the way of plaintiff’s right to recover. An absolutely void instrument cannot affect the successful assertion of a legal right which it purports to release. The release never had any binding force, and hence there could not be anything to rescind. A contract, void on account of fraud or for any other reason, is, in law, as though it had never been <em>executed; </em>and plaintiff, in the circumstances, was not bound to return the money to defendant before bringing suit. At most, it was entitled, if at all, to nothing more than a credit, on account of plaintiff’s demand, for the amount paid to and expended for him.</p>

Conceding, for the sake of argument, that there was some testimony bearing on the question of ratification, the court surety would have had no right to invade the province of the jury and undertake to determine whether plaintiff did or did not ratify the release.
