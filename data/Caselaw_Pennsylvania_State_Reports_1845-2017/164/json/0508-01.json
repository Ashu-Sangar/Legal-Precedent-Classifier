The testimony bearing on each of these questions was such as to necessarily carry the case to the jury. It was fairly submitted to them in a clear and impartial charge which appears to be free from any error of which defendants have any just reason to complain.\nIt would have been plain error to have given binding instructions to find for defendants as requested in their point recited in the first specification.\nThere was no error in the learned judge\u2019s answer to defendants\u2019 point recited in the second specification; nor has the able and ingenious argument of the learned counsel for the defendants convinced us that the court erred in affirming their point quoted in the third specification, but at the same time leaving \u201c it to the jury to determine whether any of the defendants were personally guilty of negligence.\u201d In the last clause of the point, the court was requested to say that the defendants \" are not responsible for any negligence in such operation (meaning inside operation of their mine) in which they did .not personally participate.\u201d In view of the testimony, there was no error in submitting to the jury, for their determination, the question whether defendants did personally participate in any negligence in the inside operation of their mines.\nWe find no error in the record that would justify us in reversing the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed.",

T., 1894, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Washington Co., May T., 1894, No. 75, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean aud Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before McIlvaine, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on Sept. 24, 1892, plaintiff, a boy fourteen years old, and employed by defendants as a trapper, was injured in defendants\u2019 mine. A mule drawing a train of empty pit cars ran away, and the cars jumping the track, crushed plaintiff\u2019s leg against a rib of coal. Plaintiff claimed that defendants were negligent in permitting the mule to be used in the mine with knowledge that it was wild and vicious, with a propensity to run away. Defendants claimed that the mule was not vicious, and if it was they'had no knowledge of it; that plaintiff was not acting within the scope of his employment when he was injured; and that defendants, in compliance with the mining act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 205, had placed the entire charge of the inside operation of the mine in the hands of a competent boss.\nDefendants\u2019 points were among others as follows:\n\u201c1. Under all the evidence the verdict must be.for the defendants. Answer: 'We refuse-to give you binding instructions, and leave the case to you under the evidence and the instructions we have given you as to the law.\u201d [1]\n\u201c8. It appearing, by the admission of Lemuel Gray, made upon the witness stand, and being undisputed, that he, with knowledge of . the fact that a mule drawing empty cars was about to proceed up the main entry, stepped.upon that track and started to walk along it with his back toward the mule and without looking backward to see whether said mule was approaching, and it being undisputed that if he had so looked he could have seen the danger in which he was- from the proximity of the mule, before stepping upon the track, and could have escaped injury by standing in the mouth of entry No. 3, he was guilty of contributory negligence and the verdict must be for the defendants. Anstver: Refused; we leave it for the jury to say whether the plaintiff -was guilty of contributory negligence under the law and the evidence, as they have been given to you.\u201d [2]\n\u201c 4. It being undisputed upon the testimony that the defendants had placed the entire control and management of the inside operation of their mine into the hands of a mine boss having a certificate of competency, as provided by the mining law of 1885, whose competency is not questioned i.n this case, they had performed the duty which they OAved to the plaintiff, Lemuel Gray, as their employee, and they are not responsible for any negligence in such operation in Avhich they did not personally participate. Answer: Affirmed; but we leave it to the jury to determine whether any of the defendants were personally guilty of negligence.\u201d [3]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $500.\nErrors assigned Avere (1-3) instructions, quoting them.\nJames I Brownson, Jr., Charles Gr. Mcllvaine Avith him, for appellants.\nThe direction of the superintendent to the boss driver to employ a trapper boy, Avas not a delegation of general authority over plaintiff, and there was no more reason to suppose that plaintiff would be told \u201c to throw the latches,\u201d than that he would be required to drive a mule: Greenway v. Conroy, 160 Pa. 190.\nWhen an employee undertak.es to do something not within the scope of his employment, and is injured in consequence, the employer is not liable: Gillen v. Rowley, 134 Pa. 209; Rummel v. Dilworth, 131 Pa. 509; R. R. v. Sentmeyer, 92 Pa. 276.\nThe position of peril into which plaintiff got, and the consequent injury received by him, were due to his own gross negligence: Coal Co. v. Hayes, 128 Pa. 294; Carroll v. R. R., 12 W. N. 348; s. c., 2 Penny. 159; Myers v. R. R., 150 Pa. 386; Ash v. R. R., 148 Pa. 133; Carson v. Ry., 147 Pa. 219; Ehrisman v. Ry., 150 Pa. 180; Wheelahan v.
