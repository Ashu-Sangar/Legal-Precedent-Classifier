Unity Township, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Townships\u2014Roads\u2014Contributory negligence\u2014Evidence.\nIu an action against a township to recover damages for personal injuries suffered by falling over the side of a township bridge, the case is for the jury where the evidence for plaintiff tends to show that the bridge was a dangerous one, and that for a long time no guard-rails or wall were on the side where the accident occurred.\nIn such a case the question of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is for the jury where it appears that there was another road by which plaintiff might have reached his destination, but the evidence is conflicting as to which of the two roads was the safer.\nArgued Oct. 4, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 127, Oct T., 1894, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Westmoreland Co., Aug. T., 1889, No. 96, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Longenecker, P. J., specially presiding.\nAt the trial it appeared that, on May 30,1882, plaintiff, with a companion, Steele Mechesney, returning from Latrobe borough, drove' over a bridge which was on the boundary line between Latrobe borough and defendant township. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the abutment of the bridge on defendant\u2019s side of the Loyalhanna creek was approached by a curve which descended by a considerable grade to the bridge. There was no guard-rail or wall on the lower side of the bridge. There was evidence that the bridge had been in this condition for some time prior to the accident. Plaintiff, in describing the accident, said: \u201c Just when we got over the bridge, barely across the bridge, the horse suddenly shied and just plunged, himself over the abutment.\u201d Steele Mechesney testified: Well, as we drove off through the bridge, as soon as the horse got off the plank of the bridge he frightened at something, and jumped over the side of the abutment.\u201d.\nPlaintiff testified that the bridge was a dangerous one, but qualified this by saying that he meant it was dangerous for persons crossing it into Latrobe.\nIt appeared from the evidence that there was another road which plaintiff might have taken to reach his destination, but the evidence as to which of the two roads was\" the safer was conflicting.\nThe court refused binding instructions for defendant and left the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,770.83.\nJSrrors assigned were above instructions, quoting them.\nAlbert H.
