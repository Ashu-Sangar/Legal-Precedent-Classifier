It therefore follows that there is no error in the judgment of the court below.\nJudgment affirmed.",

L. 393, entitled \u201c An act creating the office of county controller in counties containing one hundred and fifty thous- and inhabitants and over, and prescribing his duties,\u201d is defective in title and unconstitutional, as there is no indication in the title of the purpose and effect of the act to abolish the office of the county auditor, as is done in the body of the act by providing for the election of a controller in place of county auditor.

L. 393, entitled \u201c An act creating the office of county controller in counties containing 150,000 inhabitants and over, and prescribing his duties.\u201d\n' On the ground that this act was unconstitutional the clerk of the county commissioners of Schuylkill county petitioned the attorney general to suggest a writ of quo warranto to oust the controller. The writ was suggested and granted. The controller filed his answer. A demurrer was filed and' defendant filed a joinder. The case was argued on demurrer and joinder.
