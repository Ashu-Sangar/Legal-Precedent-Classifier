L. 198, the record of a justice of the peace in an action against a fire insurance company is insufficient where it shows that the writ was returned as served on the defendant company by leaving- a copy of the writ with its agent, without further description of the agent.\nIt seems that the agent intended by the act is one having a branch office of the company, or a certificate of authority for the transaction of its business, and not one for the purpose merely of soliciting insurance.\nArgued Oct. 17, 1894.\nCertiorari, No. 261, Oct.

After hearing the evidence and the parties, judgment in favor of Plff. for $2.50 and costs of suit.\u201d\nThe following exceptions were filed to the record:\n\u201c 1st. Said judgment was rendered without any legal service upon the said defendant company.\n\u201c 2d. The record does not show that A. C. McKean, upon whom service of summons was made, was an agent of the said defendant company, or had any authority whatever to represent them in the said-action.\n\u201c Sd. That the said A. C. McKean was not an agent of the said company upon whom any legal service could be made.\u201d\nThe court sustained the exceptions recited above, in an opinion by McIlvaine, P.
