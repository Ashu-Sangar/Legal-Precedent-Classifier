T., 1894, by-defendant, from order of C. P. Yenango Co., Jan. 7, 1894, No. 16, making absolute a rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of. defence.\nBefore Sterrbtt, C. J., Green, Williams', McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nScire facias sur municipal claim.\nThe affidavit of defence was as follows:\n\u201c 1. This action is brought to recover the cost of certain improvements made under the authority of an alleged ordinance of the said city providing for the paving of Front street, which said alleged ordinance is void and of no effect for the reasons following :\n\u201c a. Said city of Oil City is a city of the third class; section 25, article XV, of the act entitled \u2018 An act providing for the incorporation and government of cities of the third class \u2019 approved May 28, 1889, P. L. 325, provides that, where the paving of any street, lane or alley, or any part thereof, has been petitioned for, no ordinance for such purpose \u2018 shall be passed until five days\u2019 notice of the improvement prayed for, with the names of the petitioners therefor, has been given in one newspaper published in the city;\u2019 whereas, the improvement, for which claim is made in this case, was petitioned for by eight property holders, by petition presented to council April 10, 1898, but the notice thereof required by said act was not, at any time, given in any newspaper published in said city, although said alleged ordinance was passed in compliance with and in response to the petition aforesaid.\n\u201c 5. Section 3, article rv, of the act aforesaid, P. L. of 1889, page 282, provides, that \u2018 No ordinance shall be passed by councils except by bill \u2019 and \u2018 no bill shall be considered unless referred to a joint or separate committee, returned therefrom and printed for the use of the members ; \u2019 whereas the bill embodying the said alleged ordinance, was not referred to any committee after its preparation, nor was it printed at all until after it had passed its first and second reading in the common council on the 22d day of May A. D. 1893.\n\u201c 2. The assessment made upon the property of the defendant, which is sought to be recovered in this action, includes the cost of re-grading said Front street as well as the cost of paving the same. Said street was graded by the city authorities and the cost thereof assessed upon the abutting property in the year , and your deponent then paid the amount assessed upon the property now sought to be charged in this action : during the paving of the said street under said alleged ordinance the grade of said street was illegally raised at some points more than a foot, and your deponent is advised and believes that having once been compelled to pay for the grading of said street, he cannot be compelled to pay for the regrading thereof under cover of an alleged ordinance providing for its paving.\n\u201c Your deponent is advised and believes that the said improvement having been made under an alleged ordinance which is wholly void for the reasons above stated, and that the assessment having included therein', the cost of improvements for which he cannot be made liable, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover anything in this action.\u201d\nThe court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. \u2018 \"\nError assigned was above order.\nF. W. Hays, for appellant.\nAdvertising the petition was necessary: Act of May 23, 1889, art. 15, \u00a7 26, proviso; Morewood Ave., 159 Pa. 30 ; Ry. v. Allegheny, 92 Pa. 100 ; Dil. Mun. Corp., 2d ed. \u00a7 610; Pittsburg v. Walter, 69 Pa. 365 ; Olds v. Erie, 79 Pa. 380; Scranton v. Jermyn, 156 Pa. 107.\nWhen the mode of enacting ordinances is prescribed, that mode must be pursued: Dil. Mun. Corp., 2d ed. \u00a7 246 ; Act of May 23, 1889, art. 4, \u00a7 2, P. L. 282 ; 17 A. & E. Ency. L. 238; 15 Ib. 1036; Sank v. Phila., 4 Brewster, 143; Coffin v. Portland, 43 Fed. R. 411; Esling\u2019s Ap., 89 Pa. 210 ; Pittsburg v. Walter, 69 Pa. 365 ; Ry. v. Allegheny, 92 Pa. 100.\nWhen the adjacent property has paid the original cost of. grading or paving a street in a city, it has fully paid for all its . local advantages and it cannot be charged for re-grading or repaving : Asylum\u2019s Ap., 111 Pa. 135; Hammett v. Phila., 65 Pa. 146 ; Alcorn v. Phila., 112 Pa. 498; Morewood Ave., 159 Pa. 20.\nIsaac Ash and P. M. Speer, for appellee, not heard.\nAdvertising the petition was not necessary. A petition by a majority of the property owners is sufficient: Act of May 23, 1889, art. v, \u00a7 3, cl. 10, P. L. 288. The affidavit not denying this, it is held to be conceded : Peck v. Jones, 70 Pa. 84.\nThe proviso relied upon by appellant applies to \u00a7 26 alone. This construction harmonizes the act: Erie v. Bootz, 72 Pa. 196; Phila.\u2019s Ap., 93 Pa. 221.\nThe affidavit of defence does not allege that the ordinance or bill was not referred to and acted upon by a committee and returned therefrom to the councils, but merely that this was not done after the preparation of the bill. Neither is it alleged that the ordinance was not printed for the use of the members, but merely that it was not printed until after it had passed first and second readings in one branch of councils. The defence does not say that both of these things were not done, but merely objects to the time at which they were done during action upon the ordinance. The act does not specify any particular time.\nThe affidavit of defence does not state how much the alleged change in grade has increased the cost of the paving, or whether or not it has increased it at all. Such averments are too general and uncertain in character,' and should be disregarded: Taylor v. Murphy, 148 Pa. 337.\nOct. 15, 1894 :"
