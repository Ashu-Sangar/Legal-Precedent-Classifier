Plaintiffs, in their counter affidavit, refused to accept the amount for which judgment was tendered and averred they were not \u201c bound to take notice of said tender, as the money was not paid into court, nor' did plaintiffs issue execution therefor.\u201d No further action appears to have been taken until five days before trial of the case, when defendants, upon leave granted, paid into court $84.12, the amount tendered with costs and interest to date of payment. The case was tried and on February 16th a verdict for $74.57 was rendered in favor of plaintiffs. Afterwards defendants moved the court for an order on plaintiffs to pay all costs of the proceedings to recover the residue of their .claim,exclusive of the amount tendered and afterwards paid into court; and upon due consideration the order, which is the subject of complaint here, was accordingly made. The only question is whether the court erred in construing its own rule.\nIn view of the foregoing facts and the provisions of the rule' referred to, we think there was no error in construing the1 -after, or in making the order complained of. The rule in1 question is promotive of justice, and tends to speed the final disposition of causes, and should therefore be liberally con-strued. The court is the best judge of its own rules, and unless its construction of them is clearly erroneous we are not disposed to interfere.\nOrder'affirmed with costs to be paid by appellants.",

The plaintiff, if he refuses to accept said judgment as in full of his claim, shall, before he issues execution or receipts for the money, file a paper refusing to accept, and may thereafter proceed to trial for the balance of his claim, but if he recovers no part of the balance claimed he shall pay all costs on the proceedings to recover the same.\u201d Defendants tendered judgment for an amount admitted to be due, but did not pay the amount into court until five days before the trial, when they paid into court the amount tendered with costs and interest to date.
