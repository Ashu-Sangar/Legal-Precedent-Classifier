Evidence for plaihtiff'tended to show that the land formerly belonged to the defendant; that it was bought in at a sheriffs sale by a creditor, and subsequently conveyed to defendant\u2019s son who was not in the state at the time; that the control of the property continued in the defendant, who was at the time insolvent; that a sale of the timber on the land was effected by defendant, and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the debt of the creditor who bought in the land at the sheriff\u2019s sale. There was also evidence that another tract of land was conveyed to another son of defendant under circumstances which seemed to indicate an intent to cover up the title. Held, that the case was for the jury. - ,\nArgued Oct. 2, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 33, Oct. T., 1894, by'defendants, from judgment of C. P. Jefferson Co., Sept. T., 1889, No. 314, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAttachment execution. Before White, P. J.\nThe garnishees claimed that the fund' in their hands was the proceeds of the sale of lands belonging to R. S. Cathers, a son of defendant, James A. Cathers, under a power of attorney made by the son to the father. Plaintiff offered evidence to show that the land formerly belonged to defendant, that it was bought in at a sheriff\u2019s sale by a creditor, R. Arthurs, who subsequent!y conveyed it to defendant\u2019s son who was not in the state at the time ; that the control of the property continued in defendant, who was at the time insolvent; that a sale of the timber on the land was effected by defendant, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the debt of Arthurs. Plaintiff also offered evidence to show that Arthurs bought another tract of land belonging to defendant, sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and afterwards conveyed it to John T. Cathers, another son of defendant.\nPlaintiff, under objection and exception, gave in evidence the judgment on which the attachment execution issued, and the preceding judgment of which it was a revival, to show that the debt accrued and was a subsisting lien prior to the fraudulent-transfer. [1, 2]\nThis judgment was entered originally against James A. Cathers and W. T. Cathers. The latter was surety for the former, and, having paid off the judgment, he was subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff.\nPlaintiff, under objection and exception, gave in evidence other judgments, executions, receipts and payments by defendant, to prove that he was the beneficial owner after the transfer to his son. [3-7]\nThe court left the question of fraud to the juzy.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendants appealed.\nErrors assigned, were rulings on evidence, and instructions, quoting bills of, exception, evidence and instructions.\nCharles Corbet, M. M.
