L. 271, from selling the entire business and property of the association without the consent of all the shareholders, at suit of one having a mere equity in the capital.\nArgued Oct. 10, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 82, July T., 1894, by defendant, from decree of C. P. Crawford Co., May T., 1894, No. 1, granting preliminary injunction.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill for injunction to restrain managers of limited partnership association from selling business and property of company.\nThe court below stated the facts as follows :\n\u201c A partnership association entitled \u2018 Producers Oil Company, Limited,\u2019 was formed on June 4, 1891, under the provisions of the act of June 2, 1874, P. L. 271, with a capital stock of $600,GOO, divided into shares of $10.00 each, of which capital complainant owns $3,000.\n\u201c The business to be conducted was stated in the articles of association to be : \u2018 The producing, storing, buying, selling, piping and transporting of petroleum, crude and refined, and the products of petroleum, and the acquisition and holding of such property, real, personal or mixed, as may be necessary for these purposes or any of them, or incidental or auxiliary thereto.\u2019 The duration of the partnership was fixed at twenty years. The company has five managers.\n\u201c The company entered into the business of buying, selling and transporting oil in Allegheny and Washington counties, and, for the purpose of promoting the business of the company, constructed a pipe line from a portion of the Allegheny and Washington county oil field to Coraopolis, on the Ohio river.\n\u201c The business of the company not proving entirely satisfactory to the management, a plan was developed in connection with refiners of oil in Venango and Crawford counties, for the construction of a pipe line from Coraopolis to Titusville, via Reno and Oil City.\n\u201c To accomplish this undertaking, and for the other purposes stated in the articles of association, another partnership association was formed on the 13th day of May, 1892, called the \u2018 Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited,\u2019 with a capital stock of $250,000, divided into shares of $100 each; the duration of which association was fixed at twenty years from June 4, 1892. Five managers of the association were chosen.\n\u201c Of the capital of the association last named the Producers Oil Company, Limited, contributed $170,000. Substantially all of the capital of the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, was invested in right of way, pipe lines, tanks, telegraph lines, etc., necessary for the construction and operation of the pipe line referred to, from Coraopolis to Titusville.\n\u201c After the organization of the last named association, a lease was executed to it by tbe Producers Oil Company, Limited, of tbe tanks and pipe lines of the latter company. J. W. Lee, George H. Torrey and A. D. Wood are managers in each of the associations.\n\u201c A corporation known as the United States Pipe Line Company has a system of pipe lines in operation from Oil City and Bradford to Wilkes-Barre. On Dec. 14, 1893, the board of managers of the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, at a meeting then held, adopted the following resolutions :\n\u201c \u2018 Resolved that, whereas a combination of the several independent pipe lines doing business in the Pennsylvania oil field in a single organization is highly desirable, therefore\n\u201c \u2018 Resolved, that the managers of this company will take into consideration at any time the question of uniting the several companies, in any feasible plan mutually satisfactory to all parties concerned.\u2019\n\u201cAnd, on Jan. 27, 1894, at a meeting of the board of managers of the said association, another resolution was passed, reciting that of Dec. 14, 1893, and continuing as follows: \u2018 Now, therefore, to carry out the purpose expressed in the above resolution, we hereby authorize the following proposition to be made to the United States Pipe Line Company, subject to confirmation by majority of number and right of interest of the members of the Producers and Refiners Oil Companjq Limited, viz: The Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, to sell to the United States Pipe Line Company all of the rights of way, pipe line, telegraph line, tankage, real estate, gas wells, etc., comprising all of the property owned hy them, and used in and belonging to the business of transporting and storing oil, but not to include crude oil; for which the United States Pipe Line Company is to pay the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, in the stock of the United States Pipe Line Company the sum of $250,000; and also, as part of the consideration for the said sale, shall pay or secure to be paid, before the transfer of the property is made, all of the outstanding indebtedness of the said Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited. And the said United States Pipe Line Company, as a condition precedent to said sale, shall agree to extend its pipe line forthwith from Bradford, Pa., to Titusville, Pa., and to connect with the line of the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited. And the United States Pipe Line Company shall assume and carry out the existing contracts of the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, with certain refiners at Titusville, Oil City and Reno, Pa., as to the delivery of crude oil, storage and pipeage of the same.\u2019\n\u201c This resolution was adopted by the managers present, four in number.\n\u201c The complainant sought to restrain the proposed sale of the property of the Producers and Refiners Oil Company, Limited, alleging that it was in violation of the articles of association of the said company, and prejudicial to his interest therein.\u201d\n.
