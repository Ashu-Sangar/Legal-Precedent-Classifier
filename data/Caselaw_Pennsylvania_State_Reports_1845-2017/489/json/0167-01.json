        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\n\u201cNo right is more fundamental to the American system of justice\u201d than the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an accused to trial by an impartial jury. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Jerome, 478 Pa. 484, 504, 387 A.2d 425, 435 (1978), appeal dismissed, 443 U.S. 913, 99 S.Ct. 3104, 61 L.Ed.2d 877 (1979). See U.S.Const. Amends. VI & XIV; Pa.Const. art. I, \u00a7 9. At issue on these appeals is whether pre-trial publicity in Berks County denied appellant Stuart Richard Cohen this fundamental right. Unlike the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, we conclude that the pretrial publicity did prevent appellant from selecting an impartial jury. Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of sentence and remand for a new trial with a change of venue.\nI. Procedural History\nOn November 14,1974, a man walking along a fire trail in Reading\u2019s Egelman Park discovered the body of Steven Warunek, a sixteen year-old Reading youth. Warunek had been shot to death. On November 18, police arrested three eighteen year-old suspects, Anthony Reynolds, George Arms, and appellant, and charged all three with murder. Police also charged appellant with conspiracy to commit murder. Police investigation revealed that appellant hired the other two to kill Warunek in retaliation for threats Warunek made on appellant\u2019s life. Warunek allegedly told his fiance, Kerry Young, he would kill appellant, Young\u2019s former boyfriend.\nThe three suspects were committed to the Berks County prison in lieu of $250,000 bail. Soon after arrest, appellant was released when his father posted certificates of deposit and a bank account with the district justice. Neither Arms nor Reynolds, however, was able to post the necessary security and both remained in prison.\nAt the same time appellant sought a reduction of bail. In mid-December, at the hearing on appellant\u2019s request, Assistant District Attorney Murphy objected on the ground that \u201cMr. Cohen is accused of premeditated contract killing, and there is a distinct possibility that the district attorney\u2019s office will be requesting the death penalty in this case. . \u201d Appellant\u2019s request for a reduction of bail was denied.\nA preliminary hearing on the charges against appellant was held late in January, 1975. Testifying against appellant was Jack Geisler, a \u201cwitness\u201d to the killing who, in \u201csobbing\u201d testimony, both admitted his own involvement and claimed appellant had hired Arms and Reynolds to kill the victim. After two days of testimony, appellant was held for action by the grand jury. On March 5, appellant moved to stay grand jury action against him on the ground that he was prejudiced by media publicity concerning recently-charged Jack Geisler. Judge Edenharter, presiding judge in appellant\u2019s case, denied appellant\u2019s request. The next day the grand jury indicted appellant and later that month appellant entered a plea of not guilty. Trial was set for April 14.\nOn April 7, appellant filed a number of pre-trial applications, including an application to disqualify the District Attorney and his staff and one for a change of venue. The court continued the trial date and on April 28 began a hearing on the application to disqualify the District Attorney and his staff.\nAppellant based his motion to disqualify on the ground that the District Attorney and his staff were behaving like \u201cpersecutors and not prosecutors.\u201d City Detective John Halstead testified that during periods of interrogation either District Attorney VanHoove or Assistant District Attorney Murphy threatened Commonwealth witness Jack Geisler as well as appellant\u2019s co-defendant Reynolds that they would \u201cburn\u201d or would have the opportunity to smell \u201cburning flesh\u201d if they did not provide details of the killing. Police Lieutenant Thomas Hess testified that District Attorney VanHoove expressed his desire to stand beside appellant when the \u201cswitch was pulled.\u201d\nThe trial court denied the application to disqualify and from May 1 to May 9 held a hearing on appellant\u2019s application for a change of venue. At the hearing, appellant presented copies of Berks County newspaper articles and transcripts of local radio broadcasts which discussed appellant\u2019s case. Appellant also presented Dr. Jay Schulman, a professor at Columbia University and member of the National Jury Project, who is an expert on the impact of publicized criminal proceedings on public opinion. Dr. Schulman testified on the results of a public opinion poll he conducted which tested Berks County residents\u2019 views on appellant\u2019s guilt. Dr. Schulman, four other expert witnesses, and six lay witnesses all expressed an opinion that appellant could not receive a fair trial in Berks County. The Commonwealth opposed the application for a change of venue, but offered no evidence. The court denied appellant\u2019s application without opinion or other explanation of record.\nAppellant then petitioned this Court for a writ of prohibition or mandamus, \u201cdirect[ing] a change of venue . . . , or in the alternative, prohibiting] the enforcement of the order denying the change of venue.\u201d Simultaneously, appellant requested the court to continue trial. It did so, setting a tentative trial date of July 14, 1975. This Court denied appellant\u2019s application for extraordinary relief on July 2. Appellant then applied for and obtained another continuance, the court setting trial for the September, 1975 Term.\nOn September 2, 1975, before the scheduled date of trial, appellant filed a \u201cRe-Application For Change of Venue.\u201d In support of his \u201cRe-Application,\u201d appellant presented the results of a second public opinion survey. This survey was conducted on August 22 and 23 by Dr. Robert Buckhout, another member of the National Jury Project. Once again, the Commonwealth, opposing the motion, presented no contrary evidence. The court denied appellant\u2019s \u201cRe-Application,\u201d again without explanation. Appellant immediately applied for and was denied another continuance. Trial was set for September 8.\nVoir dire began Monday, September 8 and lasted two full weeks, through Friday, September 19. In all, 180 persons were called in order to select a twelve-member jury and two alternates. The court ordered each juror immediately sequestered upon selection. At the close of voir dire, appellant for the third time requested a change of venue. The trial court denied this request, again without explanation. Trial began the following Monday, September 22.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth proceeded on its theory that appellant hired Arms and Reynolds to kill the victim Warunek, presenting testimony not only of Jack Geisler and Anthony Reynolds but also of appellant\u2019s former girlfriend Kerry Young. In defense, appellant admitted that he spoke with Arms and Reynolds and produced $700 cash as payment. He maintained, however, that he wanted only Warunek to be \u201cscared\u201d and \u201cshoved around\u201d so that Warunek would know people were protecting appellant. Appellant sought to discredit Commonwealth witness Jack Geisler by showing on cross-examination that Geisler had given police and the District Attorney inconsistent statements and that he had previously testified at appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing that appellant wanted only to have Warunek \u201cmessed up.\u201d Appellant also pointed out that, as of appellant\u2019s trial, neither Geisler nor Reynolds had been sentenced on their convictions following their earlier guilty pleas.\nThe case went to the jury on Wednesday, October 1. That Friday, October 3, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of murder of the third degree and conspiracy to commit murder. Appellant then filed written post-verdict motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which included appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying a change of venue.\nWhile appellant\u2019s motions were pending, Judge Bertolet, presiding judge at co-defendant Arm\u2019s separate trial, granted Arms\u2019s motion for a change of venue. In support of his motion for a new trial, appellant relied in part upon Judge Bertolet\u2019s ruling in the Arms case.\nJudge Edenharter, however, denied all of appellant\u2019s post-verdict motions. In his accompanying opinion, Judge Edenharter for the first time sought to explain his orders denying appellant\u2019s three pre-trial applications for a change of venue. The court summarily dismissed appellant\u2019s principal contention that the pre-trial publicity was \u201cinherently prejudicial,\u201d concluding that, unlike the Arms case, there is insufficient evidence that any inflammatory information was widely disseminated at the time of trial. The court also concluded that the jury appellant did select was not affected by the pre-trial publicity.\nOn July 15, 1977, the court imposed sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment, costs, and a fine of $15,000 on the murder conviction, as well as a concurrent sentence of five to ten years, costs, and a fine of $10,000 on the conspiracy conviction. These appeals followed.\nII. Discharge Not Appropriate\nBefore considering whether a motion for a change of venue should have been granted, we must first consider appellant\u2019s contention that, in light of improper conduct on the part of the prosecution, appellant must now be discharged. Appellant makes three arguments in support of this relief. First, he contends the prosecution \u201ccoerced\u201d certain Commonwealth witnesses with threats of the electric chair and promises of leniency and that without the \u201ccoerced\u201d testimony the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. Second, he contends that the many acts of misconduct on the part of the prosecution, including the alleged coercion of certain witnesses, interference with defense access to Commonwealth witnesses, and unfair argument and cross-examination at trial, so denied appellant due process that a discharge is warranted. Third, appellant contends that, under Commonwealth v. Potter, 478 Pa. 251, 386 A.2d 918 (1978), appellant must now be discharged for what appellant has termed the prosecution\u2019s \u201coverwhelming display\u201d of \u201cbad faith.\u201d We reject all three arguments.\nWe cannot agree that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. Corroborated testimony of Commonwealth witnesses supports a jury\u2019s conclusion that appellant hired Arms and Reynolds to kill the victim. Although appellant invites this Court in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence not to consider testimony of Commonwealth witnesses allegedly coerced by the District Attorney, we must decline the invitation. It is not the practice of this Court to \u201cdiminish the record\u201d before reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. \u201c[T]he sufficiency of the evidence must be evaluated upon the entire trial record.\" Commonwealth v. Tabb, 417 Pa. 13, 16, 207 A.2d 884, 886 (1965). Accord, Commonwealth v. Kuebler, 484 Pa. 358, 361 n.*, 399 A.2d 116, 117 n.* (1979); Commonwealth v. Meadows, 471 Pa. 201, 369 A.2d 1266 (1977).\nNor can we agree with appellant that the alleged prosecutional misconduct here forecloses retrial on a theory that due process has been denied. We cannot accept appellant\u2019s claim that a new trial is not a sufficient remedy for the asserted prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant\u2019s claim mistakenly rests on an unsupportable assumption that a fair trial cannot be had in the future. Finally, we cannot agree with appellant that Potter requires discharge here. Potter is a case where prosecutorial misconduct allegedly forced the defendant to request a mistrial. No such circumstance is present here. Appellant points to nothing on this record establishing that he made any timely request for a mistrial.\nIII. Record Mandates Change of Venue\n\u201cLegal trials are not like elections, to be won through the use of the meeting-hall, the radio, and the newspaper.\u201d Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 271, 62 S.Ct. 190, 197, 86 L.Ed. 192 (1941). Accordingly, a trial court has an affirmative constitutional obligation to take \u201cstrong measures\u201d to assure a fair trial. Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 362, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1522, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966). As our cases repeatedly state, a trial court requested to change venue must exercise a \u201csound\u201d discretion. Commonwealth v. Casper, 481 Pa. 143, 150, 392 A.2d 287, 291 (1978).\nIn exercising sound discretion, the trial court is to consider the following \u201cdiscrete factors:\u201d\n\u201cwhether the pre-trial publicity was, on the one hand, factual and objective, or, on the other hand, consisted of sensational, inflammatory and \u2018slanted articles demanding conviction,\u2019 United States v. Sawyers, 423 F.2d 1335, 1343 (4th Cir. 1970); whether the pre-trial publicity revealed the existence of the accused\u2019s prior criminal record; whether it referred to confessions, admissions or reenactments of the crime by the defendant; and whether such information is the product of reports by the police and prosecutorial officers.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Casper, supra, 481 Pa. at 152-53, 392 A.2d at 292 (footnotes omitted). So too, the extent of saturation as well as the possibility that a period of \u201ccooling-off\u201d has occurred must be considered. Id., 481 Pa. at 153-54, 392 A.2d at 292-93. It must also be remembered that\n\u201c[A] motion for change of venue . . . shall be granted whenever it is determined that because of the dissemination of potentially prejudicial material, there is a substantial likelihood that in the absence of such relief, a fair trial cannot be had. This determination may be based on such evidence as qualified public opinion surveys or opinion testimony offered by individuals, or in the court\u2019s own evaluation of the nature, frequency, and timing of the material involved. A showing of actual prejudice shall not be required.\u201d\nABA Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free Press, supra, at Std. 8-3.3(c) (2d ed. Approved Draft, 1978).\nMoreover, a reviewing court must not simply defer to a trial court\u2019s order denying a change of venue. Rather, a reviewing court must very carefully scrutinize such an order to ensure that a sound discretion has been exercised. As the Supreme Court of the United States has made clear, where, as here, the accused\u2019s ability to obtain a trial by an impartial jury is called into question, \u201cappellate tribunals have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d Sheppard v. Maxwell, supra, 384 U.S. at 362, 86 S.Ct. at 1522. See Commonwealth v. Pierce, 451 Pa. 190, 303 A.2d 209 (1973). Here, our review of the record and independent evaluation of the circumstances convince us that prejudicial material was widely disseminated at the time of trial and thus a change of venue is necessary.\nA. Dissemination of Prejudicial Material\nFrom appellant\u2019s arrest in mid-November, 1974 until hearings in May of 1975 on appellant\u2019s first application for a change of venue, Reading\u2019s two newspapers the \u201cTimes\u201d and the \u201cEagle,\u201d as well as Reading radio stations WRAW and WEEU, extensively covered every aspect of this case. The record contains thirty-seven newspaper articles, including sixteen front-page stories, and thirty-eight radio broadcasts which directly feature aspects of this case.\nMost extensively publicized is the allegation of a \u201ccontract killing.\u201d The front page of the December 13 Eagle reported Assistant District Attorney Murphy\u2019s disclosure that the Commonwealth \u201cmay seek the death penalty which, he said, is allowed for premeditated contract killings.\u201d The December 14 Times and radio station WRAW also immediately gave similar coverage. Forty-one subsequent newspaper stories, reporting through the May hearings on appellant\u2019s application for a change of venue, carried what became standard-reference to the fact that a \u201ccontract killing\u201d was involved. These references became so prevalent that subsequent stories referred to the \u201ccontract killing\u201d without mentioning that the remarks were made by Assistant District Attorney Murphy at appellant\u2019s reduction of bail hearing. One newspaper story even pointed out that \u201c[t]he case is believed to be the first alleged contract killing in Pennsylvania since the Joseph Yablonski murders in 1969.\u201d\nAlso well-publicized were allegations that appellant and the co-conspirators made plans to kill Warunek while \u201chigh\u201d on drugs and alcohol. A front-stage story of the January Times 25 entitled \u201cCohen murder hearing begun,\u201d accompanied by a 6V2 inch by 6% inch photograph of appellant and his attorney, summarizes witnesses\u2019 allegations that\n\u201ca conspiracy to \u2018mess up\u2019 the 16-year-old Steve E. Warunek was made during a dope and booze party in an apartment at 111 S. 8th St. when the alleged conspirators were \u2018high.\u2019 \u201d\nThe same day the Eagle also carried a story entitled \u201cKilling Linked To Lover\u2019s Spat.\u201d Accompanying this story, like the story in the Times, is a 5 inch by 6 inch photograph of appellant and his attorney. The story beings:\n\u201cThe November slaying of 16-year-old Steve E. Warunek in Egelman Park was depicted Friday as a contract murder, carried out amidst fear of reprisal in a heated lovers\u2019 triangle with the conspirators discussing plans during smoke-filled pot and alcohol parties.\u201d\nThe January 31 and February 2 Eagle, the February 1 and February 4 Times, and a January 30 WRAW radio broadcast carried similar reports. Additionally, all but one of the same newspaper articles disclosed that appellant and his former girlfriend had a child out-of-wedlock. Cf. Commonwealth v. Frazier, 471 Pa. 121, 369 A.2d 1224 (1977) (dissemination of accused\u2019s criminal record prejudicial); Commonwealth v. Pierce, supra (same).\nEqually prominent among the subjects of extensive media publicity is the fact that only appellant of the three originally-arrested suspects had the financial capacity to afford pre-trial release on bail. Immediately upon appellant\u2019s release, both the November 19 Times and Eagle as well as news broadcasts of WRAW and WEEU made regular reference to the fact that only appellant was free on bail. Reports on the disparity in the suspects\u2019 ability to afford pre-trial release appeared in eighteen subsequent newspaper articles and sixteen radio broadcasts.\nIn reporting on appellant\u2019s pre-trial applications, media attributed to appellant \u201cdelays\u201d in the proceedings. The April 9 Eagle, in its front-page story \u201cCourt grants delay,\u201d reported that Assistant District Attorney Murphy \u201copposed any continuance, claiming that the pretrial relief could be resolved without too much reasonably [sic] delay. However, Judge Frederick Edenharter overruled the objection.\u201d The same story commenting on the \u201cdelay\u201d also repeated Murphy\u2019s characterization of appellant\u2019s \u201c25-page legal document\u201d as \u201cextraordinary and extra-legal.\u201d The April 10 Times carried a similar story, entitled \u201cCohen case delayed a month.\u201d\nSpecial media attention centered on appellant\u2019s pre-trial application to disqualify the District Attorney and his staff. The April 29 Eagle highlighted police testimony concerning District Attorney VanHoove and Assistant District Attorney Murphy:\n\u201cCity Detective John Halstead testified that either Mr. VanHoove or Mr. Murphy threatened Jack Geisler, 23-year-old suspect in the case, and another defendant, Anthony Reynolds, 18, during the interrogation periods.\nDuring questioning by Atty. Dimitriou, Detective Hal-stead said that one or the other told the two defendants that \u2018he would burn\u2019 or would have the opportunity to smell burning flesh if they did not provide details in the case.\nLt. Thomas P. Hess was called to testify regarding a statement by Mr. VanHoove allegedly made some time in December 1974 or late January 1975. Through examination by Atty. Dimitriou, Lt. Hess admitted that Mr. VanHoove made a remark to the effect that he wanted to stand beside Mr. Cohen when they pulled the switch.\nLt. Hess explained that the reference to Cohen was made to a room full of people and was an offhand remark. He didn\u2019t remember if it was presented in a joking manner but that it was made in the county detective\u2019s office of the DA\u2019s headquarters.\u201d\nBy his publicized \u201cpull the switch\u201d remark, VanHoove announced his opinion on appellant\u2019s guilt in violation of Commonwealth v. Pierce, supra. The April 30 Times carried front-page stories, one entitled \u201cCohen hearing opened to public\u201d and one \u201cDefense claims partiality,\u201d both of which further detailed testimony at the hearing on appellant\u2019s application to disqualify. The \u201cCohen hearing opened to public\u201d story summarized Officer Hess\u2019s previous testimony, reported in the April 29 Eagle, that VanHoove wanted to be standing next to Cohen when the \u201cswitch was pulled.\u201d The \u201cDefense claims partiality\u201d story mentioned the earlier release of Geisler on his own recognizance at the request of the District Attorney, and again discussed testimony of Detective Halstead concerning the \u201clurid\u201d statements about the electric chair made by the District Attorney.\nBerks County media also gave great attention to appellant\u2019s pre-trial application for a change of venue. The court began to hear testimony on appellant\u2019s application on May 1. The May 2 Times carried a lengthy story entitled \u201cCourt ponders trial site plea\u201d which set forth testimony on the qualifications of appellant\u2019s expert witness Dr. Jay Schulman. The same day\u2019s Eagle carried another extensive story entitled \u201cSurvey Allowed in Cohen Case,\u201d which discussed the court\u2019s ruling allowing appellant to introduce Schulman\u2019s expert testimony. Both the May 3 Times and Eagle carried related, extensive stories.\nEight more stories appeared between May 5 to May 9, all of which discussed testimony at the hearing on appellant\u2019s application for a change of venue, including \u201cConsultant Queried on Survey Errors,\u201d \u201cJury researcher calls Berks biased,\u201d \u201c \u2018Prejudice\u2019 Is Probed At Hearing,\u201d \u201cPrejudice Is Estimated,\u201d and \u201c4 rule out fairness.\u201d\nB. Prejudicial Material Pervasively Disseminated at Time of Trial\nThe record clearly establishes that the repeatedly-disseminated prejudicial material was widespread throughout Berks County at the time of trial. Thus inapposite are those cases in which the allegedly objectionable reports were not particularly widespread. Equally distinguishable are those cases in which the claimed objectionable reports so long preceded jury selection as to allow for a period of \u201ccooling off.\u201d\nHere in the months between arrest and trial Berks County residents became increasingly aware of this case. So too an ever-growing number of residents formed an opinion on the merits. The public opinion poll conducted by Dr. Schulman in March and April of 1975 and admitted into evidence at the May hearing on appellant\u2019s first application for a change of venue revealed that, of 804 randomly-selected Berks County registered voters, 65% then were aware of the case. Of those polled, 30%, or 242 out of 804 people, expressly conceded they had prejudged appellant guilty. Dr. Buckhout\u2019s survey, conducted approximately four months later in late August, revealed a still greater public awareness of this case. Of the 250 people randomly interviewed, 79% were aware of this case, an increase of approximately 15% from the level of awareness found four months earlier. Dr. Buckhout\u2019s survey also revealed that 57% of all persons interviewed, or 143 out of 250 people, attributed guilt to appellant. This figure is nearly twice as great as the figure found in the previous poll. These results, unchallenged and undisturbed by the trial court, demonstrate with unquestionable clarity the substantial extent to which pretrial publicity had reached the local population and had influenced its judgment.\nVoir dire, conducted in September, about two weeks after Dr. Buckhout\u2019s August survey, confirmed the results of Dr. Buckhout\u2019s poll. Of the 180 prospective jurors called, eleven were excused on various grounds of hardship and not questioned concerning the merits. Of the 169 persons questioned, 105 stated they held an opinion concerning the merits. Indeed, of these 105 prospective jurors, eighty-nine were excused on the ground that they admitted a \u201cfixed,\u201d irrevocable opinion on guilt. Thus, 53% of the prospective jurors questioned were excused because of prejudgment.\nThese percentages of persons expressing an opinion on an accused\u2019s guilt are unprecedented in our cases. For example, in Frazier, supra, this Court held that widespread pretrial disclosures of the accused\u2019s previous convictions as well as police testimony at the preliminary hearing that the accused admitted his own involvement were \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d and required a change of venue. There a \u201cmajority\u201d of eleven of the thirty-two jurors questioned were challenged for cause by the accused. In addition, five prospective jurors, excused by peremptory challenges, had an opinion on guilt. This Court in Frazier concluded on the basis of voir dire that \u201cclearly . . . the news coverage which occurred at the time of and shortly after the homicide was still in the minds of the prospective jurors at the time of trial.\u201d Frazier, 471 Pa. at 131, 369 A.2d at 1229. Compare Commonwealth v. Casper, supra (no inherent prejudice where two out of 42 prospective jurors knew of case and couldn\u2019t decide case on basis of evidence at trial); Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, supra (no inherent prejudice where 31 out of 139 prospective jurors questioned formed fixed opinion); Hoss I, supra (no inherent prejudice where 26 out of 138 jurors questioned had formed opinion). Surely appellant, whose evidence reveals that as many as nearly two-thirds of those jurors questioned had an opinion on guilt, and indeed 53% of those questioned were excused on the ground of an irrevocable prejudgment of the merits, is entitled to no less protection than that afforded in Frazier. It therefore must be concluded that the prejudicial material was widespread at the time of trial and that the court abused its discretion in refusing on this record to grant a change of venue.\nSo too, this record mandates that retrial must be in another venue. Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 312(a), we change venue from the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, 23rd Judicial District of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to the Court of Common Pleas of Lacka wanna County, 45th Judicial District of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nJudgments of sentence vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nNIX, J., files an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n. Bail Reduction Transcript at 3.\n. Geisler was not charged until February 24, approximately one month after appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing. Shortly after the Commonwealth charged Geisler, the district justice, at the request of the District Attorney\u2019s office, reduced Geisler\u2019s bail and then released Geisler on his own recognizance. President Judge Eshelman rescinded Geisler\u2019s release almost immediately and ordered Geisler back to prison. In only four days, the incident prompted six lengthy articles in the Reading press and ten radio broadcasts.

On the first day of hearings, the court permitted media representatives to remain in the courtroom but ordered the media not to publish testimony until further order of court. The next day, the court rescinded this order, deeming the hearings fully opened as of inception and thus lifting any restriction on publication.\n. Reading has no local television station.\n. Dr. Schulman has participated in, consulted in, or researched jury selection in over fifty criminal and civil proceedings, including the \u201cHarrisburg 7\u201d case, United States v. Ellsberg, United States v. Mitchell and Stans, the \u201cWounded Knee\u201d cases, the \u201cAttica\u201d cases, and the Joan Little case.\nWe note there is nothing in either our case law or the commentary which would suggest that exhibits of newspaper articles and other media broadcasts are the exclusive evidence in support of an application for change of venue. To the contrary, the ABA Standards on Fair Trial and Free Press encourage use of opinion surveys. Standard 8-3.3(b) of the Standards (2d ed. Approved Draft, 1978) expressly provides:\n\u201cIn addition to the testimony or affidavits of individuals in the community, which shall not be required as a condition to the granting of a motion for change of venue . , qualified public opinion surveys shall be admissible as well as other materials having probative value.\u201d\nSee id., Commentary at p. 18 (\u201ctrial courts should be very liberal in the types of testimony and evidence they will consider\u201d).\n. Petition for Writ of Prohibition or Mandamus, Commonwealth ex rel. Cohen v. Judge Edenharter, No. 431 Misc. Docket 20, at 5.\n. In his order of March 22, 1976 granting Arms a change of venue, Judge Bertolet stated that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in Berks County because of the \u201cmassive publicity to date and expected to continue to the time of trial.\u201d Judge Bertolet based his determination on newspaper articles offered by appellant and did not rely upon Arms\u2019s offer of a public opinion survey Dr. Schulman conducted in connection with the Arms case. We note that this survey, conducted in November of 1975, revealed that 40% of those Berks County residents surveyed could identify Arms, while 79% could identify appellant.\n. Upon sentencing, the court denied appellant bail pending appeal. Appellant then took a direct appeal to this Court from the judgment imposed on the murder conviction and a separate appeal to the Superior Court from the judgment imposed on the conspiracy conviction. Appellant also immediately petitioned this Court for Supersedeas and Allowance of Bail pending appeal. Then-new District Attorney of Berks County Morrissey \u201cconsented\u201d to the petition filed with this Court. On July 15, two members of this Court entered an order reinstating bail in the amount of $250,00 \u201cpending the appeal in this Court.\u201d On July 21, 1977, the Superior Court certified appellant\u2019s appeal from the judgment on the conspiracy conviction to this Court.\nThis Court originally heard argument on these appeals in May of 1979. Appellant claimed trial error, including improper venue, as well as prosecutorial misconduct on the part of previous District Attorney VanHoove and his staff requiring discharge. Then-District Attorney Morrissey not only agreed with appellant that a new trial should be granted but also agreed that the previous district attorney\u2019s conduct requires discharge. After argument, at the request of President Judge Eshelman of Berks County, Attorney General Biester reviewed the matter and determined the Attorney General should supersede District Attorney Morrissey to ensure the interests of the Commonwealth are adequately protected. In June of 1979, District Attorney Morrissey petitioned this Court for review of the Attorney General\u2019s supersession. The Attorney General was granted a stay of consideration. Also granted were the District Attorney\u2019s request for a rule to show cause and the Attorney General\u2019s request for oral argument. This Court heard argument on supersession in September of 1979. At argument, the Attorney General agreed to an order vacating supersession but permitting the Attorney General leave to file an amicus brief and orally to argue on the Commonwealth\u2019s behalf. This Court then heard reargument on the entire matter in December of 1979. Appellant maintained his previous position, as did District Attorney Morrissey. The Attorney General, as amicus, urges there is neither trial error nor prosecutorial misconduct requiring discharge and thus contends that judgments of sentence should be affirmed.\n.

The April 28 Eagle carried a story \u201cPress in Closed Hearing\u201d which recited the preliminary order of the court permitting media representatives to remain during the hearings but not permitting the media to publish testimony and evidence until further order of the court. Venue Exh. 18 at 646. See supra note 3. The next day, the April 29 Times carried a front-page story that \u201cPress will fight secrecy \u2014 Appeal planned in Cohen case ruling.\u201d Venue Exh. 18 at 648. That evening\u2019s Eagle, however, carried a story \u201cCohen Action Opened,\u201d reporting both the court\u2019s reversal of its previous order not permitting publication until further order of court and the testimony presented at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify. Id. at 647.\n. Venue Exh. 18 at 647.\n. In Pierce, this Court relied upon sections 1.1 and 2.1 of the ABA Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free Press (Approved Draft, 1968), which recommend restrictions on disclosures by prosecuting attorneys and law enforcement officers, to set down the following rule:\n\u201c[I]n this Commonwealth policemen and members of the staffs of the office of District Attorneys shall not release to the news media; (a) the existence or contents of any statement or confession given by the accused, or his refusal to give a statement or to take tests; (b) prior criminal records of the accused, including arrests and convictions; (c) any inflammatory statements as to the merits of the case, or the character of the accused; (d) the possibility of a plea of guilty; (e) nor shall the authorities deliberately pose the accused for photographs which connect him with the scene of the crime.\u201d\nPierce, 451 Pa. at 200, 303 A.2d at 215. Although nothing would indicate that District Attorney VanHoove\u2019s \u201cpull the switch\u201d remark concerning the merits was directly released to the news media, still it must be obvious that, by this tactic, the District Attorney accomplished by indirection what Pierce directly proscribes.\n.

Dr. Buckhout asked persons polled to rate their belief of appellant\u2019s guilt on a scale of \u201czero\u201d to \u201cten.\u201d One hundred forty-three ascribed more than \u201czero\u201d guilt. One hundred thirty-eight of the 143, or 55% of all persons interviewed, ascribed to appellant guilt of \u201cfive\u201d or greater.\n. The trial court here in no respect questioned the basic results of the surveys relied upon in text. Instead, the trial court merely questioned Dr. Schulman\u2019s estimation based upon the results of the survey that as many as 75% to 80% of Berks County residents prejudged appellant guilty. (Nowhere in its opinion does the trial court in any respect dispute either the evidence or conclusions of Dr. Buckhout.)\n. An additional five persons were stricken for cause on other grounds of prejudgment. One was prejudiced when told appellant could obtain release on $250,000 bail, two when told a \u201ccontract killing\u201d is involved, and two when told appellant is Jewish. Opinion of Edenharter, J., Sur Motion for New Trial and in Arrest of Judgment, at 15 n.13.\nWe note that the pre-trial publicity also affected the jury selected. It required substantial periods of sequestration. The first three jurors, sequestered immediately upon selection, were sequestered a total of 25 days. Twelve of the fourteen jurors and alternates admitted that to some extent they had read about appellant\u2019s case. One of the selected jurors admitted that he had formed an opinion. Despite the fact that a majority of prospective jurors admitted they had fixed opinions which could not be set aside, this juror claimed he could set his opinion aside. Voir Dire Trans, at 584. A second juror, selected September 9 and sequestered the full total of twenty-five days, is a self-employed plumber who admitted that service on the jury would pose a \u201cgreat financial loss\u201d which would affect his judgment. Voir Dire Trans, at 104. A third juror stated he was familiar with the case by way of discussions among prospective jurors. Voir Dire Trans, at 1107.\n. Because we conclude that a new trial is necessary, we have no occasion to address any of appellant\u2019s following claims: (a) that the trial court should have continued the date of trial from September 8; (b) that prosecutorial misconduct requires a new trial; (c) that the court improperly failed to provide appellant pre-trial statements of Commonwealth witnesses.",

        "text": "NIX, Justice,\nconcurring and dissenting.\nI am in substantial agreement with the reasoning of the majority in reaching the conclusion that appellant was not entitled to be discharged and that further prosecution for these offenses should not be barred. I also share the position that the prevailing climate in Berks County at the time of appellant\u2019s trial precluded the possibility that he could receive a trial by an impartial jury. To remedy this error a new trial must be granted. But the decision of the majority, at this time, to also provide for a retrial outside of Berks County is totally unwarranted.\nThe trial in this case occurred between September 22 and October 3, 1975. To conclude that the climate remains unchanged today, without the least support for such a judgment, cannot be supported. The appropriate resolution would permit the Berks County court to determine, at least in the first instance, whether at this time appellant could be given a fair trial within that county. I, therefore, dissent to that portion of the mandate of this Court directing a change of venue sua sponte.\n. The record before us contains only information concerning the climate prevailing in Berks Comity in 1975. Five years have passed since the trial and without any information concerning the climate today, the majority is ordering a change of venue. Perhaps the climate in 1980 is the same as in 1975, or it is possible that the citizenry\u2019s prejudices may be rekindled by a retrial of the appellant. Nonetheless, we have consistently held that \u201cit is blackletter law an appellate court cannot consider anything which is not part of the record in the case,\u201d Saint John the Baptist Greek Catholic Church v. Musko, 448 Pa. 132, 162, 291 A.2d 89 (1972), and \u201c[ojnly the facts that appear in this record may be considered by the appellate court.\u201d Commonwealth v.
