        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a Commonwealth appeal from a \u201cMemorandum Opinion Sur Exceptions to Adjudication\u201d of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, dated May 19, 1978. In the memorandum opinion, the orphans\u2019 court dismissed Commonwealth exceptions to that portion of the court\u2019s supplemental adjudication of February 1, 1978 approving appellee estate\u2019s state inheritance tax deductions of some $50,000. The orphans\u2019 court dismissed the exceptions on the ground that the Commonwealth, contrary to local orphans\u2019 court rules, failed to submit written objections to appellee\u2019s claimed tax deductions.\nThe Commonwealth maintains that the orphans\u2019 court erred in requiring written objections. According to the Commonwealth, appellee\u2019s request for the challenged deductions was contained in a \u201cPetition for Adjudication.\u201d Under the Commonwealth\u2019s reading of Montgomery County Orphans\u2019 Court Rules, particularly Rule 6.10D(d), objection to such a petition need not be made in writing, but may be made orally at the time of audit. Montgomery County Orphans\u2019 Court Local Rule 6.10D(d) provides:\n\u201cObjections. Objections to the petition for adjudication may be made orally at the time for audit.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth contends here, as it contended in its exceptions to the supplemental adjudication, that timely oral objection as called for by Rule 6.10D(d) was made.\nReview of this record makes clear the Commonwealth is correct that appellee sought approval of the claimed inheritance tax deductions by way of a petition for adjudication. So too, it is clear that the Commonwealth has correctly interpreted- local rule. Ordinarily \u201c[t]he interpretation of rules of court is for the court which enunciates them. . . \u201d Dellacasse v. Floyd, 332 Pa. 218, 224, 2 A.2d 860, 863 (1938). Accord e. g., Milton Bank & Safe Deposit Co. v. Beachel, 174 Pa.Super. 276, 101 A.2d 142 (1953). See also Clark Estate, 488 Pa. 1, 410 A.2d 796 (1980). This policy of deference, however, has no place where, as here, the plain wording of a local orphans\u2019 court rule is contrary to the court\u2019s interpretation.\n\u201cThe rules adopted by the Supreme Court regulating the practice and procedure of the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this Commonwealth, and the rules adopted by such courts, shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable. The court at every stage of any action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties in interest.\u201d\nSup.Ct.Orph.Ct. Rule 2.1.\nThis matter therefore must be remanded for appropriate consideration of the Commonwealth\u2019s exceptions. Should it be determined that the Commonwealth did indeed make timely oral objection to the claimed deductions the court shall afford proper relief from the supplemental adjudication.\nDecree vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party to pay own costs.",
