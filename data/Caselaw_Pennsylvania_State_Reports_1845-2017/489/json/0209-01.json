        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant Richard W. Stockard was convicted in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas of five counts of violating Section 3927 of the 1972 Crimes Code (\u201cTheft by failure to make required disposition of funds received\u201d) and five counts of violating Section l-^Ol(b) of the Pennsylvania Securities Act of 1972. (\u201cFraudulent and Prohibited Practices\u201d \u2014 \u201cSales and Purchases\u201d). Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to ten terms (one for each count) of imprisonment for not less than two and one half years nor more than five years. All of the terms were concurrent except for the first two, which were consecutive. Additionally, appellant was required to pay the costs of prosecution and to make restitution to the victims of his crimes. The Superior Court, 266 Pa.Super. -, 405 A.2d 574, affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and we granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for violating Section 3927 of the 1972 Crimes Code. Section 3927(a) provides:\nA person who obtains property upon agreement, or subject to a known legal obligation, to make specified payments or other disposition, whether from such property or its proceeds or from his own property to be reserved in equivalent amount, is guilty of theft if he intentionally deals with the property obtained as his own and fails to make the required payment or disposition. The foregoing applies notwithstanding that it may be impossible to identify particular property as belonging to the victim at the time of the failure of the actor to make the required payment or disposition.\n\u201cTo evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, accept as true all the evidence and all reasonable inferences upon which, if believed, the jury could properly have based its verdict, and determine whether such evidence and inferences are sufficient in law to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. The fact finder is free to believe all, part or none of the evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Tate, 485 Pa. 180, 182, 401 A.2d 353, 354 (1979).\nViewed under this standard, the record establishes that in or about June 1973, appellant formed a corporation entitled \u201cErich\u2019s Famous Recipe Fried Chicken, Inc.\u201d (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe corporation\u201d). At the time of the incorporation, appellant already owned various restaurants. He also personally owed $50,000 to Investor\u2019s Security Leasing (ISL).\nBetween September and November, 1973, appellant sold a total of $24,530 in corporate stock to five investors. As the investors were making these payments, appellant was diverting a total of $20,000 of the corporation\u2019s funds to ISL to repay his aforementioned personal loan. Appellant\u2019s diversion of corporate funds occurred in the following manner: 1) Between September 6 and 19,1973, three investors paid a total of $12,500 to the corporation for stock; appellant deposited these funds in the corporate bank account and on September 24, 1973, appellant paid $10,000 of corporate funds to ISL;\n2) On October 11, 1973, a fourth investor paid $7,005 to the corporation stock; appellant deposited these funds in the corporate bank account and on October 15, 1973, appellant paid $5,000 of corporate funds to ISL; and\n3) On November 9, 1973, a fifth investor paid $5,025 to the corporation for stock; appellant deposited these funds in the corporate bank account and on November 13, 1973, appellant paid $5,000 of corporate funds to ISL.\nSince the record clearly establishes that appellant, after obtaining a total of $24,530 from five investors for use in the furtherance of corporate purposes, diverted $20,000 of corporate fund to repay his own personal obligations, there is sufficient evidence to support his convictions for violating section 3927.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions for violating Section l-401(b) of the Pennsylvania Securities Act. Section l-401(b) provides:\nIt is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of any security in this State, directly or indirectly:\n(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.\nAt trial, each of the five investors testified that when appellant sold stock to each of them, appellant stated that the funds received from the sale of the stock would be used to expand the corporation, and, specifically, to open a restaurant in Etna, Pennsylvania. The investors testified that appellant did not inform the investors that he personally owed $50,000 to ISL and that a portion of the funds received from the sale of corporate stock would be used to repay his personal loan from ISL. Appellant, in selling the stock to the five investors and in not informing them of his intention to pay a personal creditor with the proceeds from the sales, \u201comit[ted] to state . . . material fact[s]\u201d which were \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to make his statements regarding the corporation \u201cnot misleading\u201d, and therefore, there is sufficient evidence to support his convictions for violating Section l-401(b) of the Pennsylvania Securities Act.\nAppellant\u2019s third contention is that the trial court erred in permitting Commonwealth witness William C. McCotter, a Pennsylvania Securities Commission examiner, \u201cto make [a] finding of fact on the ultimate issue\u201d during his testimony. At trial, McCotter testified as follows:\nQ. [PROSECUTOR]: All right. Now, if in fact there was a fifty thousand dollar debt to ISL that was owed by the corporation, would the victims\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would have to object. He is going to ask him an opinion question.\nTHE COURT: You\u2019re overruled. Proceed.\nQ. [PROSECUTOR]: If in fact a fifty thousand dollar loan was owed to ISL Corporation by the Fried Chicken Corporation, would the investors have to ask the defendant to disclose this information?\nA. [McCOTTER]: He would have a duty under the act, 1972 Pennsylvania Securities Act, to disclose\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor\u2014\nTHE COURT: You put your objection on, I\u2019m overruling it.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He is attempting to interpret the rule of the Commonwealth.\nTHE COURT: No, he is not interpreting. That\u2019s the law. Q. [PROSECUTOR]: Do you have a copy of that law with you?\nA. Yes, sir.\nQ. What specific sections are you referring to?\nA. It\u2019s part 4 of the 1972 Securities Act, Fraudulent and Prohibited Practices, Section 1-401, Sales and Purchases. \u201cIt is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of any security in this State, directly or indirectly: (a) To employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would have to object to him reading of the sections to\u2014\nTHE COURT: I find it very helpful. You may proceed.\nA. \u2014fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s claim is without merit; witness McCotter expressed no opinion on the ultimate issues in this case but rather recited the applicable sections of the Pennsylvania Securities Act.\nAppellant\u2019s fourth contention is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the criminal complaint with respect to the Section 3927 violations, arguing that the statute of limitations had expired prior to the time that the prosecution of the Section 3927 violations had commenced.\nThe statute of limitations for commencing prosecution of Section 3927 violations is two years. See 18 Pa.C.S.A. 108(b)(2) (1973). Additionally, Section 108(f)(1) of the 1972 Crimes Code (\u201cTolling of statute\u201d) provided:\nThe period of limitation does not run: (1) during the time when the accused is continuously absent from this Commonwealth or has no reasonably ascertainable place of abode or work within this Commonwealth. 18 Pa.C. S.A. 108(f) (1973) (emphasis provided).\nOn January 6,1977, a pre-trial hearing was held to adjudicate appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. (The sole purpose of this hearing was to adjudicate the statute of limitations issue.) At this hearing, William C. McCotter, a Pennsylvania Securities Commission examiner and an investigator in the instant case, testified that after conducting \u201ca very thorough search\u201d for appellant, he (McCotter) concluded that appellant \u201chad no legal residence or office to our knowledge in the state of Pennsylvania\u201d since 1974. Because appellant no longer had a \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d residence or office in Pennsylvania since (at the latest) the end of 1974, the statute of limitations was tolled (at the latest) at the end of 1974. Since the tolling of the statute of limitations occurred less than two years after appellant\u2019s Section 3927 violations took place, the statute of limitations was not violated and therefore, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint.\nAppellant\u2019s last contention is that the Commonwealth erred in failing to allege in the indictment that it would seek to toll the statute of limitations under Section 108(f)(1). To support this proposition, appellant cites Commonwealth v. Bender, 251 Pa.Super. 454, 459, 380 A.2d 868, 870 (1977) (allocatur refused) wherein the Superior Court held that \u201c[w]here the Commonwealth seeks to toll the statute of limitations by establishing one of the enumerated exceptions, it must allege the exception in the indictment. The purpose of this rule is \u2018to apprise the defendant that he must defend not only against the crime itself but also against the limitation of prosecution.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted).\nThe fact that the Commonwealth did not allege in the indictment that it would seek to toll the statute of limitations is of no consequence because there was no prejudice to the appellant. The Commonwealth did inform appellant of the tolling of the statute of limitations when the Commonwealth filed its answer to appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint. Approximately six weeks after the Commonwealth filed the aforementioned answer to appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, appellant had an opportunity to fully contest the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation (that the statute of limitations had tolled) at the January 6, 1977 pre-trial hearing (which was scheduled specifically to adjudicate appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss). As long as a defendant, some reasonable time before trial, is appraised that the Commonwealth will seek to toll the statute of limitations, the due process requirements of notice are satisfied.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a concurring opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J., joined.\nROBERTS and NIX, JJ., concur in the result.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. 3927 (1973).\n. Act of December 5, 1972, P.L. 1280, No. 284, \u00a7 401, 70 P.S. l-401(b) (1979-80 Supp.).\n. The fourth investor also paid another $3,000 to the corporation for stock; rather than depositing these funds in a corporate bank account, appellant deposited said funds in a private (non-corporate) account.\n. Appellant testified that the corporation owed him at least $85,000 for equipment and fixtures that he owned but which were being used by the corporation; appellant argues that by diverting $20,000 from the corporation to ISL (to repay his personal obligation to ISL) he was, in effect, being repaid by the corporation for the \u201cfunds\u201d which he earlier loaned the corporation. Obviously, the jury did not believe this.\n. Appellant does not contend in this appeal that the statute of limitations had expired prior to the time that the prosecution of the Pennsylvania Securities Act violations [Section l-401(b)] had commenced.\n. Section 108(b)(2) was repealed effective June 27, 1978. See, 42 Pa.C.S.A. 5552 (1979 Pamphlet).\n. Section 108(f)(1) was repealed effective June 27, 1978. See, 42 Pa.C.S.A. 5554 (1979 Pamphlet).\n. McCotter\u2019s testimony at the January 6, 1977 pre-trial hearing was corroborated by appellant\u2019s testimony at trial. At trial, appellant testified (on January 13, 1977) that for the previous \u201ctwo and a half years\u201d (July, 1974 to January, 1977), he was a resident of Ohio.\n. Appellant also contends that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instructions were so prejudicial to . . . [him] that they effectively deprived him of his right to a fair trial by a jury.\u201d This issue was not raised at trial nor in post-verdict motions and therefore, is waived.",
