        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant, George Arms, was convicted by a jury of murder of the third degree and sentenced for his alleged involvement in the shooting death of Steven Warunek, a sixteen year-old Reading youth. On this appeal, appellant seeks a new trial on the ground that the Commonwealth introduced testimony coerced from Commonwealth witnesses by a previous District Attorney of Berks County. We affirm.\nLike Commonwealth v. Cohen, 489 Pa. 167, 413 A.2d 1066 (1980), this case arises from the criminal episode in which Cohen allegedly hired appellant and Anthony Reynolds to kill Warunek. According to the Commonwealth, Arms fatally shot the victim with a rifle in Reading\u2019s Egelman Park.\nUnlike Cohen, however, appellant was tried in Schuylkill County, rather than in Berks, because in appellant\u2019s case the trial court ruled that \u201cmassive publicity\u201d prevented appellant from obtaining a fair and impartial trial in Berks County. Also unlike Cohen, trial took place in September, 1976, one year after the Cohen trial, due to a postponement while appellant was incompetent to stand trial. As a result, the Commonwealth\u2019s case at appellant\u2019s trial was presented by the staff of District Attorney J. Michael Morrissey, not by the staff of his predecessor District Attorney Robert VanHoove, which presented the Commonwealth\u2019s case at the Cohen trial.\nAt appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony designed to establish the time and cause of death and lay testimony of Kerry Young, girlfriend of the victim and former girlfriend of Cohen, who testified to statements Cohen made to her concerning the victim. Also presented by the Commonwealth were Jack Geisler, Anthony Reynolds, and Richard Wamsher. Geisler, also charged in the killing, had pleaded guilty and had been convicted and sentenced as of appellant\u2019s trial. He testified that he was present when Arms accepted Cohen\u2019s offer of $700 cash and also present when Arms shot the victim. Reynolds was similarly charged, convicted and sentenced. He testified that appellant accepted Cohen\u2019s offer. He further heard shots at the scene of the killing and, after hearing the shots, saw the victim crawling on the ground. Wamsher, not charged, who acted as a depository for the $700 cash until the killing occurred, confirmed appellant\u2019s acceptance of Cohen\u2019s offer.\nIt is the testimony of Geisler, Reynolds, and Wamsher which appellant now claims was coerced. In making this claim, appellant relies heavily upon the testimony of Reading Police Officer John Halstead. Halstead testified that, in pre-trial investigation and interrogation of these prosecution witnesses, previous District Attorney VanHoove regularly alluded to and reminded the witnesses of the electric chair and the smell of burning flesh. According to this police testimony, Geisler cried as a result of the District Attorney\u2019s frequent references to the electric chair and burning flesh. Appellant further points to the previous District Attorney\u2019s successful efforts to obtain for Geisler a pre-trial release on his own recognizance. Also cited is the failure of the Commonwealth to charge Geisler. with perjury even though Geisler admitted that he lied in preliminary hearings in the case.. Appellant now claims in light of this police testimony and the other allegations that \u201cthe admitted coercion of the witnesses so tainted their testimony as to deprive him of a fair trial.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s present contention, however, does not attack any ruling of the trial court on the admissibility of the challenged Commonwealth witnesses\u2019 testimony. At no time during trial did appellant interpose his present objection. Nor does appellant cite any ruling of the trial court restricting the defense\u2019s cross-examination of the challenged witnesses. And it is not claimed that the trial court in any way limited presentation of testimony concerning the alleged coercion. Indeed, the record reveals that the trial court afforded appellant full opportunity to subject the Commonwealth witnesses to thorough cross-examination on the alleged coercion and to introduce his own testimony concerning the alleged threats. So too, appellant takes no objection to the charge of the trial court on this matter. Here, the court instructed the jury that, because the testimony of accomplices comes from a \u201cpolluted source,\u201d it is the jury\u2019s duty to view that testimony with caution. See Commonwealth v. Russell, 477 Pa. 147, 383 A.2d 866 (1978).\nAppellant\u2019s claim, in reality, questions only the jury\u2019s apparent refusal to disbelieve all of the testimony he now disputes. But it is not this Court\u2019s function to disturb the jury\u2019s factual determination. \u201cIt is a basic tenet of our system of jurisprudence that issues of credibility are properly left to the trier of fact for resolution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Whack, 482 Pa. 137, 140, 393 A.2d 417, 419 (1978). In exercising this prerogative, \u201c[t]he fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 268, 344 A.2d 824, 826 (1975). Thus we are satisfied that no basis exists for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict. Appellant\u2019s claim must be rejected. Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n. In Cohen, we hold that, in view of the widespread dissemination of prejudicial material at the time of trial, the trial court abused its discretion in denying Cohen a change of venue.\n. In April of 1975, the trial court ruled appellant incompetent to stand trial. After additional psychiatric evaluation, appellant was found competent in December of 1975. No question of appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial is presented on this appeal.\n. Previous District Attorney VanHoove was replaced by District Attorney Morrissey in January, 1976. We note that, unlike in Cohen, District Attorney Morrissey does not agree with the appellant that relief must be granted. Also unlike in Cohen, the Attorney General has taken no position in this case.\n. We have reviewed appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Our review satisfies us that the record amply supports the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. We have also reviewed the other following contentions: (1) that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth on rebuttal to introduce testimony that a non-testifying expert pathologist confirmed the Commonwealth\u2019s testifying expert pathologist\u2019s theory on the time of death; (2) that the trial court improperly permitted the Commonwealth to call appellant\u2019s ballistics expert to confirm that the non-testifying pathologist is an expert; (3) that the trial court denied appellant equal protection and due process in its order permitting appellant\u2019s appointed counsel to avail themselves of the services of a pathologist; (4) that the trial court erred in refusing to permit appellant to show there were outstanding warrants for Warunek\u2019s arrest; (5) that the trial court erred in permitting Commonwealth testimony that a lead fragment was found on the floor of the morgue where the autopsy on the victim\u2019s body was performed; (6) that the trial court permitted hearsay testimony of Kerry Young; (7) that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to rehabilitate Jack Geisler by way of prior consistent statements; and (8) that the trial court improperly refused to permit appellant to introduce police records indicating that three defense witnesses told police the victim was alive after the alleged date of death. We conclude that all of these claims of error are unsupported by the record and thus lack merit.",
