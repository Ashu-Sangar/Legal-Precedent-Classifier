Following the denial of post-trial motions, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five to fifteen years. This direct appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s sole contention is that two statements given by him to police should have been suppressed, and thus not introduced at his trial, because at the time the statements were given, appellant was in such poor condition mentally and physically as to render the statements involuntary.\nAfter careful consideration of the record and briefs, we have found this issue to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.",
