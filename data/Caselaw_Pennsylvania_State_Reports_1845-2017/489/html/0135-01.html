At the time of his death, the corpus consisted of an interest in commercial real estate and a portfolio of marketable securities valued at approximately three million dollars. Pursuant to a provision in the will,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Letters Testamentary were issued to the Fidelity Bank and Leo Niessen, Jr. (son of the testator) as co-executors. In March 1975, executors offered their First Account for audit to the Orphans’ Court. Four beneficiaries, alleging breach of fiduciary duty in the handling of the securities by co-executor Fidelity Bank, filed objections to the account seeking surcharge. Prior to an evidentiary hearing, two objectors withdrew their claims. On January 6, 1978, based upon the information obtained at the hearing, the Orphans’ Court dismissed the objections and affirmed the accounting. The exceptions that were subsequently filed were also dismissed and this appeal then taken. After the present appeal was lodged, but before our consideration, one of the remaining two objectors withdrew, leaving John A. Meyer, Jr. as the sole appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>Appellant contends that the Fidelity Bank failed to exercise the care required of it as a corporate fiduciary in its management of the securities portion of the trust corpus. More specifically, it is asserted, Fidelity’s retention of the entire portfolio in substantially similar condition during the entire five year period encompassed in the accounting, constitutes a breach of the fiduciary’s standard of care, in that Fidelity did not “manage” the portfolio but merely performed a custodial function. For support, reference is made to five specific blocks of stock in the portfolio: Rohm and Haas Co.; Germantown Insurance Co.; Fidelcor, Inc.; certain “volatile stocks” (A.M.F., ARCO, Pennzoil and Hershey) and several utilities. Had these securities been handled differently, appellant claims, larger profits would have been obtained by the trust. Appellant correspondingly asserts the lower court’s conclusion that the corporate fiduciary did not breach its duty of care is unsupported by the evidence.</p>
