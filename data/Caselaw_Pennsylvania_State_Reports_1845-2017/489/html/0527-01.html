Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven and one-half to sixteen years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On appeal to the Superior Court from the judgment of sentence, appellant alleged that his guilty plea to the charge of robbery was not knowingly and intelligently entered because counsel was ineffective in failing to inform appellant that intoxication could negate an element of the robbery offense. The Superior Court remanded to allow appellant an opportunity to file a petition to withdraw his guilty plea and for a hearing thereon to determine “first whether counsel was aware of appellant’s intoxication and second whether counsel’s actions in light of knowledge of the intoxication had any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <em>Commonwealth v.

[M]y understanding of the law at that time was that intoxication, even if the consumption of the alcohol rose to the level of intoxication, my understanding of the law was that it was not available as a defense in this type of proceeding at that time.

What I did advise him was: He asked, he informed me that he was, that he didn’t recall what had happened.
