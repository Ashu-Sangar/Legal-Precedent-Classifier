For the reasons below, we affirm the decree of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

This order was issued pursuant to the Clean Streams Law, the Solid Waste Management Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and § 1917 — A of <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the Administrative Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It was made necessary by the continual generation of leachate from the landfill and its <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>discharge into a tributary with the Clean Streams Law and its attendant rules and regulations. Appellant failed to appeal this order and failed to comply with its directives. Consequently the DER issued a second order, dated March 24, 1977, directing the closure of the landfill. The DER is given authority to issue orders to abate such nuisances by § 1917-A of the Administrative Code. Orders issued by the DER do not become final until the party adversely affected has been given the opportunity to appeal to the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB). Administrative Code § 1921-A.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> While the August 16, 1976 order was never appealed <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>and thus became final, the 1977 order was appealed to the EHB which affirmed the order. Without enforcement power of its own, the DER then filed an equity action invoking the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> requesting an injunction to abate the nuisance. Appellants filed an independent appeal of the EHB determination to the Commonwealth Court per 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 763,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> subsequent to the filing of the equity action by the DER. The Commonwealth Court chose to dispose of the original equity action first, and granted the relief sought by the DER. (filed September 22, 1978). Although the Commonwealth <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>Court later affirmed the order of the EHB closing the landfill, 46 Pa.Cmwlth. 416, <a href="/citations/?q=406%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="406 A.2d 587">406 A.2d 587</a> (1979), the cause currently before our Court is the appeal of the preliminary injunction issued by the Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The policy of bringing “each pending matter to a final conclusion as promptly as possible” as is evidenced by Pa.R.J.A.

There appear only two possible ways for the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction to have been postponed: (1) if a petition for a stay of the equity action pending the appeal of the EHB adjudication had been filed by the appellant; or (2) if the filing of the appeal is deemed an automatic stay of the equity action.</p>

Such a conclusion would leave the courts powerless to enforce the order — even where it is highly unlikely that the order will be modified and where continued pollution in violation of the order presents a serious danger to the public. In effect, the mere application for an extension would operate as a stay; an applicant could continue to pollute for the period required to appeal to the EHB and the <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>courts.
