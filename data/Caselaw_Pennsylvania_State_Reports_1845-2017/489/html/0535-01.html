    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[283,435,1154,580]]]'>This is a Commonwealth appeal from a “Memorandum Opinion Sur Exceptions to Adjudication” of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Orphans’ Court Division, dated May 19, 1978. In the memorandum opinion, the orphans’ court dismissed Commonwealth exceptions to that portion of the court’s supplemental adjudication of February 1, 1978 approving appellee estate’s state inheritance tax deductions of some $50,000. The orphans’ court dismissed the exceptions on the ground that the Commonwealth, contrary to local orphans’ court rules, failed to submit written objections to appellee’s claimed tax deductions.</p>
    <p id="b582-5" data-blocks='[["BL_582.6",582,[282,1035,1154,474]]]'>The Commonwealth maintains that the orphans’ court erred in requiring written objections. According to the Commonwealth, appellee’s request for the challenged deductions was contained in a “Petition for Adjudication.” Under the Commonwealth’s reading of Montgomery County Orphans’ Court Rules, particularly Rule 6.10D(d), objection to such a petition need not be made in writing, but may be made orally at the time of audit. Montgomery County Orphans’ Court Local Rule 6.10D(d) provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.7",582,[324,1522,1110,98]]]'>
      <em>“Objections. </em>Objections to the petition for adjudication may be made orally at the time for audit.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b582-7" data-blocks='[["BL_582.8",582,[282,1639,1151,150]]]'>The Commonwealth contends here, as it contended in its exceptions to the supplemental adjudication, that timely oral objection as called for by Rule 6.10D(d) was made.</p>

So too, it is clear that the Commonwealth has correctly interpreted- local rule.
