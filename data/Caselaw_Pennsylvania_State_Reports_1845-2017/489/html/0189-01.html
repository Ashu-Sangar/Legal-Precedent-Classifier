Appellant concedes this point in his brief at p. 20: “In both <em>Polimeni </em>and <em>Garcia </em>all of the Court appear to be agreed that they are not changing the law. The position of the Court is that the legislature changed the law and they are interpreting the new law.”</p>

Indeed, appellant’s request at trial for an involuntary manslaughter instruction reflects his conclusion that correct statutory construction of the 1972 Crimes Code would require such instruction. Nevertheless, he failed to appeal the denial of his trial request. In his brief, appellant belatedly contends that tried counsel’s failure to pursue the issue on appeal may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. That contention, not having been raised below, will not be considered here. <em>Commonwealth v.

Because of our finding of waiver, we need not reach the other issues asserted by appellant: (1) whether the trial court’s refusal to charge on involuntary manslaughter is an issue of constitutional dimension, the existence of which is a prerequisite for collateral review. See <em>Commonwealth v. Rightnour, </em><a href="/pa/469/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="469 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1722131" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0107-01">469 Pa. 107</a>, 111, <a href="/pa/469/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="469 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1722131" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0107-01">364 A.2d 927</a>, 928 (1976) (plurality); (2) whether the trial court correctly concluded that our plurality decisions in <em>Polimeni </em>and its progeny are to be applied only prospectively;- (3) whether the plurality holdings in those cases reflect the view of a majority of this Court.</p>
