Until September of 1973, the District followed a practice of granting a leave of absence to teachers for attending Association conferences and meetings. The leave was without salary and the District employed a substitute teacher for the days involved. In September of 1973 the District, through its acting superintendent, and the Association entered into and implemented an oral modification of this practice. It was agreed that no deductions would be taken from the salary of the teacher granted leave for attending the Association conferences, but that the Association would reimburse the District for the wages paid to the substitute teacher replacing the teacher on leave. This arrangement remained in effect during the school year 1973-1974, and in 1974 the District, unilaterally, modified the agreed arrangement, returning to the prior practice.</p>

The meaning of “past practice” has been described as follows: “A custom or practice is not something which arises simply because a given course of conduct has been pursued by Management or the employees on one or more occasions. A custom or a practice is a usage evolved by men as a normal reaction to a recurring type situation. It must be shown to be the <em>accepted </em>course of conduct characteristically repeated in response to the given set of underlying circumstances. This is not to say that the course of conduct must be <em>accepted </em>in the sense of both parties having agreed to it, but rather that it must be <em>accepted </em>in the sense of being regarded by the men involved as the <em>normal </em>and <em>proper </em>response to the underlying circumstances presented.” Sylvester Garrett, Chairman, Board of Arbitration, U.S. Steel — Steelworkers, Grievance No. NL-453, Docket No. N-146, January 31, 1953.
