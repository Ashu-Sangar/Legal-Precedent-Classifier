    <p id="b562-10" data-blocks='[["BL_562.10",562,[259,1296,1154,355]]]'>Appellant, James Robert Katona, appeals from the Order of the Superior Court affirming per curiam the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County. Appellant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to ascertain the existence of witnesses and to subpoena those witnesses and for failing to request a change of venue.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The vehicle owned by appellant came to a stop after it had run into a parked car. Trooper Paulshock of the Pennsylvania State Police pulled his vehicle directly <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>behind appellant’s vehicle and scribbled the license number. Trooper Paulshock alighted <em>from </em>his vehicle and approached the vehicle owned by the appellant; whereupon the driver of appellant’s vehicle backed his vehicle into the police car twice and drove away. Trooper Paulshock testified that when he was about two feet from the door of appellant’s vehicle he saw the profile of appellant illuminated by the high beams from the state police vehicle and a street lamp about twenty feet away. Based on this view, Trooper Paulshock later identified appellant at appellant’s home.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[245,842,1145,193]]]'>The thrust of appellant’s argument at trial was that the identifying officer’s ability to identify the driver was not sufficient to establish that appellant was the driver of the vehicle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b563-6" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[245,1061,1146,622]]]'>Appellant apparently alleges that, during April 1976, appellant and his attorney met with Mr. James Walker,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> who had information (a) that Trooper Paulshock’s identification of appellant was based on a photographic display at the State Police Barracks and (b) that there were eye witnesses to the incident who “didn’t want to get involved.” The record shows that there were two disinterested eye witnesses who, arguably, could testify that the state policeman never went beyond the rear bumper of appellant’s car before it pulled away, and that it was too dark for the policeman to have clearly observed the driver. Apparently, no witnesses were subpoenaed to testify on behalf of appellant.</p>

In such circumstances, counsel’s conduct would not constitute ineffectiveness. (Citations omitted).

In a case where virtually the only issue is the credibility of the Commonwealth’s witness versus that of the defendant, failure to explore all alternatives available to assure that the jury heard the testimony of a known witness who might be capable of casting a shadow upon the Commonwealth’s witness’s truthfulness is ineffective assistance of counsel.
