In the instant case, the words “estate” and “beneficiary” coupled with the fact that the decedent was divesting himself of all of his worldly goods would clearly suggest a testamentary gift. However, the Chancellor properly notes that “the glaring omission is that there is no reference to the disposition of decedent’s property to take effect at decedent’s death.” (Slip opinion pg. 15) A review of our cases in this area causes the “glow” to pale.</p>
