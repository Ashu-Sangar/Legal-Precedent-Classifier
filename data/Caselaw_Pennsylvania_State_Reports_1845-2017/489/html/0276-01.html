The executrix filed the requisite inheritance tax return, but failed to include as taxable the Schuylkill County property. On July 25, 1975, the Inheritance Tax Department of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appraised the value of the Schuylkill County property at $7,500.00. The Department determined that half of the property’s value, $3,750.00, was subject to a 15 percent inheritance tax. The executrix appealed the $562.50 inheritance tax to the Orphans’ Court. The court held that the estate was properly taxed since the 1959 <em>inter vivos </em>transfer was made without consideration and the transferor reserved for her life the possession and enjoyment of the property.
