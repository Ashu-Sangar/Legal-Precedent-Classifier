Appellant, eighteen year old Harold Mumma, claims he did not know his contact with the victim, Mark Belesfield, was offensive and did not know the victim was unaware that an indecent contact occurred. We conclude that sufficient evidence appears of record to sustain the conviction. Accordingly, we affirm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Timothy’s twelve-year old brother Mark answered the door and asked if he could help as well. Appellant agreed and the two boys accompanied appellant to his house. When they arrived appellant ran a short errand, then informed the boys that the possibility of rain precluded their painting the car. As an alternative, appellant invited the boys to join his “club.”</p>

They went upstairs to appellant’s room, the “club” office, where appellant gave Mark a card to complete. Mark signed the card and appellant placed it in a file box. Appellant indicated that there were other members of the “club” and that the “club’s” purpose was teaching math and other subjects to prisoners in the Lancaster prison.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[257,670,1156,1128]]]'>Appellant next told Mark that “club” rules required every applicant to undergo a physical “examination.” Appellant instructed Mark to undress and lie on the bed under a blanket. Next appellant asked Mark to stand and turn around, whereupon appellant “brushed” Mark’s genitals four or five times.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mark was also instructed to sit on the bed with the blanket covering his head and body. During this “examination,” appellant put his head under the blanket to view Mark’s nude body. After the “examination,” Mark dressed, went out on a balcony, and spoke with Timothy. While Timothy entered the house to join the “club,” appellant ushered Mark up to the attic for additional “testing.” In the attic another “club” officer, Ronny Moser, gave Mark written tests on mathematics and various other subjects.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Moser then told Mark to remove his trousers and stand a few feet away. Moser extinguished the room lights and illuminated Mark’s body with a flashlight. Again, Mark was told to turn around during the “examination.” While Moser was examining Mark, appellant subjected Timothy to the same induction procedure but without touching Timothy’s genitals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Finally, Mark indicated that the boys were expected at home. Moser told the boys that “if you come back, we will try to scrape up money for you out of the bank, if you remember the rules.” Moser also added, “if you disobey the rules, you have stand in the corner for five minutes and with your clothes off.” Neither Mark nor Timothy ever returned to appellant’s house to participate in “club” activities.</p>
    <p id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[226,949,1145,612]]]'>A few months later, appellant asked Mark if he “wanted to sign out of the club.” Mark indicated his willingness, but didn’t have time that day. Three or four days later, when driving past Mark on the street, appellant stopped his car and again asked whether Mark wished to sign out. At trial Mark stated that “[appellant] had a file in his hand and he said we have to give you another physical . . . .” Mark accompanied appellant to the house and again went to the “club” office. This time the physical was interrupted when appellant’s mother knocked on the door to inform Mark that a friend was waiting for him. Mark left and reported the incident to the police.</p>

      <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>Appellant devised the elaborate club membership charade as a justification for the contacts. The trappings of this charade included membership application cards and various written examinations. At one point appellant misrepresented the purpose of the “club” to the victim. Additionally, the initial inducement for the victim to come to appellant’s house was to paint a car, not for initiation into appellant’s “club.” From this evidence the jury could find that appellant attempted to camouflage his true purpose for inviting the victim to his bedroom. It was permissible for the jury to conclude that appellant’s knowledge of the necessity for disguising his true purpose was equivalent to knowing that the victim would, under less disguised circumstances, be offended by the contact.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[241,1058,1155,735]]]'>Likewise, the jury could conclude that, by way of the elaborate scheme, appellant deceived the victim, resulting in the victim’s lack of awareness that an indecent contact was committed. Appellant was several years older than the victim. He first induced the victim into his house by inviting membership in the “club.” Once in the house appellant suggested that the physical was an ordinary requirement of all candidates. He represented that several others had undergone this threshold examination. At the time appellant touched the victim’s genitals, the charade may have convinced Mark that this contact was merely another aspect of a prescreening of members by physical examination.

Here, however, testimony of both Mark and Timothy Belesfield as well as physical evidence was presented to the jury.

Both boys were asked to joint the “club,” both were subjected to the “physical”, albeit separately, and both were taken to the <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>attic where Ronny Moser visually inspected their nude bodies by spotlighting each child with a flashlight after darkening the room. Finally, each child reported that appellant filled out a card which they initialled. Police seized those initialled cards from appellant’s room.

The Commonwealth need not prove that the minor’s morals were actually corrupted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davison, </em><a href="/pa-super/243/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="243 Pa.

The American Law Institute rejected this absence of consent standard because it “seem[ed] too strict a standard of criminality, considering the frequency with which tentative sexual advances are made without explicit assurance of consent.” The provisions of section 3126(1) reflect this concern for possible prosecution of “[a]cts commonly expressive of familial or friendly affection” which are “as consistent with the overfamiliar friendship as with lust.” Comment, section 207.6, Tentative Draft No. 4 (1955).

To the contrary, all of the testimony pointed to his attempts to secure the consent of the victim to the acts. There were no threats or coercion; there was no force employed; the victim complied without protest or complaint. The Commonwealth’s evidence tended to negate rather than to establish the element of force. Instead of pointing to a willingness to act against the will of the victim, the evidence pointed to a belief on the part of the actor, either that he had so disguised the nature of the conduct that the victim was not aware of its offensiveness or that he had induced the victim to willingly participate. In either event, appellant evidenced no intent to act against the will of the victim.
