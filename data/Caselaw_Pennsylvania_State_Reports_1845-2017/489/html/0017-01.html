    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[256,503,1156,945]]]'>Appellant next argues that counsel should have objected to an allegedly improper charge on the degrees of homicide. Appellant claims that the court said that a killing is presumed to be second degree murder and also that the court did not give a proper definition of voluntary manslaughter. Reading the court’s charge, we find that it was proper. The judge defined murder generally as killing “with malice aforethought. . . .” He defined first degree murder as “willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.” He stated that if the Commonwealth established the requisite malice to prove murder, the murder was presumed to be of the second degree and the bürden was on the Commonwealth to raise it to first degree. The judge defined voluntary manslaughter as “the unlawful killing of another without malice [involving] ... a direct intention to kill and without hardness of heart or cruelty, or recklessness of consequences or a mind regardless of social duty. .</p>
    <blockquote id="b68-7" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[298,1462,1112,629]]]'>“Voluntary manslaughter is willful, but it is necessary that the surrounding circumstances take away every evidence of cruel depravity and wanton cruelty. Therefore, to reduce an intentional wound which results in death, to voluntary manslaughter, there must be either a sufficient cause for provocation or a state of rage or passion without time to cool and placing the accused beyond the control of his reason and suddenly compelling him to do the deed. The word ‘passion’ in the sense in which it is used here includes such things as anger or terror, provided such a degree of intensity is present as to obscure temporarily the reason of the person affected.</blockquote>

The court defined the crime as an assault “where one wounds any person or by any means causes any person bodily injury dangerous to life with intention to commit murder.” The instruction was correct and in conformity with the statutory definition of the crime. Criminal Code of June 24, 1939 P.L. 872, § 710, 18 P.S. § 4710.</p>
    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[236,958,1149,784]]]'>Appellant also alleges an improper instruction on reasonable doubt. Trial counsel did not raise the issue in post-verdict motions. The judge began by saying that the defendant was presumed to be innocent and that the Commonwealth bore a never-shifting burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He defined a reasonable doubt as one which “would cause a reasonably prudent [person] . to pause and to hesitate in a matter of the highest importance to himself or herself . . . [it] must be one that fairly strikes the conscientious mind and clouds the judgment. It is not . . . such a doubt as one might conjure up [to avoid] ... an unpleasant verdict . it is a doubt which is reasonable and which fairly arises out of the evidence.” The charge was correct. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cartagena, </em><a href="/pa/482/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="482 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1749677" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0006-01">482 Pa. 6</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="482 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1749677" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0006-01">393 A.2d 350</a> (1978).</p>

The court said “When police officers testify . . . you should consider them as fallible human beings, and therefore they may make mistakes. Their testimony, therefore, is not necessarily entitled to any greater or certainly to any lesser weight than the testimony of other witnesses merely because they are policemen and officers of the law.” The jury had no right to credit or discredit police officers’ testimony because they were police officers.

Appellant did not present any evidence on this point at the post-conviction hearing, nor are the slides part of the record before us. The record does show that the court held an <em>in camera </em>hearing and concluded that the slides were not inflammatory. The court noted that the decedent’s genitalia did not appear. Defense counsel admitted that there were no gruesome details. In <em>Commonwealth v. Batty, </em><a href="/pa/482/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="482 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1749594" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0173-01">482 Pa. 173</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="393 A.2d 435" data-case-ids="1749594,1749608,1749682" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0173-01,/pa/482/0172-01,/pa/482/0172-02">393 A.2d 435</a> (1978), we held that the trial court has discretion as to whether photographs of the decedent’s body may be admitted in a homicide case, that such photographs are not inflammatory <em>per se, </em>and that the court must determine whether they are inflammatory and if so, whether that fact is outweighed by their essential evidentiary value. The medical examiner who took the slides testified about them to illustrate his conclusion that decedent was shot twice in the back of her body, once in the neck and once in the buttocks. The path taken by bullets through a body may be relevant to show the manner of death and may show premeditation, and photographs of the body are relevant to illustrate that. <em>Commonwealth v.
