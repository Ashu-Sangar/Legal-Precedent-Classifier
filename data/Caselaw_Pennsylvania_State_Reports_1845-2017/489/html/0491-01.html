But the Commonwealth then took no objection to appellant’s presentation of this claim, and does not now. Indeed, the PCHA court decided appellant’s claim on the merits. There is no reason for this Court now sua sponte to raise what all interested parties have viewed as a non-prejudicial technical defect.
