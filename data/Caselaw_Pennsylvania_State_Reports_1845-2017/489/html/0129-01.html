A hearing was held and the petition was denied on October 11, 1977. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. <em>Commonwealth v.

After conferring with appellant, trial counsel informed the court that no decision had been made on whether said motions would be filed. The court informed appellant that he had seven days to make a decision. No motions having been filed, appellant appeared ten days later for sentencing. When counsel argued that his client had been erroneously convicted, the court again stated that appellant could still file post-verdict motions. Before sentence was imposed, appellant was given a chance to speak; while still professing his innocence, appellant, how<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>ever, made no mention of a desire to file post-verdict motions.</p>

Further, appellant alleged that until the time of sentencing, he had not realized that the motions had not been filed.

In its opinion in support of the order denying appellant’s requested relief, the court stated:</p>

Further, when given a chance to speak prior to sentencing, appellant made no mention that he desired to file said motions.

In his P.C.H.A. petition, appellant alleged, apart from the obstruction of his appellate rights, two claims of error. He claimed that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to file a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence and because counsel did not introduce a newspaper clipping that referred to another person known as “Candy Man” who had been arrested for selling drugs. The P.C.H.A. court found no merit in either contention. The court first held no suppression motion need be filed, as there was no evidence seized pursuant to a warrant or at the time of appellant's arrest and no confessions were involved. Second, the court found that trial counsel had interviewed the appellant’s arresting officers; said officers were positive that the person they had arrested was the man who sold the L.S.D. to the undercover agent. The court thus found a reasonable trial strategy in neither introducing the newspaper clipping nor calling the arresting officers to testify. As we agree that there is no merit to these contentions which could have been raised on appeal if post-verdict motions had been filed, we believe counsel was not ineffective for failing to preserve meritless claims. <em>Commonwealth v.
