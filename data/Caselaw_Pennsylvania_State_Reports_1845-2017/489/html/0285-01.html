Evidence had been introduced at trial that a long chain had been found near the body of the deceased. The testimony of the witness, Lesster, described not only the purpose for which this chain is normally used, but also corroborates the testimony of Tabron as to its use in this particular case. Furthermore, any prejudice that may have been engendered <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>by the introduction of this evidence was immediately cured by the trial court’s wise decision to prevent a further demonstration of the use of this object.

Specifically, appellant charges that trial counsel should have made an effort pre-trial to exclude the identification testimony of Tyrone Parks, Bruce Ballard and Tanya Harmon. These witnesses testified at trial that they had observed the defendant wearing a salt and pepper colored jacket in the immediate vicinity of the killing, shortly before the incident. They further testified that after hearing shots, they ran to their doors and saw the decedent lying in the street and a man in a salt and pepper colored jacket running from the scene.</p>

After hearing the shots, they immediately looked out of their doors and saw defendant in flight. While not observing appellant’s full face, Parks and Ballard drew their conclusions from the clothes worn by the fleeing man. In view of the proximity of time and space between the point where the witnesses had originally observed the defendant and the time they saw the individual fleeing from the scene it cannot be said, as appellant attempts to suggest, that this identification was pure conjecture. The witness, Harmon, pbserved the side of appellant’s face as he was leaving the scene and, <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>because of previous and subsequent confrontations, was certain that the individual fleeing was the appellant. The mere fact that the defense counsel’s cross examination may have provided some basis for the jury to question the validity of the identification by these witnesses, did not provide a basis for suggesting that there was any reason why this testimony was inadmissible and, therefore, subject to a motion to suppress.</p>

An officer from the police graphics art unit testified that on the day of the murder, he drew a sketch of the appellant based solely upon the description provided by Parks and later modified this sketch based on Ballard’s description. He testified that he did not provide any information to either witness. Another detective testified that he drove Parks and Harmon to the Detention Center where they individually identified appellant during separate lineups. That officer testified that he did not inform either witness that appellant would appear in the lineup nor did he have any other conversations with them concerning their identification. Interestingly, the appellant in this appeal does not challenge the lineup identifications but rather hints at the possibility of suggestiveness from a statement made during the course of the cross examination of Tyrone Parks.</p>

Their ability from this observation to describe the appellant was confirmed by the description given to police officials by them and the fact that the two of them had no difficulty in selecting the appellant in separate lineups. Thus, the only avenue available for the attack by the defense was the validity of their respective judgment that the person they saw fleeing after the shooting was in fact the person who they had seen earlier and identified as being the appellant. This area was fully explored by artful cross examination conducted by trial counsel. Further, judgment as to the weight of this testimony was properly left to the jury.
