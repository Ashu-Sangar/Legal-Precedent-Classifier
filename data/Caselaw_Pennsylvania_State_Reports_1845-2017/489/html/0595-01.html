    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[229,466,1147,370]]]'>Appellant was arrested for robbery and the shooting death of an off-duty Philadelphia police officer. He was tried by a jury and found guilty of three counts of robbery and murder of the second degree. After denial of post-verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment and ten to twenty years incarceration, and this appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.6",643,[230,867,1146,687]]]'>Appellant raises five issues: 1) the trial court erred in not dismissing the charges pursuant to Rule 1100 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure; 2) the trial court erred in admitting testimony concerning prior crimes into evidence; 3) the evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant participated in the robbery-murder; 4) appellant’s first trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move to suppress evidence of appellant’s participation in similar crimes; and 5) the trial court erred in admitting evidence obtained pursuant to a search warrant for which there was insufficient probable cause. We have reviewed the record and find that it fails to support these contentions, and that they are frivolous.</p>
    <p id="b643-7" data-blocks='[["BL_643.7",643,[272,1577,787,42]]]'>The judgments of sentence are affirmed.</p>
