McGartland (Claimant) appeals here from an order of the Commonwealth Court affirming an order of the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) reversing a referee’s decision awarding compensation for loss of use of Claimant’s left hand for all practical intents and purposes.</p>

As a result, he eventually underwent an operation for the amputation of his first, second and third fingers leaving stumps of approximately three-fourths inch in length. Based on lay and medical testimony and on a personal observation of Claimant’s hand, the referee made a factual finding that Claimant sustained the loss of use of his left hand for all practical <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>purposes and awarded compensation. On appeal to the Board, Claimant, accompanied by his attorney, appeared at the argument, and the Board had occasion to observe Claimant’s hand. Based on this observation and nothing more, the Board unanimously reversed the referee’s finding and award of benefits, stating</p>
    <blockquote id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[252,673,1105,526]]]'>Normally, we would be powerless to intervene and would have to sustain his (the referee’s) award if competent evidence can support it. However, during the argument of this case, this Board had occasion to observe Claimant’s hand and his ability to function with it. Since we made this observation, we .have in effect taken additional testimony and are not bound by the Referee’s Findings of Fact. We are of the unanimous decision that the Claimant has not suffered the loss of use of his left hand for all practical intents and purposes.</blockquote>

Claimant testified that his left little finger was initially caught in the press along with his left index, middle and ring fingers, but he was able to free his little finger before it was severed by the press. He testified that he has not used his left hand since his injury because of the resultant pain in his left arm. Claimant testified that he could not do the same job that he did at the time of the accident, and that his employer assigned him as a payroll and insurance clerk when he returned to work. Claimant stated that he could not hold objects of any weight, open a car door, button his clothes, or use his left hand to bathe. Claimant’s physician stated unequivocally that claimant’s left hand was lost for all practical purposes because of the loss of mechanism created by the amputation of claimant’s index, middle and ring fingers, and that his condition was permanent. Even medical testimony presented by the employer indicated that claimant’s activities were very limited because of the amputation of his three fingers as described above; and further that claimant did not have the potential for grasp and grip.</p>
