Warunek had been shot to death. On November 18, police arrested three eighteen year-old suspects, Anthony Reynolds, George Arms, and appellant, and charged all three with murder. Police also charged appellant with conspiracy to commit murder. Police investigation revealed that appellant hired the other two to kill Warunek in retaliation for threats Warunek made on appellant’s life. Warunek allegedly told his fiance, Kerry Young, he would kill appellant, Young’s former boyfriend.</p>

After two days of testimony, appellant was held for action by the grand jury.

In defense, appellant admitted that he spoke with Arms and Reynolds and produced $700 cash as payment. He maintained, however, that he wanted only Warunek to be “scared” and “shoved around” so that Warunek would know people were protecting appellant. Appellant sought to discredit Commonwealth witness Jack Geisler by showing on cross-examination that Geisler had given police and the District Attorney inconsistent statements and that he had previously testified at appellant’s preliminary hearing that appellant wanted only to have Warunek “messed up.” Appellant also pointed out that, as of appellant’s trial, neither Geisler nor Reynolds had been sentenced on their convictions following their earlier guilty pleas.</p>

Second, he contends that the many acts of misconduct on the part of the prosecution, including the alleged coercion of certain witnesses, interference with defense access to Commonwealth witnesses, and unfair argument and cross-examination at trial, so denied appellant due process that a discharge is warranted.

Appellant claimed trial error, including improper venue, as well as prosecutorial misconduct on the part of previous District Attorney VanHoove and his staff requiring discharge. Then-District Attorney Morrissey not only agreed with appellant that a new trial should be granted but also agreed that the previous district attorney’s conduct requires discharge. After argument, at the request of President Judge Eshelman of Berks County, Attorney General Biester reviewed the matter and determined the Attorney General should supersede District Attorney Morrissey to ensure the interests of the Commonwealth are adequately protected. In June of 1979, District Attorney Morrissey petitioned this Court for review of the Attorney General’s supersession. The Attorney General was granted a stay of consideration. Also granted were the District Attorney’s request for a rule to show cause and the Attorney General’s request for oral argument. This Court heard argument on supersession in September of 1979. At argument, the Attorney General agreed to an order vacating supersession but permitting the Attorney General leave to file an amicus brief and orally to argue on the Commonwealth’s behalf. This Court then heard reargument on the entire matter in December of 1979. Appellant maintained his previous position, as did District Attorney Morrissey. The Attorney General, as amicus, urges there is neither trial error nor prosecutorial misconduct requiring discharge and thus contends that judgments of sentence should be affirmed.</p>

I also share the position that the prevailing climate in Berks County at the time of appellant’s trial precluded the possibility that he could receive a trial by an impartial jury.

Five years have passed since the trial and without any information concerning the climate today, the majority is ordering a change of venue. Perhaps the climate in 1980 is the same as in 1975, or it is possible that the citizenry’s prejudices may be rekindled by a retrial of the appellant. Nonetheless, we have consistently held that “it is blackletter law an appellate court cannot consider anything which is not part of the record in the case,” <em>Saint John the Baptist Greek Catholic Church </em>v. <em>Musko, </em><a href="/citations/?q=448%20Pa.%20132" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="448 Pa. 132">448 Pa. 132</a>, 162, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%2089" class="citation" data-index="92" data-cite="291 A.2d 89">291 A.2d 89</a> (1972), and “[ojnly the facts that appear in this record may be considered by the appellate court.” <em>Commonwealth v.
