Subsequently, the salesman requested that Buyer furnish a bank guaranty securing payment of the purchase price and, consequently, on February 20, 1974, Buyer’s bank sent a letter to Seller containing language identical (except for date and dollar amount) to the subsequent letter dated May 8, 1974 which appears hereafter. On February 22, 1974, Seller’s credit manager received the letter but was dissatisfied with the language therein because of an ambiguity as to whether the letter constituted a guarantee or a mere credit reference. The credit manager telephoned the president of Buyer’s bank who said the letter was a guarantee. The Irish beef trimmings were then released to Buyer in March of 1974 and payment was made by Buyer.</p>

A written confirmation of sale containing the words “bank guarantee due prior to delivery” was mailed to Buyer but due to an incorrect address was never received. On May 8, 1974, when no bank guarantee had been forthcoming, the salesman visited Buyer and demanded such a guaranty. Buyer’s president agreed to have one furnished, dispatched the salesman to go the bank, and telephoned ahead to the bank’s vice president instructing him to prepare a guaranty. While at the bank, the salesman telephoned Seller’s credit manager who stated he wanted a letter of credit from the bank rather than a bank guarantee. Buyer’s president, however, declined to agree to have a letter of credit supplied so the following letter was sent by the bank instead:</p>

    <p id="b439-10" data-blocks='[["BL_439.16",439,[257,1562,1145,796]]]'>On May 8, 1974 a contract was formed requiring a bank guarantee as a term of payment. Buyer contends that Seller’s request for a letter of credit constituted a material breach of contract which excused Buyer from further performance including the furnishing of a bank guarantee. We disagree. By asking for a letter of credit, after a contract had been formed between Buyer and Seller’s sales agent, Seller did not breach the contract but rather requested a material change in contract terms which was objected to and did not become part of the contract. Hence, the contract remained in its original form requiring a bank guarantee. After receipt of the bank’s letter of May 8, 1974, Seller communicated to Buyer and to Buyer’s bank that a sufficient guaranty had not been received. Consequently, Seller never shipped the ordered goods.</p>

      <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>If the letter of May 8, 1974 constituted the promised bank guarantee then Seller breached its obligation to deliver the goods. Buyer and Seller do not dispute the existence of a contract binding them but rather implicitly focus their arguments on an analysis of whether, based on the bank’s letter of May 8, 1974 and the attendant circumstances, the letter would likely have created bank liability to Seller in the event the goods had been delivered and Buyer refused to pay. It is not necessary to determine the probable ultimate effect of the letter in question. The overriding issue is simply whether the parties exchanged that which was <em>bargained for </em>by the parties and reasonably contemplated by the same as the mode of performance, termed by them as a “bank guaranty”.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[223,1062,1157,1277]],["BL_441.1",441,[265,314,1144,530]]]'>By requiring a bank guaranty in a transaction, the Seller’s purpose, obvious to both parties, is to avoid the risk of default in payment. Both parties are, therefore, chargeable with knowledge when a “bank guarantee” is bargained for that the Seller is not bargaining for a document of such uncertain meaning that, in light of the circumstances, acceptance of the same would force a reasonably cautious businessman to knowingly be exposed to the very risk of non-payment against which he sought to ensure. This case, then, is to be distinguished from those where the effect of a purported guaranty which has already been accepted by a Seller is to be determined. A guaranty is a promise to pay the debt of another when the creditor is unable, after due prosecution, to collect the amount owed by the debtor. <em>Strohecker v. Farmers Bank, </em><a href="/pa/6/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="954598" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0041-01">6 Pa. 41</a>, 44 (1847). The alleged guarantee in question, without regard to whether under rules of construction and in light of the circumstances an arguable liability for the bank in a suit by Seller may have existed, could not have constituted the “Bank Guarantee” necessarily contemplated as <em>suitable for commercial reliance </em>by the parties. A cautious Seller could reasonably interpret the letter of May 8, 1974 as a carefully worded attempt by the bank to avoid obligating itself by giving only an opinion as to the customer’s reliability and credit-worthi<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>ness without promising that the bank would pay the obligation upon the customer’s failure to do so. In the prior sale in which Seller was furnished with a letter dated February 20, 1974 like that dated May 8, 1974, the Seller questioned the sufficiency of the language and although the goods were subsequently released in that <em>one </em>smaller transaction a sequence of prior dealing<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> is not present to support a conclusion that in the transaction in question, where Seller had more of a financial stake, the parties intended less than a reasonably unambiguous guaranty to be furnished.</p>
