Acting Secretary of Revenue Charles Seligman sent letters to both bidders seeking clarification of their cost proposals and asking whether the bids were based on effective rate or accumulative rate. American Totalisator responded that its bid was indeed calculated on an effective rate basis. Control Data confirmed that it had used an accumulative rate basis; subsequently a bid based on the effective rate was submitted.

The evil of the instant procedure is readily apparent.

Even the majority recognizes that judicial intervention was proper because “the elementary principles of competitive bidding had been violated when Control Data was allowed to ‘clarify’ its bid after American Totalisator’s bid had been opened.” However, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the chancellor acted properly in ordering the submission of new bids since American Totalisator had in fact been the lowest responsible bidder; and, as such, I would now award the contract to American Totalisator. Additionally, I would compel Control Data to disgorge its profits to the Commonwealth.</p>
