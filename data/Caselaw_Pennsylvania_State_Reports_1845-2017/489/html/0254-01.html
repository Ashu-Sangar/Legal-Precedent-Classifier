Mastrangelo, was convicted in a non-jury trial of disorderly conduct and obstructing administration of law or other governmental function. Post-verdict motions were denied. Appellant was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of one to twenty-three months. Appellant was also ordered to pay two $500 fines. The Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>and we granted appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

Appellant had a place of business called the “Blue Jay” on Bridge Street in Phoenixville. When the incidents in question occurred, appellant’s car was parked on the street in front of his establishment. The street was metered and was being patrolled by Diane Young, a meter maid employed by the Borough. According to Young’s testimony, she was patrolling the street during the morning of February 3. She ticketed appellant’s car, which was illegally parked at a meter. Appellant came out of his store and shouted at her, repeatedly calling her a “fucking pig”. Ms. Young walked away, but appellant continued shouting at her.</p>

She again observed appellant’s car, but did not ticket it because it was legally parked. Nonetheless, appellant came out of his store and followed Ms. Young along Bridge Street, shouting at her and calling her, among other things, a “nigger lover” and a “cocksucker”. Ms. Young asked appellant to leave her alone, but he continued to follow her, yelling the entire time, until she left the area. On both occasions, Ms. Young testified that bystanders on the street observed appellant’s conduct; none, however, testified in court.</p>

It is inconsistent with this theory to punish solely for the effect which one’s lawful conduct has on others. Under the generally imprecise language of the prior laws, this was entirely possible.
