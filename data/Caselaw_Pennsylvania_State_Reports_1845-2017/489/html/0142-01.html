The Commonwealth, the appellant in this case, has filed a petition with this Court indicating that the issue presented by this appeal is now moot and requesting that the present appeal be withdrawn. See Pa.R.A.P. 1972(4), 1973. There is thus clearly no basis for this Court to express what is only an advisory opinion on the issue which was once presented by this case. Accordingly, I agree with Mr. Justice Kauffman that the majority is in error in failing to exercise the appropriate restraint and dismiss this appeal. Because the majority is unwilling, however, to refrain from expressing its views on the merits, I must also express my complete disagreement with those views.</p>

      <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>This Rule expressly and most clearly leaves the decision to grant bail to the sound judgment of the trial court. There is no indication in the text of this Rule that the trial judge must wait four months before he may exercise that judgment. Yet by a remarkable <em>ipse dixit </em>the majority today imposes just such a four month rulé, prohibiting all trial judges from granting bail during that period of time. If our Rules of Criminal Procedure are to be so casually ignored, one may well wonder why we have procedural rules at all.</p>

    <p id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.5",198,[273,1178,1152,311]]]'>In this case the trial judge denied the defendant’s first application for bail. Only on subsequent reapplication, when it appeared that post-verdict motions would not be decided for some time, did the trial court see fit to reinstate bail. The record plainly demonstrates that the trial judge soundly exercised discretion, and I would not disturb this ruling.</p>
