After choosing the first-prize winners the Department, however, attempted to deliver to each winner a twenty-one foot Winnebago “Brave” motor home which was worth $14,000.00 less than the “Elandan II”.</p>

The class allegedly consisted of some seventy-eight persons in addition to appellants. The Department moved to dismiss the claims, and the Board granted the Department’s motion with respect to the class action portion of the claims only, holding it was without authority to hear class actions. Both appellants appealed to the Commonwealth Court which affirmed the order of the Board. Appellants then petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal, and we granted the petitions and consolidated the appeals.</p>

Section 10 of the Act, 72 P.S. § 4651-10, directs the Board to “establish such rules for its government, and regulations governing practice before it as it shall deem proper and necessary.”</p>

That Court reasoned that because section 8 of the Board of Arbitration of Claims <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>Act, 72 P.S. § 4651-8, provides that “all <em>hearings </em>before the board . . . shall be governed by all of the rules of Pennsylvania Civil Procedure . . . ” (emphasis supplied), the Board’s authority was circumscribed and it could not adopt any of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure which applied to more than just the <em>conduct of hearings </em>(i. e., the Board could not adopt any of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure relating to pre-trial practices and procedures). This strained limitation on the seemingly plain meaning of section 121.1 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure is in direct contradiction to prior decisions of the Commonwealth Court and is by no means required by section 8 of the Board of Arbitration of Claims Act.</p>

      <em> </em>The joinder of additional defendants is a matter that is not limited to the conduct of hearings. In fact, it is a procedural device which, like the class action, involves making additional persons parties to the lawsuit. The Commonwealth Court did not, however, feel constrained to hold there that section 8 of the Board of Arbitration of Claims Act prevented the Board from adopting the rules relating to joinder of additional defendants, and we do not believe that the Commonwealth Court should have deviated from that line of precedent in the instant case.</p>

As its title states, the subject matter of the section is, “Hearings; opinions; awards; costs; appeals”. It is thus only applicable to the procedures that are to be employed at the hearing and subsequent thereto, and it does not otherwise restrict the Board’s general rule-making duties under section 10 of the Act or prevent it from promulgating those Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure which relate to pre-hearing practices and procedures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">3</a>
