    <p id="b566-13" data-blocks='[["BL_566.12",566,[241,1515,1155,633]]]'>On August 14, 1978 appellant, James Taylor, was convicted of first degree murder and aggravated robbery following the fatal beating of Robert Morgan. On appeal, appellant presents three arguments: 1) that a mistrial should have been granted because the prosecutor improperly cross-examined a defense witness; 2) that it was reversible error for the trial court to have permitted a court officer to testify concerning her observation, during trial, of a conversation between appellant and a defense witness; 3) that the trial judge invaded the province of the jury when he instructed them that he was “required” to charge them on the law of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter.</p>
