It will not suffice to point to what the Court in <em>Chadwick </em>called ‘the diminished expectation of privacy which surrounds the automobile,’ for the reasons given for that reduced expectation are inapplicable to the locked trunk — its contents are not in plain view, looking within the trunk would not ‘ordinarily be permissible in order to insure the running safety of a car,’ and an <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>impounded car and its contents may be adequately protected without intruding into a locked trunk.” [footnotes omitted]</blockquote>

On this record, however, the trial court specifically ruled that consent had not been freely given. Our review of the record discloses that the trial court’s ruling was proper. Nor does the Commonwealth contend that appellant’s “consent” to the search was valid.

In his post-verdict motion appellant alleged that the trial judge improperly denied his “pre-trial application.” The record reflects that the only pre-trial application was an “Application to Suppress Evidence.” Appellant’s reference to the “pre-trial application” was sufficiently specific to preserve this claim for review because appellant’s reference necessarily was only to the suppression of the evidence seized from the trunk. Indeed, at every stage of this proceeding both our courts and the Commonwealth have been able to discern the specific challenge appellant raises.</p>
