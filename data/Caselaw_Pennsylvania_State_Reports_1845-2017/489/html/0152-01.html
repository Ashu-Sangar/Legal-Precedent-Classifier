The complaint alleged that appellee had induced their mother to execute powers of attorney to enable appellee to control their mother’s assets. It was further asserted that appellee fraudulently converted these assets prior to the mother’s death by placing them in her own name. Specifically, it was contended that appellee, during January and April of 1970, through the use of the previously mentioned powers of attorney, converted savings bonds and certificates belonging to the mother and placed in trust for appellant to her own account. The chancellor found that the redemption of these bonds and certificates was not at the request or instruction of the mother and rejected the contention that the redemptions were intended by the mother to be a gift to appellee. Thereupon the chancellor found in appellant’s favor and imposed a constructive trust in the amount of $25,000. Appellant appeals from the chancellor’s refusal to award pre-verdict interest. The Superior Court affirmed without opinion and we granted allocatur.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

This was because, beginning on January 26, 1970, appellee began to redeem all of the savings bonds purchased by decedent in trust for her daughters. Using the powers of attorney executed by her mother in appellee’s favor, appellee redeemed these bonds in her mother’s name, deposited the funds in a joint account she shared with her mother, and then deposited the funds in her sole account. The chancellor found that the redemption of these bonds was not at the request or instruction of the mother. In rejecting appellee’s claim that the redemptions <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>were intended by the decedent to be a gift to appellee, the chancellor found that a confidential relationship existed between appellee and her mother and that this relationship was abused by appellee to her sole benefit. Consequently, a constructive trust in the amount of $25,000 was imposed for the benefit of appellant. Following this adjudication, appellant filed with the court a petition to amend the decree nisi praying that interest from the date of her mother’s death be included in the award. By order of August 13, 1975, the chancellor ruled that this petition was to be treated as an exception to the decree nisi. On July 6, 1976, the chancellor denied appellant’s request for interest and the court <em>en banc </em>affirmed him on September 21, 1976.</p>

It is clear from the record that appellant’s Petition to Amend Decree Nisi was intended to be an exception to the chancellor’s original adjudication. Furthermore, the chancellor by order expressly termed it an exception and it was so treated and considered by the chancellor and the court <em>en banc. </em>The chancellor correctly refused to permit faulty nomenclature to obscure the true nature of the pleading. The chancellor was given formal notice by appellant that she did not acquiesce in his adjudication and he was given the opportunity to review the propriety of appellant’s claimed right to pre-verdict interest. In these circumstances, Rule 1518 was complied with. <em>See, Turnway Corp. v. Soffer, </em><a href="/pa/461/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="461 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="483823" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0447-01">461 Pa. 447</a>, <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>455-56, <a href="/pa/461/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="461 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="483823" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0447-01">336 A.2d 871</a> (1975). Neither Rule 1518 nor our case law have imposed upon an excepting party the duty to file further exceptions to a supplemental decree responding to the exceptions already filed. First, the rule itself speaks only of the necessity of filing exceptions “to rulings on objections to evidence, to statements or findings of fact, to conclusions of law, to the decree nisi [and] . . . to a failure or refusal to find any matter of fact or law.” Nowhere is it made necessary to file exceptions to protect the failure of the chancellor to accede to the originally filed exceptions. Second, the two cases cited by appellee do not support her position. In <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Cherrie, </em><a href="/pa/444/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="444 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1938616" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0555-01">444 Pa. 555</a>, 556, <a href="/citations/?q=282%20A.2d%20236" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="282 A.2d 236">282 A.2d 236</a>, 236 (1971), we ruled that the moving party’s claims were waived because of the failure “to file <em>any </em>exception or exceptions to the decree in the court below.” (Emphasis in the original.) And in <em>McGrorey Estate, </em><a href="/pa/474/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="474 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1732102" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0402-01">474 Pa. 402</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="378 A.2d 855" data-case-ids="1732102,1732171" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0402-01,/pa/474/0401-01">378 A.2d 855</a> (1977), the appellant had also failed to comply with Rule 1518 by not filing any exceptions in the court below. In the present case appellant has timely filed exceptions and was not under further duty of excepting to the chancellor’s response to her original exceptions.</p>

That the inclusion in the verdict of such interest, as compensation for delay, is but equitable is well illustrated by assuming a case where a broker wrongfully sold his customer’s stock and the customer after going through all the required preliminaries, immediately repurchased a like amount of the same stock at an advanced price, and sued the broker to recover the difference in value which he was obliged to pay. Assuming further that plaintiff’s case was not tried for two or more years after the reacquirement-of-stock date, it can be plainly seen that, while plaintiff had the same advantages of his reacquired stock during this interval as he would have had had it never been wrongfully converted, yet, during the same period, he would lose the advantage of the additional capital which he was obliged to pay out to remedy the broker’s wrong — namely, the rise in the market value between the day of the conversion and the time the stock was again <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>purchased, — and hence that he would be entitled to interest on that capital during the period in question.</blockquote>

    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[235,710,1143,361]]]'>The treatise writers are in accord that “the better view seems to be that interest upon liquidated damages will be allowed from the time of the accrual of the claim for liquidated damages.” C. McCormick, Damages 217 (1935). Professor Dan Dobbs has set forth cogent reasons for permitting a plaintiff to recover pre-verdict interest in cases, like the present one, in which a fiduciary breaches her duty:</p>
    <blockquote id="ACg" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[277,1086,1102,568]]]'>In the first place, it seems clear that if the fiduciary must account for profits he has gained by the use of the plaintiff’s money, he must likewise account for interest he gained by its use. There would hardly be any purpose in holding the fiduciary liable for profits he gains on sales of stock purchased with his beneficiaries’ funds, without also holding him liable for interest he earned by investment of his beneficiaries’ funds. Hence, wherever the fiduciary’s profits could be reached by the beneficiary, interest on the funds wrongly held by the fiduciary could be awarded as an alternative.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b209-7" data-blocks='[["BL_209.7",209,[276,1678,1103,574]]]'>In the second place, the principle in such cases is the prevention of unjust enrichment. If the fiduciary makes profits, or gets interest on the money he wrongly takes from the beneficiary, he must be held liable not only for the profits or interest he makes on such funds, but also for interest on those profits or the interest itself. In no other way can his enrichment be taken from him. Hence, any claim based upon unjust enrichment or restitution, rather than upon compensation or damages, not only permits pre-judgment interest, but also permits an award of compound interest.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b209-8" data-blocks='[["BL_209.8",209,[279,2268,1100,95]],["BL_210.1",210,[298,314,1113,728]]]'>Because all of this was most obvious in fiduciary cases, and because those cases were decided in equity courts, the <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>generalization often made was that <em>interest would be permitted in equity, as a matter of the chancellor's discretion, </em>even where not permitted at law because the claim was unliquidated. The principle behind this, however, is clearly broader than the scope of purely equitable actions: it is a principle based upon unjust enrichment notions. For that reason it should be stated, not as a rule about equity, but as a rule about restitution. Whenever the defendant holds money or property that belongs in good conscience to the plaintiff, and the objective of the court is to force disgorgement of his unjust enrichment, interest upon the funds or property so held may be necessary to force complete restitution. This may be true in law as well as in equity.</blockquote>

This is especially true in cases, like the present one, in which the plaintiff’s claim for interest is contained in her prayer for general relief and is therefore dependent upon the “long recognized power of a Chancellor to shape and render a decree which accords with the equities in the case.” <em>Salisbury Township v.
