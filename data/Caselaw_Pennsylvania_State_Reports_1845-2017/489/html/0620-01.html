The intruder struck the son repeatedly in the head and shot the son in the abdomen. Thereafter, William Phillips, Sr. rushed into his son’s room. He was not armed. The intruder fired at William Phillips Sr. A bullet went through his left palm, entered the right side of his face, and lodged in an area of the brain causing injury resulting in instant death.</p>

Their only surprise was that the Commonwealth finally locatedLeFebvre.”</p>

LeFebvre was asked whether he knew Baker, Hassett, or Johnston. To each question, LeFebvre responded in the negative. Hudson complains about the trial judge permitting these additional questions. However, the complaint is without merit, since Hudson suffered no apparent prejudice from the negative responses.</p>

Hudson also argues that ballistics evidence, by itself, was not sufficient to establish his guilt of the crimes charged and that the trial court erred in refusing Hudson’s motion for a directed verdict. Since we will not review a sufficiency claim on a diminished record, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kuebler, </em><a href="/pa/484/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="484 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1753771" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0358-01">484 Pa. 358</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="484 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1753771" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0358-01">399 A.2d 116</a> (1979); <em>Commonwealth v.
