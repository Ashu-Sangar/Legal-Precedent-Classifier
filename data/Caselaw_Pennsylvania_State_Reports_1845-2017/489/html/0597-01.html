If the court en banc was in disagreement with the chancellor before whom the witnesses appeared, there might be merit in this argument, but the Agency has overlooked an important fact, i. e. the chancellor was a member of the court en banc and joined both its findings and final decree. “A chancellor, who <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>initially makes findings of fact may subsequently join as a member of a court en banc in making . . . contrary finding[s], if the ultimate finding[s are] supported by adequate evidence: <em>Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp. v.

The parents separated some time prior to the divorce, and the mother, M.A.K., has not remarried. On July 21, 1970, M.A.K. requested the Agency to provide shelter for three of her children, including M.K. and R.K., because she was being evicted from her living quarters and could not care for them. Later, the Agency petitioned the court to have the children adjudged dependent and committed to the custody of the Agency because of M.A.K.’s instability, her failure to make a suitable plan for the children, and the possible danger to the children arising from the natural father’s presence in the home. In December 1970, M. K. and R.K. were placed in separate foster homes. On April 21, 1971, the court adjudged the children dependent and committed them to the custody of the Agency.</p>

With the financial and personal support of her son-in-law, who lived in her home, M.A.K. did retain an attorney and filed a petition with the court seeking return of the children to her custody. After hearings in December 1976, the court denied her petition. The hearing judge decided the best interests of the children would be served by having them remain with their respective foster parents because of the excellent relationship which had developed between the children and their foster parents.

Mrs. K. lives in a large, nicely furnished home adequate to house [a third child in placement, M.K., and R.K.] and her income is adequate to meet their material needs. Mrs. K. has done a fine job of caring for her three children who were returned three and one-half years ago. A good family relationship has developed between Mrs. K. and these three children. These are personable, well-adjusted children who are progressing well in the home, schools and community.

During this period, she was able to care adequately for the three children residing at home with her. Also during this period, the Agency sent M.A.K. letters scheduling visits with the children on three different occasions. In each instance, M.A.K. telephoned the Agency to report she would not be able to keep the appointment. She was then advised, by letter, that, if she wished further visitation, it would be her responsibility to initiate contact with the Agency. M.A.K. testified she attempted to contact her children after the custody hearings, but was unsuccessful and found the Agency uncooperative.
