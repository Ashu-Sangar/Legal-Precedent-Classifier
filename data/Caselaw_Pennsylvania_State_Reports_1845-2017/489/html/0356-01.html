It is clear that under the sentencing code a “severe reprimand” falls within the “guilt without penalty” provision. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 1321(a)(2). Thus, the sentence imposed constitutes a final appealable order. On the merits I believe that appellant’s conduct at the suppression hearing did not rise to the level of direct criminal contempt. 42 Pa.C.S. § 4131(3). This conduct in no way constituted obstruction of the orderly administration of justice.
