Further, and as previously mentioned, the value of a domestic subsidiary’s capital stock must be included in the valuation of a parent foreign corporation’s capital stock. <em>Commonwealth v. Monessen Amusement Co., Inc., <a href="/pa/476/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="382 A.2d 983" data-case-ids="1736908" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0319-01">supra.</a> </em>Appellant argues, however, that as a domestic corporation, the disallowance of any exclusion for the value of its domestic subsidiaries amounts to double taxation unintended by the Legislature. <em>Commonwealth v.

In passing the 1967 amendment and in reenacting it in the Tax Reform Code of 1971, the Legislature knew that a domestic corporation using the amendment could not exclude the value of its domestic subsidiaries. Despite any double taxation that might occur, the amendment sought to allow domestic corporations to reduce their tax liability below the amount obtained by using the single fraction formula, 72 P.S. § 1896, where the value of domestic subsidiaries can clearly be excluded. We thus find no error in the taxing authorities’ refusal to allow appellant to deduct the value of its domestic subsidiaries.</p>

We need not, however, decide this issue of first impression, i. e., whether a domestic corporation electing to compute its capital stock tax using the franchise tax formula is entitled to multiform treatment, for appellant failed to raise this issue in Commonwealth Court.
