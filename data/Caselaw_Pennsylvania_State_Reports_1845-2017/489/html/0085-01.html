However, on January 21, 1977, after an on-the-record colloquy during which Evans was fully advised of his right to a trial within 180 days, he signed an agreement waiving commencement of trial until April 20, 1977.

The remark was not made as a condemnation of Evans or as an opinion on his guilt, but as part of an explanation of why a warrant was not legally necessary for his arrest. Furthermore, it was already apparent from the voir dire, the opening statements, and the evidence previously produced that Evans had been sought for and charged with a murder. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/453/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="453 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="577618" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0319-01">453 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20371" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="309 A.2d 371">309 A.2d 371</a> (1973).

However, as we have already stated, the record shows Rule 1100 was fully explained to Evans at the proceeding.
