At the time the account in question was opened, it constituted a major portion of decedent’s assets. Looking to the totality of the circumstances, the Court below found that if the joint account was, in fact, created by the decedent, it was meant only as a convenience. Only one month prior to the creation of the joint account, decedent had executed a will indicating a settled intention to deal with all his sisters equally. This intention was expressed three times in that instrument. On the other hand, there is nothing in the record which would satisfactorily explain such a significant change in decedent’s intentions during that one month period so as to substantially negate the distribution expressed in his will.</p>

Although decedent expressed to a bank employee his intention to add to the book the name of the sister with whom he lived, no witness could identify decedent’s signature on a bank signature card. More significant, in our view, is the fact that the purported signature card between the parties was not put into evidence in the court below, nor is it part of the record on appeal. We agree with the lower court that the joint account was a convenience account and was not meant to be a gift inter vivos to decedent’s sister.</p>

Moreover, proponent failed to make out a prima facie case of a gift in any fashion. Therefore, no burden shifted to the contestants.

Counsel for the estate advised appellants’ attorney in writing that “no part of decedent’s expenses were unpaid by the insurance coverage.” However, at the hearing below, he testified that none of these expenses of decedent’s last illness were covered by insurance. Faced with this conflicting evidence, the lower court found that the basis for the objection was “resolved”, and the expenses were properly charged to the estate. We will not disturb a finding of fact by the auditing judge where the finding is supported by competent and adequate evidence and is not predicated upon a capricious disregard of competent and credible evidence. <em>Estate of Penrose, </em><a href="/pa/486/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="486 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1757550" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0009-01">486 Pa. 9</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="486 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1757550" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0009-01">403 A.2d 982</a> (1979).

Letters testamentary were granted on March 4, 1975, but executrix-appellee delayed filing her first account until June 2, 1978, and then after issuance of a court order to do so. During these three years, the account in question could have been invested in an interest bearing savings account where the funds would have been available on demand and without a delay. Instead the funds were allowed to remain idle and unproductive. P.E.F. Code, Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, 20 Pa.C.S. § 3316 (1975) provides: “Subject to his duty to liquidate the estate for prompt distribution and to the provisions of the will, if any, the personal representative may invest the funds of the estate but shall have no duty to do so.” Before the enactment of this statute case law had approved investment of funds by personal representatives and indicated a duty to do so in certain circumstances. <em>Bile’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/24/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="24 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="9504616" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0335-01">24 Pa. 335</a> (1855); <em>Jones Estate, </em><a href="/pa/400/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="400 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="1292537" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0545-01">400 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20A.2d%20408" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="162 A.2d 408">162 A.2d 408</a> (1960); <em>Lare Estate, </em><a href="/pa/436/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="436 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1926020" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0001-01">436 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=257%20A.2d%20556" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="257 A.2d 556">257 A.2d 556</a> (1969). Clearly, the legislature did not intend by this legislation that under no circumstances would a personal representative ever have a duty to invest estate funds. Rather, we construe this statute to mean that where administration of an estate is concluded reasonably within the time contemplated by law, the personal representative has no duty to invest estate funds. But where, as in the instant case, administration of an estate is delayed for an extended period of time, it is incumbent upon the personal representative to <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>invest the funds and not to permit them to remain idle. Where a personal representative breaches this duty, she may properly be surcharged for appropriate interest. We will remand this part of the proceedings to the Orphans’ Court to determine the amount of surcharge in accordance with the views herein set forth.</p>

Particularly drastic is the removal of the executrix chosen by the testator, since her appointment represents an expression of trust and confidence in her. <em>In re Estate of Lux, </em><a href="/pa/480/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="480 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1745053" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0256-01">480 Pa. 256</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="480 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1745053" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0256-01">389 A.2d 1053</a> (1978). In the instant case, the executrix claimed ownership of a joint bank account which amounted to nearly half the assets in the estate. While similar facts have been held to justify removal of an executor, <em>Henry’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/54/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="54 Pa. Super. 274" data-case-ids="437592" data-case-paths="/pa-super/54/0274-01">54 Pa.Super. 274</a> (1913), we do not think that fact alone should necessitate removal of executrix-appellee here. When the lower court found the proceeds of the account to be estate assets and ordered the assets with the interest repaid to the estate, the executrix complied immediately. We have today held that the costs and attorney’s fees incurred by executrix in attempting to <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>establish ownership of the account were not properly charged to the estate. So that, while the litigation regarding ownership of the bank account may have contributed to delay in settling this estate, the actual costs of the litigation do not burden the estate, and executrix-appellee has evidenced a willingness to comply with all orders of the lower court. Compare <em>In re Estate of Lux, <a href="/pa/480/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="480 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1745053" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0256-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/480/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="480 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1745053" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0256-01">480 Pa. at 271</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="480 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="1745053" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0256-01">389 A.2d at 1060</a>. Furthermore, the conclusion of the administration of this estate is now very near at hand. To require a new executor to qualify and administer the estate might cause additional delay and expense. For these reasons, we hold that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remove executrix-appellee.</p>
