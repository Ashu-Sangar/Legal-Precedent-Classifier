Pollard, III, was employed by appellant as an internal consultant. On October 7, 1974, the decedent joined his superior for a five-day assignment at appellant’s facility located in Hampton, South Carolina. After a brief tour of this facility, decedent and his superior were invited by a Westinghouse division manager to stay at the appellant’s lodge, a ranch-type house used to provide overnight accommodations for its employees and customers. Arriving at the lodge at approximately 6:30 p. m., decedent requested a scotch whiskey. Shortly thereafter, decedent and several others who were present at the lodge departed for dinner at a Holiday Inn where one round of drinks was ordered. The evening was largely social in nature and the party returned to the lodge at approximately 9:00 p. m. The decedent then went to the lodge game room to continue drinking and socializing. By approximately 9:45 p. m. decedent’s speech became noticeably slurred and incoherent; he stumbled and fell when attempting to rise from his seat. Believing that decedent was intoxicated, two of his co-workers assisted decedent to <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>his room, placed him in bed without removing his clothing, and left him there for the night. The next morning, decedent was found dead, lying fully-clothed on the floor near to his bed.</p>

In applying this standard to the instant case, we find that it was an error of law for the referee to conclude from the facts that decedent’s death was compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. Section 301(c) of the Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> states in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[283,789,1114,416]]]'>“The terms ‘injury’ and ‘personal injury’, as used in this Act, shall be construed to mean injury to an employee, regardless of his previous physical condition, <em>arising in the course of his employment and related thereto . . . ; </em>and wherever death is mentioned as a cause for compensation under this Act, it shall mean only death resulting from <em>such injury </em>and its resultant effects . . . .” (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>
