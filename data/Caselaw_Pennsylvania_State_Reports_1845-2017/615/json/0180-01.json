Whether a claim for emotional distress without physical injury is covered by a liability insurance policy which provides coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d defined as \u201cbodily injury to a person and sickness, disease or death which results from it.\u201d\nb. Assuming, arguendo, that such claims do constitute bodily injury, whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims for emotional distress are subject to the \u201ceach accident\u201d liability limits of the State Farm insurance policy, rather than the \u201ceach person\u201d liability limits, despite the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress resulted from the bodily injury suffered by Benjamin Lipsky, and the policy includes within its \u201ceach person\u201d limits \u201call injury and damages to others resulting from this bodily injury.\u201d",
