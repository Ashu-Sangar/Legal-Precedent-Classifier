Whether, under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8541-8664, the Register of Wills is immune from suit under Section 3172 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3172?\nb. Whether, in assessing the applicability of official immunity under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8546, the issue of whether the official\u2019s conduct giving rise to the claim was authorized or required by law, or whether the official, in good faith, reasonably believed his conduct was authorized or required by law, is a genuine issue of material fact for a fact-finder to determine, or a legal issue to be decided by the trial court?\nWith regard to your discussion of issue (a), address whether the Commonwealth Court correctly interpreted Meyer v. Community College of Beaver County, 606 Pa. 539, 2 A.3d 499 (2010) and Antonis v. Liberati, 821 A.2d 666 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003).",
