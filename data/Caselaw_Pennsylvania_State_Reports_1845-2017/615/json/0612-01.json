The issues, as stated by petitioner are:\n(1) Did a panel of the Superior Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s determination that drug-related text messages were not offered for their truth and thus admissible where it\u2019s [sic] ruling conflicts with a prior ruling of a panel of the Superior Court and creates uncertainty in the law?\n(2) Did a panel of the Superior Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s determination that drug-related text messages were properly authenticated where it misapprehended the plain language of Pa.R.E. 901 and rendered an opinion inconsistent with a prior opinion of a panel of the Superior Court, again creating uncertainty in the law?",
