        "text": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nIn this case, we consider whether deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class are \u201cpolice officers\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under the act commonly known as Act 111. The Commonwealth Court determined that they are not, and, for the reasons stated herein, we vacate and remand.\nAppellant, the Allegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d), filed a petition with the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (the \u201cPLRB\u201d) seeking to represent, for collective bargaining purposes under Act 111, deputy sheriffs employed by Allegheny County (the \u201cDeputy Sheriffs\u201d). The Association twice before had attempted to attain this same objective, only to fail before the PLRB and the Commonwealth Court. However, following those decisions, the General Assembly amended the Crimes Code in 1995, and then the Municipal Police Education and Training Law (\u201cMPETL\u201d) in 1996, to define deputy sheriffs in a second-class county (i.e., the Deputy Sheriffs) as police officers. See, respectively, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103; 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162.\nConcluding that the aforesaid legislative action was not dispositive of the issue, the PLRB hearing examiner here determined that the Deputy Sheriffs were not \u201cpolice officers\u201d as contemplated by Act 111 because he found that their primary duties were not those of typical police officers, but rather were those directly related to the operation of the courts. For this reason, the hearing officer concluded that the bargaining rights of the Deputy Sheriffs were governed by Section 805 of the Pennsylvania Public Employe Relations Act (\u201cPERA\u201d), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805. In coming to his decision, the hearing examiner found insufficient the Association\u2019s evidence of numerous police-related activities, in addition to court-related ones, engaged in by the Deputy Sheriffs. Additionally, the hearing officer relied heavily upon Venneri v. County of Allegheny, 12 Pa.Cmwlth. 517, 316 A.2d 120 (1974), and Allegheny County Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 95 Pa. Cmwlth. 132, 504 A.2d 437 (1986) (en banc) (\u201cACDSAI \u201d). As noted above, these cases denied previous bids by the Deputy Sheriffs to collectively bargain under Act 111.\nThe hearing examiner filed a proposed order of dismissal, the Association filed exceptions, and the PLRB dismissed them, issuing a written Final Order against the Association. In arriving at its decision, the PLRB made additional factual findings concerning the duties of the Deputy Sheriffs, concluding that, while the Deputy Sheriffs do perform some traditional police duties, their primary duties are rooted in court functions.\nThe Association appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed in a published opinion. Allegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 990 A.2d 86 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010) (\u2018ACDSA II \u201d). The court began by observing that the PERA governs the bargaining rights of all deputy sheriffs as \u201cemployees \u2018directly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts of this Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 88 (quoting 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805) (emphasis in Commonwealth Court opinion). The court then observed, as had the PLRB, that a judicially and administratively created test has been established and used to determine whether law enforcement personnel, other than traditional state and local police officers, fall within the ambit of Act 111. This test asks: 1) are the employees legislatively authorized to act as police; and 2) do they effectively act as police. Id. at 89 (citing Narcotics Agents Reg\u2019l Comm. v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 833 A.2d 314 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003); Cambria County Deputy Sheriffs Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 799 A.2d 957 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002), et al.).\nWith respect to the first prong of the test, the court stated that \u201cabsent any clear legislation which expressly grants [the Deputy Sheriffs] general police powers in any community, geographic area[,]. or jurisdiction, the definitions of \u2018police officer\u2019 in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103 and 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162 are insufficient to vest [the Deputy Sheriffs] with the legislative authority to act primarily as Act 111 police officers rather than court personnel.\u201d ACDSA II, supra at 97. With respect to the second prong of the test, the court held that the PLRB correctly found that, although the Deputy Sheriffs \u201cperform some police-type functions, these functions are incidental to their predominantly court-related responsibilities.\u201d Id. at 99. Accordingly, because the court determined that the Deputy Sheriffs had failed to demonstrate that they could meet the two-pronged test, the court concluded that the PLRB had properly dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for Act 111 representation of the Deputy Sheriffs.\nThe Association filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which we granted on the following issue:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the PLRB\u2019s dismissal of the sheriffs\u2019 association\u2019s petition to represent deputy sheriffs as police officers under Act 111, when the PLRB disregarded Hartshorn v. County of Allegheny [460 Pa. 560], 333 A.2d 914 (Pa.1975), and Commonwealth v. PLRB [502 Pa. 7], 463 A.2d 409 (Pa.1983).\nAllegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 606 Pa. 506, 1 A.3d 867 (2010) (per curiam).\nOur review of a decision by the PLRB is limited to determining whether there has been a violation of constitutional rights, an error of law, a procedural irregularity, or whether the findings of the PLRB are supported by substantial evidence. Borough of Ellwood City v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 606 Pa. 356, 998 A.2d 589, 594 (2010). The PLRB\u2019s decision must be upheld if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and if the conclusions of law drawn from those facts are reasonable. Id. Further, the PLRB\u2019s interpretation of a governing statute is to be given controlling weight unless clearly erroneous. Id. Because we conclude that the PLRB\u2019s decision here constitutes an error of law, we reverse.\nContrary to the conclusions of the Commonwealth Court and the PLRB, the controlling factor in this case is that the General Assembly, in two separate pieces of legislation, specifically singled out for definition as police officers, deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class. No other deputy sheriffs in this Commonwealth have been so defined by the General Assembly. Indeed, the general definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d in the Crimes Code does not simply include the Deputy Sheriffs; rather, \u201cdeputy sheriffs of a county of the second class who have successfully completed\u201d MPETL training are the only law enforcement personnel mentioned as being included in the definition of \u201cpolice officer.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103. Based on these circumstances and our holdings in the analogous cases of Hartshorn v. County of Allegheny, 460 Pa. 560, 333 A.2d 914 (1975), and Commonwealth v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 502 Pa. 7, 463 A.2d 409 (1983) (\u201cCapitol Police \u201d), we now hold that deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class are police officers for purposes of Act 111.\nWhile Act 111 does not define \u201cpolice\u201d or \u201cpolice officer,\u201d neither does PERA single out deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class as \u201cemployees\u201d subject to its provisions; rather, PERA simply defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \u201cany individual employed by a public employer\u201d except for certain categories of public employees including those \u201ccovered under\u201d Act 111. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(2).\nWe have held on two prior occasions that certain nontraditional \u201cpolice-officer\u201d law enforcement personnel fall under Act Ill\u2019s reach because of their legislative definition as police officers in statutes unrelated to Act 111. In Hartshorn, supra, this Court held that Section 1440(b) of the Second Class County Code \u201cmakes clear that the legislature intended county detectives to be classified as policemen\u201d for purposes of Act 111 bargaining rights: \u201c[sjince 16 P.S. \u00a7 4440(b) establishes that [the county detectives] are policemen, their right to collective bargaining is then clear under Act 111.\u201d Hartshorn, supra at 915-16.\nSection 1440(b) simply provides:\n(b) County detectives shall at all times be subject to the orders of the district attorney, and shall investigate and make report to the district attorney as to the conduct in office of magistrates, constables, deputy constables and other officers connected with the administration of criminal justice, to make investigations, and endeavor to obtain such evidence as may be required by the district attorney in any criminal case, and perform such other duties as the district attorney may direct. Said detectives shall be general police officers and shall have all powers now conferred on constables by existing laws of this Commonwealth, so far as they relate to crime or criminal procedure, and they shall serve subpoenas in cases in which the Commonwealth is a party in a court of record.\n16 P.S. \u00a7 4440(b) (emphasis added). Neither 16 P.S. \u00a7 4440(b) nor the Second Class County Code generally makes mention of Act 111.\nIn Capitol Police, supra, we held that the Capitol Police are legislatively vested with Act 111 police powers under Section 646 of the Administrative Code, which provides in pertinent part:\n\u00a7 646 Capitol Police, Commonwealth Property Police and Campus Police\nThe Capitol Police ... shall have the power, and their duty shall be: (a) To enforce good order in State buildings and on State grounds ...; (b) To protect the property of the Commonwealth in State grounds and buildings ...; (c) To exclude all disorderly persons from the premises ...; (d) In the performance of their duties to adopt whatever means may be necessary; (e) To exercise the same powers as are now or may hereafter be exercised under authority of law or ordinance by the police of the cities of Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, municipalities in Dauphin County wherein State buildings are located ...; ... (g) To order off said grounds and out of said buildings all vagrants, loafers, trespassers, and persons under the influence of liquor, and, if necessary, remove them by force, and, in case of resistance, carry such offenders before an alderman, justice of the peace or magistrate^] and (h) To arrest any person who shall damage, mutilate or destroy the trees, plants, shrubbery, turf, grass-plots, benches, buildings or structures, or commit any other offense within State buildings....\n71 P.S. \u00a7 646 (emphasis added).\nMore specifically, in Capitol Police, we reversed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination that the Capitol Police serving in Scranton may not be considered police officers for purposes of Act 111, holding that Section 646 of the Administrative Code makes clear that \u201cCapitol Police serving in Scranton are empowered as are Scranton Police and police generally throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d Capitol Police, supra at 413.\nIn the instant case, deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class have been specifically designated by the General Assembly as police officers in the Crimes Code and the MPETL. See, respectively, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103, and 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162. The Commonwealth Court did not consider such designations sufficient for Act 111 purposes because they lack further explanatory language or the grant of specific powers that the Commonwealth Court concluded was evident in the Second Class County Code and the Administrative Code regarding, respectively, second-class county detectives and the Capitol Police. See ACDSAII, supra at 95-97.\nContrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis, when the legislature designates a specific class of law enforcement personnel as \u201cpolice officers,\u201d it is not then required to add the words, \u201cwhich means that these individuals are hereby legislatively authorized to be or act as police officers\u201d in order for its meaning to be made clear. Further, we disagree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s assertion that Section 1440(b) of the Second Class County Code adds meaningful illumination to its designation of second-class county detectives as police officers when it states: \u201cSaid detectives shall be general police officers and shall have all powers now conferred on constables by existing laws of this Commonwealth, so far as they relate to crime or criminal procedure.\u201d 16 P.S. \u00a7 4440(b). The same may be said of the language describing the Capitol Police, to wit, as law enforcement personnel who may \u201cexercise the same powers as are now or may hereafter be exercised under authority of law or ordinance by the police of the cities of Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, [and] municipalities in Dauphin County.\u201d 71 P.S. \u00a7 646. Essentially, these statutory provisions, which we used to determine inclusion under Act 111, merely note that certain law enforcement personnel are, or may act, as police officers. The additional verbiage in these statutes, which the Commonwealth Court concluded was determinative in differentiating these statutes from 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103 and 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162, adds little or nothing of any practical nature to the essential definition of these law enforcement personnel as \u201cpolice officers.\u201d\nMoreover, we note the significance of the MPETL definition of \u201cpolice department\u201d as including:\n(1) A public agency of a political subdivision having general police powers and charged with making arrests in connection with the enforcement of the criminal or traffic laws. This paragraph includes the sheriffs office in a county of the second class.\n53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162 (emphasis added).\nThe MPETL\u2019s definition of \u201cpolice department\u201d goes on to identify five other law enforcement organizations, listing the Capitol Police at subparagraph 4. Unmistakably, however, the General Assembly chose to give \u201cthe sheriffs office in a county of the second class\u201d the same primacy as municipal police departments by placing them both in the same first subparagraph. From the specificity of this definition, the legislature\u2019s view of deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class as police officers substantially on a par with traditional municipal police could not be made more plain. Significantly, as the PLRB found, the Deputy Sheriffs are also required to be trained to be police officers pursuant to the MPETL. See 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2167 (requiring the training of police officers and all members of police departments, as defined by the MPETL). Therefore, this case is not distinguishable, in any significant manner, from our prior determinations that Act 111 applied to certain law enforcement personnel based on the language of the relevant statutory scheme governing those specific employees. See Hartshorn, supra; Capitol Police, supra.\nOur inquiry with respect to the question accepted for review ends with the recognition that the General Assembly expressly defined \u2014 and thus authorized \u2014 deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class to be police officers. The pains the legislature took to specifically single out these particular law enforcement personnel, together with our holdings in Hartshorn and Capitol Police, lead to the conclusion that deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class are police officers falling under Act 111. Thus, the PLRB\u2019s and Commonwealth Court\u2019s application of a judicially and administratively created test to examine whether the Deputy Sheriffs are police officers, after they have been defined as such by the General Assembly, was erroneous.\nFor the above reasons, the order of the Commonwealth Court is vacated, and this matter is remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustices SAYLOR, BAER, and TODD join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 217.1-217.10. Act 111 expressly gives police officers and fire fighters the right of collective bargaining concerning working conditions and the swift and final resolution of disputes by non-appealable arbitration. See 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.1.\n. See Venneri v. County of Allegheny, 12 Pa.Cmwlth. 517, 316 A.2d 120 (1974), and Allegheny County Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 95 Pa.Cmwlth. 132, 504 A.2d 437 (1986) (en banc) (\"ACDSA I\").\n. Section 1101.805 of PERA provides:\nNotwithstanding any other provisions of this act[,] where representatives of units of guards at prisons or mental hospitals or units of employes directly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts of this Commonwealth have reached an impasse in collective bargaining and mediation as required in [43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.801] has not resolved the dispute, the impasse shall be submitted to a panel of arbitratorsf,] whose decision shall be final and binding upon both parties^] with the proviso that the decisions of the arbitrators which would require legislative enactment to be effective shall be considered advisory only.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805 (footnote omitted).\n. The PLRB summarizes its findings of fact, in relevant part, as follows:\nThe primary duty of approximately 70-75 deputy sheriffs [of the approximately 150 employed by Allegheny County] is to provide courtroom security for the County\u2019s common pleas judges and district magistrates. The primary responsibility of approximately 24-26 deputy sheriffs is to transport prisoners to court proceedings. Seven deputy sheriffs are assigned to hospital duty and watch prisoners taken to the hospital from the County jail pursuant to an order of the common pleas court. Approximately 12 deputy sheriffs serve writs or other process issued by the common pleas court during daylight hours, and two deputy sheriffs serve housing warrants on the evening shift at the court\u2019s request. Approximately 16 deputy sheriffs work in the investigation unit of the Sheriff\u2019s office and are assigned arrest warrants for fugitives who are subject to the jurisdiction of the court.\nThe Sheriff requires the deputy sheriffs to attend training provided by the Municipal Police Officers' Education and Training Commission (MPOETC). Upon completion of such training, the MPOETC issues certification cards that identify the deputy sheriffs as police officers. The deputy sheriffs carry firearms outside the courthouse, are expected by the Sheriff to exercise their arrest powers, and have made arrests for crimes committed in their presence. However, the vast majority of arrests by deputy sheriffs are made pursuant to court-issued warrants.\nPLRB Final Order, entered April 21, 2009, at 2-3.\n. We affirmed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision that approved the \"police\u201d status of Capitol Police serving in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Harrisburg for purposes of Act 111. Commonwealth v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 502 Pa. 7, 463 A.2d 409, 413 (1983) (\"Capitol Police \u201d).\n. The MPETL also defines the Capitol Police as police officers. See 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162.\n. Further, in Capitol Police, we explained that the duties of the Capitol Police as \"guards\u201d and \"police officers\u201d were \"not mutually exclusive and there is necessarily an overlapping of functions.\u201d Id. at 411. As we stated, \"[W]e are not persuaded that the status of the Capitol Police as 'police' is to depend upon frequency of [police-related] acts____In the event of need, [the Capitol Police] possess the ability, capacity and authority to interpose in any situation requiring police intervention.\u201d Id. at 412. The same analysis applies with respect to the Deputy Sheriffs.\n. Intervening in the proceedings below, Allegheny County argued that it would be unconstitutional for the Deputy Sheriffs to be afforded Act 111 police officer status, citing Article III, Section 31 and Article III, Section 32(1) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Because the Commonwealth Court determined that its disposition of the Association\u2019s appeal obviated any need to address the County's constitutional concerns, it did not review the County\u2019s arguments. Allegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 990 A.2d 86, 95 n. 12 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010). Because these constitutional claims were not addressed below and, moreover, appear to fall beyond the scope of the question accepted for review, we decline to address them here and remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court. See Warehime v. Warehime, 563 Pa. 400, 761 A.2d 1138, 1142 n. 4 (2000).\n. We additionally note that nothing in Section 805 of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805, relied upon in part by the Commonwealth Court, compels, or even suggests, a different result. That section merely references the procedure to be followed when representatives of employees \"directly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts\u201d (among other PERA employees) have reached a bargaining impasse. This section does not provide that deputy sheriffs of counties of the second class must be represented by such unit representatives. Again, PERA defines employees as any public employee except for certain defined employees, specifically including those covered under Act 111. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(2).",

        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent. I would affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding that deputy sheriffs of second class counties are not \u201cpolicemen\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111 of 1968, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 217.1-217.10 (\u201cAct 111\u201d), but are instead employees covered by the Pennsylvania Public Employe Relations Act (the \u201cPERA\u201d).\nAs the majority concedes, our review of this appeal arising out of a decision by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (the \u201cPLRB\u201d) is limited to determining whether there has been a violation of constitutional rights, an error of law, a procedural irregularity, or whether the findings of the PLRB are supported by substantial evidence. Majority Opinion at 131, 41 A.3d at 843 (citing Borough of Ellwood City v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 606 Pa. 356, 998 A.2d 589, 594 (2010)). A reviewing court must uphold the PLRB\u2019s decision if its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and if the conclusions of law drawn from those facts are reasonable. Ellwood City, supra; Commonwealth v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 502 Pa. 7, 463 A.2d 409, 411 (1983) (\u201cCapitol Police \u201d). The court must give controlling weight to the PLRB\u2019s interpretation of a governing statute unless it is clearly erroneous. Ellwood City, 998 A.2d at 594.\nThe PLRB asserts that, like the courts, it uses a two-part test for determining what employees are considered \u201cpolicemen\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111: whether 1) they are legislatively authorized to act as police; and 2) they \u201cin fact effectively act as police.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 14. Although the sheriffs do perform some police-type duties, according to the PLRB, their work remains primarily court-related. Since the examiner\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence presented, the PLRB contends that its decision that the deputy sheriffs are not Act 111 policemen was correct. My review reveals that the PLRB\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes was not clearly erroneous, and its findings were supported by the evidence. I would therefore reject the arguments of the Allegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d) to the contrary.\nThe question of whether deputy sheriffs in counties of the second class are \u201cpolice officers\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111, or are instead employees covered by the arbitration provisions of the PERA, is ultimately a question of legislative intent, and there is no statutory provision that plainly expresses this intention. The Majority gleans its conclusion instead from what amounts to vague, indirect or circumstantial evidence of legislative intent, based on definitions in the Crimes Code, and the Municipal Police Education and Training Law (\u201cMPETL\u201d). The Majority concludes that public employees who perform some police or police-like duties, and who are identified as \u201cpolice officers\u201d in unrelated statutes, have been granted the same collective bargaining rights as the \u201cpolicemen\u201d expressly referred to in Act 111 \u2014 ie., that the term \u201cpolice officers\u201d always carries a specialized meaning, with collateral collective bargaining trappings, regardless of the statutory or factual context.\nOur prior determinations that Act 111 applied to certain employees derived from the language of the relevant statutory scheme governing those specific employees, which conferred policing powers, and not from external or circumstantial sources for the conclusion. See, e.g., Hartshorn v. County of Allegheny, 460 Pa. 560, 333 A.2d 914 (1975) (statutory language provides that \u201c[county] detectives shall be general police officers\u201d); Capitol Police, supra (statutory language provides that Capitol police may \u201cexercise the same powers\u201d within their jurisdiction as police in Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia). The Majority insists that these cases are analogous here, but I respectfully cannot agree.\nWe have held that the legislative grant of policing powers is of substantial concern in considering the status of employees for purposes of determining the applicability of Act 111. Capitol Police, 463 A.2d at 413. The statutes describing the powers of the Capitol Police, for example, made it clear that they have \u201cfull police powers and duties confined jurisdiction-ally to property of the Commonwealth, a geographical limitation not unlike special police forces in other governmental or principality jurisdictions.\u201d Id. at 412 (citing 71 P.S. \u00a7 646, which authorizes Capitol police, inter alia, to \u201cexercise the same powers as are now or may hereafter be exercised under authority of law or ordinance by the police of the cities of Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia ... \u201d).\nSimilarly, the Allegheny County detectives seeking Act 111 coverage in Hartshorn were deemed entitled to such coverage on the basis of express statutory language which specified that those \u201cdetectives shall be general police officers.\u201d 16 P.S. \u00a7 4440(b). This Court held that the statute established that the county detectives \u201care policemen, [and] their right to collective bargaining is then clear under Act 111----\u201d 333 A.2d at 915-16. See also Commonwealth v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 125 Pa.Cmwlth. 549, 558 A.2d 581 (1989) (\u201cPark Rangers \u201d) (Legislature specifically vested state park officers \u25a0with broad police powers within their jurisdiction, and Act 111 applies to them). As the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded in the instant case, absent similar specific legislative direction regarding deputy sheriffs, either throughout the Commonwealth or in second class counties specifically, we should not presume that the General Assembly has intended that they be deemed police officers for purposes of Act 111, merely because they receive police officer training and certification under the MPETL, or are defined as \u201cpolice officers\u201d in an unrelated criminal statute. Allegheny County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 990 A.2d 86, 97 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010).\nAlong these same lines, this Court determined that sheriffs, \u201cwhile performing vital and necessary duties in the Commonwealth, are not \u2018investigative or law enforcement officers\u2019\u201d under the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (\u201cWiretapping Act\u201d), 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5701-82. Kopko v. Miller, 586 Pa. 170, 892 A.2d 766, 767 (2006). Our decision in Kopko was based on the language of the Wiretapping Act, which grants authority to an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer\u201d who is \u201cempowered by law to conduct investigations of or to make arrests for\u201d certain predicate offenses listed in the Act, and who is \u201ca member of the Pennsylvania State Police or an individual employed as a police officer who holds a current certificate under 53 Pa.C.S. Ch. 21 Subch. D (relating to municipal police education and training).\u201d Id. at 768, 780 (quoting from 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5702 & 5704(16)(iii)). We concluded that the sheriffs were not \u201cinvestigative and law enforcement officers\u201d under the Wiretapping Act, despite the fact that two of the sheriffs had in fact completed training under the MPETL. None of the sheriffs in Kopko were employed as \u201cpolice officers\u201d pursuant to the MPETL. Id. at 768 & n. 2. Although we acknowledged that the \u201crole of sheriffs in the Commonwealth commands our utmost respect,\u201d and it certainly does, we could not ignore the terms of the Wiretapping Act and determined that it \u201cis incumbent on the legislature to specify that the Sheriffs are encompassed within the definition of \u2018investigative or law enforcement officers,\u2019 in order to reach a different conclusion.\u201d Id. at 770.\nI am well aware of the essential law enforcement role played by the dedicated employees of the sheriffs office in Allegheny County. But, I would not blithely set aside the General Assembly\u2019s use of the specific term \u201cpolicemen\u201d to limit the application of Act 111. The Majority adopts the Association\u2019s reasoning that deputy sheriffs should be accorded Act 111 coverage by extrapolating from their \u201cpolice-type\u201d duties and training, and from statutory language in the Crimes Code and the MPETL. In my view, neither basis supports such a result as a matter of the intended scope of Act 111.\nI do note the limited value in this appeal of many of our existing cases concerning sheriffs, which did not present questions of labor law but instead arose out of challenges to sheriffs\u2019 law enforcement authority. Sheriffs are long-standing officers in this Commonwealth, and, indeed, in Anglo-American history. Sheriffs have performed varied duties over the centuries, which have included law enforcement functions, and we have respected that history in construing challenges to their residual authority. The parties\u2019 arguments reflect this dearth of precisely apposite case law by focusing primarily on the various duties that deputies presently execute, and how these duties do or do not functionally make them \u201cpolice\u201d under Act 111. But, more important in determining which of two labor law statutes \u2014 Act 111 or the PERA \u2014 governs the employment terms of these particular public employees, is the consideration of the unique role of sheriffs in relation to the functions of the court system.\nThe sheriff at early common law acted as a \u201cjudge\u201d in the modern sense, and we have noted that, as the judiciary developed, \u201cthe sheriffs role evolved from that of judge to that of court officer.\u201d Commonwealth v. Leet, 537 Pa. 89, 641 A.2d 299, 301-02 (1994). Provisions of general application to all sheriffs throughout the Commonwealth give this Court a role in providing rules of practice, procedure, and conduct for sheriffs and their deputies. The Pennsylvania Constitution provides:\nThe Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts, justices of the peace and all officers serving process or enforcing orders, judgments or decrees of any court or justice of the peace.... All laws shall be suspended to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under these provisions.\nPa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(c) (emphasis supplied). According to the Commonwealth\u2019s Judicial Code, \u201c[t]he sheriff, either personally or by deputy, shall serve process and execute orders directed to him pursuant to law.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2921. See also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102 (sheriffs are officers \u201cenforcing orders\u201d and are included as personnel of the unified judicial system existing under Article V, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution). Thus, the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that:\n[substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings that Deputies\u2019 primary duties remain court-related. Deputies provide courtroom security, transport prisoners, watch hospitalized prisoners, serve writs, and locate and apprehend fugitives. Deputies perform some police-type functions. However, Deputies[\u2019] primary duties do not fall within the realm of Act 111 police work. Rather, Deputies[\u2019] primary duties are directly related to the operation of the County courts.\n990 A.2d at 98 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).\nIn my view, the lower tribunals properly determined that, despite their voluntary execution of certain incidental \u201cpolice-type\u201d duties, the primary responsibility of deputies in Allegheny County remains to the courts. Simply because the Sheriffs Office assumes police-type activities does not confer upon the office or its personnel the legal determination of \u201cpolice officer\u201d for collective bargaining purposes. The Majority reaches far afield to so conclude. One does not become a \u201cpolice officer\u201d by osmosis. As the deputies are public employees \u201cdirectly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts,\u201d they are thus governed by the provisions of the PERA. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805.1 cannot conclude that they are \u201cpolicemen\u201d for purposes of collective bargaining under Act 111.\nTherefore, I respectfully dissent.\n. Act 195 of 1970, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.101-1101.2301. Section 805 of the PERA provides that when \"units of employes directly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts of this Commonwealth have reached an impasse in collective bargaining and mediation,\u201d the impasse shall be submitted to arbitration. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.805.\n. The PLRB found that the \"primary duty of approximately 70-75 deputy sheriffs is to provide courtroom security for the County\u2019s common pleas judges and district magistrates. The primary responsibility of approximately 24-26 deputy sheriffs is to transport prisoners to court proceedings. Seven deputy sheriffs are assigned to hospital duty and watch prisoners taken to the hospital from the County jail pursuant to an order of the common pleas court. Approximately 12 deputy sheriffs serve writs or other process issued by the common pleas court during daylight hours, and two deputy sheriffs serve housing warrants on the evening shift at the court\u2019s request. Approximately 16 deputy sheriffs work in the investigation unit of the Sheriff's office and are assigned arrest warrants for fugitives who are subject to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 9 (citations omitted). See also Majority Opinion at 129-30 n. 4, 41 A.3d at 841-42 n. 4.\n. The PLRB notes that this is the \"third time that the Allegheny County deputy sheriffs have sought a determination that they are police officers under Act 111,\u201d and that there has been no change in circumstances to justify a different result this time. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 4-6 (citing Venneri v. County of Allegheny, 12 Pa.Cmwlth. 517, 316 A.2d 120 (1974) and Allegheny County Deputy Sheriff's Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 95 Pa.Cmwlth. 132, 504 A.2d 437 (1986)). The primary duties of the deputy sheriffs are still \"directly related to the operation of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas,\u201d and the primary duty of most deputy sheriffs is to provide courtroom security for judges and magistrates, transport prisoners to court, and serve writs or other process. Id. at 8-9. \"Nearly all of the investigative work performed by the deputy sheriffs is directed at apprehending fugitives who are already subject to the jurisdiction of the courts.\" Id. at 9-10. According to the PLRB, there are no communities in Allegheny County where the deputy sheriffs provide primary police protection; instead, at most, they \"back up\u201d or substitute for municipal police officers. Id. at 11.\n. Section 103 of the Crimes Code defines \"police officer\u201d as including \"deputy sheriffs of a county of the second class who have successfully completed the requirements under [the MPETL].\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103. The MPETL, in relevant part, defines \"police department\u201d as: \"(1) A public agency of a political subdivision having general police powers and charged with making arrests in connection with the enforcement of the criminal or traffic laws. This paragraph includes the sheriff\u2019s office in a county of the second class.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2162. Section 2162 also defines \"police officer,\u201d in relevant part, as a \u201cdeputy sheriff of a county of the second class.\u201d Id.\n. For example, the PLRB discusses Commonwealth v. Leet, 537 Pa. 89, 641 A.2d 299 (1994), where we considered deputy sheriffs' common law power to make warrantless arrests for breaches of the peace committed in their presence, and determined that they now may exercise that power in the context of Motor Vehicle Code violations. See also Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Kline, 559 Pa. 646, 741 A.2d 1281 (1999) (deputy sheriff who received same training as municipal police officer was authorized to enforce Vehicle Code). But, in my view, the use of the term \"police officer\u201d when referring to deputy sheriffs in the context of their duties is not dispositive of the question of what statute governs the employment status of these public employees. See also Commonwealth v. Dobbins, 594 Pa. 71, 934 A.2d 1170, 1180 (2007) (\"no legal authority whatsoever\u201d supports treating sheriffs as comparable to police officers with regard to conducting independent criminal investigations; sheriffs have only such independent investigatory authority as is expressly authorized by statute).\n. Sheriffs' duties within the unified judicial system include holding judicial sales, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991 (sale conducted by officer or person authorized for purpose by some competent tribunal), and collecting proceeds from recognizances taken in open court for distribution by a judge, such as costs of prosecution and apprehension and victim compensation, 53 P.S. \u00a7 17088. See also 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301 (court of common pleas may authorize sale of personal or real property under Orphans\u2019 Court jurisdiction); 21 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 274, 274a, 274b (sheriff's sales in mortgage foreclosure); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4134 (power to take into custody persons fined for contempt until fine paid or discharged); 50 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4419, 4425 (power to apprehend and return committed persons escaped from mental hospital); 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7282-83, 16040 (sheriff\u2019s sale for failure to pay local taxes; delivery of deed).\n. The PLRB\u2019s summary, in footnote 2 supra, amply demonstrates the record evidence supporting the conclusion that the primary function of deputy sheriffs remains court-related. In addition, Intervenor Allegheny County filed a brief in opposition to the Association's position, and argues that the General Assembly placed deputies within the jurisdiction of the PERA, rather than Act 111, because of the deputies\u2019 role in the operation of the courts of the Commonwealth. The County asserts that even the majority of the work done by the deputy sheriffs\u2019 investigations unit relates to people who are already subject to warrants, or is otherwise related to the work of the courts. According to the County, classifying the deputies as Act 111 employees \"would undermine the independence of the judicial branch\u201d by reducing the court's authority over hiring, firing and supervising these employees. Intervenor\u2019s Brief at 10. Moreover, says the County, treating deputy sheriffs of Allegheny County differently from those in other counties would violate equal protection principles established in DeFazio v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n, 562 Pa. 431, 756 A.2d 1103, 1106 (2000) (\"One particular county officer may not be treated differently from the other similar officers throughout the commonwealth merely because that officer is within a certain class of county.\u201d).",
