Gibbs then sought <em>habeas corpus </em>relief in the district court, which denied the petition as to all claims.

This, however, appears to contemplate the Commonwealth’s impeachment of its own witness, which presents an additional analytical hurdle for which the majority does not account, even absent consideration of the fact that the impeachment is via compelled, as opposed to voluntary, disclosures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

As Appellant stresses, however, the <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>present review is of a pre-trial ruling compelling his submission to an oral examination, which was of substantial relevance to his own decision-making. Moreover, the Commonwealth chose to go forward with its efforts to obtain authorization to use compelled disclosures; thus, it assumed the risk associated with the ensuing appellate review of such license. In this regard, meritorious preserved claims of trial court error implicate the harmless error standard, pursuant to which the Commonwealth is required to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error had no effect on the verdict. <em>See Commonwealth v. Howard, </em><a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="538 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="475553" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01">538 Pa. 86</a>, 100, <a href="/pa/538/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="645 A.2d 1300" data-case-ids="475553,7874424" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0086-01,/a2d/645/1300-01">645 A.2d 1300</a>, 1307 (1994). Thus, to the degree the trial court erred, as I believe it did,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> it is the Commonwealth’s responsibility, and not Appellant’s, to address the vagaries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

Frank, </em><a href="/f3d/387/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="387 F.3d 268" data-case-ids="9153203" data-case-paths="/f3d/387/0268-01">387 F.3d 268</a> (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that the scope of a defendant’s waiver of his right against self-incrimination in connection with a compelled examination must be understood in light of any <em>Miranda-iike </em>warnings issued to the defendant at the time of the examination). <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 321, 42 A.3d at 998. I differ with this approach, since warning-type issues have not been briefed in the present case. To the extent the Commonwealth may have wished to rely on such warnings as a basis for the admission of Dr. Michals’ testimony, it seems to me that it should have developed this on the record in the pre-trial proceedings in the second case. <em>Cf.

An additional difference in the testimony of the two experts concerns an event that allegedly happened a long time prior to the killing — an event that could have had a significant impact on the jury. Dr. Michals testified that he had "gathered information that the Defendant used a gun while he was involved in a fight when he was 19 or 20 with a boyfriend of a girl he had gotten involved with.” N.T. May 1, 2002, at 144. Dr. Fink, however, did not mention this incident. <em>See id. </em>at 92.</p>

The majority does not appear to view Appellant’s statements to Dr. Michals as compelled in the first instance, since absent the presentation of a diminished capacity defense, Appellant would not have been subjected to an examination by the Commonwealth's psychiatric expert. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 319 n. 7, 42 A.3d at 996 n. 7. However, the majority, and the caselaw upon which it relies, nonetheless characterize such statements as compelled. <em>See id. </em>at 320, 42 A.3d at 997 ("A defendant who raises a mental health defense can be compelled to submit to a psychiatric examination.”) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Morley, </em><a href="/pa/545/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="545 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="465013" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0420-01">545 Pa. 420</a>, 426-27, <a href="/pa/545/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="681 A.2d 1254" data-case-ids="465013,7867374" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0420-01,/a2d/681/1254-01">681 A.2d 1254</a>, 1257 (1996)). Moreover, I agree with Appellant that the admission of such statements becomes particularly problematic when the Commonwealth seeks to use them at a second trial in which Appellant is not putting his mental status at issue or presenting his own psychiatric expert. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Sartin, </em><a href="/pa/561/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="561 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="92966" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0522-01">561 Pa. 522</a>, 528, <a href="/a2d/751/1140-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="751 A.2d 1140" data-case-ids="11514051,92966" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/1140-01,/pa/561/0522-01">751 A.2d 1140</a>, 1143 (2000) ("The Commonwealth may only utilize the results of its psychological examination in a rebuttal capacity, and only as to those issues which have been implicated by the expert testimony of the defendant’s psychiatrist.”).</p>
