The Board filed its timely Petition for Review in this Court on October 12, 2010, and requested a stay from the supervising judge pending review by this Court.

The Board asserts that the rights involved are too important to be denied review. Finally, the Board asserts that the claimed right would be irreparably lost and would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment in any criminal case arising from the grand jury investigation.

The OAG asserts that no exception to the mootness doctrine exists here. In the OAG’s view, the issues raised are not likely to evade review in the future because other Commonwealth agency litigants will have the same choice of either complying with a subpoena or challenging the validity of the subpoena through contempt proceedings.

The Board suggests that the supervising judge’s ruling cloaks the OAG with almost unfettered power and alters the basic form of government by elevating the OAG to a position far superior to that of its fellow Commonwealth agencies.

In so doing, as to both arguments, the Court apparently accepts the OAG’s view that the only appropriate way for the Board to secure review was to defy the subpoena and for its members and executive director to invite a finding of contempt and the potential sanction of incarceration. I recognize the support for that view in our prior cases via extrapolations of the holdings in our prior cases. But, I question whether the rationale for those restrictions should apply in this matter, where the subjects of the subpoena, who have been threatened with incarceration, are public employees of a public agency arguably just trying to do their jobs; they have complied with the subpoena, thus ensuring no delay in the grand jury proceedings; and they seek review of important privilege issues that could affect all governmental agencies.</p>

      <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>This case is unusual in that the dispute ultimately is between the OAG in its own independent executive capacity, and another executive agency in its .capacity. Although the privilege issues are playing out with the Gaming Control Board, the dispute is not unique to that particular executive entity: indeed, any executive or governmental entity could be the subject of a grand jury investigation conducted by the OAG. Moreover, the privilege arguments forwarded by the Board are not designed to protect the private interests of its members or employees, or to delay the grand jury investigation— the Board’s ultimate compliance proves as much — but are forwarded in an apparent good-faith effort by a public agency to ensure that it discharges its office with fidelity, as it understands that duty. The Board’s arguments on the privilege merits may be appropriate or not. But, I believe that this circumstance, involving a public governmental entity and its employees seeking an answer to novel, important, and potentially recurring issues of privilege does not warrant resort to the Hobson’s choice of “go to jail in contempt or forfeit the opportunity for any review.” Indeed, I view the Board’s compliance as an exceedingly reasonable recognition of, and accommodation of, the time pressures that attend the grand jury process, where appellate delays may impede the grand jury’s ability to complete its task. I would not penalize the accommodation by denying review in this instance by the rote application of principles designed for less compelling circumstances, and thereby instruct public employees that they must go to jail in order to forward a good faith challenge of first impression in a matter such as this.</p>
