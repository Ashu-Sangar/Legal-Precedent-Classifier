According to Dr. Teta, Dr. Maddox did not follow the scientific method in proceeding from hypothesis through scientific proof in support of his conclusions. Rather, she asserted, the pathologist ignored an established hierarchy of scientific evidence; employed a selective approach to the scientific literature; and, in particular, disregarded a wealth of epidemiological evidence to the effect that those who work with automotive friction products do not suffer from a higher incidence of mesothelioma than is found in the general population. <em>See supra </em>note 1. Additionally, Dr. Teta observed that the any-exposure opinion is inconsistent with the common understanding that the context and circumstances of exposure to toxic substances — including the critical component of dose — matter greatly in terms of determining the risk of disease. <em>See generally </em>Bernard D. Goldstein, <em>Toxic Torts: The Devil Is In the Dose, </em><a href="/citations/?q=16%20J.L.%20%26%20Pol%27y%20551" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 J.L. &amp; Pol'y 551">16 J.L. <em>&amp; </em>Pol’y 551</a>, 551 (2008) (“Dose is a central concept in toxicology — ‘the dose makes the poison’ is the oldest maxim in the field.”).

Much of such testimony is sophisticated and difficult to comprehend, and an analysis of the scientific validity of the methodologies underlying the testimony is simply beyond the capabilities of most lay persons. Therefore, the gatekeeping role of the court, far from detracting from the jury's function, is in fact essential to it: scientific methodology and conclusions must initially be scrutinized by the court to ensure that what might appear to the jury to be science is not in fact speculation in disguise. Properly supported scientific evidence, however complex, can then reach the jury for its consideration, while material whose complexity merely hides its unreliability is winnowed out.
