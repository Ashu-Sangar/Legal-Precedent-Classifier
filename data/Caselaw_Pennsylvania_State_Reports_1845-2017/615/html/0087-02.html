(This Court has not yet had an opportunity to address Section 2778a.) Article If, Section 2 of the Constitution does not establish a specific time frame in which the presiding officer must act to discharge his ministerial duty to issue writs of election; albeit, use of the words “whenever” and “shall” convey that alacrity is required. Moreover, and notably, the Constitution does not repose any discretion in the presiding officer of either chamber to permit regularly scheduled elections to go by without issuing writs to fill vacant seats.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In contrast, the Election Code specifically addresses timing, and corroborates that the Constitution contemplates that writs should issue quickly. Thus, the Code generally requires the presiding officer of the affected legislative branch to act almost immediately to fill vacancies: within ten days of a vacancy, the presiding officer must “issue a writ of election to the proper county board or boards of election and to the Secretary of the Commonwealth, for a special election to fill <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>said vacancy, which election shall be held at the next ensuing primary, municipal or general election scheduled at least sixty (60) days after the issuance of the writ....” 25 P.S. § 2778.</p>

The Speaker argues that this provision confers upon him a discretionary power to delay issuing writs of election indefinitely, until a final reapportionment plan has force of law.

We think that the statute, insofar as it applies to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, may be, and properly should be, construed in a narrower sense that avoids this obvious constitutional tension. <em>See In re F.C.

Every Pennsylvania House seat is voted upon every two years. A new reapportionment plan, once final, takes effect at the next ensuing primary and general election; it does not operate retroactively to remake the districts of sitting House members for the remainder of their terms; it simply does not disrupt existing terms. Thus, unlike his presiding officer counterpart in the Senate, the Speaker of the House does not need to abide the outcome of a redistricting plan to know where to schedule the special elections the Constitution requires him to call, in order to fill vacancies for the remainder of these two-year terms. In short, there is no apparent reason why the <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>constitutionally mandated, ministerial duty to issue writs of election to fill vacant House seats can or should be deferred pending the outcome of the reapportionment process.</p>

While the 2011 Legislative Reapportionment Commission continues its work on a new reapportionment plan going forward, there is no question about what districts are involved here; they are the six districts whose seats have been vacant since January 2012. The 2011 reapportionment otherwise mandated by our Constitution, <em>see </em>Pa. Const, art.

This narrower construction is consistent with the position of petitioners, who do not allege that the Speaker was required to schedule special elections in advance of the primary, and it avoids a potential conflict with the Speaker’s clear, non-discretionary, ministerial duty under the Constitution. The contrary construction offered by the Speaker eviscerates the constitutional provision, requiring citizens to go unrepresented while a reapportionment process, having nothing to do with the identity of the vacant seats in the House, is completed.</p>

In the face of the specific challenge forwarded, we will construe Section 2778a in a fashion that does not conflict with this clear constitutional mandate.

Although now essentially ministerial in nature, writs of election have a long history deriving from English common law regarding Parliamentary elections. Within that history, it is also apparent that the authority to issue writs of election has at times been ill-used. For example, during the Glorious Revolution — the rivalry between King James II and Parliament that ended in 1688 when the King fled the country and abdicated the throne — the King dismissed and dissolved Parliament, then withheld writs of election, which prevented the constitution of a new Parliament against him. The decline of the monarchy and lack thereof in the United States has minimized the potential influence of the writ of election, but it continues to play "the important administrative role of authorizing state officials to provide for the myriad details necessary for holding an election (printing ballots, locating voting places, securing election personnel, and so on).” <em>Judge v. Quinn, </em><a href="/f3d/612/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="612 F.3d 537" data-case-ids="3701270" data-case-paths="/f3d/612/0537-01">612 F.3d 537</a>, 552 (7th Cir.2010) (exploring executive duty to issue writs of election in context of refusal of Illinois governor to issue writ of election for special election to fill United States Senate seat vacated by President-Elect Barack Obama).</p>

Significantly, it is this fundamental, discretionary character of the salient decision which should control the outcome of the present petition, since the requested remedy (mandamus) is appropriate to compel ministerial actions but not to direct the terms of discretionary ones. <em>See, e.g., Safe Harbor Water Power Corp. v.
