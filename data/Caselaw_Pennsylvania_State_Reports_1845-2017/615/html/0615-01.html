In this regard, it is noteworthy that Section 302(a) is reposited in an independent section of the Purdon’s Pennsylvania Statutes compilation (77 P.S. § 461), separate and distinct from Section 302(b)’s location (77 P.S. § 462). This arrangement, coupled with the fact that Section 302(b) is, by far, the more common subject of litigation, tends to explain why Section 302(a) is sometimes overlooked or conflated with Section 302(b) in the courts’ broader statements concerning statutory-employer status. <em>See also Peck v.
