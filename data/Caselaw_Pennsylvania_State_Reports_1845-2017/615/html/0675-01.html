After waiving his rights, Keaton gave a written statement incriminating himself in the killing, and he was charged with murder. Later that day, police questioned Keaton about the June, 1992 rape of another woman, Michelle B.

      <em>Walker </em>detailed the history surrounding “new” direct appeal counsel’s obligation to investigate and present extra-record claims in the wake of <em>Hubbard, </em>as well as the advent of relaxed waiver on collateral review following our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

In short, <em>Hubbard </em>required appellate counsel to raise all claims of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness (including extra-record ones) on direct appeal, or else such issues were waived on collateral review. <em>DeHart </em>subsequently made relaxed waiver available on collateral review of capital cases; direct appeal counsel could reasonably believe extra-record claims relating to trial counsel’s stewardship could be addressed as claims of prior counsel’s ineffectiveness at the collateral stage. As <em>DeHart </em>was decided after direct appellate counsel in <em>Walker </em>filed his brief and the case was argued, he could not reasonably have relied on relaxed waiver when he declined to pursue extra-record claims on direct appeal. <em>See Walker, </em>at 7-8. However, we held appellate counsel could have reasonably <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>relied upon the “extraordinary circumstances” exception, which was derived from the language of the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA, the PCRA’s predecessor). <em>Id., </em>at 8. The exception provided an ineffectiveness claim could be raised where the petitioner was “able to prove the existence of other ‘extraordinary circumstances’ justifying his failure to raise the issue.” 19 P.S. § 1180-4(b)(2) (repealed). Under that provision, global allegations of the ineffectiveness of all prior counsel constituted an “extraordinary circumstance.” <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Commonwealth v.

He invoked his right to remain silent and was not questioned about that offense; counsel was appointed to represent him, and he remained in county prison.

After being given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waiving his rights, Keaton gave an incriminating statement. Later that day, police informed Keaton they wished to question him about several unsolved sexual assault cases; the interviewer questioned Keaton about each case individually, and when Keaton indicated he had information about a case, he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings and waived his rights.

The trial court noted Keaton filed a <em>pro se </em>“petition for withdrawal of counsel” two months prior to trial, which a different judge denied following an <em>in camera </em>hearing. As Keaton’s contention at trial was the same as this prior argument — counsel would not represent him to the best of counsel’s ability — and Keaton offered nothing new in support of his allegation, the trial court concluded Keaton had not demonstrated the attorney-client relationship had deteriorated to the point that counsel could not effectively represent him. <em>See </em>N.T. <em>Voir Dire, </em>9/12/94, at 4-13.</p>

Four of these proposed witnesses testified at the penalty phase. Reviewing their penalty phase testimony and their affidavits, we conclude any testimony they could have offered at the guilt phase would not have been helpful; their penalty phase testimony indicated they did not have frequent contact with Keaton, and his behavior was negatively impacted by his drug use.

Thus, such testimony indicated not only that the family had lost touch with Keaton at the time of the offenses, but also that he acted out of character when he was under the influence of drugs, which was frequently. Furthermore, these witnesses’ affidavits did not aver they were aware of Keaton’s reputation in the community for peacefulness and non-violence, but only that their opinion was he was such a person.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

The Commonwealth asserts trial counsel was probably aware of Keaton’s hospitalization and counseling for drug abuse because Keaton told the expert counsel hired, <em>see </em>N.T.

Thus, the Commonwealth contends, the record does not support the conclusion that trial counsel did not obtain Keaton’s records. Even if trial counsel did not obtain the records, however, the Commonwealth argues the information they contained would not have provided helpful mitigation evidence; Keaton’s school records refute his mental retardation claim, <em>see </em>PCRA Petition Exhibits, Tab 11, his family court records do not indicate he was physically abused as a child, <em>see id., </em>Tab 10, and his hospital records indicate he had no gross cognitive deficits. <em>See id., </em>Tab 12.

The Commonwealth contends this information was more harmful than helpful to Keaton; it was trial counsel’s strategy to portray Keaton as a decent individual worth saving, who had been a kind, reliable person until he became addicted to drugs.

PCRA Hearing, 11/5/02, at 97-99. Following review of the parties’ briefs and the hearing testimony, the PCRA court apparently did not find an additional hearing was necessary, as it denied all of Keaton's guilt phase claims, only awarding relief on his penalty phase mitigation claim.</p>

Indeed, trial counsel admitted it was his usual practice to employ a mental health expert; he offered no reasonable explanation why he ignored this expert's advice and did not call him to testify.

For my own part, I do not find this sentiment to be useful or apt to our appellate review in the death-penalty arena. While a capital defense attorney certainly would not paint his client as deranged, the difficulty he often will encounter is that, by the time of the penalty stage in a capital case, the prosecution will already have established deplorable conduct on the part of the defendant to the satisfaction of the jurors beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the challenge facing counsel is to adduce some evidence to blunt the force of such conclusion, in terms of the degree of the <a id="p751" href="#p751" data-label="751" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*751</a>defendant’s moral culpability (as it relates to the jurors’ selection between life imprisonment and death as the appropriate penalty). Death-penalty lawyers should certainly be aware of the perspective, held by some at least, that explanatory mitigation is the most effective means of doing this. <em>See, e.g., Simmons v. Luebbers, </em><a href="/f3d/299/0929-01" class="citation" data-index="224" data-cite="299 F.3d 929" data-case-ids="11452081" data-case-paths="/f3d/299/0929-01">299 F.3d 929</a>, 938-39 (8th Cir.2002) (“By the time the state was finished with its case, the jury’s perception of Simmons could not have been more unpleasant.
