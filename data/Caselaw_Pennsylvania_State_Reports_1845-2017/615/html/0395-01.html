Appellant discusses the lead opinion in that case, which found a tip from an anonymous informant that another individual was dealing drugs, to be insufficient to establish probable cause for arrest, despite the fact that the police officer had asserted that the informant had previously given information leading to 50 arrests. As Appellant points out, that opinion applied the <em>Gates/Gray </em>totality of the circumstances test and determined that, because the police merely made bald assertions that the informant was reliable, but provided no objective facts establishing his reliability, the failure of the police to corroborate the allegations of the informant rendered the arrest, and the search conducted thereto, illegal.</p>

This, the Commonwealth claims, misconstrues the purpose of an anticipatory search warrant which, in its view, instead requires a showing of probable cause that evidence of a criminal event will be found at a future time following the occurrence of a contingent event, and may be sought even if there is no evidence of past criminal activity which police personally observe. The Commonwealth cites <em>Grubbs </em>as an example, pointing out that, in that case, there was no prior police observation of any criminal activity at the defendant’s house, but, yet, an anticipatory warrant was found to be <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>supported by probable cause since the information in the affidavit established a fair probability that both the triggering event would occur, and evidence of a crime would be found.</p>

In the Commonwealth’s view, the informant’s reliability was corroborated by the fact that the affidavit specifically identified the case where the information he gave led to the seizure of cocaine. The Commonwealth further challenges Appellant’s focus on the fact that the affidavit referred to drug dealing only in the Mercedes and not Appellant’s house, contending that this did not detract from the reasonable conclusion that, since Appellant arranged to sell drugs to the informant at his house, it was likely that he was storing the drugs in the house in anticipation of the sale.</p>

Furthermore, the Commonwealth contends the affidavit therein contained sweeping assertions about the confidential informant’s reliability without providing any supporting details. By contrast, herein, the Commonwealth contends the affidavit provided specific detailed information regarding an identified case in which drugs were seized because of information the informant provided. The Commonwealth distinguishes <em>Smith </em>on the grounds that the officer in that case provided no information the informant was reliable, was incorrect in material facts provided, and that the triggering event was a noncriminal act.</p>

The triggering event here was the completion of a controlled purchase of cocaine at the aforementioned location. The question is whether the information is sufficient to allow a magistrate to conclude there was a “fair probability” that the sale would happen as suggested.</p>

This is an all too common methodology, looking at a document’s shortcomings rather than evaluating its contents. Looking at what is not there is a red herring, causing a departure from the actual question. Our evaluation of course has nothing to do with what is not in the affidavit — the test is solely concerned with what the affidavit does contain.

Moreover, the amount of drugs and marked “buy money” was not insignificant here: four ounces of cocaine were to be purchased for $3800 in pre-recorded bills. As in <em>Coleman, supra, </em>to disapprove of an anticipatory search warrant under these circumstances would force the police to wait until the actual occurrence of an anticipated drug buy, then proceed to a station house to prepare a warrant application, find a magistrate at night and seek approval, all the while risking that the evidence would disappear.</p>
