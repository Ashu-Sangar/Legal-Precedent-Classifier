Furthermore, as we find the lower courts considered the operator’s good faith judgment in concluding the oil and gas lease at issue in the instant case has produced in paying quantities, we affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment entered by the trial court in favor of T.W.

Jedlicka objected to the construction of these new wells, claiming that T.W. Phillips failed to maintain production “in paying quantities” under the habendum clause of the Findley lease, and, as a result, that the lease lapsed and terminated. Specifically, Jedlicka argued that there has not been continuous production in paying quantities on the wells because, in 1959, T.W. Phillips suffered a loss of approximately $40 as a result of operations under the Findley lease.</p>

Prior to trial, Jedlicka filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of Appellees’ post-1974 operating expenses and revenues for Well Nos. 1 through 4 because Appellees did not have any depletion schedules<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> for those wells after 1974.

Appellees further noted that Jedlicka failed to allege any reasons for such inactivity in a timely petition for permission to reinstate the cause of action. Accordingly, Appellees argued that Jedlicka should be precluded from presenting any evidence or testimony regarding the production or operation of the wells on the Findley property prior to 1988. The trial court heard testimony on Appellees’ motion and determined that the lease at issue in the 1988 action was the same as the lease at issue in the case <em>sub judice; </em>however, the trial court was unable to conclude that the issues in the two actions were identical, or that Jedlicka was attempting to argue the same claims, and thus denied Appellees’ motion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Martin of the Indiana County Court of Common Pleas. Following trial, President Judge Martin determined that, notwithstanding the $40 loss suffered in 1959, Appellees had produced gas on their leasehold in paying quantities, and, therefore, that the Findley lease remained in effect. In determining that Appellees produced gas in paying quantities, the trial court relied on this Court’s 1899 decision in <em>Young v. Forest Oil, </em>wherein we held that consideration should be given to a lessee’s good faith judgment when determining whether oil was produced in paying quantities. The trial court noted that Appellees “continued efforts in production after 1959 and [the owners of the Jedlicka tract] continued to receive royalty payments per the lease for more than thirty years without asserting that the lease had expired.” <em>T.W.

The trial court explained, in particular, that the Findley lease “is a pressure lease, not a 1/8 royalty lease,” and “[t]he evidence indicates that the lessees were operating the wells in good faith and there was no evidence that they were holding the land for purely speculative purposes.” <em>Id.</em>

We note that, under the habendum clause, the Findley lease remains valid as long as "oil or gas is produced in paying quantities,” or as long as "operations for oil or gas are being conducted thereon, including the right to drill other wells.” Lease, July 2, 1928, at 1 (R.R. at 13a-14a) Thus, even if gas or oil were not produced in paying quantities, Appellees’ rights under the lease would remain intact for as long as "operations” are conducted. The trial court did not address this possibility in its opinion, and, despite Appellees’ assertions that ”[f]rom the date of the Findley Oil and Gas Lease to the present, ... operations for oil or gas have been conducted,” <em>see </em>Appellees’ Pretrial Memorandum, at 3 (R.R. at 60a), a review of the trial transcript reveals that there was some dispute, not only as to whether Appellees conducted operations for gas during the period of the lease, but also as to what activities constituted "operations” in the first instance. As a result, we are unable to determine whether the Findley lease remains valid under the second part of the habendum clause. Given our disposition of the "in paying quantities” issue, however, such determination is unnecessary.</p>

Jedlicka argues in her brief to this Court that the trial court improperly held that she waived her right to challenge the validity of the Findley lease by accepting royalties from Appellees. Jedlicka contends such a finding is contrary to established law, particularly, <em>Brown, supra. </em>Jedlicka argues that, under <em>Brown, </em>when Appellees failed to produce gas in paying quantities in 1959, any interest Appellees had in the land "lapsed as a matter of law into a tenancy at will, terminable by Ms. Jedlicka at any time,” and, therefore, “there can be no waiver of any right to challenge the validity of the lease.” Appellant’s Brief at 16. Contrary to the terminology used by Jedlicka, the trial court in the instant case did not hold that Jedlicka <em>waived </em>her challenge to the validity of the lease. The trial court simply noted, in its discussion of the $40 loss suffered by T.W. Phillips in 1959, that Jedlicka "continued to receive royalty payments per the lease for more than thirty years without asserting that the lease had expired,” and, thus, received the benefit of the bargain since the inception of the Lease in 1928. <em>T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc., </em>No. 10362 CD 2005, at 5. The court then went on to address her arguments under the lease.

The dissent suggests that our interpretation of <em>Young </em>is based, not on its plain language, but on how other courts have interpreted <em>Young, </em>and avers, "[w]hile arguably reflecting a more modem view of 'paying quantities,’ these cases are in conflict with the plain terms of <em>Young, </em>which impose a threshold, marginal profitability requirement.” <em>See </em>Dissenting Opinion, at 229, 42 A.3d at 280. The dissent further posits that the decisions on which we rely "did not elaborate on the original formulation of the ‘paying quantities’ test,” set forth in <em>Young, </em>but rather "effectively displaced that standard where well production was marginal or sporadic.” <em>Id. </em>at 231, 42 A.3d at 281.

As the majority correctly determines, “the test for determining in paying quantities could never be <em>purely </em>objective, absent picking an arbitrary time period.” Majority Op., at 222, 42 A.3d at 274-75 (emphasis in original). That is because profitability is not measured (under the lease, much less elsewhere) on a calendar year. If Ford loses a billion dollars one year and makes two billion the next, it has sold cars in “paying quantities.” Scouring the 80-year history of a well and finding a 12-month period where expenses were greater than revenue is false accounting for lease purposes and cannot be rewarded.</p>

Here, it is Appellant who is the party attempting to terminate the relationship, even though she has received payments and gas throughout the life of the lease. Therefore, this is not a case where a driller, desiring to get out of a lease, slows production in bad faith and causes the well to not produce in “paying quantities.” Accordingly, I do not believe a review of whether Appellees acted in good faith is necessary for the disposition of this issue.

If profits exceed operating expenses, then the subjective component — the lessee’s good-faith judgment — comes into play. In those instances, it should be presumed that the lessee is operating the lease in good faith, and unless the lessor rebuts this presumption, the lease is said to be producing in “paying quantities.” My reasoning is as follows:</p>
