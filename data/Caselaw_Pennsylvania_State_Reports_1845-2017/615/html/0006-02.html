Admittedly, the plain reading of the statutes presents a statutory scheme whereby the appeal of suspensions of an emission inspector’s certification will be litigated in a manner and forum different from the employer’s appeal from any suspension of its certificate of appointment even though the litigation may arise from the same factual circumstances. We agree that it is certainly more logical and convenient to have the same court conduct hearings on both 'matters at the same time where the underlying charges rest upon the same facts. The fact that this scenario is more desirable, however, does not give rise to an inconsistency or a latent ambiguity. Rather, as the Commonwealth Court dissent points out, the result is a lack of symmetry in the statutory scheme. “There is nothing inherently inconsistent in the existence of two distinct statutory procedures for the resolution of the same disputes, even though the result may be a lack of symmetry in the area.” <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v.

Section 4726(c), however, clearly is not among the five listed determinations of the Department over which the courts of common pleas have been granted jurisdiction by virtue of the exception provided in section 768(c) to the Commonwealth Court’s exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of government agencies.

My primary concern is that the process for judicial review of a mechanic’s suspension sanctioned by the Majority fails to offer either the mechanic or the Department the opportunity to pursue a traditional appeal of right, <em>ie., </em>to obtain review of the findings of fact and conclusions of law on the existing record. The Majority approves a statutory scheme, which provides for: an evidentiary hearing before a Department examiner, 67 Pa.Code § 177.651; a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing — in the guise of an “appeal” — in the Commonwealth Court, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 4726(c), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 763(a), (c), 933(a); and a right for either party to request leave to appeal the Commonwealth Court’s decision to this Court, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 724(a), 723, Pa.R.A.P. 1112 (petition for allowance of appeal). According to the parties, the hearing before the Department’s examiner is informal and off the record, and no transcript is generated or available for a court’s review. Section 4726 then provides the suspended mechanic with the right to a second full evidentiary hearing before a court of record. But, after that second “trial” (masquerading as an “appeal”), the mechanic has no opportunity to file a traditional “appeal” of right following either decision; additionally, the Department is provided no opportunity to seek appellate-style review as of right at either stage of the proceedings. Only review by permission in this Court, following the second, <em>de novo, </em>evidentiary hearing is available to the parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

As the Department explains, the suspensions of the certificates of a mechanic and of the inspection station employing the mechanic are related because the same acts of the mechanic are, in many instances, the factual basis for imposing the suspensions. <em>See </em>Department’s Brief at 9; <em>accord </em>67 Pa.Code §§ 177.602(a)-(b), 177.603. But, unlike a suspended mechanic, the owner of an inspection station with a suspended certificate of appointment may appeal the Department’s adjudication to the court of common pleas of the county where the inspection station is located, <em>see </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 4724(b), 42 Pa.C.S. § 933(a).

Either party then has a right to appeal the common pleas decision to the Superior Court, and may request further leave to appeal the Superior Court decision to this Court. <em>See Grey; </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 724(a). These processes encompass the conventional approach to judicial <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>review and utilize our courts in their traditional roles: the courts of common pleas as courts of first instance, and the Commonwealth Court as an appellate court conducting error review on the existing record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> In my respectful view, I believe it unlikely that the General Assembly intended to single out cases involving mechanics challenging suspensions as instances where appeals of right should not be permitted, despite the constitutional right of appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

The General Assembly is certainly familiar with the classes of matters on which the Commonwealth Court holds evidentiary hearings, and routine administrative suspensions, equivalent to summary criminal offenses, are generally not among them. <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 761. Nonetheless, the procedure pre<a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>scribed by the Majority requires the Commonwealth Court to step out of its traditional role and be tasked to hold evidentiary hearings in these fact-bound, routine matters involving minor offenses. It is unlikely in the extreme that the General Assembly consciously intended to so burden the Commonwealth Court. The General Assembly also is not likely to have intended the dissipation of judicial resources necessitated by the use of dissimilar and parallel judicial processes in related cases which the parties could choose to consolidate for the purposes of evidentiary hearings, if such hearings were in the same forum. The availability of consolidation would also release litigants and witnesses from the burdens of appearing multiple times, and in different tribunals, and from the risk of inconsistent adjudications.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[120,1067,1153,967]]]'>But, the Majority rejects any requirement of symmetry between the judicial process afforded mechanics facing suspension and the process provided inspection station owners following suspension of their certificate of appointment, according great deference to the plain language of Section 933, no matter how absurd or unreasonable. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 18-20, 40 A.3d at 1193-94. In my respectful view, a proper decision here requires a broader perspective and, for the reasons I have explained, the general rule that the plain language of the statute is the best indicator of legislative intent fails us here. In this instance, the effect on the parties’ right of appeal, against the background of the full legislative scheme, persuades me that the omission of Section 4726(c) from the list of appeals over which the court of common pleas has jurisdiction was not simply an inconsistency supported by unclear legislative policy or even benign inadvertence, but is demonstrably contrary to the General Assembly’s intent in devising the statutory scheme governing the suspension of a mechanic’s inspection certificate by the Department.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

The Majority misconstrues my position and responds that appellant is entitled to an administrative process and an appeal of right to the Commonwealth Court, which it says comports with Administrative Agency Law procedures. Majority Op., at 22 n. 20, 23, 40 A.3d at 1195 n. 20, 1196 (citing 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 504, 702). According to the Majority, this process should be sufficient to allay my supposed "primary complaint” and to vindicate appellant’s principal complaint. While the Majority may be correct that its construction affords this particular <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>appellant the relief he seeks, it is not substantively responsive to my central position concerning the review paradigm, and ultimately raises more questions than it answers.</p>
      <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.2",82,[322,1044,1121,834]]]'>Under the plain language of Section 4726(c) (judicial review), the appellant is entitled to two trial-like proceedings and no traditional type of appeal by right; meanwhile, the Department is deprived of any form of appeal by right. The Majority seemingly believes that application of Administrative Agency Law Section 702 to mechanic's license suspension matters provides for an appeal of right for all parties. I respectfully disagree. Section 702 provides that "[ajny person aggrieved by an adjudication of a Commonwealth agency who has a direct interest in such adjudication shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the court vested with jurisdiction of such appeals by or pursuant to Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure).” 2 Pa.C.S. § 702. While Section 702 designates in which court the appeal is appropriate and seemingly affords the Department a right of appeal, judicial review of a suspension would nonetheless proceed under the specific provision applicable, Section 4726(c), and the terms I explain above. Section 702 does not change the atypical nature of a mechanic’s appeal, and introduces the further complication of affording the Department and mechanics differing processes for appeal of the same adjudication. In my view, the General Assembly could not have intended such a tortured interpretation of the relevant provisions. The Majority does not explain adequately or reconcile its broad pronouncements regarding the Administrative Agency Law with the plain language of Section 4726(c).</p>
      <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.3",82,[320,1882,1121,489]]]'>I also note that, unlike the informal process currently employed by the Department, the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 502-508 (Practice and Procedure of Commonwealth Agencies), requires all testimony to be stenographically recorded and a full and complete record to be kept of the proceedings; requires notice to the Department’s representative in the Department of Justice of the Department's proposed action or defense; permits legal representation, examination and cross-examination of witnesses, briefing, and oral argument before the Department’s examiner; and mandates that the Department issue adjudications in writing, to contain findings and the reasons for any adjudication. By its approach and holding here, the Majority establishes a major shift in practice which is incongruent with the relatively minor nature of these cases.</p>

My conclusion regarding the "latent absurdity” in Section 4726(c) is distinct from the Commonwealth Court’s finding of a "latent ambiguity” in the same provision. Indeed, I agree with the Majority’s criticism of the Commonwealth Court’s finding, <em>see </em>Majority Op. at 19, 40 A.3d at 1193, although I also note that the lower court’s decision was in large part driven by the parties' theories of the case and briefing.</p>

There are instances where the Commonwealth Court acts, in effect, as a trial court, and direct appeals lie with this Court; and there are cases where direct appeals from trial courts proceed to this Court (such as capital matters). But, in both of those scenarios, a traditional appeal as of right is preserved. The scheme here provides no traditional manner of appeal, a lacunae which calls for an examination beyond the plain language.</p>

Appellant’s principal theory of the case is that his suspension is void <em>ab initio </em>because the Department issued its adjudication in his absence and in violation of his due process rights. According to appellant, the Department should have conducted an on the record agency hearing appealable to the Commonwealth Court, in accord with the Commonwealth agency procedures of the Administrative Agency Law. <em>See </em>2 Pa.C.S. §§ 504, 702. In the context of this claim, appellant also argues that "the alleged ‘oversight’ was the inclusion of [Sjection 4724(b) of the Vehicle Code within the provisions of Section 933 of the Judicial Code rather than the exclusion of Section 4726(c).” Appellant’s Brief at 28 (emphasis omitted). Appellant seems to suggest that the Administrative Agency Law offers the appropriate adjudication and review procedure for Motor Vehicle Code suspensions. In my view, the Commonwealth Court properly rejected appellant's argument in light of Section 4726(c), which includes a specific review procedure, <em>i.e., </em>a <em>de novo </em>hearing in a court of record. Moreover, appellant’s suggestion that the legislative oversight was to list Section 4724(b) among Section 933 adjudications appealable to the court of common pleas is unavailing in light of the infirmities, described <em>supra, </em>from which the Section 4726(c) procedure suffers.</p>

I am aware of the Judicial Code provision which states that this Court may reassign classes of matters among the several courts of this Commonwealth "by general rule,” subject to the approval or disapproval of the General Assembly. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 503. Thus, after concluding that the intent of the General Assembly was to provide <em>de novo </em>hearings in Section 4726(c) appeals in the Commonwealth Court, this <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>Court could act to reassign these appeals to the court of common pleas. But, unless the burden on the Commonwealth Court becomes onerous to an extreme, the justification to undertake this process will be absent, in light of the Majority's conclusion that the intent of the General Assembly was clearly to the contrary.</p>
