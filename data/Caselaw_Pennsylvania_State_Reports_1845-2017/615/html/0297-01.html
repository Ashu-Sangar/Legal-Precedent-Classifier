Specifically, his testimony outlined that Clifton had stated that he was with appellant’s co-conspirator, Scott Anderson, and another individual six hours prior to the robbery during which appellant murdered New Cumberland Police Officer Willis Cole. At that time, Clifton overheard the two men discussing a robbery. Clifton also told Detective Harlacker that he was intoxicated when he was with the two men. Furthermore, Clifton told Detective Harlacker that he was able to identify Anderson, but was unable to identify the man who was with him.

Clifton’s account may have been relevant to further inculpate Anderson, indicating his intention to commit a robbery, but it did nothing to exculpate appellant. Detective Harlacker’s testimony indicated that Clifton claimed that he was able to identify Anderson, but was unable to identify the individual who was with Anderson. Clifton’s inability to identify the other individual to Detective Harlacker does not exculpate appellant, it just fails to inculpate him in an association many hours before the robbery and murder. By the same token, Clifton’s account to police that he had overheard Anderson and another individual discussing a robbery six hours before it occurred does nothing to exculpate appellant for his conduct, attested to by numerous eyewitnesses, and corroborated by, among other things, the gunshot wound he suffered in his exchange of lethal gunfire with Officer Cole.

Both appellant and Anderson were injured during the criminal episode: the evidence suggested that appellant was shot by Officer Cole, and Anderson’s hand was injured during a skirmish with the store owner. At trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence that blood taken from the steering wheel of the getaway car, when tested, matched the blood type and blood enzymes of appellant and did not match the blood type and enzymes of Anderson. The Commonwealth used this evidence to help establish appellant’s pres<a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>ence in the getaway car. The Commonwealth also presented evidence that blood taken from the driver’s side door of the getaway car when tested, was determined to match the blood type of Anderson and did not match appellant’s blood type. The new blood evidence, deriving from the <em>habeas </em>proceedings and relating to different blood samples taken from the steering wheel than that tested by the Commonwealth before trial, corroborated Anderson’s role, but did not disprove or negate the evidence of appellant's presence.

Appellant raises a second claim on appeal, unrelated to the <em>Brady </em>claim Judge Jones directed him to exhaust. This claim alleges that a "new” National Academy of Science Report demonstrated the unreliability of the fingerprint evidence introduced at his trial. Appellant attacked the same fingerprint evidence, albeit premised upon different "new” evidence, in the appeal from the denial of his first serial PCRA petition in <em>Abdul-Salaam III. </em>This Court rejected the serial claim as follows: "Appellant's argument conveniently overlooks that even in the absence of such fingerprint evidence, there was overwhelming eyewitness testimony placing Appellant at the scene of the crime. At least four persons who were at the scene of the crime testified that Appellant shot the police officer. Thus, even if we were to accept Appellant’s argument regarding the fingerprint evidence, Appellant is simply unable to show that the evidence would have altered the outcome of the trial.” <em>Abdul-Salaam III, </em><a href="/pa/571/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="812 A.2d 497" data-case-ids="1070145,11365715" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0219-01,/a2d/812/0497-01">812 A.2d at 503</a>. Since our disposition in <em>Abdul-Salaam III </em>turned on appellant’s failure to demonstrate prejudice, his present claim, alleging a new basis for the same theory, does not remotely affect the prejudice assessment finally litigated during his second collateral proceedings and is plainly frivolous. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/597/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="597 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="3924340" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0109-01">597 Pa. 109</a>, <a href="/pa/597/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="950 A.2d 294" data-case-ids="3924340,8226424" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0109-01,/a2d/950/0294-01">950 A.2d 294</a>, 320 (2008) (conclusion on direct appeal that error was harmless because of overwhelming evidence of guilt undermined and ultimately defeated appellant's claim of ineffectiveness on collateral review because appellant could not <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>demonstrate prejudice); <em>Commonwealth v.
