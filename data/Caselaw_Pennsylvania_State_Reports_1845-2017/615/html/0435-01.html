Given that the Rules of Criminal Procedure do not provide for an appeal from a magisterial district court to the Superior Court, we conclude that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over this case because there was no final order from the Court of Common Pleas.

In the supporting affidavit of probable cause, the trooper indicated that the victim and her father drove to Defendant’s house because the victim suspected her paramour of visiting Defendant. Although it is undisputed that the victim and Defendant were involved in an altercation resulting in minor injuries to both women, the affidavit presented differing accounts of the fight and the events surrounding the altercation, as told by the Defendant, the victim, the victim’s father, and the paramour. The affidavit claimed that Defen<a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>dant also provided different versions of her story to two troopers including, as relevant to the evidence fabrication charge, accusing the victim of injuring Defendant with a butter knife in one version and a double-edged boot knife in a later account.</p>

I have advised the defendant of the right to counsel. I certify that the plea was made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.” The record also includes a Magisterial District Judge Payment Order of the same date ordering Defendant to pay fees and costs of $635.50, signed by the District Judge and the Defendant. By signing, the Defendant indicated that she acknowledged “receipt of a copy of this order and further understand that if I do not make payments within the time specified, a warrant for my arrest will be issued” and that failure to comply with the payment schedule may result in a finding of criminal contempt among other sanctions.</p>

Pa.R.Crim.P. 720 (entitled “Post-Sentence Procedures; Appeal”). Before the Superior Court, the Defendant conceded that no record had been developed below and the Court of Common Pleas had not had an opportunity to act in her case, in contrast to the typical case in which a notice of appeal is filed.

The Superior Court observed that subsection (D) sets forth that a defendant who enters a plea of guilty “may, within 10 days after sentence, change the plea to not guilty by so notifying the magisterial district judge in writing. In such event, the magisterial district judge shall vacate the plea and judgment of sentence.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 550(D). Finally, the court stated that Rule 550(E) provides, “Ten days after the acceptance of the guilty plea and the imposition of sentence, the magisterial district judge shall certify the judgment, and shall forward the case to the clerk of courts of the judicial district for further proceedings.” The court emphasized that the comment to subsection (E) supports the view that once the district court forwards the case to the Court of Common Pleas, that court has exclusive jurisdiction over the case, which should proceed in the same manner as any other court case.

Instead, her first action was to file a notice of appeal to the Superior Court on the thirtieth day following the entry of her guilty plea. The Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court does not have authority to create a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>process, which it argues would eviscerate the requirements of Rule 550.

Defendant’s Brief at 2. She explains that a defendant who enters a plea of guilty in a summary case before a district judge may take an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 460(A), by filing a notice of appeal within thirty days of the entry of the plea, and that such defendant is then entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Court of Common Pleas, from which decision the defendant can then appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(3).</p>

She next notes that a defendant who pleads in a trial court may also file a post-sentence motion, pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(1), and then is allowed thirty days to file a notice of appeal in the Superior Court. In contrast, she laments that defendants who plead guilty before the district judge to a third-degree misdemeanor have only the relief offered by Pa.R.Crim.P. 550, which is to withdraw the plea within ten days, and have no mechanism to challenge the plea in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
