In response, the Authority argued that Appellant’s function— baseball park management — was non-governmental, and thus, <a id="p646" href="#p646" data-label="646" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*646</a>disclosure of its records under Section 506(d)(1) was not implicated. In this regard, the Authority referenced an area of the law which has evolved to determine whether contracts of a governmental entity are binding upon a successor governing body. <em>See, e.g., Mun. Auth. of Borough of Edgeworth v. Borough of Ambridge Water Auth., </em><a href="/a2d/936/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="936 A.2d 538" data-case-ids="8362902" data-case-paths="/a2d/936/0538-01">936 A.2d 538</a>, 548 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007). In such context, a common-law distinction between “governmental” and “proprietary” functions has been employed to distinguish from ordinary contracts those particular agreements which are so intertwined with policymaking choices as to warrant the opening of an avenue for relief, so as not to impede succeeding government decision-makers. <em>See Program Admin.

In her opinion, the appeals officer explained that she regarded the governmental-proprietary distinction as inapposite to the open-records arena. In this regard, she observed that, under that test, the Stadium Authority’s entire purpose <em>{i.e., </em>owning and running a baseball park) might also be considered non-governmental, although, indisputably, the Authority is a local governmental agency. Thus, the appeals officer reasoned that “[t]he test in this case is not whether or not baseball or Stadium operations are governmental functions in a vacuum.” <em>In re Wintermantel v. Multi-Purpose Stadium Auth. of Lackawanna Cnty., </em>No. AP 2009-0184, <em>slip op. </em>at 6 (OOR May 6, 2009). Rather, she explained, the work the Stadium Authority itself performs is “a crucial aspect” in considering whether Appellant performs a governmental function. <em><a href="/citations/?q=75%20Iowa%20L.%20Rev.%20277" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="75 Iowa L.

Highlighting the explicit agency relationship between the Authority and Appellant, the appeals officer’s rationale proceeded as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b701-4" data-blocks='[["BL_701.4",701,[186,620,1108,583]]]'>The OOR finds that the [Management] Agreement transfers essentially all functions to [Appellant], and is precisely the kind of arrangement the RTKL targets in [Section 506(d)(1) ] and that the records of [Appellant] are exactly the type required to be disclosed. To hold otherwise would permit a local agency, expressly subject to the RTKL, to contract away all of its functions to a private company and shield all of its operations from the public that funds them. We find the arguments advanced by the Authority, demonstrating the complete control of [Appellant] over operations, to support disclosure rather than protection.</blockquote>

Moreover, the court highlighted, the Municipality Authorities Act authorizes the creation of authorities precisely to “perform[ ] <em>essential governmental functions </em>in effectuating these [broader] purposes.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Indeed, it is for this very reason, the court continued, that authorities are not required to pay taxes or assessments. <em>See id. </em>(“Since authorities will be performing <em>essential governmental functions </em>in effectuating these purposes, authorities shall not be required to pay taxes or assessments upon property acquired or used by them for such purposes.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In light of this strong governmental nexus invoked to justify the Stadium Authority’s very existence and tax-exempt status, <em>see SWB Yankees, </em>No. 09 CV 3691, <em>slip op. </em>at 21 (“It is undisputed that by virtue of 53 Pa.C.S. § 5620, the Authority has never paid property taxes with regard to the Stadium.”), the court was skeptical of the claim that the Legislature regarded the Authority’s activities in a contrary fashion for purposes of a remedial open-records law.</p>

Nevertheless, he rejected Appellant’s invitation to import the meaning ascribed to the term in determining the contractual duties of successor governing bodies into the open-records setting.

As a preliminary matter, I note that part of the difficulty in cases involving records exclusively in the control of private entities stems from circumstances related to the sort of procedure followed here. Appellant did not participate in the initial phases of the disclosure process; the Authority’s open records officer decided the request in the first instance without notice to or advocacy from appellant, whose records and information were actually at issue. The open records officer denied the request, citing as the sole basis for refusal the fact that appellant was not performing a “governmental function” on behalf of the Authority. The OOR disagreed with the officer’s assessment on the governmental function issue raised by the agency and reversed. Appellant, arguably the more appropriate party in interest given the stakes and the nature of the dispute, intervened only after the OOR ordered release of the records and thereafter appealed the decision to the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas.</p>

In any event, the open records officer’s reasoning framed the dispute between appellant and appellees in subsequent phases of judicial review. Adding to this procedural difficulty, the present iteration of the Right-to-Know Law is relatively recent, constitutes a considerable departure from the previous version of the statute, and now includes the addition of the principle articulated in Section 506(d)(1). The court that interpreted Section 506(d)(1) most recently had expressly given the term “public record” little meaning, essentially reading it out of the provision. <em>See A Second Chance, Inc., </em><a href="/a3d/13/1025-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="13 A.3d 1025" data-case-ids="7288822" data-case-paths="/a3d/13/1025-01">13 A.3d at 1036-39</a>; <em>accord </em>Majority Op. at 658 n. 13, 45 A.3d at 1040 n. 13. As a result, appellant’s primary argument here <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>poses a very narrow issue — that appellant does not perform a governmental function — pursuant to a distinction no court of this Commonwealth has yet to accept as valid in the context of the Right-to-Know Law. Against this background, the Majority offers a persuasive analysis of the parties’ dispute regarding the phrase “governmental function.”</p>

It is clear that the General Assembly intended Section 506(d)(1) to provide access to certain information of an agency, which happens to be in the possession of a contractor; but, it is less clear whether the General Assembly intended to recast information peculiar to the contractor as a public record of the agency. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.506(d) (“Agency possession”). Section 506(d)(1) defines a public record subject to disclosure, <em>see </em>65 P.S. § 67.302(a), to include a “public record,” which is not in the possession of the local agency but in the possession of a contractor performing a governmental function on behalf of the agency, and which directly relates to that governmental function. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.506(d)(1). For the first reference to a “public record” in Section 506(d)(1) to have any meaning, the term must be defined by reference to the general definition in Section 102 of the Right-to-Know Law, <em>supra, </em>and not in a circular fashion by reference to the second iteration of the term “public record” in Section 506(d)(1). <em>See also </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (General Assembly does not intend result that is absurd). Moreover, the first reference to a “public record” in Section 506(d)(1) can neither be read out of the provision nor downplayed. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(2) (General Assembly intends entire statute to be effective). The first reference to a “public record” in Section 506(d)(1) is a key normative phrase in the provision’s scheme, which indicates an intention to limit disclosure to that information of the agency which is in the contractor’s possession; access to the contractor’s information is then subject to Section 506(d)(2). In this respect, Sections 506(d)(1) and 506(d)(2) are clear that information in the pos<a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>session of a contractor, other than a public record, is not subject to disclosure. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.506(d)(l)-(2).</p>
    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[137,454,1152,465]]]'>The term “governmental function” is a secondary normative phrase, which further narrows information subject to disclosure of any public record in any third party’s possession to those public records in the possession of a contractor that performs a governmental function on behalf of the agency whose own records are being requested. Moreover, any public record disclosed must relate “directly” to the contractor’s performance of that governmental function. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.506(d)(1).</p>
    <p id="b727-5" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[135,947,1156,1436]],["BL_728.1",728,[279,334,1146,97]]]'>To the extent that Section 506(d)(1) is ambiguous, the tools of statutory construction confirm this interpretation of the provision. The title of Section 506(d) — “Agency possession”— for example, strongly suggests that the purpose of the provision is to address possession of a public record, rather than to recast private information of a private entity as a public record. This interpretation of Section 506(d) is harmonious with the general statutory scheme: thus, Sections 301(a) and 302(a) provide access to non-exempt and non-privileged local and Commonwealth agency records, in the first instance, and Sections 305(a) and 506(d)(1) address agency possession of those records. In Section 305(a), the General Assembly offers the presumption that records of a local or Commonwealth agency in the possession of those agencies shall be disclosed and, in Section 506(d)(1), further addresses the limited disclosure of public records in the possession of certain types of contractors. As a corollary to these provisions, any other information is not subject to disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law. Section 708 further narrows the types of information that may be obtained pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law by listing thirty exemptions pursuant to which an agency may deny access to a public record. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.708(b). The assertion that a public record is exempt from disclosure must be substantiated by the agency, which carries the burden to prove the applicability of the exemption, whether the public record is in its own possession or in the possession of a contractor. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.708(a)(1). Thus, even among <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>public records, a great number are exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law.</p>
    <p id="b728-4" data-blocks='[["BL_728.4",728,[278,454,1150,1366]]]'>The statute offers no indication that, while access to certain public records is restricted, information of private entities/contractors is nonetheless subject to disclosure by simple association with a governmental agency — and with limited ability by the third party to participate in the disclosure process. Indeed, Section 506(d)(2) suggests the contrary, and expressly prohibits access to the private information of governmental or agency contractors, even if that contractor is also in possession of some public record. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.506(d)(2). Presumably, if the intention was to make records and information of private contractors subject to broad disclosure, the General Assembly would have placed the burden to prove entitlement to an exemption on the contractor, the actual party in interest and in possession of the relevant supporting documentation. Other procedural provisions of the Right-to-Know Law also suggest that the statute targets broad disclosure of information that actually documents activities or transactions of local or Commonwealth agencies, rather than private party information deemed a public record of such an agency by operation of law. These provisions outline the duties of the agency to disclose information, and impose sanctions on the agency for failure to comply. <em>See, e.g., </em>65 P.S. §§ 67.701-707 (“Procedure”), 901-905 (“Agency Response”), 1305 (“Civil penalty”). Notably, duties, including civil sanctions, are not aimed at enforcing the Right-to-Know Law against third party contractors.</p>

Private entities have more prominent privacy and proprietary interests, have more reticence to assume the costs of any information disclosure mechanism, and have a diluted interest in vindicating the public’s right to know. These competing interests are evident in the lines that the General Assembly has drawn between public records and <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>private entity information, as well as between public records in the possession of an agency and public records in the possession of other entities. Regardless of whether broad disclosure of a contractor’s private information may be salutary, I am skeptical of the notion that the General Assembly drafted the Right-to-Know Law with the intent to recast information of a private entity as a public record.</p>

The issue I address, of whether the information appellees requested here was a "public record” for the purposes of Section 506(d)(1) is distinct from the issue that appellant raises, of whether the information requested is a "record,” as that term is defined in Section 102 of the Right-to-Know Law. "Public record” and "record” are separately defined and generally employed as terms of art by the Right-to-Know Law.
