The WCJ did not err in finding that petitioner did not maintain a continuous employment relationship with Employer, as petitioner did not “retain[ ] significant rights/accoutrements of employment” with Employer. <em>Contrast Reifsnyder v.

While the outcome of certain matters may be so apparent as to justify a <em>per curiam </em>disposition on the allocatur docket, particularly where a decision of this Court is clearly aligned with the case under review, I do not regard the authority cited in the majority’s order as satisfying this criterion. <em>See Reifsnyder v.

As the significance of such a history in the overall continuing-employment-relationship inquiry is unclear, <em>see Reifsnyder, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="883 A.2d 537" data-case-ids="8908487,988469" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0537-01,/pa/584/0341-01">883 A.2d at 547</a> (“In addition, Claimants all returned to work with Employer following their respective layoffs, evidencing an ongoing employment relationship despite the periods of inactivity.”), I cannot join the <em>per curiam </em>disposition of this case.</p>
