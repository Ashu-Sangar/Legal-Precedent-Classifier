Act 55 found that the inconsistencies had led to ‘confusion and confrontation’ among traditionally tax-exempt institutions and political subdivisions to the detriment of the public, a detriment which included the ‘unnecessary] diversion]’ of ‘charitable and public funds ... from the public good to litigate eligibility for tax-exempt status.’ ”) (quoting 10 P.S. § 372(b)).</p>

Thus, so long as the statute otherwise comports with the Constitution, I would defer to the General Assembly’s reasonable policy determination that an organization satisfying the criteria set forth in Act 55 is a purely public charity.</p>
