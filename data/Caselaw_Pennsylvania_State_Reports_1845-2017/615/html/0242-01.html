Appellant paid $66,818.25 for the license, Software implementation, training, and sales tax, based on assurances or expectations that the Software would update and streamline Appellant’s ability to track sales, maintain accounts receivable, and improve record keeping. However, Appellant was never able to implement the Software.</p>

Included in the agreement was the transfer of control over the Software, which was owned by the former shareholders of SDG, subject to payment of two promissory notes. Appellant alleged that the additional defendants had engaged in a fraudulent transfer of assets, and further alleged that XLNT was liable under the original breach of contract and warranty actions as the successor corporation of XLN.

The stock purchase agreement provided that the source code for the Software would be placed in escrow, and that the ownership of the Software would remain with the Shareholders until the promissory notes were paid in full.

XLN also assigned its lease of the premises in Lancaster to XLNT, which thus further obtained all leasehold improvements from XLN. The two aforesaid workstations and servers retained by XLN were to remain at this business location.

The court opined that the record did not contain the names of XLN’s board of directors at the time of the sale, and, other than the name of the CEO, the record was silent regarding XLN’s officers at the time of the sale.

We find the analysis of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Bud Antle, supra </em>at 1458, quoted above, instructive on this point. That court rejected the notion that a merger always involves a transfer of the assets from one corporation to another in exchange for its securities. However, we agree with this court that a <em>de facto </em>merger must show “some sort of continuation of the stockholders’ ownership.” <em>Id. </em>This is because “corporate liability adheres not to the nature of the business enterprise but to the corporate entity itself.

However, such proof is not restricted to mere evidence of an exchange of assets from one corporation for shares in a successor corporation. Evidence of other forms of stockholder interest in the successor corporation may suffice; indeed 15 Pa.C.S. § 1922(a)(3) contemplates that continuing shareholder interest pursuant to a statutory merger may take the form of “obligations” in lieu of shares in the new or surviving corporation. Further, <em>defacto </em>merger, including its continuity of ownership prong, will always be subject to the fact-specific nature of the particular underlying corporate realities and will not always be evident from the formalities of the proximal corporate transaction. These realities may include an issue concerning which entity is actually the true predecessor corporation. <em>See Lavelle, <a href="/pa-super/382/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="382 Pa.

Once again, the obligation was secured by the critical asset for this new corporation, namely the Software. The two principal Shareholders of SDG held positions of importance with both XLN and XLNT.

Maj. Op. at 271-74, 42 A.3d at 968-69. I agree with the majority that a statutory merger may take the form of “obligations” in lieu of shares in the new or surviving corporation and that the underlying corporate realities will not always be evident from the formalities of the proximal corporate transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 42 A.3d at 969. Moreover, I believe the <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>majority correctly concludes that this type of analysis does not require adherence to a mechanically applied checklist as found by the Superior Court, but rather uses the relevant factors as a map to determine whether a merger of two corporate entities is the result of the transaction. Because I believe that the trial court’s analysis of the facts of this case fulfill the analytical framework set forth by the majority, I would simply reverse the Superior Court’s determination and reinstate the trial court’s decision concluding that a <em>de facto </em>merger resulted in this case rather than remand for such a determination.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[140,884,1153,1499]]]'>Specifically, as noted by the majority, the trial court concluded that given the realities of the transactions between SDG and XLN and XLN and XLNT there was a corporate continuum from SDG to XLNT. Maj. Op. at 272-74, 42 A.3d at 969. As also pointed out by the majority, and relied upon by the trial court, the facts demonstrate that Appellant’s causes of action for breach of contract and breach of express warranty derived from a transaction between Appellant and SDG. Sometime following the above events, all of the SDG’s shareholders sold their shares to XLN, a sale that unquestionably resulted in a corporate merger of SDG and XLN. In exchange, SDG’s shareholders received cash and promissory notes obligating XLN to pay the shareholders a considerable debt on the notes. This obligation was secured by the primary asset of the corporation, its software (the Software). When XLN sold its assets to XLNT, XLN was relieved of its debt obligations to the SDG shareholders and XLNT assumed such obligation with the Software again serving as security for such obligation. Thus, the primary corporate asset, the Software, remained the property of the original SDG shareholders throughout the sales transactions from SDG to XLN and then to XLNT. Finally, the trial court noted that the record demonstrated the key employees and shareholders of SDG, Daniel Fritsch and Michael Hamlin, continued as key employees and owners of the main corporate asset, the Software, at XLNT. Thus, <em>inter alia, </em>although there was not a technical continuity of the shareholders from XLN to XLNT, the trial court found there was a <em>de facto </em>merger between XLN and XLNT.</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>In my view, the above facts found by the trial court likewise satisfy the analytical framework set forth by the majority for determining whether the continuity of ownership prong of the <em>de facto </em>merger test has been satisfied. Specifically, for all intents and purposes, the ownership of XLNT remained the same as the ownership of XLN given the assumed obligations of XLNT to Fritsch and Hamlin, in lieu of shares. Thus, despite the technical lack of shareholder continuity from XLN to XLNT, I would, nevertheless find continuity of ownership. Because the Superior Court concluded otherwise, I would simply reverse its decision and reinstate the trial court’s determination.</p>

On the merits, were this entirely a paper transaction, I might support the result obtained (albeit such a paper scenario would seem more similar to mere continuation rather than <em>de facto </em>merger, assuming absolute continuity of ownership should not be required under either theory). Here, however, the purchaser — a corporation with shareholders independent of the seller — paid more than $250,000 as part of the consideration in the relevant asset purchase transaction. <em>Cf </em>19 C.J.S. Corporations § 911 (2011) (opining that “[t]he crucial factor in determining whether there has been a de facto merger or continuation of business, resulting in successor liability, is whether adequate cash consideration was paid for the predecessor corporation’s assets”). To the extent the Court dilutes the continuity of ownership inquiry, 1 believe it should include an element focusing on the cash consideration to guard against unfairness to stockholders in a purchasing company. Notably, there is no discussion in the briefs of any claim that the consideration provided by XLNT was inadequate in this regard.</p>
