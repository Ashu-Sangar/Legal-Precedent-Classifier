Second is the recognition that the penal provision at issue did not have a common law analogue. This point of distinction is significant because this Court has recognized that: “Statutes which embody well-settled common law norms stand on a footing somewhat different than statutes which attempt to circumscribe conduct newly proscribed. Because the former group merely reiterate customary normative standards, the prohibitory language need not be drawn with the precision that a newly-conceived interdiction might require.” <em>Heinbaugh, </em><a href="/pa/467/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="467 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1717362" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0001-01">354 A.2d at 247</a> (citation omitted).</p>

Megan’s Law directs that upon release from incarceration, offenders are to provide state police with “all current or intended residences”; offenders are thereafter to inform state police of any “change of residence or establishment of an additional residence or residences” within forty-eight hours. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.2(a)(1). According to the Majority, when the location appellee initially registered as his intended residence, 1708 Market Street in Harrisburg, did not work out, appellee’s obligation to notify police of a change in his “residence” was triggered; and, the fact that appellee thereafter became homeless did not negate his registration obligations. Nor did the fact that, due to appellee’s ensuing homelessness, he never met the thirty day “consecutive domicile” requirement of “residence” or the forty-eight hour notification period for a change of residence.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[284,1420,1152,682]]]'>The potential exposure to criminal sanction in this statutory construct turns upon the word “residence,” which is specifically defined in a way that includes a temporal limitation of thirty days. The Majority reasons that the inclusion of “intended residences” in the statutory scheme indicates legislative anticipation that registrants’ residences might not be fixed, and that this potentiality would not excuse a registrant’s noncompliance. The Majority concludes: “There is no exception for homeless offenders, and the Superior Court was incorrect in reading such an exception into the statute,” the purpose of which is to ensure that communities where offenders may live are notified of and protected from the possibility of future predation. Majority Op. at 43, 40 A.3d at 1208.</p>
    <p id="b102-6" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[285,2126,1152,255]],["BL_103.1",103,[118,343,1156,1435]]]'>The Majority’s intricate unraveling of the statute, in pursuit of an effectuation of the purpose behind the provision, may make perfect sense to lawyers, but that is not the test when construing a provision that would deprive a person of his or her liberty. The statute, as drafted, simply does not by its <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>terms account for homeless or transient offenders. The definition at Section 9792 needs no additional construction if applied to a registrant fortunate enough to secure a physical place to live upon release: “A location where an individual resides or is domiciled or intends to be domiciled for 30 consecutive days or more during a calendar year.” Although thirty days of predictable and reliable living arrangements does not seem like a difficult prospect, the reality is that in this day and age, many persons lack even that little security. And, indeed, the consequences of criminal prosecution no doubt make convicted offenders less likely able than law abiding citizens to secure reliable or stable living arrangements. So it was here, as the evidence shows that appellee slept in various places on the streets of Harrisburg, evidently somewhere different on many nights, but kept a locker and received mail at a soup kitchen. Offenders such as appellee, by definition, have no “residence” as that term is defined in the statute. Thus, as applied to a homeless registrant who is the “common person” to whom the statute applies, residence is, at best, ambiguous. As such, the governing definition of residence 'is also, at best, silent on the nature of the obligation of such persons. To find a basis to punish offenders who lack a statutory residence to report, one must go behind the plain language. In such circumstances, the mandate of strict construction/lenity, which favors liberty, must apply; and, in my view, that principle dictates the outcome here. For certain, a park bench does not a residence make.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[118,1803,1152,469]]]'>Furthermore, one need not look far for an unambiguous manner in which to address the circumstance of a transient or homeless offender who is subject to Megan’s Law registration requirements. As the Majority notes, the General Assembly has revised the registration provisions and has explicitly addressed the unique circumstance of homeless offenders.
