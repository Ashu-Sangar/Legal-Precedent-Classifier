Nonetheless, this Court has recognized several discrete doctrines of case or controversy justiciability, among them mootness. <em>Rendell v. Pa.

But, the Court was fully aware that this development could occur when we granted review; if it had been a powering consideration, we could have simply held the allocatur petition until after the primary. As it happened, the candidate, an incumbent, retired at the end of his term and, <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>long before then, expressed his disinterest in filing a brief in the appeal.

I have previously addressed the unique difficulties arising because of the expedited nature of decisions in election matters. <em>See, e.g., In re Petition of Fitzpatrick, </em><a href="/pa/573/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="573 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="197199" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0514-01">573 Pa. 514</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="827 A.2d 375" data-case-ids="197199,9108605" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0514-01,/a2d/827/0375-01">827 A.2d 375</a>, 378 (Pa.2003) (Castille, J., dissenting). The timeframes for decision are constrained, and we very rarely decide cases via published opinions. <em>See In re Farnese, </em><a href="/pa/609/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="609 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="4201308" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0573-01">609 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/pa/609/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="17 A.3d 375" data-case-ids="4201308,7281919" data-case-paths="/pa/609/0573-01,/a3d/17/0375-01">17 A.3d 375</a>, 382-83 (Pa.2011) (Castille, C.J., concurring). In the cases in which we issue opinions, it is not at all uncommon for one or the other of the parties to lose interest. Such is the case here where the candidate, having lost the primary election, then lost interest in pursuing this appeal to vindicate his prevailing position below. In this respect, election appeals are sui generis. Specifically, we accepted allocatur in this matter to decide by published opinion an important and potentially recurring issue regarding candidate and notary fraud in the nomination process. The issue transcends this case. This issue is unlikely to reach our Court other than with a constrained timeframe for decision, given the relative briefness of the election calendar. <em>Western Pa. Socialist Workers 1982 Campaign v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/512/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="512 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1800490" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0023-01">512 Pa. 23</a>, <a href="/pa/512/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="512 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1800490" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0023-01">515 A.2d 1331</a>, 1333 (Pa.1986). Moreover, the ideal case may never arrive — while the alleged fraud goes on. For these reasons, in spite of the candidate’s eventual lack of interest, I believe that this case is appropriate to address this particular form of fraud in the nomination process and to address it now, rather than later.</p>

By its plain language, Section 977 does not apply, since the “material error or defect” here was not apparent on the face of the petition. The Commonwealth Court, relying upon the result in <em>Ross </em>without conducting its own independent explication of the statute, declared simply that “the defects” in the circulators’ affidavits were “cured.” Cmwlth. Ct. Op., at 7. Notably, <em>Ross </em>provided no grounded explanation either, appearing to read the Section 977 language in the disjunctive, <em>i.e., </em>as permitting amendment of either “material errors” or “defects apparent on the face of the nomination petition.” <em>Ross, </em><a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20719" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="190 A.2d 719">190 A.2d at 720</a>. Thus, under the implied <em>Ross </em>interpretation, “material errors” need not be apparent on the face of the petition in order to be amendable. But, although the <em>Ross </em>interpretation may have required the Commonwealth Court panel to view the fraudulent certification as a material error, the court below repeatedly referred to the certification as a mere “defect.” In my view, there is no textual or interpretive basis for holding that the qualifier applies to “defects,” but not to “material errors,” and requires one but not the other to be apparent on the face of the <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>petition. When a challenge is made to a nomination petition, what is there to “amend” except material representations on its face? The face is the form that is filed, and it is what establishes a valid candidacy. The plain language of the statutory language addresses errors or defects, when apparent on the face of the petition. And, notably, <em>Ross’s </em>unexplained contrary interpretation of the statute now allows non-facial fraud to be amended away.</p>

Indeed, absent a time machine, there was no way that the notary could make her false certification true by amendment. The circulators here simply did not “personally appear before her” on the day she swore they had (and dates are crucial when nomination petitions are at issue); they were not duly sworn before her; and they did not state what they were required to state before her. Obviously, there can be errors and defects, facial or latent, that may be subject to correction <em>(e.g., </em>spelling mistakes, stamping a wrong date). But, the material error here went to the essence of certification. The notary’s post-objection affidavit affirms that each circulator had appeared after appellants raised their objections, and affirmed that they had signed the respective circulator affidavits she had falsely notarized — albeit not in her presence.

Again, the new notarization is neither set forth nor meaningfully characterized; it may be that the Court understood its holding as merely approving an untimely re-notarization.

The statutory construction decision in <em>Ross </em>is unexplained, it is contrary to the plain language of the statute, it encourages fraud (and other criminal conduct), and it creates no legitimate reliance interest, since no citizen — circulator, candidate, or notary — can legitimately assert a right to engage in a criminal falsification of circulator affidavits.</p>

Although the Court may be unwilling to explicitly put a stop to this sort of fraudulent conduct today, any candidate who would repeat this sort of fraud does so at his or her peril, not to mention at the peril of the notary involved.
