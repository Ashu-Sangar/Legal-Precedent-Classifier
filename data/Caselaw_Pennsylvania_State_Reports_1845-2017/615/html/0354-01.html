On April 6, 2008, police were called to their residence, where they found appellant outside. Victim was on the kitchen floor, unresponsive, and had both old and new bruises all over her body. Police attempted to revive victim, and paramedics transported her to York Hospital. Victim was then transferred to Hershey Medical Center, where she died the next day.</p>

On that morning, victim upset appellant by coming into mother and appellant’s bedroom. Appellant hit victim and told her to stand in the corner. At about 12:20 p.m., mother heard appellant yelling and victim crying, and saw appellant spanking the child at the top of the stairs. The spanking caused the child’s diaper to explode, which angered appellant further; he began beating her again and threatened to beat mother. Mother, who was in a separate room during most of this incident, indicated appellant beat victim for 20 to 30 minutes, although she repeatedly asked him to stop. Eventually, mother could no longer hear victim scream or appellant yell. She then heard water running in the bathtub for approximately 10 minutes. Appellant returned, carrying victim’s limp body. Appellant and mother attempted to resuscitate victim and, on mother’s prodding, appellant called 911.</p>

Sanders inquired, “What do you mean?,” and appellant stated, “I’m sorry, I did it.” <em>Id. </em>Sanders asked again, “What do you mean you did it?” <em>Id. </em>Appellant elaborated, “I have been hitting the child for the last two or three days.” <em>Id. </em>Sanders then asked, “Well, what did you use on the child?” Appellant responded, “A belt.” <em>Id., </em>at 149. Kohler subsequently drove appellant to the York City Police Department. During the drive, appellant said, “That girl and her mother bruise when I touch them at all.

He said victim came into his bedroom between 5:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. the day before her death, waking him up. He told victim to stay in a corner of the bedroom until he and mother awoke. He later woke up, left the residence, and returned to find mother upset. He assumed mother was upset because of victim, so between 12:30 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. he struck victim on her arms and buttocks approximately seven times with the cord from an Xbox controller. He noted these blows could have injured victim’s chest and back because the cord wrapped around her body. Victim then moved her bowels, so he took her to a running bathtub of hot water. Appellant claimed he left the child in the bathtub to bring her clean clothes and, when he returned, he found her drowning and noticed a lump on her head. Appellant summoned moth<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>er, argued with her about what happened, and sought to revive victim.

The pathologist found approximately 220 external injuries on victim, 150 of which were “fresh,” meaning they had occurred within 24 hours of victim’s admission to the hospital. He noted victim’s right ear had fresh trauma, and the center of her right ear had an abrasion consistent with someone scraping a fingernail in her ear. Victim’s hair on the right side of her head was pulled out by its roots. Injuries on her left shoulder were caused by the cord of the Xbox controller, and her entire left arm was swollen. The pathologist determined bruises on the back of victim’s forearm and contusions, bruises, and abrasions to her feet and lower legs were caused by blunt force trauma. The pathologist discovered numerous fresh internal injuries to victim’s head, including swelling and bleeding in her brain, as well as retinal hemorrhages and damage to her spinal cord. He noted victim suffered trauma to her heart, right lung, liver, pancreas, and right adrenal gland, which were caused by multiple high-velocity impacts to the chest and belly. There were also hemorrhages to her neck caused by compression or strangulation. He opined victim was repeatedly struck at a speed of approximately 20 miles per hour.

However, there is no evidence in the record concerning the prison conditions, well-regarded motion pictures, or the treatment of child killers in prison. Accordingly, there was no evidentiary basis for this argument.

      <em>Montalvo, </em>at 109-10 (quoting <em>Powell, </em>at 425) (internal citations omitted). Here, appellant inflicted approximately 150 wounds on victim with multiple weapons, including whipping victim with a cord. Appellant beat victim to the extent she bled onto a bedroom wall. The pathologist testified victim suffered massive swelling over most of her body and deep internal bleeding in her brain, as well as injury to her pancreas, lungs, and heart. The pathologist indicated victim suffered severe sharp pain to her chest, coughed up blood, and endured a severe headache from her brain injuries. The wounds were inflicted to both vital and non-vital areas of her body, as her injuries covered her entire body. Mother heard victim cry during the assault, indicating victim was conscious while appellant was injuring her. Further, the assault lasted an extended period of time, as the pathologist opined it lasted at least 45 minutes, and mother testified the assault lasted 20 to 30 minutes. Also, “given the size disparity between the victim and [ajppellant, one can infer that it was [ajppellant’s intent to ‘torture’ the victim as he easily could have killed her with one quick blow.” <em>Sherwood, </em>at 506 (citation omitted).
