The district court permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing the statutory provision, and the Commonwealth did not appeal that decision. The importance of the issue, particularly as it affects the Secretary of the Commonwealth (“Secretary”) in policing elections in accordance with the federal district court’s decision, is explained below. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Commonwealth and the Secretary are bound by the district court decision in <em>Morrill, </em>and may not enforce Section 2911(d) as written.</p>

He argued that, as the <em>Morrill </em>court had determined, Section 2911(d)’s residency requirement constitutes an unconstitutional restriction upon the rights of both candidates and petition circulators, and thus, the statute cannot be enforced.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[284,774,1151,574]]]'>Stevenson asserted that the district residency requirement burdens core political speech, and is thus subject to strict scrutiny. He claimed that the requirement imposes a severe burden on the First Amendment rights of candidates and their supporters as literally millions of Pennsylvania electors are deprived of their right to associate based upon residency. He acknowledged that there are thousands of potential circulators who are residents of the 184th Legislative District; but, he noted that the important determinative factor is not how many potential circulators there are, but rather how many people are precluded from being potential circulators.</p>

Stevenson argued that even if the Commonwealth had tried to make such a showing, it would not have been able to meet its burden. In a bit of sideways reasoning, Stevenson posited that the Commonwealth’s compliance with the injunction in <em>Morrill, </em>and the Commonwealth’s decision not to appeal from that decision, effectively undermines any argument that the Commonwealth has a compelling interest in enforcing Section 2911(d). Stevenson claimed that years of compliance with the <em>Morrill </em>court’s permanent injunction, without the election system grinding to a halt, establishes that there is no compelling interest in enforcing Section 2911(d). Stevenson also asserted that any interest the Commonwealth could posit in having local circulators is undercut, moreover, by the lack of a local residency requirement for circulators in statewide races. Thus, argues Stevenson, for dozens of statewide races, circulator affiants may be residents of any part of Pennsylvania, and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>they certainly cannot be presumed to know everyone in the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[117,465,1152,906]]]'>Additionally, Stevenson asserts that even assuming that the government had articulated a compelling interest, the district residency requirement for circulators is still unconstitutional because it is not narrowly tailored. Stevenson observed that the Commonwealth in <em>Morrill, </em>and the Commonwealth Court below, posited that the district residency requirement ensures that a circulator has a personal stake in the district; the district residency requirement thus ensures that the election expresses the true will of the people. Stevenson asserts that this argument is hollow, as the true will of the people is adequately ensured by requiring that a nomination paper bear the signatures of hundreds of qualified, resident electors in order for the proposed candidate’s name to be placed on the ballot. Stevenson notes that “[t]he residence of the witness to those signatures neither adds to nor subtracts from the support from the electorate, and therefore is not narrowly tailored to promote that interest.” Stevenson’s Brief at 14 n. 7.</p>

Because Objectors’ global challenge was not before the Commonwealth Court on remand and the First Amendment issue remained in the jurisdiction of this Court, Objectors’ purported withdrawal of their global challenge did not remove the First Amendment issue from this Court. Instead, the issue became moot because the Commonwealth Court’s final judgment of October 8, 2010, which Stevenson did not appeal, set Stevenson’s Nomination Paper aside on other grounds.

Quite clearly, the Commonwealth could have litigated in 1978 in the federal court issues presented before the state court in <em>Scanlon. </em>But they elected not to do so.

The <em>Delaware Valley II </em>court’s decision comports with our understanding of the operation of the doctrine, in federal-state matters, as outlined above. As -with the <em>Delaware Valley II </em>case, the present matter involves a federal claim that was the subject of a final federal judgment that directs ongoing compliance from the Commonwealth. Also, the compliance demanded from the Commonwealth, in both situations, is global in nature; the federal court’s final judgment, in each case, did not merely require that the Commonwealth act only with respect to the parties who had appeared in the initial federal action.
