Given that the surgical instrument in issue is said to have multiple applications, we are asked to determine whether a trial court’s threshold risk-utility analysis should be limited to the particular one alleged to have caused the plaintiff harm. Additionally, appeal was allowed to consider the degree to which an appellate court is bound by such weight and credibility determinations as may be made by a trial court in a risk-utility assessment.</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.6",155,[117,1076,1154,743]]]'>By way of background, the pertinent medical device is a linear cutting and stapling instrument, used in place of traditional scalpel-and-suture techniques in various surgical applications. In highly simplified terms, the elongated device consists of: a hand-held control mechanism resembling a pistol grip; a thin shaft; and a compact, distal-end jaw. This jaw incorporates compression, cutting, and stapling features useful in transecting organ tissue, while seaming and sealing resultant segments. Through a cartridge inserted into the jaw, linear, parallel rows of staples are fired into compressed tissue on both sides of the blade during incision, ideally leaving the divided and seamed tissue ends hemostatic (or not bleeding). This process is repeated, as needed, to form longer staple-line seams.</p>

As part of the procedure, her stomach was transected to create a smaller stomach pouch. The surgeon used a product manufactured by Ethicon EndoSurgery, Inc. (“Appellee”), known as an ETS-Flex45 Articulating Endoscopic Linear Cutter, or an “endocutter,” as described above. As is apparent from its name and shape, the instrument was designed for use in endoscopic surgery (less invasive procedures accomplished through small incisions in which a magnifying camera, a light source, and surgical instru<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>ments are inserted).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> However, Appellee also marketed its product as being useful in more traditional surgery, in which larger incisions are made to expose organs to open view and accessibility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Mrs. Selepec’s surgery was of this latter kind.</p>

Furthermore, after the surgery, the particular endocutter used was discarded (as is apparently the common practice for these instruments intended for use in a single surgery).</p>

They discovered that staples were absent in two small line segments, with the operative report indicating: “What we found was a defect on the staple line both on the left side of the gastric pouch as well as the gastric remnant. These findings were consistent with mechanical staple failure.” N.T., May 17, 2007, at 275. A repair was effectuated; however, leaked stomach contents fostered sepsis, and Mrs. Selepec died.</p>

Such asserted mistake, Appellee had claimed, was a more probable cause of any staple failure than the alleged product malfunction.</p>

    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[282,614,1152,839]]]'>At trial, Appellant opened his case in chief with the testimony of a general surgeon, I. Michael Leitman, M.D. Dr. Leitman testified to the increased prevalence and success of gastric bypass surgery. <em>See id. </em>at 172-73. He described the benefits of the procedure, including improvement of health and lifestyle for persons suffering from obesity. <em>See id. </em>According to Dr. Leitman, the procedure is not without attendant risk, as one in two-hundred patients may die from the surgery “for a variety of reasons [including] a leak.” <em>id. </em>at 174. In describing the particular bypass technique employed, encompassing the use of the endocutter, Dr. Leitman indicated that, in gauging organ tissue thickness, physicians rely on tactile sense, as well as an unforced closure of the endocutter’s compression mechanism, manifested by a “click.” <em>See id. </em>at 176-79, 189, 201.

According to Dr. Leitman, Dr. Georgiades’ selection of an intermediate-size staple was appropriate, and this was evidenced by the overall adherence of the seam. <em>See id. </em>at 183 (“If he had chosen an inappropriate cartridge and something would have happened, the whole thing would have likely fallen apart, but it was just one small area.”); <em>see also id. </em>at 203. Of central importance to Appellant’s present arguments concerning product defect, <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>Dr. Leitman also testified that there are other devices on the market, used in different cutting and stapling applications, that have a gauge to permit a surgeon to accurately measure thickness. <em>See id. </em>at 190.</p>

He also noted that the products offered by another major endocutter manufacturer also do not incorporate such a device. <em>See id. </em>at 196-197 (“There’s no linear endocutter on the market that has a thickness gauge.”). In response to questions eliciting additional details about the different cutter-stapler referenced in his direct testimony, Dr. Leitman disclosed that it was a circular, intraluminal instrument with substantially different functionality as compared to the endocutter. <em>See id. </em>at 197 (reflecting the witness’s agreement that an intraluminal stapler cannot be used to divide the stomach). Finally, Dr. Leitman acquiesced in the understanding that the package insert accompanying Appellee’s product indicates that, if a surgeon elects to use buttressing material such as peri-strips, he should consider using a larger size staple. <em>See id. </em>at 203 (“Selection of the appropriate staple cartridge should be based upon the combined thickness of both the tissue and the staple line buttressing materials.”).</p>

Furthermore, Appellee notes, Appellant did not object to the defense evidence regarding the utility and design constraints associated with the use of its endocutter in the circumstance for which it was designed and named, <em>i.e., </em>endoscopic surgery.

Nevertheless, Appellant limited his own case at trial to malfunction and design defect theories. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 25 (“[A] claim that [Appellee] should have marketed the device for some procedures while warning against its use in connection with other procedures is not a design defect claim: it is either a breach of warranty claim or a failure to warn claim.

It should be enough to say that a product’s utility obviously may be enhanced by multifunctionality, so that it would be imprudent to deny trial courts the ability to assign some weight to this factor in assessing product design. <em>Cf. supra </em>note 14. Moreover, Appellant simply does not address why the other theories which may be available to a plaintiff, such as failure to warn, do not provide sufficient protection against deficient marketing and instruction practices. In this void, it is difficult to disagree with Appellee’s observation that Appellant’s concessions of the net social utility calculus in the area of the endocutter’s primary design (endoscopic surgery) are irreconcilably inconsistent with his claim of an inherent design defect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

For whatever reason, it didn’t perform the function that it was intended to do based on the fact that it failed, and that subsequent events confirmed that.

At this juncture, we observe that there are a number of theoretical inconsistencies running through this case which tend to cloud the analysis of the issues. For example, as to counsel’s argument above, if Appellant could not prove that a design defect relating to tissue thickness caused Mrs. Selepec's death, it simply could not prevail on a design-defect theory of liability, since causation is an essential element on which Appellant bore the burden of proof. <em>See Berkebile v.
