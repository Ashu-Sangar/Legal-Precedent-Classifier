According to DAP, if the legislature intended such a result, it specifically would have permitted the Commonwealth to invoke the mandatory minimum at any time prior to resentencing, as it did in other statutes. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9763(d) and 9774(c). This distinction is critical, DAP avers, in light of “the canon of statutory construction providing that when the General Assembly uses different language in similar statutes, it does so to demonstrate a different legislative intent.” Brief of DAP at 10.

It contends that the sentencing alternatives available to the court at the time of Appellee’s initial sentencing included non-section 6317 penalties because the parties negotiated, and the trial court imposed, a non-section 6317 penalty.

We disagree. <em>Wilson </em>concerned whether the Commonwealth could present evidence supporting the application of the youth/ school sentence enhancement, 204 Pa.Code § 303.9(c), on remand after the initial sentence was vacated. We permitted the admission of this evidence since vacating the sentence rendered it a legal nullity, thereby allowing the court to treat the case anew for evidentiary purposes. In <em>Monge, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude retrial in the noncapital sentencing context where the original sentence was reversed because there was insufficient evidence to support a recidivism sentence enhancement. Significantly, both cases involved resentencing after the original sentence was overturned on appeal, not resentencing in the context of a probation revocation. Consequently, these cases are inapposite and do not support the Commonwealth’s claim that this Court and the High Court have rejected the so called "one bite at the apple” approach.</p>

Moreover, I disagree with the <em>per curiam </em>view that principles of statutory interpretation suggest that the legislature intended to prohibit, by implication, the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences upon revocation of probation. In my view, the legislature has plainly stated that upon revocation of probation, the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing, and that mandatory minimum sentences must be imposed for prescribed offenses when the Commonwealth gives notice of its intent to proceed under a mandatory minimum provision and provides adequate proof at sentencing that such a provision applies. Additionally, the Sentencing Code contains numerous mandatory minimum sentence provisions that, for all practical purposes, are identical to the instant provision. Thus, the effect of the <em>per curiam </em>decision today is that, absent legislative amendment to the Sentencing Code, no person on probation for commission of any offense punishable by a mandatory <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>minimum sentence, including offenses committed with a firearm, or second or subsequent violent offenses, may properly be sentenced to the applicable mandatory minimum upon revocation of probation, despite having received notice of the Commonwealth’s intent to proceed thereunder.

Moreover, our courts frequently impose probationary sentences as a means of conditional supervision, and it is not uncommon for a sentencing court to enter a split sentence, <em>i.e., </em>impose a sentence on a single offense that combines elements of both incarceration and probation. Given the similarities between intermediate punishment and probation, and between the proof at sentencing provisions of numerous mandatory minimum statutes and the one at issue here, I disagree that the principles of statutory construction show an intent on the part of the legislature to weaken the longstanding precedent in this Commonwealth that “upon revocation of probation, the court possesses the same sentencing alternatives that it had at the time of initial sentencing.” <em>Wallace, supra </em>at 842-843 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/497/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="497 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1775342" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0437-01">497 Pa. 437</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="497 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1775342" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0437-01">441 A.2d 1218</a>, 1219 (1982)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a>

In <em>Wallace, </em>pursuant to the defendant’s negotiated guilty plea to three counts of PWID, the court initially sentenced him to three concurrent terms of twenty-one to forty-two months’ imprisonment followed by two years’ probation. While on probation, the defendant committed another drug offense, and upon revocation of probation, the court sentenced him to three consecutive terms of five to ten years’ imprisonment, the statutory maximum sentence available under the Sentencing Code. The defendant appealed and claimed the sentence was illegal, and the Superior Court agreed, reversing and remanding for resentencing. On remand, the court sentenced the defendant to three concurrent terms of five to ten years' imprisonment, and the defendant appealed once again. The Superior Court ultimately remanded to the trial court for resentencing "limited to the terms of the plea agreement it accepted at the time of original sentencing, that is: concurrent terms with an outside limit of five and one-half years.” <em>Id. </em>at 842. This Court granted the Commonwealth’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>

In a well-reasoned concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Wallace, supra, </em>Justice Saylor correctly pointed out that the analysis of the issue of “available” sentences should recognize that, upon revocation, the imposition of any sentence exceeding that contemplated by the plea agreement is not in strict conformity with the statutory requirement that "the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing.” <em>Id. </em>at 849 (Saylor, J. concurring and dissenting) (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9771(b)). This is so because the trial court would not previously have had the option of sentencing outside the terms of the agreement without offering the defendant the opportunity to withdraw the plea. Here, the imposition of a mandatory minimum is also not in strict conformity with the statutory language. The court would not have previously had the option to impose a mandatory minimum sentence because the Commonwealth had agreed not to proceed under the mandatory minimum provision. Nevertheless, as Justice Saylor has correctly pointed out, <em>see id. (citing Commonwealth v. Fusselman, </em><a href="/a2d/866/1109-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="866 A.2d 1109" data-case-ids="9040194" data-case-paths="/a2d/866/1109-01">866 A.2d 1109</a>, 1113 (Pa.Super.2004)), strict adherence to the statutory language would lead to absurd results since, for example, imposition of a term of incarceration would be "unavailable” on resentencing where the plea agreement did not contemplate incarceration. In my view, the "unavailability” of a mandatory minimum provision on revocation simply because the Commonwealth agreed not to proceed thereunder initially in exchange for the entry of a guilty plea, is an equally unacceptable and absurd result.</p>

I recognize that the propriety of the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence upon revocation of probation was not squarely at issue in <em>Infante, </em>but the holding in the case reflects the accepted practice in Pennsylvania of the Commonwealth’s seeking a mandatory minimum sentence at the revocation of probation stage where probation had initially been imposed pursuant to a negotiated guilty plea agreement in lieu of the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>

I note tangentially that Justice Baer's dissent in <em>Wallace </em>disagreeing that the Commonwealth’s appeal was properly before the Court, has <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>some resonance for me, as I would agree that the issue preserved in the defendant’s first appeal to the Superior Court in that case concerned both the manner (consecutive or concurrent) and length (total period of incarceration) of the sentence imposed, and the Commonwealth did not file a petition for allowance of appeal from that judgment. Nevertheless, the rule in <em>Wallace </em>is broadly stated, controls the issue raised <em>sub judice, </em>and I would conclude, unlike the <em>per curiam </em>opinion, that <em>Wallace </em>requires reversal of the Superior Court’s determination here.</p>
