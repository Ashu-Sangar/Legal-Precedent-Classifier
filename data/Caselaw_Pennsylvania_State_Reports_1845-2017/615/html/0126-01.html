For this reason, the hearing officer concluded that the bargaining rights of the Deputy Sheriffs were governed by Section 805 of the Pennsylvania Public Employe Relations Act (“PERA”), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, <em>as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 1101.805.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In coming to his decision, the hearing examiner found insufficient the Association’s evidence of numerous police-related activities, in addition to court-related ones, engaged in by the Deputy Sheriffs.

Having reached this conclusion, I see no reason to speak to incorporation of the independently-elected sheriff into our court system; the <em>de facto </em>role of the sheriff differs from county to county. The constitutional issues related thereto are considerable, and I would avoid <em>dicta </em>that may prove inapplicable down the road.</p>
