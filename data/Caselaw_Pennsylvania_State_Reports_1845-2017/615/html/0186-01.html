The question highlights a tension in the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, (“MVFRL”), 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1701-1799, and Pennsylvania decisional precedent, as perceived by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On the one hand, Section 1714 of the MVFRL prohibits uninsured drivers from recovering first-party benefits, which include medical and income loss benefits. <em>Id. </em>§§ 1702, 1714. On the other hand, Section 1705 of the MVFRL deems uninsured drivers to have chosen the limited tort alternative, which permits recovery of damages for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person. <em>Id. </em>at § 1705. Economic loss, of course, is commonly understood as being comprised of damages for medical expenses and wage loss. Thus, it may appear as though the MVFRL both prohibits and permits insurance recovery to uninsured drivers for this <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>category of damages or loss, and it is the resolution of this seeming contradiction that we address herein.</p>

On February 6, 2006, Appellee, Mary Corbin, was driving south on Route 413 in Bristol, Pennsylvania, in her uninsured vehicle, while Appellant, Suresh Khosla, was driving his insured vehicle north on Route 413. As the vehicles approached each other, Appellant turned left onto State Road in front of Appellee. In the resulting motor vehicle accident, Appellee sustained bodily injury. Appellee maintained that the accident was Appellant’s fault because she had the right of way through the intersection. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, Appellee sued Appellant in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and sought both economic and non-economic damages.</p>

The district court ruled that Appellee was precluded from recovering non-economic damages under Section 1705. Relying, in part, on language set forth by this Court in <em>Swords v. Harleysville Ins.

In subchapter A, the General Assembly has mandated that all owners of currently registered private passenger motor vehicles in Pennsylvania must maintain the ability to respond in damages to liability-in the minimum amount of $15,000 for injury to one person in any one accident, $30,000 for injury to two or more persons in any one accident, and $5000 for damage to the property of others in any one accident. 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1702-1705. Moreover, an insurance policy may not be issued until the applicant has been provided an opportunity to elect a tort option. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(4). One who chooses the full-tort option remains eligible to seek compensation for both economic and full non-economic losses, whereas one who chooses the limited-tort option remains eligible to seek compensation for economic loss and for non-economic loss only where serious injury has been sustained. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(c), (d). An owner of an uninsured motor vehicle “shall be deemed to have chosen the limited tort alternative.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(5).</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[286,1542,1151,844]]]'>In subchapter B of the MVFRL, the General Assembly has mandated that all motor vehicle insurance policies issued in Pennsylvania must include a first-party medical benefit in the minimum amount of $5000. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1711. Additionally, all insurers must make available for purchase additional first-party medical benefits, income loss benefits, accidental death benefits, funeral benefits, combined benefits, and extraordinary medical benefits. 75 Pa.C.S. 1712. Significantly, there is no requirement to prove fault or liability in order to make a claim for first-party benefits. Instead, such claims are payable upon reasonable proof of the amount of the benefit. Indeed, benefits are overdue and subject to accrual of interest if not paid by the insurer “within 30 days after the insurer receives reasonable proof of the amount of the benefits.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1716. An uninsured motorist “cannot recover first party benefits.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1714.</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Considering the subchapters and sections together, there is no ambiguity. A straightforward reading and analysis shows that, in addition to the potential loss of driving privileges and fines, Pennsylvania attempts to deter motorists from driving without insurance in two ways. First, such motorists are limited in the recovery of non-economic damages by virtue of defaulting to limited tort. Second, such motorists are precluded from making claims for first-party benefits against any policies under which they might have otherwise been eligible for benefits as an insured, a named insured, or the occupant of an insured vehicle. Clearly, Section 1714 precludes uninsured drivers from participating in the first-party benefit system as a sanction or penalty for driving without insurance. This preclusion deprives the uninsured driver of speedy payment of medical and wage loss benefits from any first-party carrier through a direct claim against a policy for no-fault benefits. It does not, however, preclude an uninsured motorist from making a claim for economic damages in tort. Indeed, the MVFRL expressly deems an uninsured motorist to have elected the limited tort option. Thus, the relevant provisions of the MVFRL remove uninsured drivers from any potential participation in the first-party no-fault system, and thrust the uninsured driver into the uncertainty, time and expense required to sue the tortfeasor, establish fault, and recover payment limited to economic damages (and non-economic damages in the event of serious injury) from the tortfeasor’s insurance company under the third-party liability provisions of the insured’s policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <blockquote id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[205,1376,1086,861]]]'>Construing Section 1714 as only prohibiting an uninsured owner and operator of a vehicle from recovering damages from a defendant insurance company, as opposed to an alleged third party tortfeasor, is consistent with the statutory language. Section 1714 prohibits owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from " recovering] first party benefits.” (Emphasis added). First party benefits are benefits paid by a plaintiff’s own insurance carrier. <em>James R. Ronca et al. Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Insurance: An Analysis of the Financial Responsibility Law </em>§ 2.1 (2d ed.2007). The statute does not explicitly exclude recovery of benefits from an alleged third party tortfeasor. The Pennsylvania Superior Court in <em>McClung, <a href="/a2d/700/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="700 A.2d 495" data-case-ids="11899999" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0495-01">supra,</a> </em>conceded this point, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in <em>Swords </em>did not hold that Section 1714 precluded recovery of economic damages from a third party tortfeasor. <em>McClung, </em><a href="/a2d/700/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="700 A.2d 495" data-case-ids="11899999" data-case-paths="/a2d/700/0495-01">700 A.2d at 497</a>; <em>Swords, </em><a href="/a2d/883/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="883 A.2d 562" data-case-ids="8908654,988543" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0562-01,/pa/584/0382-01">883 A.2d at 569</a>. Furthermore, Section 1714 falls within the subchapter of 75 Pa.C.S.A. covering "Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance First Party Benefits.” (Emphasis added). The fact that the subchapter specifically refers to “insurance” coverage suggests that Section 1714 would not apply to actions brought to recover economic damages from a third[-]party tortfeasor. Moreover, as noted in <em>Swords, supra, </em>75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1705 would allow recovery of economic damages as the consequence of the fault of another person.</blockquote>
