The business had already closed for the day. Sgt. Hendrick pulled his marked cruiser into the parking lot to “merely [check] on the vehicle.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), Oct. 4, 2007 at 21. In so doing, Sgt. Hendrick positioned his cruiser at a 45-degree angle to the parked car, aligning his headlights to illuminate the passenger side. Dressed in full uniform, Sgt. Hendrick then exited his cruiser, and approached the front-passenger door of the car. As he neared the vehicle, the front-passenger window rolled down, and Sgt. Hendrick observed six individuals in the car: two in the front seat, and four in the back. Sgt. Hendrick walked up to the window, and asked the occupants, “What’s going on?” <em>Id. </em>at 6.

Sgt. Hendrick did not merely approach Appellee in an airport, bus terminal, or like facility and ask to see his identification, ticket, and luggage. Rather, as noted, at the origin of this incident, the sergeant pulled his marked cruiser into a parking lot at an angle to the car in which Appellee was <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>seated to position the police officer’s headlights so that they would shine directly into the car and at Appellee; exited his cruiser; approached the car in full uniform with holstered gun evident; positioned himself immediately outside Appellee’s door; and began to interrogate Appellee and the other occupants of the vehicle regarding their purpose for being in the lot at 12:30 a.m.</p>
    <p id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[142,720,1154,733]]]'>I emphasize these facts because they are part of the totality of the circumstances, and not because standing alone they rise to an unconstitutional stop requiring reasonable suspicion. Indeed, a convincing argument can be made that the illumination of the interior of the car and the conspicuous movement of the uniformed police officer toward it were measures appropriate for officer safety. At that juncture, the individuals in the car could have assured the officer of their well-being. The officer having responsibly carried out his duties, and being satisfied that these young people were just “hanging out,” could have told them to be careful, wished them well, and sent them on their way. If that is how this scenario would have concluded, there would have been no infringement of Appellee’s constitutional rights.</p>
    <p id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[138,1476,1155,786]]]'>Instead, with no basis or necessity, the sergeant sought Appellee’s identification, as he was obviously unsatisfied with the answers he had received to his inquiries to that point. When this solicitation for identification is considered in the context of all the other elements of this interaction, it escalated from a scenario where a reasonable, innocent person in Appellee’s position would have felt free to speak or not speak with Sgt. Hendrick, to one in which such person no longer felt free to ignore or refuse the sergeant’s solicitation for identification. <em>Accord Commonwealth v.

Maj. Op. at 338, 42 A.3d at 1007. While the facts of this case, combined with the aforementioned precedent, certainly exemplify this sentiment, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that where a balance is to be achieved “between the public interest and [a citizen’s] right to personal security and privacy,” such balance must “til[t] in favor of freedom from police interference.” <em>Brown, </em><a href="/us/443/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="443 U.S. 47" data-case-ids="6179718" data-case-paths="/us/443/0047-01">443 U.S. at 52</a>, <a href="/us/443/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="443 U.S. 47" data-case-ids="6179718" data-case-paths="/us/443/0047-01">99 S.Ct. 2637</a>. Here, Sgt. Hendrick’s solicitation of Appellee’s identification constituted just that: unlawful police interference with lawful private conduct. As such interference constitutes an investigatory detention unsupported by reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the Superior Court correctly affirmed the trial court’s granting of suppression. As the Majority reaches the opposite result, I respectfully dissent.</p>

I agree with the Majority that, to the extent the parties have not focused their advocacy on the privacy-based interests of Article I, Section 8, we should not expand the decision in this case, whatever the outcome, beyond the Fourth Amendment.</p>
