After failing the polygraph, Knoble admitted during group treatment that he had been dishonest about his sexual history. Knoble took a second polygraph, and again disclosed during a subsequent group therapy session that he had been deceptive about essential aspects of his sexual history. Knoble admitted he had victimized other minors, and accepted responsibility for a sexual offense against a minor for which he had previously been acquitted.
