        "text": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the order of the Superior Court that affirmed the pre-trial order of the court of common pleas permitting Jose Alicia (\u201cAppellee\u201d) to introduce expert testimony concerning the phenomenon of \u201cfalse confessions\u201d at his upcoming murder trial. Because we agree with the Commonwealth that such testimony is not admissible, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand this matter to the court of common pleas.\nOn November 1, 2005, Appellee was arrested and charged with murder and related offenses in the shooting death, two days earlier, of one George Rowe at the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9 in Philadelphia. Evidence adduced at the pre-trial stage established that Appellee and several of his friends, including Lydia Rivera, Jeremy Duffy (\u201cJ.P.\u201d), and Angel Ortiz, had gone to the caf\u00e9 after receiving word that individuals who had previously robbed Ortiz were there. In the midst of the physical altercation that ..ensued between the two groups, a gun was fired, hitting the victim, an innocent bystander who was not part of either group.\nAppellee was detained by police and questioned over a period of approximately six hours. Although Appellee initially denied involvement, near the end of the interview he confessed to shooting the victim during the altercation in the caf\u00e9, and he subsequently was charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, possession of an instrument of crime, and two violations of the Uniform Firearms Act. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence against Appellee included a statement from Lydia Rivera that Appellee was the shooter. However, other eyewitnesses identified the shooter as Angel Ortiz, and Ortiz told police that Jeremy Duffy was the shooter.\nOn May 3, 2007, Appellee filed a Motion for Use of a False Confessions Expert, averring the following. Appellee is of low intelligence and has been an SSI disability beneficiary due to mental health issues most of his life. The only evidence identifying Appellee as the shooter (other than his confession) comes from two corrupt sources, one of whom initially stated that the shooter was Jeremy Duffy. Appellee believes Duffy was the shooter, and that the evidence at trial will show that Appellee was told by Duffy\u2019s associates to \u201ctake the fall for the real perpetrator.\u201d Motion for Use of a False Confessions Expert, dated 5/3/07, at \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. According to this Motion, the text of Appellee\u2019s confession, along with his handwritten corrections, \u201cprovide a number of clues indicating it is a false confession.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 7. Further, the Motion avers that although \u201cjurors find it impossible to believe that a person would make a false confession,\u201d it has been proven in over 185 cases that false confessions do indeed occur. Id. at \u00b6 9. Based on the above averments, Appellee requested that the court grant his motion to permit a false confessions expert to testify.\nOn June 6, 2007, the Commonwealth filed a motion to exclude any defense expert on false confessions. The Commonwealth noted that Appellee, in his motion for such an expert, did not allege that the police had influenced or coerced him to give a false confession. Commonwealth\u2019s Motion to Exclude Defense Expert in False Confession and for a Frye Hearing on the Admissibility of Said Expert, filed 6/6/07, at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12. The Commonwealth averred that the determination of whether an individual falsely confessed to a crime is within the jury\u2019s own ability to evaluate. In addition, the Commonwealth argued that expert testimony regarding the phenomenon of false confessions in general, proffered in order to give rise to the inference that Appellee\u2019s confession must also be false, would undermine the fact-determining process because such testimony would be based on mere speculation. Id. at \u00b6 12. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asked the court to deny Appellee\u2019s motion as not relevant because the jury was capable of assessing whether the evidence established that non-police sources might have influenced Appellee to confess falsely.\nOn June 17, 2008, the court of common pleas held a hearing to determine whether the proposed testimony of Richard Leo, Ph.D., J.D., Appellee\u2019s proffered expert in the area of police interrogation practices, psychological coercion, and false confessions, was admissible. Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d), 6/17/08, at 11. The court first found that Dr. Leo was \u201cqualified as an expert in the field of police interrogations.\u201d Id. at 34. Dr. Leo then explained police interrogation as a two-step psychological process: the first step is to convince the suspect that he or she is caught and denial is futile, and the second step is to motivate the suspect to believe that it is in his or her best interest to make a full confession. Id. at 45-46. Dr. Leo testified that there are two different types of false confessions that may result from police interrogation: 1) a \u201ccompliant\u201d false confession in which a suspect is psychologically coerced to lie, knowingly giving a false confession in order to end the interrogation and perhaps to be treated more leniently; and 2) a \u201cpersuaded\u201d or \u201cinternalized\u201d false confession in which a suspect confesses to a crime under the belief that he or she did in fact commit the crime although he or she has no memory of doing so. N.T., 6/17/08, at 50-52.\nWhen asked what he would testify to, were he permitted to testify in Appellee\u2019s case, Dr. Leo responded as follows. First, in general terms, he would educate the jury as to police interrogation methods, psychological research on interrogation methods, and coercive interrogation methods that can put an innocent suspect at risk of making a false confession. Id. at 59-64. Second, in terms of the specifics of this case, Dr. Leo would discuss the specific interrogation techniques he discerned from interviewing Appellee about what took place during his interrogation, and identify any possible risks of false confession posed by those techniques. In addition, Dr. Leo would discuss the relevance of Appellee\u2019s low IQ to the risk of false confession. Id. at 61-62. At the end of the hearing, the trial court ordered the parties to submit memos on the admissibility of Dr. Leo\u2019s proffered trial testimony.\nOn August 12, 2008, the court issued the following order, which permitted Dr. Leo to testify in general regarding police interrogation techniques, but barred him from giving testimony as to any specific allegations in Appellee\u2019s case:\n1. Dr. Leo may testify, based on his knowledge, his own research and the research of others with which he is familiar, about the general concept of false confessions.\n2. Dr. Leo may further testify, again based on his knowledge, his own research and the research of others with which he is familiar, about:\n(a) . Police training methods in the field of interrogations;\n(b) . Police interrogation methods; and\n(c) . Why certain interrogation techniques, if used in a particular case, may increase the risk of false confession.\n3. Dr. Leo may not testify as to case specific allegations about the interrogation in the instant case, and may not offer testimony based on:\n(a) . Statements provided to him by the defendant either verbally or in writing;\n(b) . Documents or reports prepared by counsel or other experts, to the extent such documents or reports purport to be based on discussions with or information about the defendant, Jose Alicea;\n(c) . What he believes may be factors specific to this interrogation that may have given rise to a false confession; and\n(d) . Wfiiether or not he believes the confession in this case was voluntary or coerced, or true or false.\nTrial Court Order, entered 8/12/08 (emphases in original).\nThe Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal in the Superior Court, arguing that the trial court had erred in ordering that Dr. Leo could testify, because his proffered testimony would invade the credibility-assessing function of the jury. In an opinion filed pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a), the trial court reasoned that, because Dr. Leo would not be permitted to testify \u201cas to any case specific allegations with regard to [Appellee\u2019s] confession or the interrogation methods used by police in this particular case\u201d and would not be permitted to offer opinion testimony as to the truthfulness of Appellee\u2019s confession, the jury would remain the ultimate arbiter of the credibility of Appellee\u2019s confession. Trial Court Opinion, dated 11 /24/08, at 6.\nA divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed the order of the trial court. The lead memorandum opinion written by Judge Mary Jane Bowes held that Dr. Leo\u2019s proposed testimony would not usurp the jury\u2019s credibility-determining function and would not improperly bolster or attack the credibility of, respectively, Appellee or law enforcement officers, because the court had barred Dr. Leo from discussing the specific circumstances of Appellee\u2019s interrogation and confession. Commonwealth v. Alicia, 2445 EDA 2008, slip opinion at 36-37, 45, 26 A.3d 1190 (Pa.Super., filed 3/14/11) (memorandum opinion). In a concurring statement, President Judge Emeritus Stephen McEwen set forth his view that Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony was not relevant to the issues before the jury; however, because the Commonwealth had not raised the issue of relevance before the Superior Court, he remained in a concurring posture. Alicia, supra (McEwen, P.J.E., concurring, at 2). In a dissenting memorandum, then-President Judge Corr\u00e9ale Stevens concluded that Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony would impermissibly invade the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the arbiter of credibility because even a general discussion of interrogation methods that may be more likely to lead to a false confession would improperly enhance Appellee\u2019s credibility and attack the officers\u2019 credibility. Alicia, supra (Stevens, P.J., dissenting, at 1-3).\nThe Commonwealth sought this Court\u2019s review, which we granted as to the following issue:\nUnder this Court\u2019s precedent, which the Superior Court mischaracterized and misapplied, does expert testimony on \u201cthe phenomenon of false confessions\u201d impermissibly invade the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the arbiter of credibility?\nCommonwealth v. Alicia, 615 Pa. 613, 44 A.3d 1147 (2012).\nTo support its argument that Dr. Leo\u2019s proffered testimony would improperly intrude on the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the arbiter of credibility, the Commonwealth relies upon this Court\u2019s prior holding that similar psychological expert testimony in other areas is inadmissible because it would \u201cinvest the opinions of experts with an unwarranted appearance of authority on the subject of credibility, which is within the facility of the ordinary juror to assess.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 17-18 (citation omitted). In response, Appellee argues that Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony is admissible for the sole purpose of educating the jury as to a topic about which it would be otherwise uninformed. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 15-18. Appellee\u2019s Amici Curiae, the Innocence Network and the Pennsylvania Innocence Project, argue that jurors have an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of interrogation techniques and confessions, and thus are in need of expert information concerning false confessions. In Amici\u2019s view, rather than invading the jury\u2019s province of assessing credibility, Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony would \u201cprovide a framework, based on established, general [sic] accepted research or clinical evaluations of the suspect, for juries to consider in their weighing of confession evidence.\u201d Brief of Amici Curiae at 15-16.\nThe admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and this Court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision concerning admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 623 (2010). An abuse of discretion will not be found based on a mere error of judgment, but rather exists where the court has reached a conclusion which overrides or misapplies the law, or where the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will. Commonwealth v. Eichinger, 591 Pa. 1, 915 A.2d 1122, 1140 (2007). To the extent that this case presents a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope is plenary.\nUnder our Rules of Evidence, expert testimony is permitted when the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is beyond that of the average layperson and will help the fact-finder to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. Pa.R.E. 702(a) and (b); Commonwealth v. Lopez, 578 Pa. 545, 854 A.2d 465, 470 (2004). We have consistently maintained that a lay jury is capable of determining whether a witness is lying, and thus expert testimony is not permissible as to the question of witness credibility. For example, in Commonwealth v. Davis, 518 Pa. 77, 541 A.2d 315, 317 (1988), we stated the following:\n[T]he veracity of a particular witness is a question which must be answered in reliance on the ordinary experiences of life, common knowledge of the natural tendencies of human nature, and observations of the character and demeanor of the witness. As the phenomenon of lying is within the ordinary capacity of jurors to assess, the question of a witness\u2019s credibility is reserved exclusively for the jury.\nId.; see also Commonwealth v. Balodis, 560 Pa. 567, 747 A.2d 341, 345 (2000) (\u201cA determination of whether or not a witness is telling the truth is a subject well within the ordinary knowledge and experience of the average juror.\u201d); Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 352 A.2d 30, 32 (1976) (\u201cTo permit psychological testimony for th[e] purpose [of determining the credibility of a witness] would be an invitation for the trier of fact to abdicate its responsibility to ascertain the facts relying upon the questionable premise that the expert is in a better position to make such a judgment.\u201d)\nOn many occasions, this Court has held inadmissible expert psychiatric or psychological testimony which, by providing a generalized explication of human behavior under certain particular circumstances, directly speaks to whether a witness is being truthful. For example, in Commonwealth v. Dunkle, 529 Pa. 168, 602 A.2d 830, 836-38 (1992), we held inadmissible expert testimony as to the reasons why child victims of sexual abuse often do not immediately report the abuse and often omit many details thereof. We concluded that the reasons for such behavior in a child are well within the range of common experience, knowledge, and understanding of a jury, and expert testimony on the matter would improperly infringe upon the jury\u2019s ability and responsibility to assess the credibility of the child witness; see also Balodis, supra at 345-46 (relying on the same reasoning to reject expert testimony similar to that at issue in Dunkle). Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Seese, 512 Pa. 439, 517 A.2d 920 (1986), we held inadmissible expert testimony that young children rarely he about sexual abuse, reasoning that such testimony would opine on the veracity of an entire class of individuals, and thus would encroach on the province of the jury to assess the individual witness\u2019s credibility; see also Davis, supra at 316-17 (citing Seese in concluding that expert testimony as to the inability of young children to fantasize about sexual encounters was improper). In Commonwealth v. Gallagher, 519 Pa. 291, 547 A.2d 355 (1988), we held that expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome was improperly admitted at the appellant\u2019s trial. The expert in Gallagher had opined that the victim was suffering from rape trauma syndrome, and thus her positive, in-court identification of the appellant as her assailant was not incompatible with her inability to identify him shortly after the rape, which had occurred five years earlier. Id. at 358. We determined that the only purpose of the Gallagher expert testimony was to enhance the credibility of the victim, and we concluded that \u201c[s]uch testimony would invest the opinions of experts with an unwarranted appearance of authority on the subject of credibility, which is within the facility of the ordinary juror to assess.\u201d Id.\nIn each of the above examples, the psychological or psychiatric expert testimony deemed inadmissible was proffered by the Commonwealth; however, we have also rejected expert testimony proffered by the defense when it infringes upon the jury\u2019s assessment of a witness\u2019s credibility. For example, in Commonwealth v. Crawford, 553 Pa. 195, 718 A.2d 768, 773 (1998), this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony on revived repressed memory because the reliability of revived repressed memory was not at issue in the case and the expert testimony was intended solely to attack a Commonwealth witness\u2019s credibility, a matter properly left to the jury. Based upon similar reasoning, in several cases, we have also held inadmissible expert testimony regarding factors that may influence the reliability of eyewitness identification. See Commonwealth v. Spence, 534 Pa. 233, 627 A.2d 1176, 1178, 1182 (1993) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the opinion testimony of a psychologist regarding the possible effects of stress upon a victinVwitness\u2019s ability to identify his assailant, whom the victim/witness knew from their previous partnership in dealing illegal drugs); Commonwealth v. Simmons, 541 Pa. 211, 662 A.2d 621, 631 (1995) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow a defense expert to testify generally about the reliability of eyewitness identification, reiterating that \u201c[s]uch testimony would have given an unwarranted appearance of authority as to the subject of credibility, a subject which an ordinary juror can assess,\u201d and noting that the defendant-appellant had attacked the witnesses\u2019 credibility and pointed out the inconsistencies of their testimony during cross-examination and closing argument); Commonwealth v. Abdul-Salaam, 544 Pa. 514, 678 A.2d 342, 352 (1996) (relying on Simmons to uphold the trial court\u2019s denial of the appellant\u2019s request for funding of an expert in the psychology of eyewitness identification).,\nAlthough this Court has not previously ruled on the admissibility of expert testimony concerning false confessions, courts in other jurisdictions have done so. Many have held such testimony inadmissible. For example, in United, States v. Benally, 541 F.3d 990, 998 (10th Cir.2008), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a district court\u2019s refusal to admit a psychologist\u2019s expert testimony concerning whether false confessions occur, and if they do occur, why they occur. The defendant-appellant had testified that his confession was false and claimed that it had been prompted by federal agents\u2019 coercive tactics. Id. In rejecting the defendant-appellant\u2019s proffered expert testimony, the Tenth Circuit held as follows:\n[The psychologist\u2019s expert] testimony inevitably would encroach upon the jury\u2019s vital and exclusive function to make credibility determinations. While [the defendant-appellant] emphasizes that [the psychologist expert] would not have opined as to whether she believed [that he had] confessed falsely, with or without the opinion, the import of her expert testimony would be the same: disregard the confession and credit the [defendant-appellant\u2019s] testimony that his confession was a lie. Testimony concerning credibility is often excluded because it usurps a critical function of the jury and because it is not helpful to the jury, which is capable of making its own determination regarding credibility.\nId. at 995 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nIn United States v. Jacques, 784 F.Supp.2d 59, 60 (D.Mass.2011), a district court declined to admit the defendant\u2019s proffered expert testimony concerning the existence of false confessions generally and the features of the defendant\u2019s specific interrogation that allegedly increased the risk of a false confession. Citing Benally, supra, the court concluded, inter alia, that the proffered expert testimony was contrary to the well-established rule that an expert cannot offer an opinion as to a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence: \u201cAn opinion that a defendant\u2019s [confession] is unreliable cannot be logically disconnected from the implicit opinion that the defendant is, in fact, not guilty.\u201d Jacques, supra at 63 (emphasis in original). See also Brown v. Horell, 644 F.3d 969, 978, 982-83 (9th Cir.2011) (in denying a petition for habeas corpus, upholding the exclusion of expert testimony as to interrogation methods that tend to produce false confessions, where the trial court had concluded that the defendant\u2019s explanation for his allegedly false confession, to wit, a threat of violence against another person, was within the jury\u2019s experience); State v. Free, 351 N.J.Super. 203, 798 A.2d 83, 95-96 (App.Div.2002) (holding that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting expert testimony as to false confessions and interrogation techniques because, inter alia, it was not scientifically reliable, it was of no assistance to the jury, and the jury would recognize that coercive methods have the potential for causing a false confession).\nAppellee cites three cases in which expert testimony as to false confessions was determined to be admissible. See Appellee\u2019s Brief at 17-18 (citing United States v. Hall, 93 F.3d 1337 (7th Cir.1996); Boyer v. State, 825 So.2d 418 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2002); and Miller v. State, 770 N.E.2d 763 (Ind.2002)). In Hall, the defendant-appellant\u2019s theory of the case was that he had falsely confessed due to a personality disorder that made him susceptible to suggestion and pathologically eager to please. Id. at 1341. The district court excluded expert testimony from a social psychologist regarding false confessions and coercive interrogation techniques, as well as expert testimony from a psychiatrist who had examined the defendant-appellant regarding his susceptibility to interrogation techniques and his propensity to give a false confession. Id. at 1341, 1345. The Seventh Circuit vacated the defendant-appellant\u2019s conviction, concluding that the excluded expert testimony at issue \u201cwent to the heart\u201d of the defendant-appellant\u2019s defense. Id. at 1345; see also Boyer, supra at 419-20 (in reversing the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony as to the phenomenon of false confessions and police interrogation techniques, quoting Hall for the proposition that the expert testimony \u201cwould have let the jury know that a phenomenon known as false confessions exists, how to recognize it, and how to decide whether it fit the facts of the case being tried\u201d); Miller, supra at 774 (reversing the trial court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony as to the psychology of false confessions because the testimony \u201cwould have assisted the jury regarding the psychology of relevant aspects of police interrogation and the interrogation of mentally retarded persons, topics outside common knowledge and experience\u201d).\nAfter careful review of relevant opinions from courts of other jurisdictions, as well as our own precedent, we are not persuaded by the rationale of those courts that have admitted expert psychological/psychiatric testimony regarding the phenomenon of false confessions and police interrogation techniques. Rather, we conclude, in agreement with the Tenth Circuit Court\u2019s decision in Benally, supm at 995, that expert testimony such as the proposed testimony of Dr. Leo constitutes an impermissible invasion of the jury\u2019s role as the exclusive arbiter of credibility.\nThis conclusion is not altered by the fact that the trial court\u2019s order barred Dr. Leo from offering opinion testimony as to whether Appellee\u2019s particular confession was, in fact, false. General expert testimony that certain interrogation techniques have the potential to induce false confessions improperly invites the jury to determine that those particular interrogation techniques were used to elicit the confession in question, and hence to conclude that it should not be considered reliable. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Dr. Leo\u2019s proposed testimony would merely serve a pedagogical function.\nFurthermore, were the defense permitted to offer Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony concerning interrogation techniques that might lead to false confessions, it is highly likely that the Commonwealth would seek to present rebuttal expert testimony that the same techniques elicit true confessions \u2014 and elicit true confessions in substantially greater numbers than false confessions. We cannot conclude that expert testimony as to such generalities would help the jury to understand the evidence presented or to determine a fact in issue, to wit, the veracity of Appellee\u2019s confession. Ultimately, we believe that the matter of whether Appellee\u2019s confession is false is best left to the jury\u2019s common sense and life experience, after proper development of relevant issues related to, inter alia, the particular circumstances surrounding the elicitation of his confession, using the traditional and time-honored techniques of cross-examination and argument.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand the matter to the court of common pleas for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice BAER joins the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion and Justice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. The relevant portions of Appellee\u2019s statement to the police are as follows:\nQ. Are you willing to answer questions of your own free will regarding this shooting inside 5514 Rising Sun Avenue?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know the decedent in this matter, George Rowe?\nA. No.\nQ. Were you present inside the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9 when a male was shot and killed on 10-30-05 at about 8:23 pm?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Do you know who shot the male inside the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9 on 10-30-05 at about 8:23 pm?\nA. I did.\nQ. Jose, who else was present when you shot the male inside the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9?\nA. Tito, JP, Angel and Lydia.\nQ. Jose, would you tell us what took place that led up to you shooting the male inside the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9?\nA. We were hanging out down at 3rd and Indy; Me, Tito and JP when Lydia calls Tito on his cell phone. She was like, \u201cthey rolled on Angel\u201d and she was gonna pick us up to go over there. We were all like \"OK\u201d, we were all in agreement. We were getting rowdy, ready to fight. After a couple of minutes, Lydia pulls up and picks us up. We get in the car and she drives us to the corner of Clarkson and Westford. We got out there and waited for her. She was going to go up and pick up Angel so that he could take us to where the guys that rolled on him were. Then Angel and Lydia came walking back. We followed them around the corner to the caf\u00e9 on Rising Sun Ave. where all this happened. When we got to the caf\u00e9, Angel peeped in the window to make sure that the guys were in there. Angel says they are in there so we go in. Angel went in first then everyone else. I went in last and stayed by the door. Everybody just started fighting, tables and chairs started flying. I started to back up and as I did that, I pulled a gun out of my waist. I pointed it at the guys and told them to stop throwing chairs. The guy threw another chair and the gun went off. Everybody started running; one guy was trying to run to the back door and I fired two shots at the door while he was running. After that I ran out of the place. I ran to my right and up Clarkson. As I was running, I heard someone say \u201cdrop the weapon\u201d. I thought it was the Police, so I dropped the gun and kept running. Then I just went home.\nQ. What kind of gun did you have?\nA. It was a silver automatic, that\u2019s all I know.\nQ. At what point did you get your gun that day?\nA. I had it with me that night but not on me. I didn\u2019t actually keep it on me until Lydia came.\nQ. Did Lydia tell you how many people \"rolled on\u201d Angel?\nA. I think she said three.\nQ. Did she tell you who rolled on Angel?\nA. She just said that they were black guys who wanted to take his money.\nQ. When you went into the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9, how many guys were in there?\nA. There were three of them.\nQ. Did you know any of these males?\nA. No, I never saw them before.\nQ. Did anyone else have a gun that night in the caf\u00e9?\nA. I didn\u2019t no [sic].\nQ. Jose Det. Bums is showing you a number of photographs. Can you tell me if you recognize these males? A. Yeah. This is JP (identifying ... Jeremy Duffy); this is Angel (identifying ... Angel Ortiz) and this is Tito (identifying ... Andres Rivera).\nQ. Are these the same males that were with you the night that you shot the male inside the Blue Mountain Caf\u00e9 at 5514 Rising Sun Ave.?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Det. Burns is showing you a Driver\u2019s License photograph, do you recognize this female?\nA. Yes. That\u2019s Lydia (identifying ... Lydia Rivera).\nQ. Is this the Lydia that you have been referring to in your statement?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Jose, is there anything else that you would like to add?\nA. Just that I didn\u2019t mean to kill anyone. I was really feared [sic] of the guys throwing chairs at me so I fired so I can get out of this tradity [sic].\nQ. Jose, I would like for you to read this 5 page statement. You can make corrections or additions. If it is true and correct sign the bottom of each page.\nA. Ok Jose Alicia from the bottom of my heart that I'm sorry for all that I have done.\nInvestigation Interview Record, dated 11/01/05.\n. Respectively, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502, 903, 907, 6106, and 6108.\n. Ms. Rivera is identified variously as Appellee\u2019s friend or as his aunt.\n. A defense mental health expert concluded that Appellee's IQ score was 64, placing him in the range considered mentally retarded. See Psychological Evaluation by Allan Tepper, J.D., Psy.D., dated 3/19/07, at 4.\n. Appellee\u2019s motion of May 3, 2007, did not request a specific expert, but rather stated that the defense was then \"currently corresponding with two of the nation's three most prominent and respected false confessions experts: Richard A. Leo ... and Alan Hirsch\u201d and attached a curriculum vitae for each of the two individuals. Motion for Use of a False Confessions Expert, dated 5/3/07, at \u00b6 10. Appellee subsequently proffered the testimony of Dr. Leo.\n. As indicated in the title of its motion, the Commonwealth also sought a Fiye hearing on the admissibility of the defense expert's testimony concerning false confessions. See Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir. 1923). The issue of the admissibility of the proffered testimony under Fiye is not before us.\n. As developed at the hearing, Dr. Leo received a Ph.D. and a J.D. in 1994 from the University of California at Berkeley. Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.''), 6/17/08, at 19, 21. His doctoral dissertation was \u201con the study of police interrogation practices in the United States in the 20th century.\u201d Id. at 19. Subsequently, he has been a professor at three universities in four departments, to wit, psychology, criminology, sociology, and law. Id. The primary focus of his research has been \u201cpolice interrogation, Miranda, false confession, and wrongful conviction.\u201d Id. at 19-20.\n. Of these two types of false confessions, the latter is rarer and is not a basis upon which Appellee here challenges the veracity of his statements to police.\n. Dr. Leo also submitted a report to the court in which he stated that if called to testify at Appellee's trial, he would provide the following testimony: \"I would provide general educative testimony about modern American interrogation techniques and strategies; the step-by-step process through [sic] psychological interrogation is designed to move the suspect from denial to admission; the assumptions, goals and effects of police interrogation practices; which interrogation methods and strategies researchers regard as psychologically coercive and why; how and why psychologically coercive police interrogation techniques can lead the innocent to confess falsely; what we know about the phenomenon of interrogation-induced false confession; the personal and situational risk factors for interrogation-induced false confession; and the patterns, characteristics and indicia of unreliability found in interrogation-induced false confessions.\u201d\nLeo Report, dated 5/15/08, at 4-5.\nDr. Leo also indicated that he had interviewed Appellee, who had stated that his family had put pressure on him not to snitch on \"Jay-Jay\u201d as the shooter, and he feared that he and/or his family would be harmed were he to do so. Id. at 6-7. Dr. Leo acknowledged that \"[o]ther than the participants, no one knows what really happened during [Appellee\u2019s] interrogation.\u201d Id. at 6.\n. The Commonwealth also argued that Dr. Leo\u2019s methodology was not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and, therefore did not meet the admissibility requirements of Frye v. U.S., 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923) and Grady v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 576 Pa. 546, 839 A.2d 1038 (2003). However, we did not grant review of this issue and we shall not address it further. For this reason, certain of the cases from other jurisdictions excluding expert testimony regarding false confessions relied upon by the Commonwealth are inapposite as they directly address whether the expert testimony proffered is based on any reliable and accepted scientific methodology.\n. The entirety of Rule 702 is as follows:\nRule 702. Testimony by Expert Witnesses\nA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\n(a) the expert\u2019s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is beyond that possessed by the average layperson;\n(b) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; and\n(c) the expert's methodology is generally accepted in the relevant field.\nSubsection(c) reflects Pennsylvania's adoption of the standard in Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923). See Comment to Rule 702. In the instant case, there is no Frye issue before this Court.\n. In Commonwealth v. Walker, 625 Pa. 450, 92 A.3d 766, 2014 WL 2208139 (Pa., filed 5/27/14), the appellant has asked us to limit the holdings of Abdul-Salaam, Simmons, and Spence, and to reconsider the bar to expert testimony concerning factors that may impair the accuracy of eyewitness identification. We note here that the accuracy of an eyewitness identification is a matter readily distinguishable from the veracity of a confession to a crime. In assessing the reliability of an eyewitness identification, the issue is generally not whether the victim or witness is telling the truth \u2014 the victim or witness is often entirely and honestly convinced, and convincing to the fact-finder, that he or she has correctly identified the true perpetrator. The issue is rather whether the witness\u2019s identification is indeed accurate.\n. Our Superior Court has approved of the admission of psychological expert testimony in two areas, to wit, battered person syndrome and post-traumatic stress syndrome, as probative of the defendant's state of mind as it relates to a theory of self-defense. See Commonwealth v. Miller, 430 Pa.Super. 297, 634 A.2d 614, 622 (1993) (en banc) (reasoning that expert testimony as to battered person syndrome was \"not introduced to improperly bolster the credibility of the defendant, but rather, to aid the jury in evaluating the defendant's behavior and state of mind given the abusive environment which existed\u201d); Commonwealth v. Pitts, 740 A.2d 726, 732-34 (Pa.Super.1999) (relying on Miller's reasoning to admit the expert testimony of a defense psychiatrist as to the diagnosis and symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome, because such testimony would explain how post-traumatic stress syndrome affected the reasonableness of the defendant\u2019s belief that at the time he shot the victim, he was in danger of death or serious bodily injury). The circumstances of Miller and Pitts, and the purposes for which psychological expert testimony was proffered in these cases, are distinguishable from the instant case.\n. It must be noted that in Jacques, the defendant\u2019s confession was recorded on videotape, and thus the district court concluded that the jury \u201cwas particularly well positioned to evaluate for itself the effect of the interrogation technique on the reliability of [the defendant's] confession.\u201d Id. at 63.\n. The 7th Circuit remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the expert was proposing to testify to scientific knowledge that would assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue, pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). Hall, supra at 1341-42, 1346.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nIn Commonwealth v. Walker, 625 Pa. 450, 92 A.3d 766 (2014), this Court lifted the absolute prohibition against expert testimony concerning eyewitness identifications, investing judgment about the admissibility of such evidence within the sound discretion of trial judges. Walker, in my view, reflects an emerging reluctance to adhere reflexively to nineteenth-century conventions and axioms, amidst growing evidence produced by social and behavioral scientists (among others) that these may have been precipitous. In this regard, I believe Walker represents an exercise in judicial modesty. After Walker, no longer will we intone that jurors\u2019 life experience and common sense will necessarily guide them to the truth when the essential inquiry encompasses understanding the complex subjects of perception and memory. Rather, in appropriate cases \u2014 where the science is sound and the evidence is deemed probative and necessary \u2014 we will not inflexibly block litigants\u2019 attempts to educate jurors about matters we are learning may be further from the realm of everyday experience than our predecessors had envisioned.\nMy position in the present case tracks my vote in Walker. Here, I would abandon the restraint upon our trial courts against admitting expert testimony regarding human behavior in police interrogations based on the notion that such evidence is by nature an \u201cimpermissible invasion of the jury\u2019s role as the exclusive arbiter of credibility.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 446, 92 A.3d at 764. Although I believe that it should be the unusual case in which such evidence would be admitted, ultimately, I find insufficient justification to support perpetuating the per se prohibition.\nI realize there are costs associated with moving beyond holding that everyday experience and common sense alone are sufficient to effectuate justice in cases requiring crucial judgments relative to eyewitness testimony and the behavior of those subject to interrogation. As the Commonwealth observes, the strategic use of expert testimony in litigation invites a counter-presentation and may make the prosecution\u2019s task of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt more difficult. Nevertheless, the alternative of blanket exclusion of relevant evidence based upon unanalyzed assumptions about juror capabilities, even as these assumptions are challenged by demonstrations of wrongful convictions and developing behavioral science, is no longer satisfactory from my viewpoint. Cf. Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 321, 129 S.Ct. 1558, 1570, 173 L.Ed.2d 443 (2009) (observing that \u201cthere is mounting empirical evidence that [police interrogations] can induce a frighteningly high percentage of people to confess to crimes they never committed\u201d (citing Steven A. Drizin & Richard A. Leo, The Problem of False Confessions in the Post-DNA World, 82 N.C.L.Rev. 891, 906-907 (2004))).\nIn my considered judgment, the better approach is to trust our trial judges to make fair and just decisions on admissibility of expert evidence, knowing full well that there will be inconsistencies which will need to be addressed by the appellate courts in the developing decisional law. In the choice among the many imperfect approaches available to us for effectuating justice within our existing adversary system, I have come to prefer options which do not depend upon under-analyzed and untested presumptions.\nJustice TODD joins this dissenting opinion.\n. Parenthetically, I find the majority\u2019s treatment of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Benally, 541 F.3d 990 (10th Cir.2008), to be materially incomplete. In this regard, I observe that the Benally court did not overturn prior decisions allowing the admission of expert testimony when a defendant\u2019s identifiable medical disorder raises a question as to the reliability of his confession. See id at 996. Accordingly, the Benally decision is more fact-dependent than the majority opinion conveys.",
