Rather than engaging in the type of speculation advocated by Appellee and surmising the intended disposition of these challenges by the trial judge, particularly where the disputes, if successful, could result in the setting aside of the nomination petition, I would remand for the court to provide the necessary consideration or clarification relative to its reasoning.",
