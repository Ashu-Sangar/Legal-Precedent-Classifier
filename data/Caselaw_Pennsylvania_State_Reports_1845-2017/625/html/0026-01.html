The CBAs specified, <em>inter alia, </em>that, when Contractor needed bricklayers and/or laborers, Contractor would obtain them from the Unions. The CBAs also referred to Contractor as “Employer,” and to any union members hired by Contractor in accordance with the CBAs as Contractor’s “employees.” The CBAs additionally required Contractor to furnish contributions for employee benefits, such as health and retirement benefits, for each hour of labor performed by union workers. Under the CBAs, the contribution amounts were to be reflected in monthly reports issued by Contractor, and the contributions were to be paid directly to Appellees, who are trustees of Bricklayers of Western Pennsylvania Combined Funds, Inc., and Laborers’ Combined Funds, Inc.

Consequently, the court held that the unionized workers did not come within the meaning of “subcontractor” as that term is defined by the 1963 Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

While recognizing that the intermediate court’s previous decisions indicated that the enactment is subject to strict construction as a statute in derogation of the common law, <em>see Bricklayers, </em><a href="/a3d/41/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="41 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7313300" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0016-01">41 A.3d at 24</a> (collecting cases), the majority stated that such decisions improperly relied on case law from this Court interpreting the 1963 Act’s predecessor statute, the Mechanics’ Lien Law of 1901. The court pointed out that, under the Statutory Construction Act, the rule of strict construction for statutes in derogation of the common law is inapplicable to statutes enacted finally after <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>September 1, 1937, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(a), and that, with certain limited exceptions not presently applicable, all other provisions of a statute should be liberally construed to “effect their objects and promote justice.” <em><a href="/a3d/41/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="41 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7313300" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0016-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 1928(c).

Instead, the court reasoned, the CBAs merely establish Contractor’s obligation to employ union members for specific types of work, and govern the terms of employment whenever Contractor would hire such persons to work on a project. <em>See Bricklayers, </em><a href="/a3d/41/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="41 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7313300" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0016-01">41 A.3d at 29</a>.</p>

In particular, the majority reasoned that, pursuant to the CBAs, the Unions furnished its members to Contractor to perform the necessary work on the improvement, and those individuals undertook such work with an expectation that Contractor would fulfill its obligations under the CBAs’ employee-benefit provisions. <em>See Bricklayers, </em><a href="/a3d/41/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="41 A.3d 16" data-case-ids="7313300" data-case-paths="/a3d/41/0016-01">41 A.3d at 30</a>.

In this respect, the Trustees highlight that amendments to the statute in 2006 expanded the definition of subcontractor, <em>see </em>Act of June 29, 2006, P.L. 210, No. 52 (broadening “subcontractor” to include persons who furnish labor “pursuant to a contract with a subcontractor in direct privity of a contract with a contractor”), again supporting the view that the present provision should not be understood as a mere reenactment of the 1901 law.

However, the Trustees note that it was only the dissent in <em>American Seating </em>that specifically referenced the strict-construction aspect of <em>Murray. </em>Moreover, the Trustees argue that this Court has recognized that the 1963 Act “effected a substantial change in the law,” Brief for Appellees, at 15 (citing <em>McCarthy v.

The most salient provisions of the act for present purposes are Section 201(5), which defines “subcontractor,” <em>see supra </em>note 4, and Section 303(a), which states that no lien is allowed in favor of any person other than a contractor or subcontractor, even though such person furnishes labor or materials to an improvement, <em>see supra </em>note 3.

On the other hand, Section 303(a) plainly contemplates a class of persons who furnish labor to an improvement, but who are not subcontractors and therefore are not entitled to file a mechanics’ lien. <em>See </em>49 P.S. § 1303(a). Since the union members who provided labor for the construction project on Developer’s land did so pursuant to an employment agreement of some sort — whether oral or written, or only implied in fact — it is not immediately clear whether they are meant to be included as subcontractors by Section 201(5), or excluded by Section 303(a).

First, according to Developer, the court relied on the collective bargaining agreements to find an implied contract, whereas none of the authority it cited supports an implied-contract theory based on an express contract. Second, Developer contends that any implied contract that the intermediate court found cannot have been valid in any event because it was wholly lacking in consideration. In this latter respect, Developer posits that all of the actions performed by the parties in relation to the construction project — including Contractor’s hiring of union members, the union workers’ provision of labor and bricklaying services, and Contractor’s responsibility to pay compensation as agreed upon — were undertaken pursuant to obligations already existing by virtue of the CBAs.

Although the CBAs were executed before the specific construction project on Developer’s land was contemplated, they stated the parties’ intentions and controlled their obligations relative to the project, as the Trustees forcefully argue. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellees, at 41-42. <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>Thus, no additional obligations needed to be assumed, and no additional promises needed to be made, for the CBAs to be fully applicable with respect to the construction project — nor were any actions or requirements alleged to have arisen in relation to the project separate and apart from the express provisions contained in the CBAs.

Some jurisdictions have recognized competing policies favoring the protection of property owners, as either provided for by statute, <em>see Duffield Constr., Inc. v. Baldwin, </em><a href="/nw2d/679/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="679 N.W.2d 477" data-case-ids="9266101" data-case-paths="/nw2d/679/0477-01">679 N.W.2d 477</a>, 481 (S.D.2004) (quoting a portion of South Dakota’s statute protecting landowners from liens arising from unauthorized improvements), or as stemming more generally from the circumstance that liens create an encumbrance on property that deprives the owner of his ability to convey clear title. <em>See VCS, Inc. v. Utah Cmty. Bank, </em><a href="/p3d/293/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="293 P.3d 290" data-case-ids="6976358" data-case-paths="/p3d/293/0290-01">293 P.3d 290</a>, 295 &amp; n. 12 (Utah 2012). Although such an encumbrance serves the primary purpose of the lien, it imposes a burden on the owner in circumstances where, through no fault of his own, the contractor is derelict in fulfilling its own obligations toward its subcontractors. For this reason, it has been argued, in the context of subcontractor liens, that the risk of double payment is unjust to the property owner — and, as noted, Developer raised a contention along these lines in its demurrers. Some commentators have answered that it is appropriate to incentivize property owners to take measures to protect the financial interests of those who increase the value of their property, and that this does not impose an undue hardship. <em>See, e.g., Mechanics’ Lien </em>— Right <em>of Subcontractor to Lien Regardless of Original Contract, </em><a href="/citations/?q=32%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20178" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="32 Harv. L. Rev. 178">32 Harv. L. Rev. 178</a>, 178 (1918). Pennsylvania's legislation mitigates any such harm, moreover, by subrogating the owner to the rights of, and security held by, the subcontractor, upon the owner’s payment of a claim. <em>See </em>49 P.S. § 1604(1). In all events, the General Assembly has evidently weighed these considerations and chosen to permit liens in favor of subcontractors, subject to statutory limitations. It is our duty, as a reviewing court, to enforce these rights, limitations, and any other policy choices made by the legislative body as they may be gleaned from the text of the statute. <em>See Program Admin.
