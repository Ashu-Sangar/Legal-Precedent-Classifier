The jury concluded, with respect to imposition of sentence, that the aggravating circumstances (committing murder to prevent testimony in a possible criminal proceeding regarding a felony and committing a killing in perpetration of a felony) outweighed the mitigating circumstance (character and record). Upon review, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[285,964,1152,1396]]]'>The facts gleaned from the evidence adduced at trial, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict-winner, are as follows. On June 23, 2009, Trooper Shawn Wolfe of the Pennsylvania State Police employed a confidential informant to make a controlled drug purchase of ten bags of heroin from the eventual murder victim, Ronald Lee Simmons, Jr., at his residence in York. Simmons was arrested immediately thereafter. Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Trial, 1/18/11, at 196-200. Trooper Wolfe and Trooper Christopher Keppel then asked Simmons if he was willing to cooperate with them by leading them to his heroin supplier in order to effectuate that person’s arrest. Simmons at first was hesitant because, as he stated to the troopers, he feared for his life should his supplier, who knew where he lived, learn of his cooperation with the police. N.T. Trial, 1/19/11, at 240-42. However, Simmons overcame his hesitation and agreed to contact his supplier — a Hispanic male he knew only as “True” — in order to arrange for the purchase of five bags of heroin. N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 207-09; N.T. Trial, 1/19/11, at 242. At the ensuing controlled drug purchase, “True” (who was later identified as Appellant herein, Hector Morales) and another individual were arrested. N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 209-11, 216-20. This incident appears to have also occurred on June 23, 2009. <em>See id. </em>at 220. Appellant was charged with two counts of delivery of heroin and one count of criminal conspiracy to deliver heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 221.</p>

Prior to that date, Appellant told a friend of his, Hector Perez, that he had been “set up” on a drug buy by an individual known as “Country,” and that he was going to kill “Country.” N.T. Trial, 1/19/11, at 431-32. Ronald Simmons was known by Appellant and others as “Country.” N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 196-97, 238. Also prior to the preliminary hearing, Trooper Keppel telephoned Simmons to remind him of his need to appear at that proceeding. N.T. Trial, 1/19/11, at 247-48. Simmons replied that he was aware of the date of the proceeding and was making babysitting arrangements so that he could attend. <em>Id. </em>at 248.</p>

That evening, the two drove to York in a vehicle Miles had borrowed from Ricky Newson; they also picked up Newson along the way. In York, the three individuals spent a brief period of time at Miles’s mother’s house. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 361-63. Then, at approximately 1:00 a.m. on July 16, 2009, Newson drove Appellant and Miles to an alleyway off Tremont Street in York and backed into a parking space. <em>Id. </em>at 363-65; N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 88. Miles was seated in the front passenger seat, and Appellant was seated in the back seat; Miles was dressed in a black “hoody” over a white tee shirt and a pair of jeans, while Appellant wore a short-sleeved white or light-colored shirt with a prominent design or designs on it and a pair of fatigue shorts. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 363-64; N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 88-89. Miles and Newson believed that they were in the area to buy marijuana. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 364; N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 89.</p>

Appellant then led Miles to the back door of a house where Appellant stated that he was going to kill the person who lived inside if he turned out to be the person who was going to testify against him at the preliminary <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>hearing. Appellant asked Miles if he would accompany him into the house to assist in the deed. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 367. Miles said that he would not and returned alone to the car. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68; N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 90. As Miles left, Appellant struck the door of the residence; he had also, at some point, donned a pair of black-knitted gloves and a ski mask. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 367. On his way back to the vehicle, Miles heard five or six gunshots. <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>

He observed a car with three occupants back into a parking space, and one occupant— a short man wearing a shirt having designs — get out of the vehicle and walk down the alley. He then saw this same person return to the vehicle, and he watched as a second occupant — a taller man wearing a black hoody — got out and accompanied the first man down the alley. Several minutes later, Portner saw the taller man in the black hoody return to the vehicle alone, and shortly thereafter, Portner heard gunshots. He then saw the short individual return to the car at a rapid pace. The vehicle took off after this man got into the car. <em>Id. </em>at 326-28.</p>

Simmons then screamed, and his wife saw that he was in a struggle with an intruder. <em>Id. </em>at 256-58. The intruder was a man of short stature wearing a shirt with a design on it, and Simmons yelled that the intruder had a gun. <em>Id. </em>at 257-60. The wife heard several gunshots, after which the intruder ran off. <em>Id. </em>at 258. Simmons stated to his wife <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>that he had been shot and then fell down the steps. <em>Id. </em>His wife called the police and waited for their arrival, noticing, as she waited, that the back door to the house had been forced open. <em>Id. </em>at 260-61.

Appellant was also observed by his companions holding a handgun, from which he wiped fingerprints. <em>Id.; </em>N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 91-93. At the convenience store, while Miles was paying for gas, Appellant told Newson that he had killed the man who would have been testifying against him. N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 93. Appellant also used one of the squeegees available for use at the gas pumps to clean blood off his shoes. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94.</p>

Trial, 1/14/11, at 377. Appellant and Supreme then walked away. At that point, Miles told Newson that Appellant was going to kill him, and Miles suggested that they both drive away and flee from Appellant. They did so, returning to Lebanon. <em>Id. </em>at 377-78; N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 102-04. In Lebanon, Miles retrieved the gun used in the previous evening’s shooting from its location in the shoebox in Miles’s girlfriend’s house.

That investigation revealed that the victim was a confidential informant working with the Pennsylvania State Police, and was scheduled to testify against Appellant later on the morning of the shooting. The investigators also spoke with Richard Portner, the individual who had witnessed the activity <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>around Newson’s car on the evening of the killing. Based on the descriptions of the killer given by Portner and Simmons’s wife, and considering the individuals that Simmons had disclosed to the police as being involved in the drug trade, the investigators compiled a list of possible suspects. From photographic arrays of these suspects, Portner identified Appellant as the man he had seen on the evening of the shooting. Portner noted Appellant’s short stature, and added that when Appellant ran back to the car, his hands were in his pockets. N.T. Trial, 1/18/11, at 258-65.</p>

Additionally, a palm print taken from Simmons’s back door was a match with Appellant’s palm. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86. Finally, in July or August 2009, Appellant told Hector Perez that he was aware that Miles had turned him in to the police and that he would seek revenge on Miles. N.T. Trial, 1/14/11, at 431-32.

At Appellant’s arraignment, the Commonwealth filed its notice of intention to seek the death penalty based on four aggravating circumstances, namely those set forth at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5), (6), (7), and (15). Thereafter, Appellant filed a motion to compel discovery concerning the identity and location of the eyewitness who had seen Appellant outside of Simmons’s house on the night of the murder (Mr. Portner). The Commonwealth opposed Appellant’s request because of fears for the witness’s safety, in light of the asserted aggravating circumstance that Appellant had killed a witness against him in a separate drug prosecution in order to prevent the witness’s testimony. The Commonwealth delivered to Appellant a copy of the police interview with this witness, asserted that there was no agreement with the witness in exchange for testimony, and agreed to deliver to <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>Appellant any criminal record that the witness might have had (it was later determined that there was none). Following a hearing held July 20, 2010, the trial court agreed with the Commonwealth’s concerns for the witness’s safety and, deeming the Commonwealth’s efforts and Appellant’s eventual right to cross-examine sufficient to safeguard Appellant’s rights, denied the motion to compel discovery of the identification of the witness.</p>

Before the jury was sworn in, one of the selected venire persons — Juror No. 131 — told the trial judge’s tipstaff that she had come to the conclusion that she might possibly not be able to sentence a person to death. The tipstaff told the judge this information, and the judge convened a hearing whereat Juror No. 131 was questioned about her willingness or ability to fulfill her obligations as a juror. At the conclusion of the hearing, and over Appellant’s objection, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion to replace Juror No. 131 with the first of the previously selected alternate jurors.</p>

In so finding, the jury accepted the testimony favorable to the Commonwealth, as outlined above, and rejected the testimony offered by Appellant — including Appellant’s own testimony — that suggested that the person who had shot Simmons was actually Melvin Miles, and that it was Appellant who feared Miles rather than the other way around.</p>

It is also not illogical that Appellant would want to conceal the murder weapon in a place the police might not think of searching, and the testimony at trial showed that there appeared to be very free access to abodes connected to Appellant’s circle of drug dealers. Further, it is not significant who had reloaded the gun after the incident in that such evidence does not cancel the substantial evidence that Appellant had used the gun in the killing; in any event, <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>there was also no evidence that it was Miles and not Appellant who had reloaded the pistol.</p>

Here, the Commonwealth proved that Simmons was unlawfully killed, that Appellant was responsible for the killing, and that Appellant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill. Simmons died of a gunshot wound to the chest inflicted by an intruder who, having no license or permission to enter, had broken through a locked entranceway into Simmons’s private residence. Appellant matched the description of the intruder given by Simmons’s wife in terms of stature and attire. Appellant’s stature and attire also matched the description of the person seen by Portner hastily leaving the alleyway from Simmons’s house just after gunshots were heard. Appellant was seen after the incident cleaning blood off of his shoes at a gas station; and Appellant, on several occasions after the incident, admitted — even bragged — that he had killed the man who was to testify against him at a preliminary hearing on drug charges. The man who was to testify against him was Simmons, who bore the nickname that Appellant knew him by: Country. Prior to the incident, Appellant had stated that he was going to kill Country in order to prevent his testimony. There is testimony linking Appellant to the murder weapon, and additional evidence that Appellant had burned the clothes he had worn on the night of the incident in a dumpster behind a gas station.

The trial court concluded that Appellant’s reasons focused on the issue of the witness’s credibility, which issue Appellant could fully explore on cross-examination. The court further concluded that the witness’s testimony would not exonerate Appellant; therefore, the determination to grant or deny Appellant’s motion was discretionary with the court. <em>See id. </em>at 8-9.

Although Appellant was incarcerated while awaiting his murder trial, his connections in the geographic area of York with others involved in the illegal drug trade, persons who were in and out of prison, as demonstrated by the witnesses giving trial testimony here, established that Appellant was not an individual who lacked the potential ability to assert his will beyond the prison walls. The critical importance of the safety of eyewitnesses, and, additionally, the public need for them to be willing to come forward with information, cannot be swept aside under the circumstances of this case based only on Appellant’s bald assertion that there was never a danger because he was in prison while awaiting trial.

N.T. Pre-Trial Hearing, 1/14/11, at 195-96. At the same time, she stated that she would “try [her] best” to follow the court’s instructions, no matter what they were, or “give it [her] best shot.” <em>Id. </em>at 198-99. After counsel for both parties questioned Juror No. 131, the trial judge had the following critical exchange with the juror:</p>

Such determinations [are] entitled to deference even on direct review; the respect paid such findings in a <em>habeas </em>proceeding certainly should be no less.” And the finding may be upheld even in the absence of clear statements from the juror that he or she is impaired because “many veniremen simply cannot be asked enough questions to reach the point where their bias has been made ‘unmistakably clear’; <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>these veniremen may not know how they will react when faced with imposing the death sentence, or may be unable to articulate, or may wish to hide their true feelings.” Thus, when there is ambiguity in the prospective juror’s statements, “the trial court, aided as it undoubtedly [is] by its assessment of [the venireman’s] demeanor, [is] entitled to resolve it in favor of the State.”</blockquote>

As mentioned above, the trial court found two grounds for the admission of Mr. Simmons’s statements: as an exception to the rule against the admission of hearsay, and for purposes of proving motive. The second ground is based on the premise that the statements are <em>not </em>hearsay, in that the statements were offered not for the truth of the matters asserted, but for purposes of establishing motive only. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Paddy, </em><a href="/pa/569/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="569 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="312796" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0047-01">569 Pa. 47</a>, <a href="/pa/569/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="800 A.2d 294" data-case-ids="312748,312794,312796,9409766,9409783,9409834" data-case-paths="/pa/569/0046-01,/pa/569/0045-01,/pa/569/0047-01,/a2d/800/0294-01,/a2d/800/0294-02,/a2d/800/0294-03">800 A.2d 294</a>, 309-10 and 309-10 n. 9 (2002). The record does not show that the jury was instructed as to how the statements were to be considered, nor do we discern any request by any party for limiting instructions. Because Appellant has waived his argument here, any potential tension as to this evidence is of no moment.</p>
