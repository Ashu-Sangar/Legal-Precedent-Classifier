Briefly, on April 28, 2000, Richard Baumhammers (Appellant) went on a two-hour crime spree in Allegheny and Beaver Counties in which he shot six individuals with a firearm. Appellant first shot to death a Jewish neighbor and set her house on fire. He then drove to public places such as a Chinese restaurant and an Indian grocery store, where he shot five additional persons, all racial or ethnic minorities. Four of these additional victims died of their wounds; the fifth was paralyzed from the neck down. During the crime spree, Appellant also damaged two synagogues by spray-painting swastikas and the word “Jew” onto one of them, and shooting bullets into both. <em>See id. </em>at 13-21, <a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">960 A.2d at 67-71</a>. Appellant was charged with five counts of first-degree murder and related offenses, and the matter proceeded to trial from April 27th to May 9th of 2001. The jury found Appellant guilty on all charges. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigation and set the penalty at death for all five murders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant’s post-<a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>sentence motions were denied, and this Court affirmed the judgments of sentence. <em>See <a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">at 66</a>, <a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">960 A.2d at 99</a>.</p>

The PCRA court, per Judge Manning (who was also the trial judge), scheduled a hearing on four of the claims and noted its intent to dismiss the remaining fifteen claims without a hearing. A three-day hearing was held in September 2011, at which numerous witnesses testified. The court ultimately denied relief. After Appellant appealed and filed a concise statement of errors complained of on appeal, <em>see </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), the PCRA court issued an opinion addressing each of the alleged errors and concluding that it had properly denied relief. <em>See Commonwealth v.

He presented the testimony of several treating psychiatrists as fact witnesses, and of forensic psychiatrist Dr. James Merikangas as an expert witness. Dr. Merikangas testified that, on the day of the crime, Appellant may have been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and, although he understood the nature and quality of his actions, he did not know that what he was doing was legally or morally wrong. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 315 (setting forth Pennsylvania’s insanity defense in terms of the defendant’s failure to understand the nature and quality of his conduct or that it “was wrong”). Dr. Merikangas’s testimony supported the defense theory that Appellant was suffering from hallucinations in which he believed the FBI was harassing him and causing him physical pain through the use of lasers and poisons, and promised to stop doing so if he would kill ethnic and racial minorities. Dr. Merikangas elaborated that Appellant thought the FBI wanted to discredit his nas<a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>cent “Free Market” political party and, to that end, directed him to conduct a “right-wing hit.” The expert witness opined that Appellant understood that it is ordinarily wrong to kill others, but he believed his conduct was legally and morally justified because he was obeying a government order.</p>

Based on a records review involving 230 sources and many hours of interviews with Appellant, Dr. Weiner produced a lengthy report. He testified consistent with the report, disputing Dr. Merikangas’s conclusions and opining that Appellant was not schizophrenic, he understood the nature and quality of his actions, and he knew his actions were wrong. Dr. Weiner disbelieved Appellant’s claims of hallucinations, attributing such assertions to after-the-fact malingering. He concluded instead that Appellant acted based on hatred toward non-European immigrants and other minorities. The witness indicated that, although Appellant met the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder, possible antisocial personality disorder, and delusional disorder of a persecutorial type, delusions are different from hallucinations,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and moreover, the delusional facet of Appellant’s personality had largely receded during the months leading up to the killings. Dr. Weiner testified that his conclusion regarding Appellant’s hatred-based motive for the killings was supported by Appellant’s desecration of the two synagogues, as well as trial testimony and information he gathered for his report suggesting that Appellant had: angrily threatened two Pakistani restaurant patrons in a Pittsburgh suburb in August 1999, telling them to leave America or they would die; stricken a woman with his fist while traveling in France two months later because he thought she was Jewish; visited white-supremacist websites prior to the day in question; and made anti-minority and white-supremacist state<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ments to fellow inmates shortly after his arrest and while awaiting trial.</p>
    <p id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[182,431,1148,573]]]'>Six years after the trial, when a massacre occurred at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech), Dr. Weiner was working as a paid consultant for ABC News. In that capacity, he was interviewed about the Virginia Tech shootings and, in passing, made reference to Appellant’s case. Dr. Weiner also made comments to other media organizations as well as an educational institution between 2007 and 2011, in which he mentioned Appellant’s case. In at least three of these comments or interviews, Dr. Weiner stated that Appellant suffered from schizophrenia, albeit his actions were motivated by ethnic hatred separate and apart from his schizophrenia.</p>
    <p id="b415-5" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[182,1029,1153,1104]]]'>This suggestion was, of course, inconsistent with Dr. Weiner’s trial testimony in which he rejected a schizophrenia diagnosis for Appellant. Appellant viewed the inconsistency as material because, in Appellant’s view, a schizophrenia diagnosis would have supported his insanity defense better than the personality disorders Dr. Weiner described at trial. Thus, at the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented the testimony of forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick concerning the effect if, hypothetically, Dr. Weiner had testified at trial that Appellant suffered from schizophrenia. Dr. Resnick testified that: (a) if Dr. Weiner had diagnosed Appellant with schizophrenia, the diagnoses of narcissistic personality disorder and possible antisocial personality disorders would have been difficult to support; and (b) a schizophrenia diagnosis would have explained, in terms of a disease of the brain — as opposed to mere personality traits — certain items that may have cast Appellant in a negative light before the jury, such as Appellant’s alleged: grandiosity; inappropriate affect (e.g., smiling) at the time of his arrest; lack of empathy; lack of remorse; aloofness; argumentativeness; and inability to maintain steady employment. <em>See </em>N.T., Sept. 12, 2011, at 15-24.</p>

Dr. Weiner preliminarily agreed that schizophrenia is the “most extreme <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>manifestation of paranoia,” N.T., Sept. 13, 2011, at 190, and acknowledged that, in the media, he had indicated that Appellant suffered from schizophrenia at the time of the shootings. He observed, however, that his role as a media consultant is “very different from” his role as a forensic psychiatrist, <em>id. </em>at 191, because media outlets are not primarily concerned with specific diagnoses or legal issues, but with broader public implications and the public’s sense of vulnerability in the wake of a mass shooting.</p>

Dr. Weiner testified, as well, that, to the extent any of his misstatements regarding Appellant suffering from schizophrenia remained available on the ABC News website, he had taken steps to rectify them. Finally, Dr. Weiner stated that he stood by his trial testimony and the specific diagnoses he articulated at that time, which excluded schizophrenia. <em>See id. </em>at 232-34. The PCRA court ultimately credited Dr. Weiner’s explanation that he had simply made a mistake when speaking with the media and other organizations many years after the trial, and pointed out that Appellant offered no evidence to contradict such explanation. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Opinion, <em>slip op. </em>at 37-38.</p>

Appellant proffers that this is especially so because Dr. Weiner was able to remember other details of Appellant’s case, most notably the names of the victims, during these same media interviews. On this basis, Appellant argues that Dr. Weiner’s trial testimony was so unreliable as to render the guilt and penalty verdicts reached by the jury constitutionally infirm under the Due Process Clause and Eighth Amendment. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 19. Finally, Appellant reasons that Dr. Weiner’s post-trial statements in the media constitute newly discovered evidence entitling him to a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at 19-20. <em>See generally </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(vi) (allowing for relief where a PCRA petitioner demonstrates that the conviction or sentence resulted from the unavailability of exculpatory evidence that has become available and would have changed the outcome if it had been introduced).</p>

Despite this lack of clarity in the printed record, however, there will be situations where the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective juror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law. [Tjhis is why deference must be paid to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.</blockquote>

This Court added that, "in rejecting Appellant's post-sentence argument on this issue, the trial court specifically determined that the record of the jury selection process established that it was possible to select a jury untainted by prejudicial pre-trial publicity” and that "[sjuch a jury was, in fact, selected in this matter.” <em>Baumhammers, </em>599 Pa. at 26-27, <a href="/pa/599/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="327" data-cite="960 A.2d 59" data-case-ids="3441393,8191523" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0001-01,/a2d/960/0059-01">960 A.2d at 75</a> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
