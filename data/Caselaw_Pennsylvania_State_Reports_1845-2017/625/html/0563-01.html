Appellees are former CCBC students who, according to their allegations, enrolled in and completed substantial work in CCBC’s police training program. However, their academic progress was cut short when, in 2002, CCBC’s alleged malfeasance caused state officials to decertify the program, thereby rendering their educational and financial investments largely worthless. Appellees filed actions in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County, asserting claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty, and, pertinent to this appeal, a claim under the UTPCPL’s provisions providing a private cause of action for “persons” injured by other “persons” employment of unfair trade practices. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 201-9.2.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After the close of pleadings and discovery, CCBC sought summary judgment with respect to the UTPCPL claims on two grounds. First, noting that the UTPCPL provides a cause of action against “persons,” CCBC observed that the statute defines a “person” as “natural persons, corporations, trusts, partnerships, incorporated or unincorporated associations, and any other legal entities,” <em>see </em>73 P.S. § 201-2(2), and argued this definition excluded community colleges. Second, CCBC maintained that the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8541 <em>et seq., </em>provided it immunity from all statutory liability, including UTPCPL liability, not <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>contained within the Tort Claims Act’s enumerated exceptions.

Accordingly, attempting to resolve the ambiguity, the court employed canons of statutory construction in order to discern legislative intent. Specifically, the Court reviewed the UTPCPL’s public and private enforcement action provisions and, noting that only a “person” may seek relief as a plaintiff from others’ employment of unfair trade practices, the court held that interpreting “person” to exclude political subdivision agencies would be absurd, contrary to the UTPCPL’s purpose, and contrary to the public interest:</p>

First, noting that, in other statutory contexts, the legislature has specifically included such agencies, she reasoned that it could and would have done so in the UTPCPL if it sought to subject them to liability. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. §§ 780-101 <em>et seq.; </em>the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. § 951 <em>et seq.; </em>and the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. § 691.1 <em>et seq.) </em>Next, Judge Leavitt noted that, pursuant to the interpretive canon of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>“general expressions used in a statute are restricted to things ... similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expressions.” <em>Id. </em>at 603 (quoting <em>Petty v.

Finally, Judge Leavitt offered her view that the General Assembly could, and did, reasonably decide to exclude government agencies because, unlike consumers, governmental entities are unlikely to be victimized by deceptive practices, and, unlike ordinary commercial firms, they were constrained by various legal restrictions that ensured fairness and transparency, such as the federal civil rights lawsuits, the Right-to-Know Law, and the Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions, thereby rendering UTPCPL liability less important as a deterrent. <em>Id. </em>at 608-09.</p>

CCBC contends that, under the plain language of the UTPCPL, political subdivision agencies are not included in the definition of “person” because they are not specifically enumerated in the definition. Consistent with Judge Leavitt’s dissent below, CCBC argues that the legislature has, in many other contexts, explicitly named political subdivision agencies, and that its failure to do so here makes clear that it intended to exclude them from the UTPCPL’s definition of “person.” CCBC further asserts the Commonwealth Court erred in failing to apply the common law interpretive presumption that a statute using the term “person” does not ordinarily include political subdivision agencies. Alternatively, CCBC argues that, should this Court decline to hold that, under the plain language of the UTPCPL, a political subdivision agency is not a “person,” the language of the UTPCPL should at least be deemed ambiguous as to this issue.</p>

First, in the context of public enforcement actions, the UTPCPL provides that the Attorney General or a District Attorney may obtain, “on behalf of the Commonwealth,” civil penalties in varying amounts, up to $5,000 per violation. 73 P.S. § 201-8. Likewise, in the context of private actions, plaintiffs may recover treble damages in an amount up to three times the amount of their actual damages, as well as costs and attorney fees. <em>See </em>73 P.S. § 201-9.2. These damages, although designed, in part, for other more remedial purposes, do contain a deterrent, punitive element. <em>See Schwartz v. Rockey, </em><a href="/pa/593/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="593 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="3248666" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0536-01">593 Pa. 536</a>, <a href="/pa/593/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="932 A.2d 885" data-case-ids="3248666,8348934" data-case-paths="/pa/593/0536-01,/a2d/932/0885-01">932 A.2d 885</a>, 898 (2007) (noting the treble damage provisions are “a hybrid,” with both punitive and remedial aspects) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Although the legislature certainly has the authority to impose punitive sanctions and damages upon its political subdivisions, the proceeds of which would go to its own treasury, we are of the opinion that it would not take such an uncharted course without making a clearer statement, particularly given our longstanding precedent that governmental agencies are ordinarily immune from common-law punitive damages. <em>See Feingold v.

We decline CCBC’s invitation to apply the canon of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>or "the express mention of one thing excludes all others.” <em>St. Elizabeth’s Child Care Ctr. v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare, </em><a href="/pa/600/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="600 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="4194522" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0131-01">600 Pa. 131</a>, <a href="/pa/600/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="963 A.2d 1274" data-case-ids="4194522,8176476" data-case-paths="/pa/600/0131-01,/a2d/963/1274-01">963 A.2d 1274</a>, 1275 n. 1 (2009). First, we note that CCBC's argument does not actually invoke the canon it purports to invoke. Pursuant to <em>expressio unius, </em>a particular statute which specifies particular items within its scope implies the exclusion of other particular items. <em>See, e.g., Tate v. Ogg, </em><a href="/va/170/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="170 Va. 95" data-case-ids="1953502" data-case-paths="/va/170/0095-01">170 Va. 95</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20S.E.%20496" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="195 S.E. 496">195 S.E. 496</a>, 499 (1938) (opining that a statute concerning "any horse, mule, cattle, hog, sheep, or goat” did not include turkeys). It has no application where, as here, the legislature did not merely identify a list of covered subjects, but rather employed "catchall” language designed to include similarly situated entities within the statutory scope.</p>

In order to be liable under the UTPCPL, a defendant must, in addition to being a “person” as defined in that statute, also be engaged in “the conduct of any trade or commerce.” 73 P.S. § 201-3. As the Majority notes, “the legislature enacted the UTPCPL to account for the fundamental inequality between buyer and <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>seller, and to protect consumers from exploitative merchants.” Majority Op. at 576, 93 A.3d at 814. In my view, CCBC is not a merchant, and is not engaged in trade or commerce as envisioned in the UTPCPL. I agree with Judge (now President Judge) Pellegrini’s expression on this point in his dissent below:</p>
    <blockquote id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[197,634,1108,620]]]'>“Trade or commerce” is mercantile activity in which the person engaged in that business is doing so for private profit which could motivate unfair or deceptive practices for private gain or, more accurately, private greed. All of the provisions of the [UTPCPL] are aimed at private businesses. The Community College is not engaged in the conduct of ‘trade or commerce’ but is carrying out a public responsibility with tax dollars to provide students with an affordable education to citizens of the Commonwealth. In other words, when a governmental entity is carrying out a public duty, it is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or commerce, but in the conduct of government.</blockquote>
