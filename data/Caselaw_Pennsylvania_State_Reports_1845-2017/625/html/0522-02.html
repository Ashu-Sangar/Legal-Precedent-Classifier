We conclude that although the [TYHA] permits admission of hearsay testimony to convey a child victim’s out-of-court statements where the child is “unavailable” pursuant to subsection 5985.1(a)(2)(ii), a determination of unavailability under that section is not a substitute for the requisite evaluation and finding of competence. In short, the [TYHA] ... presupposes that the witness has been determined to be competent within the meaning of Pa.R.E. 601 at the time he or she made the statements in question. Under no circumstances does a finding of unavailability under the [TYHA] transmute testimony not competent under Pa.R.E. 601 into admissible evidence capable of sustaining a criminal conviction.</blockquote>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>in holding the victim’s hearsay statements were admissible under the TYHA, the trial court was required to find, and did find, that (1) the victim was unavailable as a witness and (2) her statements contained sufficient indicia of reliability. Initially, regarding the first factor, we note that the Superior Court, in holding the trial court erred in admitting the victim’s statements into evidence pursuant to the TYHA, characterized the determination of the victim’s competency as a “threshold issue.” <em>Walter, </em>1829 MDA 2010 at 9. As a result, the Superior Court did not address the trial court’s ruling regarding the unavailability of the victim due to the fact that she would suffer emotional distress. Nevertheless, we agree with the Commonwealth that the record supports the trial court’s determination that, under the TYHA, the victim was unavailable to testify.</p>

First, the trial court must find that the evidence is relevant and that the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient indicia of reliability. Second, the child must either (1) testify at the proceeding, or (2) be deemed unavailable as a witness. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5985.1(a)(2)(i), (ii). In order for the child to be deemed unavailable to testify as a witness, “the court must determine, based on evidence presented to it, that testimony by the child as a witness will result in the child suffering serious emotional distress that would substantially impair the child’s ability to reasonably communicate.” <em>Id. </em>§ 5985.1(a.l). In making this determination, the court may (1) observe and question the child, either inside or outside of the courtroom; and (2) hear testimony of the child’s parent or custodian or any other person who has dealt with the child in a medical or therapeutic setting. <em>Id. </em>§ 5985.1(a.l)(l), (2). The TYHA does <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>not require that a trial court’s determination of unavailability be supported by expert testimony.</p>

Foster Mother stated that the victim had nightmares for several nights after court appearances; that the victim became anxious and hid her face when she learned she had to attend court proceedings; and that simply being outside of the courthouse had a negative effect on the victim. The trial court explained that, in reaching its conclusion, “the Court found the testimony presented of the difficulties experienced by the child after testifying to be credible. These difficulties included but were not limited to severe negative reactions, nightmares, crying, and freezing up upon discussing the instances of abuse.” Trial Court Opinion, 1/7/11, at 5.

Dyer. Although Dyer attempted to verify the presence of sexual abuse and explain away the absence of any abnormality in A.W.’s vaginal area, her testimony is profoundly exculpatory, undermining the Commonwealth’s case and any contention that A.W.’s statements offer reliable evidence of sexual abuse. Indeed, Dyer’s examination verified only “[n]on-specific vulvar redness and irritation likely associated with enuresis [i.e., bed-wetting] and the use of pull-ups.” Although Dyer conducted the examination four days after the report of the abuse, she reported that A.W.’s condition was “[o]therwise normal!,”] and that “[h]er hymenal edges were sharp and without clefts!,]” that her “[h]ymenal vasculature was uni<a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>form and normal in appearance!,]” and that “[h]er fourchette and perineum were normal.” Medical History and Physical Examination Report dated 10/21/08, at 2-3. In view of these findings, A.W.’s most inflammatory statements, indicating that her father inserted “Chucky;” i.e., his penis, into her vagina and moved it back and forth, defies credibility; indeed, the notion that an adult male could vaginally rape a three-year-old in that manner leaving no signs of penetration whatsoever appears to us a physical impossibility. Accordingly, the record does not support the trial court’s conclusion that A.W.’s statements possessed the requisite indicia of reliability.</blockquote>

The extent to which witnesses to those statements would find them to be circumstantially reliable is entirely a function of what the witnesses <em>presumed </em>the circumstances to be. Indeed, prior to being informed of pending sexual abuse charges, witness Diane Bulger discounted the statements, as the circumstances under which A.W. made them appeared consistent with diaper rash. In truth, the statements indicate only that A.W. suffered discomfort. They shed no light whatsoever on the cause of that discomfort and therefore cannot be deemed reliable evidence of anything more than that.</blockquote>

To the extent the alleged victim has a generalized difficulty distinguishing fiction from reality, or believes it is normal and acceptable to lie, the reliability of his or her prior hearsay statements is called into question, as such statements may be the product of imagination or creativity. The present case is illustrative: at the <em>in camera </em>hearing, not only did A.W. give a number of nonsensical answers and maintain that it was a “good thing” to lie, but her testimony included fictitious elements, such as an affirmation that Appellee had brought a horse and a gorilla into her room to sexually <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>abuse her. <em>See </em>N.T., Jan. 30, 2009, at 34, <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. 19a.

In this regard, it is worth observing that a number of other states expressly require corroboration when the declarant is unavailable to testify, <em>see, e.g., </em>Ala.Code § 15-25-34; Miss.R.E. 803(25); 12 Okla.

However, a declarant’s motive to fabricate, or lack thereof, often cannot be discerned from a statement’s content or its immediately-surrounding circumstances, and must instead be gleaned through external factors, as the Commonwealth’s present argument demonstrates. <em>See </em>Brief for Commonwealth at 21 (arguing that A.W. had no motive to fabricate her accusations because her parents were married and not involved in a custody dispute).

This is not a trivial concern in light of the need for the trial judge’s screening function to be fulfilled as accurately as possible. Without derogating the role of the jury as the ultimate fact-finder, it should be recognized that child sex-abuse charges are inherently inflammatory and tend to invoke strong feelings toward the accused. If the defendant is guilty, the justice system obviously benefits from the introduction of incriminating evidence in view of the high social cost of allowing him to go free, often to re-offend. However, the opposite error, conviction of an innocent defendant, also involves a significant social cost, as the ensuing criminal punishment and society’s condemnation can be severe. This highlights the need for extreme caution to avoid, on the one hand, withholding a victimized child’s statements from the jury, and on the other, allowing a manipulated child’s accusations to be placed before the jury.
