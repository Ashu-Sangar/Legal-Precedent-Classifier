Pursuant to § 1723-A(d)(2), the above provision is applicable “regardless of whether the charter was approved prior to or is approved subsequent to the effective date of this subsection.” There is no ambiguity in this language either— charters approved prior to and charters approved subsequent to the effective date of § 1723-A(d) are treated equivalently for purposes of this subsection. Because there is no ambiguity in the language of § 1723-A(d), we look no further than the plain meaning of the statutory text to conclude that the number of students enrolled in a charter school may be subject to a cap, prior to and subsequent to the effective date of § 1723-A, if the cap is included in the written charter agreed to by the charter school.</p>

The court and the Secretary have imposed a requirement that has no basis in the statute; in fact, the plain language of § 1723-A is directly contrary to their construction. When, as in this case, a charter has been approved prior to enactment of § 1723-A(d), that subsection applies, exactly as it applies to charters approved subsequent to the enactment. Regardless of the timing of the charter approval relative to the date of § 1723-A(d)’s enactment, the crucial requirement remains the same: the charter school must have agreed to the enrollment cap “as part of its written charter.” 24 P.S. § 17-1723-A(d)(1).</p>

The Charter School’s contention that the enrollment cap was somehow unilaterally imposed without its consent, acquiescence, or agreement is belied by the straightforward text of the 2005 Charter, a “legally binding agreement” signed by the <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>Charter School. The Charter School asserts that it showed its lack of acquiescence to the cap by consistently enrolling more students than permitted by the cap, <em>see </em>Charter School’s Brief at 25-28, but this fundamentally flawed assertion demonstrates no such thing. The Charter School’s enrollment of more students than permitted by the cap shows only that the Charter School intentionally failed to abide by the legally binding agreement that it had signed. The Charter School’s further contention that a charter is not an agreement, <em>see </em>Charter School’s Brief at 23, is similarly belied by the text of the 2005 Charter. <em>See </em>2005 Charter at 3 ¶ 6 (“This Charter and all Exhibits hereto constitute a legally binding agreement____”). Finally, the Charter School’s assertion that the enrollment cap was invalid and unenforceable because it was not “in the text of the written charter,” but rather was “merely incorporated by reference” to the SRC Resolution is frivolous. <em>See </em>Charter School’s Brief at 19. By the express terms of the 2005 Charter, the SRC Resolution was “attached” to and “made a part” of the 2005 Charter, and the Charter School agreed to “comply with the Resolution.” 2005 Charter at2.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>
