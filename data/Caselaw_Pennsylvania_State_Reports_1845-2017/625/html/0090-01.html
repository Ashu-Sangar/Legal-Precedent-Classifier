Unlike other rules of evidence, Rule 403 requires a trial court to weigh probative value and prejudice — the costs and benefits of relevant evidence — viewing it as part of a whole and not in isolation. Inherent in the rule is the assumption that the court has an adequate record, one that will mirror or provide great insight into what will develop at trial. In the majority of cases, and particularly manifested in this one, the trial court has no way of knowing beforehand exactly what evidence will be presented at trial. Depending on the case and the inevitable vagaries of litigation, the pre-trial record may be entirely different than the record that eventuates as matters unfold. Even if the evidence the parties intend to present is set, a trial rarely follows the anticipated script. The actual value of evidence may differ substantially from pre-trial expectations, depending on all manner of factors, such as the availability, appearance, memory, or demeanor of a witness, admissions on cross-examination, the defense theory, or the defendant’s decision whether or not to testify. Even a relatively developed pre-trial record will be of limited utility in predicting the probative value or prejudice a particular piece of evidence will ultimately have.</p>

There may also be cases where the pre-trial record is sufficiently developed and the evidence to be presented is sufficiently certain to allow the trial court to intelligently and accurately balance the interests involved. However, these scenarios are exceptions rather than the rule and, as this case demonstrates, are exceedingly unlikely to apply to assessments of the cumulative nature of potential testimony; thus, we caution against pre-trial Rule 403/404(b) balancing assessments unless the trial court finds it manifestly appropriate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The court unfortunately did not provide analysis of why it chose the four witnesses it deemed to be the cumulative ones.

Ms. Alston, Ms. Lovell, and Ms. Chavez— <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>the witnesses the trial court did not rule to be cumulative— were admitted crack-cocaine users and suspected prostitutes. Commonwealth’s Offer of Proof, 4/27/11, at 2-4, 6. Ms. Chavez and Ms. Lovell, along with excluded witnesses Ms. Muhammad — who was also a suspected prostitute — Ms. Phillips, and Ms. Downing, were believed to be residents of Texas; Ms. Lovell lived in Virginia, and Ms. Hicks’s last known address was in Illinois. <em>Id., </em>at 1-6.

In affirming the trial court, the Superior Court stated, “The sole limitation the court placed on the Commonwealth was the number of witnesses it could call[.]” <em>Hicks, </em>at 11. The record belies this assertion. Instead of limiting the number of proffered witnesses the Commonwealth could call at trial, the trial court categorically precluded specific witnesses, labeling them “repetitive” before any evidence had been presented. This was error, which should have been reversed on appeal. It is a fundamental precept of our criminal jurisprudence that the Commonwealth is entitled to prove its case by relevant evidence of its choosing. <em>See Old Chief, </em>at 186-87, <a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">117 S.Ct. 644</a> (discussing this “familiar, standard rule”). Thus, assuming the trial court’s pre-trial admissibility determination was correct, it would have the authority to limit how many cumulative witnesses may testify, but it cannot dictate which of those <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>witnesses the Commonwealth may call to prove its case. That decision lies exclusively with the prosecutor.</p>

Finding the evidence generally admissible under Rule 404(b)(2), the court should have deferred application of the balancing test until trial. The court erred in ruling pre-trial on the perceived cumulative nature of the evidence under Rule 403; as part of the prejudice portion of the balancing test, such evaluations should generally be deferred until there is a full record as developed at trial. Finally, the court erred in ruling which witnesses would be the cumulative ones, restricting which ones the prosecution might call.</p>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.6",151,[166,1196,1147,472]]]'>We therefore remand for trial. Given the muddle created by the trial court’s inconsistent position in its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court may consider the proposed arguments of counsel regarding whether the formerly excluded witnesses’ testimony is admissible under Rule 404(b)(2) and rule accordingly. The application of the balancing test of Rule 403 or 404(b)(2) may be applied to all witnesses, formerly excluded or not, but such ruling should be deferred until the record makes such a determination appropriate.</p>
