Durrant confessed to shooting the victim, but claimed he did so at the behest of Appellant, who had been incarcerated in the Lycoming County Prison since March 1, 2007. At Appellant’s trial, Durrant testified that he first met Appellant while the two were previously incarcerated. In or <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>around July 2006, after both men had been released from prison, they ran into each other in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and Appellant introduced Durrant to Javier “Little Man” Cruz-Echevarria (“Cruz”). Subsequently, Appellant, Cruz, and the victim went to Durrant’s house on two separate occasions to discuss drug dealing, but Durrant told the men he wasn’t interested in working with the victim because he didn’t know him. Several weeks later, Durrant asked Cruz why he hadn’t seen Appellant and Cruz “hanging around” with the victim for a while, and Cruz told Durrant that the victim was working as a police informant. At some point thereafter, Appellant and Cruz told Durrant they wanted the victim killed because he was a “snitch,” and Durrant agreed to do the killing.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[288,1101,1151,901]]]'>Durrant further testified that, during the week prior to the murder, Cruz brought a 12-gauge shotgun, with the butt partially sawed off, to Durrant’s house for use in killing the victim. Durrant went to a Lowes store to purchase a hacksaw, which he then used to further saw down the barrel of the gun. On the evening of March 30, 2007, Durrant told Cruz to call the victim and ask him to meet in an alleyway under the pretense of arranging a drug deal. When the victim arrived in the alleyway, Durrant, who had been waiting for him, shot the victim twice in the head, killing him. Durrant and Cruz fled the alleyway in Cruz’s vehicle, and the police immediately gave chase. After several blocks, Cruz stopped the vehicle, at which time Durrant exited the car, dropped the shotgun in the road, and unsuccessfully attempted to run away. Durrant pled guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced to 25 to 60 years imprisonment in exchange for his agreement to testify against Cruz and Appellant.</p>

Moreover, even assuming James’ testimony was relevant to show that Durrant was willing to “do anything” to cooperate with the Commonwealth, as Appellant suggests, we are convinced the trial court’s exclusion of James’ testimony did not affect the jury’s verdict. Indeed, as the Commonwealth notes, Appellant introduced substantial evidence at trial demonstrating that Durrant had a motive to fabricate his testimony in order to obtain a favorable plea agreement. During a thorough cross-examination, Durrant admitted that he initially lied about his participation and the involvement of others in the victim’s murder. N.T. Trial, 5/19/10, at 127-42. Appellant also established that, in exchange for Durrant’s testimony, the Commonwealth agreed to drop the charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and sentence Durrant for third-degree murder. Durrant further admitted that he <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>withheld evidence until pending motions in his own case were resolved; that his main objective was to obtain the best deal possible; and that, at one point, he stated he was going to claim that his trial counsel was ineffective.

    <blockquote id="b191-6" data-blocks='[["BL_191.6",191,[206,1674,1109,689]]]'>[sjtudies have shown that juries begin to form opinions about the imposition of the death penalty beginning with the voir dire process and form opinions as to the penalty during the guilt phase of the trial. Prospective jurors believe that a sentence of life imprisonment is in fact a sentence which allows for a parole after a finite period of years substantially less than life. In the absence of an instruction to the jury as to the definition of “life imprisonment”, Appellant submits that the jury selected was predisposed to the sentence of death as opposed to a life sentence because they erroneously believed a life sentence resulted in less than lifetime of imprisonment. Such predisposition deprived Appellant of his right to a fair and impartial jury trial.</blockquote>
