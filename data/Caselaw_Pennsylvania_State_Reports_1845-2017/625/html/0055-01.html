Specifically, Section 1322 directs gaming facilities to establish protocols that “[p]rovide for reliable records, accounts and reports of any financial event that occurs in the operation of a slot machine, including reports to the [Gaming Board] related to the slot machines;” “[p]rovide for accurate and reliable financial records”; and “[e]nsure that any financial event that occurs in the operation of a slot machine is recorded adequately to permit proper and timely reporting of gross revenue and the calculation thereof and of fees and taxes and to maintain accountability for assets.” 4 Pa.C.S. § 1322(b)(2), (4), (6). These more general subsections would be unnecessary if the universe of financial reporting for slot machines was limited to the CCS. We conclude that nothing in the statutes listed requires the awards to be tracked by the CCS. Moreover, we are not concerned that the integrity of gaming in the Commonwealth will be at risk given that the gaming entities will have to file a petition for a refund documented by adequate and reliable financial records or face appropriate rejection of the petition by the Department of Revenue.</p>

Instead, our reading of the regulation relating to “State Gaming Fund Transfers,” and in particular the subsection relating to “[t]ax assessments and credit against tax,” does not require all items relevant to GTR to be tracked by the CCS. 61 Pa.Code § 1001.8(c)(1). Instead, the relevant language, <em>supra </em>at 707-OS, merely provides that the Department’s GTR determinations and related tax calculations be based on the CCS. It does not forbid the gaming entities from providing other calculations of GTR not based upon the CCS. In fact, a later subsection addresses how a gaming entity can challenge the Department’s conclusions, which arguably would include the calculation of GTR. 61 Pa.Code. § 1001.8(c)(5). Accordingly, we find nothing in the statute or the Department’s regulations <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>requiring that the amounts subtracted from total wagers in calculating GTR must be tracked solely by the CCS.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

    <p id="b125-4" data-blocks='[["BL_125.5",125,[166,451,1150,844]]]'>Nonetheless, while we conclude that the plain language of the statute requires neither a metered win nor tracking by the CCS, we find the definition of GTR is still ambiguous regarding the meaning of the phrase “result of playing a slot machine.” The Commonwealth convincingly asserts that the promotional awards at issue, which are arguably unrelated to any specific act of playing a specific slot machine, are likewise not related to the purpose underlying the GTR calculations. As the Commonwealth suggests, GTR measures the revenue of a slot machine, which in most simplistic terms is the wagers received minus the winnings paid out. The promotional awards, however, are not precisely correlated to the quantity of wagers received, and thus, according to the Commonwealth, should not be deducted from total wagers any more than they should be deducted as expenses related to the parking garage or the restaurants.</p>

Moreover, Greenwood observes that the comp exclusion in the personal property subsection would be redundant if the personal property subsection was already restricted to awards tied to a specific slot machine play.</p>

As noted, statutes that define what property is and is not subject to taxation are <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>interpreted strictly in favor of the taxpayer and against the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(3) (requiring strict construction of “[provisions imposing taxes”); <em>see also Crawford Cent. Sch.

Greenwood is correct that the definition of GTR in Section 1103 involves defining what is and is not subject to the slot machine tax in the first instance. The section begins with total wagers and from there subtracts (1) cash paid out, (2) cash paid to purchase annuities to fund prizes, and (3) personal property distributed. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1103(GTR)(l)-(3). The result of this calculation is GTR. It is GTR, not the original total wagers, that serves as the basis for the slot machine tax. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1403 (providing that “each slot machine licensee shall pay a daily tax of 34% from its daily gross terminal revenue from the slot machines in operation at its facility and a local share assessment ... ”). Thus, subsection (l)-(3) are exclusions, which must be interpreted strictly in the favor of Greenwood as the taxpayer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

Accordingly, we conclude that the amounts that can be deducted from total wagers need not be tied to specific machines, but rather can be tied more generally to slot machine play at the gaming facility. We further find support for this reading in the “comp exclusion” included in subsection (3). As Greenwood argues, the comp exclusion would be an unnecessary statutory section <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>if the gaming facility could only subtract personal property distributed to a patron that was tied to a specific machine. Comps, such as free drinks and lodging, are not given to patrons as a result of playing a particular slot machine. Instead, they are provided as an enticement for continued slot machine gaming, just like the promotional awards in the case at bar. Thus, we conclude that the Legislature’s inclusion of the comp exclusion is indicative of an intent to allow gaming facilities to subtract amounts, such as the promotional awards, without requiring these sums to be tied to the play of a specific slot machine at a specific time. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a) (requiring every statute to be construed to give effect to all its provisions).</p>

After review of the Stipulation, we conclude that questions of fact remain concerning whether the specific awards claimed are a “result of playing a slot machine.” For example, in regard to the promotional awards given to patrons who had their Players Cards inserted in a slot machine at a specific time, the Stipulation does not indicate how insertion of the Players Card relates to actually “playing” the slot machine, as required by Section 1103’s definition of GTR. As another illustration, the Stipulation catalogues the cost of roses given to women dining in Greenwood’s restaurant on Valentine’s Day and the cost of plastic eggs given at Easter which enclosed free slot play, without indicating how the items were “personal property distributed to a patron as the result of playing a slot machine,” 4 Pa.C.S. § 1103(GTR)(3), as opposed to “as the result of’ eating in the restaurant or walking into the casino.

As noted by the Commonwealth Court below, these awards “were designed [by Greenwood] to improve the relationship between Greenwood and its patrons, with the ultimate goal of encouraging patrons to frequent the casino more often, to increase his/her gaming activity, and to promote the casino.... ” <em>Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/a3d/29/1215-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="29 A.3d 1215" data-case-ids="7281052" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/1215-01">29 A.3d 1215</a>, 1217 (Pa.Cmwlth.2011). As aptly stated by the Majority here, Greenwood asks this Court to hold that Section 1103 of the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. § 1103 (Section 1103), allows for a substantial portion of such marketing and promotional costs to be credited as a pre-tax deduction from slot machine-related <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>gross terminal revenue in calculating slot machine taxes due to the Commonwealth. In order to make the connection between these promotional costs and slot machine gross terminal revenue, Greenwood claims it limited these promotions to Greenwood patrons who either inserted their “Players Card” into a slot machine at some point, presented in person a postcard mailed to them by Greenwood with entries for selection by a random number generator, or simply were chosen as a specific patron targeted for “player development.” <em><a href="/a3d/29/1215-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="29 A.3d 1215" data-case-ids="7281052" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/1215-01">Id.</a> </em>The Commonwealth Court reasonably concluded that “the prizes awarded are more accurately described as resulting from one having a Players Card, not as resulting from simply playing a slot machine.” <em>Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, Inc., </em><a href="/a3d/29/1215-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="29 A.3d 1215" data-case-ids="7281052" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/1215-01">29 A.3d at 1220</a>. Thus, as noted by the Majority here, it is — to say the least — unclear as to whether these promotional awards can be described as related to actually playing slot machines. Maj. Op. at 79, 90 A.3d at 714 (“to be deductible, the promotional awards must result from playing slot machines, and Greenwood is obligated to prove as much”).</p>

      <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>4 Pa.C.S. § 1103. In other words, gross terminal revenue, a measurement of the collective revenue generated by a casino’s employment of slot machines, is a dollar figure produced by a relatively simple mathematical equation, to wit: gross terminal revenue = (cash received by a slot machine - wager related costs of slot machine operation) + (entry fees for slot machine contests/tournaments). As the Majority Opinion concedes, “[t]he Commonwealth convincingly asserts that the promotional awards at issue, which are arguably unrelated to any specific act of playing a specific slot machine, are likewise not related to the purpose underlying the [gross terminal revenue] calculations.” Maj. Op. at 77, 90 A.3d at 713.</p>
    <p id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[293,965,1152,683]]]'>Thus, this Court is called upon to interpret the statutory definition of gross terminal revenue to determine whether marketing and promotional expenses in the form of awards and prizes should be subtracted from total wagers as the “result of playing a slot machine,” for purposes of calculating taxes due to the Commonwealth on slot machine revenue, where the awards are, at best, only tangentially related to slot machines, have no impact on the wager related costs of slot machine operation, and are selectively issued, perhaps even at whim, by casinos for the sole purpose of promoting their businesses. I am not persuaded that the General Assembly intended to have the Commonwealth’s taxpayers foot these expenses.</p>

Belin, </em><a href="/pa/501/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="501 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="1782510" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0255-01">501 Pa. 255</a>, <a href="/pa/501/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="461 A.2d 197" data-case-ids="1782457,1782510" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0254-01,/pa/501/0255-01">461 A.2d 197</a> (1983). “Of equal importance [however,] is the presumption that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd ... or unreasonable.” <em>Triumph Hosiery Mills, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/469/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="469 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1722165" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0092-01">469 Pa. 92</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="469 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="1722165" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0092-01">364 A.2d 919</a>, 921 (1976) (citing 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1)). As noted in the Majority Opinion, the Commonwealth argues that interpreting gross terminal revenue in such a way as to allow the deduction of a promotional award from money otherwise taxable by the <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>Commonwealth merely because a selected card holder had at one time played a slot machine produces an absurd result that, I believe, was not intended by the General Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[164,516,1151,1268]]]'>In my view, the idea behind Section 1103 is that slot machine revenue consists of money gained from the operation of slot machines, minus actual costs attributable to operating the same. Paying out winnings, as addressed in Section 1103(l)(i) and (iii), are costs of operating slot machines. Paying for annuities to fund prizes payable over time, as addressed in Section 1103(l)(ii), is a cost of operating slot machines. Marketing and promotional awards, on the other hand, are not costs of operating slot machines, but simply a casino’s costs of doing business which exist independent of slot machine revenue, and would exist even if the casino had no slot machines. Thus, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s holding that “the allowable deductions are prizes that are won as a direct product of physical operation of a particular slot machine, not just because the patron played a slot machine at some point in time.” <em>Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, Inc., </em><a href="/a3d/29/1215-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="29 A.3d 1215" data-case-ids="7281052" data-case-paths="/a3d/29/1215-01">29 A.3d at 1219</a>. As the Commonwealth contends, it is nonsensical to deduct the costs of marketing and promotions from slot machine revenue where the recipients of the promotional “prizes” make no wagers at slot machines and, therefore, no contribution to gross terminal revenue to receive such prizes. I do not believe the General Assembly intended such an unreasonable result.</p>
    <p id="b131-5" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[163,1827,1149,538]]]'>Again, marketing and promotional expenses are simply a cost of doing business, <em>i.e., </em>business expenses, for casinos. As such these expenses are somewhat self-regulating in the sense that they eat into the casino’s profits. The more promotions cost, the less profit the casino makes. It is appropriate that the casino pays for all such expenses, and not the Commonwealth. The unintended effect of the Majority Opinion will be to encourage increased casino giveaways, subsidized by the taxpayers. Because I believe this result is contrary to legislative intent, I respectfully dissent.</p>
