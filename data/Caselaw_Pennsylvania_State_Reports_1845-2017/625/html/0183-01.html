Accordingly, we adopt the federal automobile exception to the warrant requirement, which allows police officers to search a motor vehicle when there is probable cause to do so and does not require any exigency beyond the inherent mobility of a motor vehicle.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[169,862,1151,1311]]]'>On January 15, 2010, Philadelphia Police Officers Baker and Waters were on patrol' in their marked car in the area of North 58th Street and Florence Avenue when they observed Shiem Gary (Appellee) driving an SUV with heavily tinted windows. Believing that the level of tint in the windows violated Pennsylvania’s Motor Vehicle Code, the officers stopped and approached the SUV. As they did so, they noticed the smell of marijuana emanating from the passenger and driver sides of the vehicle. When Officer Baker asked Appellee if there was anything in his vehicle that the officers “need [to] know about,” Appellee responded that there was some “weed.” The officers removed Appellee from the SUV, placed him in the police cruiser, and summoned the canine unit. As Police Officer Snyder and his dog, Leo, began to walk around the SUV, Appellee got out of the police cruiser and started running from the scene. With Leo’s help, the officers apprehended Appellee and returned him to the police cruiser. The search of Appellee’s SUV yielded approximately two pounds of marijuana, found under the front hood in a bag lodged next to the air filter. Opinion of Court of Common Pleas, dated 12/15/10, at 2; Notes of Testimony (“N.T.”) Suppression Hearing, 4/28/2010, at 6-11; N.T. Hearing, 6/4/10, at 11-13 (Municipal Court summary of facts of the case). Appellee was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court conducted a hearing on Appellee’s suppression motion on April 28, 2010, and on June 4, 2010, the court held that the warrantless search was valid because it was justified by both probable cause and exigent circumstances. More specifically, the court held that probable cause was “strong” based on the “plain smell” of the marijuana emanating from Appellee’s SUV. With respect to exigent circumstances, the court found that police had no advance warning that Appellee’s vehicle would be stopped or that there would be probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband. The court also determined that Appellee was in custody and that the police were in control of his vehicle at the time of the search, but these determinations did not undermine the court’s finding of exigency. N.T. Hearing, 6/4/10, at 13-15. Accordingly, the municipal court denied Appellee’s suppression motion, and the marijuana was admitted into evidence. Following a stipulated trial, Appellee was found guilty of both charges and was sentenced to four years’ reporting probation.</p>

Following oral argument on September 28, 2010, the court denied the writ. The court observed that a warrantless search of an automobile is permissible where there is both probable cause to search and exigent circumstances necessitating a search. Opinion of Court of Common Pleas, dated 12/15/10, at 3 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Casanova, </em><a href="/a2d/748/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="748 A.2d 207" data-case-ids="11454033" data-case-paths="/a2d/748/0207-01">748 A.2d 207</a>, 211 (Pa.Super.2000)). In finding probable cause to search, the common pleas court noted the “plain smell” of the marijuana emanating from the vehicle, as well as Appellee’s flight from the scene. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. In addition, the court concluded that the following factors constituted exigent circumstances: (1) the lack of advance warning to police that Appellee’s vehicle would be stopped and would be part of a criminal investigation; (2) the need for the officers to act quickly to seize contraband from the vehicle; and (3) the determination that Appellee was not under arrest before the search occurred and thus might have been permit<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>ted to return to his vehicle and drive away with the contraband. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>

In upholding the seizure of the vehicle, we recognized that “in considering the reasonableness of a given search or seizure of an automobile, the need for a warrant is often excused by exigent circumstance,” and we cited two reasons for this exception to the warrant requirement, to wit, the mobility of a vehicle, and the lesser expectation of privacy with respect to an automobile as compared to a home or office. <em><a href="/pa/480/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="480 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1745027" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0093-01">Id.</a> </em>at 106 (citing U.S. Supreme <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>Court opinions in <em>Chambers, <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">supra,</a> </em>and <em>Opperman, <a href="/us/428/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="428 U.S. 364" data-case-ids="6177992" data-case-paths="/us/428/0364-01">supra,</a> </em>as well as our opinions in <em>Smith, supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth v.

We held that the warrantless seizure of the vehicle was proper because it was reasonable “for police to seize and hold a car until a search warrant can be obtained, where the seizure occurs after the user or owner has been placed into custody, where the vehicle is located on public property, and where there exists probable cause to believe that evidence of the commission of a crime will be obtained from the vehicle.” <em>Id. </em>at 106 (footnote omitted).

In <em>Hernandez, </em>a freight shipping manager alerted police to a shipment of many boxes of marijuana. Police stopped the U-Haul truck containing the marijuana, which was driven by the defendant, and directed him to get out of the vehicle. One of the officers opened the rear roll-up door of the truck to see if there was someone else in the truck. The officer observed an open box containing packaging consistent with narcotics. The defendant admitted to police that he had been paid to pick up the shipment, which he knew contained controlled substances. Police then sought and obtained a warrant to search the truck, finding more than 400 pounds of marijuana. <em><a href="/pa/594/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="227" data-cite="935 A.2d 1275" data-case-ids="3595413,8367480" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0319-01,/a2d/935/1275-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/594/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="227" data-cite="935 A.2d 1275" data-case-ids="3595413,8367480" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0319-01,/a2d/935/1275-01">at 1277-79</a>.

Rather, “[warrantless vehicle searches in this Commonwealth must be accompanied not only by probable cause, but also by exigent circumstances beyond mere mobility.” <em>Id. </em>We acknowledged the difficulty that this Court has had in determining precisely what satisfies the exigency requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1280-81 (discussing Perry, supra). We then held “without equivocation, that where there is potential danger to police or others in the context of a vehicle stop, exigency has been established for purposes of a warrantless search.” <em>Id. </em>at 1282. However, in <em>Hernandez, </em>because the Commonwealth had not offered any supporting evidence for the police claim of danger from another person in the truck, this Court held that the search was not supported by exigent circumstances and thus was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 1288. Nevertheless, this Court concluded that the officer’s observations of the rear compartment of the truck were not required to support probable cause for the subsequently obtained warrant.

Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="446" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">526 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="447" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d 887</a> (1991), a case which emphasized the paramount importance of Article I, Section 8 in safeguarding the fundamental human right to privacy enjoyed by the people of this Commonwealth, the plurality opinion in this matter incongruously now interprets that provision in a manner which severely diminishes its protections of the important personal privacy rights which owners and occupants of automobiles possess therein. The requirement that the ultimate decisionmaking authority for commencing an automobile search — a disruptive and invasive ordeal for those individuals whose vehicles are subjected to the search process — be vested in a neutral magistrate, and not the officer who will conduct the search, except in those instances where exigent circumstances make the obtaining of a warrant impracticable, is critical to ensure that the protections afforded by Article I, Section 8 to all owners and occupants of automobiles not be forsaken. However, our Court has now eliminated the time-honored and time-tested protection of our citizenry afforded by the interposition of the judgment of a neutral magistrate, through its wholesale adoption of the United States Supreme Court’s “automobile exception” to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment of the federal Constitution, which allows a search of an automobile based solely on the searching officer’s determination that probable cause exists for such a search.</p>

As I explain at greater length herein, the federal automobile exception was first created by the high Court in the 1920’s, seemingly in response to the practical difficulties of federal prohibition enforcement agents obtaining a search warrant for vehicles they suspected of transporting liquor, and then applied more recently by that Court in the mid-1980’s because of a completely differing policy consideration — people’s alleged diminished expectations of privacy in their vehicles. However, these rationales have been seriously eroded by both the advance of technology and the practical reality of how owners, operators, and passengers in automobiles utilize them in modern times. Today, the time it takes to obtain a search warrant for an automobile has been radically reduced, thanks in large measure to advances in communication technology which allow warrants to be obtained efficaciously by officers while they are still at the scene of an investigation. Other advances in technology have caused cars to become data repositories revealing the most discrete information about how and where individuals drive, whom they call from their car, and any number of other revealing insights into what they do in their daily lives. Likewise, for most people, the automobile, by consumer choice and by design, has become a rolling repository of their private possessions, which they keep shielded from public view during the significant amounts of time they spend therein. Some of these possessions, such as the laptop or smartphone, are digital treasure troves which contain significant amounts of highly sensitive personal and business information.</p>

However, as the plurality recognizes, <em>see </em>Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (“OAJC”) at 120, <em>White </em>marked a clear break with the United States Supreme Court’s caselaw in this area, which, by 1995, had abandoned the requirement that exigent circumstances must exist to excuse the failure to obtain a warrant prior to an automobile <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>search. As a result, I consider our decision in <em>White, </em>that suppression of evidence obtained from the search of the arrested driver’s vehicle was compelled by Article I, Section 8, because the police had time and opportunity to obtain a search warrant prior to the search, to reflect a deliberate choice by our Court to chart an independent course in our jurisprudence under Article I, Section 8. From my perspective, it, thus, represented an intentional repudiation of the federal approach to such searches, an approach which, as I explain at greater length <em>infra, </em>gives what I deem to be insufficient consideration to, and protection of, the vital interest in individual privacy, secured by the warrant requirement of Article I, Section 8. I, therefore, regard <em>White </em>as constituting a watershed division between Pennsylvania jurisprudence and federal law on this subject, which preserved and continued our prior interpretation of Article I, Section 8 as requiring a warrant for automobile searches, unless exigent circumstances preclude procuring one. This clear separation between our jurisprudence under Article I, Section 8, and that of the United States Supreme Court under the Fourth Amendment, has been maintained by subsequent precedential decisions from our Court continuing to insist on both probable cause and exigent circumstances as justification for a warrantless search of an automobile. <em>See Luv, <a href="/a2d/735/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="461" data-cite="735 A.2d 87" data-case-ids="11533687,56811" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0087-01,/pa/557/0570-01">735 </a></em><a href="/a2d/735/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="461" data-cite="735 A.2d 87" data-case-ids="11533687,56811" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0087-01,/pa/557/0570-01">A.2d at 93</a> (both “the existence of probable cause and the presence of exigent circumstances” are required “to justify a warrantless search of a vehicle”); <em>Hernandez, </em><a href="/pa/594/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="462" data-cite="935 A.2d 1275" data-case-ids="3595413,8367480" data-case-paths="/pa/594/0319-01,/a2d/935/1275-01">935 A.2d at 1280</a> (the “dual requirement of probable cause plus exigency is an established part of our state constitutional jurisprudence”).</p>

The people of colonial Pennsylvania suffered myriad invasions of privacy as the result of widespread, capricious general search and seizure practices, which did not require that the searching official obtain prior approval from a neutral judicial officer before conducting a particular search or seizure. The people’s active resistance to these practices, and the concomitant attempts by our colonial judiciary to limit the powers of crown officials to carry out searches and seizures at their exclusive discretion, greatly influenced the framers of our original Constitution to provide security to the people of this Commonwealth against such unreasonable searches and seizures. They provided such security by including within that Constitution’s Declaration of Rights a warrant requirement in order to specifically regulate the future conduct of searches and seizures by governmental officials. <em>See generally </em>J.

Dickinson argued that the power of general search conferred by the writs, which extended to all places of privacy, including the innermost confines of a colonist’s home, had been recognized even in England as “dangerous to freedom and expressly contrary to the common law,” and he argued that the writs were “utterly destructive to liberty” since, unlike in England, the people here had no security “against the undue exercise of this power by the crown.” Lasson, at 70 n. 67.</p>

In rejecting a 1771 application for a general writ from the Philadelphia customs collector, John Swift, Chief Justice Allen of our Court informed Swift: “[I]f you will make oath that you have had an information that ... [smuggled goods] are in any particular place, I will grant you a writ to search that particular place but no general writ to search every house — I would not do that for any consideration.” Cuddihy, at 520.

We, along with Massachusetts, were the only colonies to supplant the authority of our own excise collectors to conduct warrantless excise searches with a requirement that the searches be conducted pursuant to supplementary search warrants, which authorized searches of places based on information provided by the official on where he thought goods on which duty had not been paid might be found.

Even though the members of our inaugural constitutional convention, who began their labors in July 1776 under the shadow of the gathering storm clouds of war with England, were confronted with numerous weighty matters such as selecting a basic form of government, they, nevertheless, immediately formed a “Bill of Rights Committee,” and assigned as one of its primary tasks the drafting of <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>protections for the “freedom from arbitrary search.” Burton A.

Also remarkable was the fact that Article X secured the right of the people to be free from arbitrary search and seizure of their papers and possessions by requiring the use of specific warrants “to search suspected places” in which such papers and possessions might be found. I find it particularly noteworthy that Article X was the first post-colonial constitutional provision to contain a requirement that an officer, who wished to obtain such a specific warrant to search a particular place, or to seize particular items, swear or affirm to a neutral third party empowered to issue the warrant — most often a judge — that “[a] sufficient foundation” existed, factually, for the officer to conduct such a search or make such a seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 170. By inclusion of this requirement that a governmental official obtain authorization prior to conducting a particular search or seizure, Article X represents a deliberate and affirmative repudiation of the previously discussed judicially unsupervised search practices which the framers found so repugnant.</p>

That our Commonwealth was the first to express a clear constitutional preference for the independent judgment of the judiciary regarding prior approval for, and conduct of, searches and seizures is significant, as it was a logical and natural outgrowth of the unique historical experiences of the people of Pennsylvania, who had long embraced specific warrants, issued after judicial review of specific justifying facts, but prior to any search or seizure taking place, as an effective legal means to ameliorate the harmful consequences of the deleterious warrantless search and seizure practices to which they were subjected. Based on this rich history, I regard our Constitution’s warrant requirement to be one of singular and distinctive importance to Pennsylvania, in contrast to the later warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was based, in part, on this provision. <em>Edmunds, </em><a href="/pa/526/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="488" data-cite="526 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1825870" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0374-01">586 A.2d at 896</a>.</p>

It is viewed, for those who routinely travel in it, as a place of refuge and protection from the external world and the stresses of modern life. Today’s vehicles are deliberately engineered to insulate the drivers and passengers from as many extraneous disturbances as possible, and people frequently take maximum advantage of this insularity to “get away from it all” by taking long evening, weekend, or vacation drives. Even in their daily lives, more people still opt for driving than taking public transportation, in large measure because of the privacy the vehicle affords them while in transit. As William Safire has cogently observed in this regard: “[M]ost people ... prefer vehicles of their own. Certainly a strong reason must exist for commuters to go into hock to buy a car, to sweat out traffic jams, to groan over repair bills. That reason is, simply: the blessed orneriness called privacy.” Katz, <em>Automobile Searches and Diminished Expectations in the Warrant Clause, </em><a href="/citations/?q=19%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%20557" class="citation" data-index="533" data-cite="19 Am.

In addition, the Committee agreed with the concept that proceeding with a warrant is favored over proceeding without a warrant, and using ACT will reduce the number of warrantless arrests and seizures.</blockquote>

Consequently, the adoption of these rules reflects a strong policy choice by our Court to maximize the use of judicially issued warrants by police in the field who wish to conduct searches, by providing a modern update to the warrant application process which facilitates rapid communication between them and the issuing magistrates. Although the rules do not require magistrates to use this process, as a rule of statewide applicability, it nevertheless permits the utilization of these procedures in every county of this Commonwealth, and, thus, insures and strengthens compliance with the warrant requirement of Article I, Section 8.</p>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the length of time required to obtain a search warrant was a factor of considerable importance to the <em>CarroU </em>Court in finding that an immediate warrantless search on probable cause was justified, given the possibility the vehicle could be driven away before a magistrate could be found to consider a warrant application. However, this concern has been significantly lessened by the advent of the above enumerated modern technological means to enhance communication between officers in remote locations and magistrates, which technology <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>has only improved in both quality and availability since the original promulgation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 203.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_16" id="ref_footnote_3_16">16</a> The <em>Carney </em>Court, in fashioning its broad warrantless search rule, did not consider, at all, the impact such rapid communications technologies — in development at the time that case was heard — would have on the speed and ease of obtaining a warrant for the search of an automobile, and, thus its persuasiveness as a basis to impede the operation of this state rule, and thereby impact the administration of justice in this Commonwealth is severely undermined.</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[176,868,1152,1037]]]'>Nevertheless, I find it significant that, even though the time required to obtain a warrant was considerably longer in the 1920’s, the <em>Carroll </em>Court, as related above, expressed a warrant preference which was in alignment with our current state constitutional standard, i.e., “where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used.” Carroll, <a href="/us/267/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="553" data-cite="267 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6137701" data-case-paths="/us/267/0132-01">267 U.S. at 156</a>, <a href="/us/267/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="554" data-cite="267 U.S. 132" data-case-ids="6137701" data-case-paths="/us/267/0132-01">45 S.Ct. 280</a>. Today, in this Commonwealth, as the result of Rule 203, which seeks to maximize the use of advanced communication technology, obtaining a search warrant is quite reasonably practicable; accordingly, as is constitutionally required, it should remain the first choice, unless exigent circumstances foreclose an investigating officer from obtaining it. I deem adherence to these requirements as affording our police officers a clear and understandable standard to guide them, as sought by the plurality, and I consider police officers eminently capable as trained professionals of making the basic assessment of whether it is reasonably practicable for them to seek a warrant, under all of the circumstances existing at the time they wish to search an automobile.</p>

The disruption of individual privacy while a magistrate considers a search warrant application is limited to the temporary loss of the vehicle’s use, which, especially if the procedures set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 203 are utilized, will usually be brief, and, most significantly, avoids any invasion of the vehicle’s interior and disturbing of its contents prior to a judicial determination of whether the search is lawful under our Constitution. Further, it bears emphasis that the process of judicial consideration of a warrant application, guaranteed by Article I, Section 8, is a citizen’s sole means by which he or she may attain judicial review of the legality of a search prior to it occurring. <em>See Brinegar v.

Our Court, by adopting the diluted federal automobile exception and sanctioning the search of Appellee’s vehicle under Article I, Section 8, based solely on the officer’s determination of probable cause, has eviscerated the strong privacy protections that amendment affords the people of Pennsylvania in their automobiles. By so doing, our Court heedlessly contravenes over 225 years of unyielding protection against unreasonable search and seizure which our people have enjoyed as their birthright. I cannot join our Court in this endeavor, as it is so diametrically contrary to the deep historical and legal traditions of our Commonwealth. As Mr. Justice Jackson observed so persuasively over a half century ago, and which principle remains just as viable today: “When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or Government enforcement agent.” <em>Johnson v.

Connecticut, in interpreting its own constitution, has adopted only a limited version of the federal automobile exception which allows a warrantless search on probable cause when the automobile remains in a public place after the arrest of the driver; however, if the vehicle is impounded and towed to the police station, then a warrant is required to search it. <em>State v.
