They contend that “an attorney providing a trial expert with facts or other information, or telling the expert what to say, does not result in counsel developing new legal theories or advancing a factual investigation,” and thus these exchanges should not be protected.

Reconciling these provisions, the panel held that discovery should supersede the work product doctrine under the circumstances, given that the protections of Rule 4003.3 do not create an absolute privilege, whereas Rule 4003.5 specifically requires disclosure of the substance upon which an expert’s opinions are based, including information contained within correspondence. Like the trial court, the panel also found <em>Pavlak </em>instructive, but declined to require redaction and <em>in camera </em>review, instead imposing a <em>per se </em>rule in favor of disclosure. The court explained that, in light of its interpretation of the pertinent rules, <em>“in camera </em>inspection would be duplicative and a waste of judicial resources.” <em>Barrick v. Holy Spirit Hosp., </em>No. 1856 MDA 2009, <em>slip op. </em>at 14 (Pa.Super.2010). As applied here, the panel reasoned that Mr. Barrick’s medical records could not contain all the information upon which Dr. Green relied in forming his expert opinions; rather, Dr. Green corresponded with counsel in his role as an expert witness and thus necessarily reviewed communications from the Barricks’ attorney in the course of developing his expert opinions. Therefore, the court concluded, Appellants “are entitled to discover information which <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>would enable them to ascertain whether Dr. Green’s opinions are his own or whether he merely intended to parrot what he was told by counsel.” <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>

The panel also concluded that the Defendants improperly sought the records directly from Dr. Green, when under Rule 4003.5, the request should have been made through Plaintiffs’ counsel. It appears that Defendants were not aware when they requested the documents that Dr. Green was an expert witness, rather than a treating physician. Presumably as a result of the lack of a designation, Defendants did not follow the required procedure for discovery of expert witnesses via interrogatories rather than subpoenas.</p>
