CI-142 spoke with Yvette Torres at the door, went inside, and returned a few minutes later with two clear, red-lidded jars of PCP. Officer Cujdik used this transaction as probable cause in an application for a search warrant, which was issued and executed later that day. Officer Cujdik stationed himself at the rear of the property while other officers knocked on the front door. After the knock, Officer Cujdik saw appellee run out the back door and toss a clear plastic baggie into the neighboring yard. While other officers apprehended appellee, Officer Cujdik retrieved the baggie, which contained five clear glass jars of PCP, two of which had red lids like those purchased earlier by CI-142.</p>

The article further indicated the owner recovered ten minutes of video footage from , a back-up surveillance system, which showed the officers cutting the wires to a camera. No footage showed the alleged looting of the store. The article stated Officer Cujdik’s affidavit for the warrant averred that a confidential informant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> purchased drug paraphernalia at the store two and a half hours before the raid, and alleged that video from this time period did not show anyone purchasing such items.</p>

The Superior Court applied the after-discovered evidence test and determined the defendant was unlikely to have discovered the article prior to its publication, the evidence was not cumulative because the veracity of the technician’s testimony had not been questioned at trial, and <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>the evidence could be offered for a non-impeachment purpose <em>{i.e., </em>the evidence called into question the type and amount of drug upon which the conviction and sentence were based). <em>See <a href="/a2d/939/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="939 A.2d 355" data-case-ids="8301932" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0355-01">id., </a></em><a href="/a2d/939/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="939 A.2d 355" data-case-ids="8301932" data-case-paths="/a2d/939/0355-01">at 359</a>.
