CYS conducted an investigation, and on November 5, 2009, filed an “indicated” report against G.V. after finding that “substantial evidence” existed that G.V. had sexually abused C.S. A summary of the indicated report was also filed with the Registry, as required under the Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6301-6386 (“CPS Law”). Shortly thereafter, G.V. was informed that he was listed as a perpetrator in the Registry, and he asked that DPW expunge the report on the grounds that it <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>was inaccurate and/or maintained in a manner inconsistent with the CPS Law. Expungement was denied, and G.V. appealed pursuant to Section 6341(c) of the CPS Law. A hearing was held before an administrative law judge at which several witnesses testified, including G.V., C.S., T.V., an adult daughter of G.V. and T.V., a long-standing friend and neighbor of G.V., and the CYS social worker. Thereafter, the administrative law judge issued an adjudication and recommendation concluding that the indicated report was supported by substantial evidence and that the summary of the indicated report was being maintained in a manner consistent with both the CPS Law and DPW regulations. The administrative law judge found that C.S.’s testimony was credible, and that G.V.’s testimony was incredible due to internal inconsistencies, as well as to other evidence showing that G.V. regularly hid his activities from family members. Upon G.V.’s appeal, the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals adopted the administrative law judge’s recommendation and denied expungement. After his motion for reconsideration was denied, G.V. appealed to the Commonwealth Court.</p>

A person accused in an indicated report has forty-five days after receiving notice of the report to petition the Secretary of Public Welfare for amendment or expunction on the grounds that the report is inaccurate or being maintained in a manner inconsistent with the CPSL. 23 Pa.C.S. § 6341. Section 6341(c) further provides:</p>

Specifically, the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of Section 6841(c) fails to give proper effect to language in that section which authorizes the Secretary of Public Welfare to expunge indicated reports from the ChildLine Registry when the reports are “inaccurate or ... being maintained in a manner inconsistent with [the CPSL].” <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 6341(c).</p>

In Section 6303(a), the CPSL plainly states that a report of child abuse is indicated upon a showing of substantial evidence. Because an indicated report is created and entered into the ChildLine Registry on the basis of substantial evidence, the report is properly maintained in the registry on the basis of the same substantial evidence. Accordingly, when Section 6341(c) directs the Secretary to expunge an indicated report summary from the registry in the event that the appropriate county agency fails to demonstrate that the report is accurate and maintained in a manner consistent with the CPSL, the provision, by reference to the rest of the CPSL, identifies substantial evidence as the appropriate standard of proof for overcoming an expunction hearing challenge and maintaining an indicated report in the Registry thereafter.</p>

By permitting a lower burden of proof, substantial evidence, for creating and entering an indicated report summary in the ChildLine Registry, and then imposing a higher burden of proof, clear and convincing evidence, to maintain such a report in the Registry, the Commonwealth Court created an outcome where the Child-Line Registry will inevitably contain reports based on differ<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>ent evidentiary standards. Because not all individuals named in the Registry will challenge their indicated status within the forty-five day statutory period, many reports of abuse will remain in the Registry after being established by substantial evidence, while those that are challenged will remain only if they are established by clear and convincing evidence. As we presume the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable, we respectfully reject the Commonwealth Court’s construction of the CPSL as contrary to the General Assembly’s intent on the basis of our statutory construction analysis. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1).</p>
    <p id="b348-4" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[283,922,1151,844]]]'>Moreover, this result is consistent with the statutory construction factors of 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(1) through (4), as set forth at note 3, infra. The occasion and the necessity for this statute, the circumstances for its enactment, the mischief to be remedied and its object all involve protection of children from adults who, if given the opportunity, would prey upon them. While it makes every sense that our Legislature would build Section 6341(c) into this statute to allow the falsely accused to seek amendment or expungement of a report maintained in the Childline Registry, it makes no sense that they would impose a clear and convincing standard upon the Commonwealth to defend indicated reports created on the basis of substantial evidence, and thus increase the likelihood that persons who abused children will escape the registry, leaving them free to prey again upon an uniformed and unprotected public.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[284,1791,1148,575]]]'>It is noteworthy that Section 6340(a) limits access to the ChildLine Registry to only certain individuals charged with the care and supervision of children. The confidential nature of the ChildLine Registry is consistent with the General Assembly requiring substantial evidence as the appropriate standard of proof for overcoming an expunction hearing challenge. Thus, in contemplating these basic tenants of statutory construction, I also conclude that the Legislature intended to apply the substantial evidence, rather than clear and convincing evidence, standard to an action to amend or expunge an entry into the statewide Childline Registry.</p>

I further agree with the Majority Opinion’s analysis and conclusion that the substantial evidence standard does not offend due process or the constitutional right to reputation as contained in Article I, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Finally, so that there is no possible uncertainty, I note that I agree with the precedent cited at note 2 which equates the evidentiary standard of substantial evidence to the well-known civil standard of preponderance of the evidence.</p>
