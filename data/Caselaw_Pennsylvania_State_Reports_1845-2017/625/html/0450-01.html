For the reasons that follow, we hold that, in Pennsylvania, the admission of expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification is no longer <em>per se </em>impermissible, and join the vast majority of jurisdictions which leave the admissibility of such expert testimony to the discretion of the trial court. Thus, we reverse the order of the Superior Court, and remand the matter to the trial court for reconsideration of such expert testimony, including the possibility of a <em>Frye </em>hearing in light of our decision today.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>The origins of this appeal stem from two armed robberies which occurred within two weeks of each other in October 2005 in Philadelphia. As found by the trial court, at 1:00 a.m. on October 15, 2005, three Drexel University students, Jenna Moreno, Courtney Howe, and Caitlyn Costello, were walking south on 36th Street at the intersection of Baring Street. At this intersection is a church with a lighted archway. A man alleged to be Appellant, Benjamin Walker, approached the women, drew a black handgun approximately 6-8 inches in length, cocked it, and demanded that the women give him their money. After the women explained that they had no money, the assailant demanded their cell phones. Each complied, giving the man their cell phones and digital cameras.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[286,1024,1149,680]]]'>The victims immediately went to campus security who escorted them to a police station to provide a statement and identify their assailant. Two days later, the victims met with Philadelphia Police Detective William Farrell to determine if they could identify the assailant from two photo arrays. Each photo array was composed of eight individuals. Included in the photo arrays were Appellant, along with another suspect, and other individuals closely resembling Appellant and the other suspect. The three victims were separated and provided a photo array one at a time. Moreno and Howe identified Appellant out of the photo arrays. Three months later, on January 18, 2006, Moreno identified Appellant in an in-person lineup.</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[285,1727,1151,521]],["BL_505.1",505,[170,313,1148,576]]]'>The second robbery occurred on October 28, 2005. At approximately 3:00 a.m., University of Pennsylvania students Jonathan Ghitis and Kristina Leone were walking west on Pine Street between 40th and 41st Streets. This section of Pine Street is residential in character with several lampposts lining the street. Again, a man alleged to be Appellant and a co-conspirator walked toward the students. As the men approached the couple, Appellant separated from his co-conspirator, and flashed a silver handgun, approximately 6-8 inches in length. Leone began to scream. Appellant threw her to <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>the ground and ordered her to be quiet. At the same time, Appellant’s co-conspirator threw Ghitis down onto steps of a nearby residence. The men demanded whatever the victims had. Immediately, Leone gave Appellant her pocketbook, and Ghitis gave Appellant’s co-conspirator his wallet, watch, and cell phone. Leone continued to cry and scream, and, so, Appellant, although already in possession of her pocketbook, repeatedly struck her on the back of her head with his gun. Appellant ordered Ghitis to calm Leone, which he did. Appellant let Leone go, and shortly thereafter, Appellant and his co-conspirator fled the scene.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[168,914,1150,1163]]]'>At 3:30 a.m., after calling the police, both victims gave their account of the events and described their assailant to Detective Philip Lydon of the University of Pennsylvania police department. They met with Detective Lydon at his headquarters three hours later. There, the Detective separated the victims and showed three separate photo arrays of individuals that had similar characteristics to Appellant. Leone looked at the first array and told Detective Lydon that she could not recognize anyone. Upon viewing the second array, Leone immediately identified Appellant, viscerally reacting to his picture. Leone was shown a third array, which included an individual the police suspected was Appellant’s co-conspirator, but she could not identify him. Leone spent three to four minutes looking at the arrays. Detective Lydon did not comment to her as to whether Appellant was a suspect after she had made her identification. The same procedure was conducted with Ghitis. He pointed out Appellant from the array, but was less than 100% positive. Again, Detective Lydon did not comment to Ghitis whether Appellant was the suspect after he made his identification. The sole evidence connecting Appellant to the robberies was eyewitness identification by the victims.</p>

Appellant filed a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>to present the expert testimony of Dr. Solomon Fulero regarding the fallibility of human memory, the science as to <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>human recall, and scientific studies related to the reliability of eyewitness testimony generally. In the alternative, Appellant requested a <em>Frye </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of such evidence. After hearing argument, the court denied the motions on September 17, 2007. After trial, the jury acquitted Appellant on all charges relating to the October 15, 2005 robbery involving the three Drexel students, but found Appellant guilty of five charges relating to the October 28, 2005 robbery involving the two University of Pennsylvania students.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On December 12, 2007, the trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of incarceration of 17/6-35 years, followed by 5 years probation.</p>
    <p id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[286,957,1148,676]]]'>Regarding the denial of Appellant’s motion to admit expert testimony on human recall, or to hold a <em>Frye </em>hearing, the trial court’s threshold determination was that a <em>Frye </em>hearing was not necessary, relying upon Pennsylvania case law which holds that expert testimony concerning eyewitness identification is inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em><a href="/pa/541/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="541 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="470745" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0211-01">541 Pa. 211</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="662 A.2d 621" data-case-ids="470745,7863238" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0211-01,/a2d/662/0621-01">662 A.2d 621</a> (1995); <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court opined that, not only has our Court explained that an expert would have an unwarranted appearance of authority on the eyewitness’s credibility, but that a defendant was free to attack a witnesses’ credibility by pointing out inconsistencies through cross-examination and in closing arguments.</p>
    <p id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.6",506,[286,1657,1148,466]],["BL_507.1",507,[167,314,1150,1088]]]'>The trial court also rejected Appellant’s claim that he was denied his constitutional right to present a defense under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions by excluding expert testimony, both on eyewitness identification and on suggestiveness of out-of-court identification procedures. The trial court reasoned that, as defendants must comply with the rules of evidence to assure fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence, and as expert testimony on eyewitness identification is inadmissible, this argument was <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>without merit. The court, thus concluded that it did not infringe upon Appellant’s constitutional right to present a defense. Furthermore, the trial court dismissed Appellant’s contention that his expert testimony was admissible pursuant to Rule 702 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. Noting that this Court in <em>Simmons </em>has already spoken to the admissibility of expert testimony, that Rules 401 and 403 require that all evidence be relevant, and that the probative value outweigh its danger of unfair prejudice, the trial court found that Appellant’s statistics regarding eyewitness identifications had no bearing on whether the eyewitnesses testifying in this case were mistaken. Thus, the expert testimony, according to the trial court, did not make the fact of the eyewitnesses’ identification more or less probable. Finally, according to the trial court, even assuming that the expert’s testimony met the threshold for relevance, the probative value of such testimony was nominal, as several witnesses identified Appellant and their encounters with him were more than brief. Again, consistent with <em>Simmons, </em>the trial court reasoned that an expert would have an unwarranted appearance of authority on the eyewitness’s credibility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

With respect to the issue of the trial court’s denial of the admission of expert testimony on the subject of eyewitness identification, the Superior Court initially noted that evidentiary rulings and the admission of expert testimony is a matter of discretion for the trial court, and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. The Superior Court explained that it was mindful that our Court has been “unequivocal” in rejecting expert testimony regarding the reliability of eyewitness identification, as such testimony would impermissibly speak to the credibility of a witness’s testimony, <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>which is for the jury to assess, citing <em>Simmons, </em>and that the Superior Court has consistently followed this precedent, citing <em>Bormack.

An abuse of discretion “is not merely an error of judgment, but if in reaching a conclusion the law is over ridden or misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will, as shown by the evidence or the record, discretion is abused.” <em>Mielcuszny et ux. v.

Appellant maintains that making jurors aware of the variables that impact eyewitness accuracy is critical to “a fair adjudication of the truth.” Appellant’s Brief at 24. Building upon his argument, Appellant contends that the only evidence offered by the Commonwealth in this case were the victim’s cross-racial identifications after a stressful nighttime gunpoint robbery, and included identifications from photo arrays, which, according to Appellant, were designed around Appellant and his brother. As noted by Appellant, these eyewitness identifications were without corroboration.

Echoing Appellant’s arguments, the APA submits that expert testimony does not invade the province of the jury, as such testimony does not go to whether a particular witness is lying, and, moreover, does not give an opinion on the accuracy of a particular witness’ identification. Rather, the expert would speak to objective scientific research and knowledge relating to eyewitness identification. The APA offers that studies suggest that jurors do not abdicate their fact-finding role when presented with expert testimony. Turning to the requirement that the methodology underlying the expert testimony must have general acceptance in the relevant scientific community, the APA submits that extensive research has been conducted on human memory and its limits, as well as inaccurate eyewitness identification, and, thus, the science of eyewitness identification passes the <em>Frye </em>general acceptance test. Finally, the APA notes that researchers have identified numerous factors that impact eyewitness identification, including those areas at issue in this appeal.</p>

Amici offers that a vast majority of states and the federal circuits permit eyewitness identification expert testimony and leave it to the discretion of the trial judge as to whether to admit such evidence.

Further, Amici offers that the admission of expert testimony in this area should be determined on a case-by-case basis, under the same standards applicable to other expert testimony.

The Commonwealth contends that, under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 403, psychological testimony concerning eyewitness testimony is unfairly prejudicial because it invites the jury to abdicate its responsibility. The Commonwealth offers that “credibility” is more than simply whether a witness is lying, but is the quality that makes a witness worthy of belief, including trustworthiness and reliability. Thus, the Commonwealth submits that Appellant’s theory of mistaken identity based upon a witness’s inability to identify a perpetrator directly challenges the witness’s credibility, even though it does not suggest the witness is intentionally lying. Commonwealth’s Brief at 9. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, when properly understood, expert testimony on the reliability of eyewitness testimony constitutes prohibited expert testimony on the credibility of eyewitnesses. Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts that expert testimony that does not address a <em>particular </em>witness’s ability to make an accurate identification improperly shifts the jury’s focus to the credibility of identifications from a class of. witnesses and to the expert assessment of the credibility of eyewitnesses generally. This, the Commonwealth contends, gives the expert an unwarranted appearance of authority on the subject of witness credibility, citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Rather than making jurors more sensitive to identifications of varying quality, the Commonwealth postulates that expert testimony makes jurors skeptical of eyewitness identification, undermining the credibility of both relatively strong and relatively weak eyewitness testimony. Thus, the Commonwealth avers that psychological studies on the issue show that expert testimony on eyewitness reliability is more than twice as likely to cause unfair prejudice to the prosecution as it is to fairly help the jury and that such testimony is more likely to have no effect or cause unfair prejudice to the defendant than to help the jury.

Indeed, the Commonwealth claims that there is no <em>Frye </em>issue in this case. According to the Commonwealth, even if every publication were based on “actual science” and were generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, expert evidence should be excluded under Rule 403 as it will not assist the trier of fact, as it is inherently more prejudicial than probative. While denying their relevance, the Commonwealth argues that the studies on which Appellant relies do not involve or replicate actual crimes with actual victims and eyewitnesses. Watching a video or live-action simulation cannot replicate real life, and, the emotion of being a victim of a violent crime, and, thus, according to the Commonwealth, such studies are unreliable compared to studies of actual cases. Finally, the Commonwealth asserts that admitting expert testimony regarding eyewitness testimony fails to account for the nature of our jury system, and that, rather than the admission of expert testimony, the best way to account for eyewitness credibility is reliance upon the “collective sense and experience” of twelve people who will “bring to their deliberations an array of experiences and views on the issues affecting eyewitness credibility.” Commonwealth Brief at 43. Here, the Commonwealth emphasizes that multiple witnesses identified Appellant both before and at trial, Appellant was able to extensively cross-examine each witness, and after consideration of the circumstances affecting the reliability of the identifications, the jury acquitted Appellant of three of the robberies.</p>

Rather, such testimony teaches — it provides jurors with education by which they assess for themselves the witness’s credibility. In light of demonstrated misconceptions that jurors and other lay persons may possess regarding the infallibility of eyewitness identification, and ideas contrary to “common sense,” such as the correlation between certainty and accuracy, use of expert testimony in appropriate cases will permit jurors to engage in the process of making credibility determinations with full awareness of limitations that eyewitness testimony may present. Moreover, while the Commonwealth claims that expert testimony would speak to a class of witnesses, causing the jury to defer to the expert and to give the expert an unwarranted appearance of authority, the focus is on factors that jurors may be unaware, and will potentially enhance their ability to render a just decision. Indeed, as expressed by the Supreme Court of Utah, “expert testimony does not unfairly favor the defendant by making the jury skeptical of all eyewitnesses.

As discussed below, such testimony would only be permitted where relevant. Pa. R.E. 401. While we need not precisely define such situations, generally speaking, it would be where the Commonwealth’s case is solely or primarily dependent upon eyewitness testimony. Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth’s suggestion that permitting expert testimony would impact thousands of cases, we believe the scope of removing the <em>per se </em>ban on such testimony would be limited, and, again, at the discretion of the trial judge. Second, there is a monetary cost for all tools used to achieve justice, including trial by jury. Moreover, the collective experience of the vast majority of state and federal jurisdictions that permit expert testimony appears to be that the ability to proffer such testimony has not placed an undue burden on the court system, either at trial or on collateral review, and the Commonwealth has cited no specific examples. Finally, the limited use of expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification will allow and may well encourage the <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>Commonwealth to proffer its own experts, but as noted above, if proper, such expert testimony will merely provide the jury with additional knowledge with which the jury can then make a more informed decision.</p>

Importantly, our decision today is limited to this unique area of the law, where, as noted above, the case law from other jurisdictions and the research is compelling.

The trial court determined that the proffered evidence regarding eyewitness identifications had no bearing on whether the eyewitnesses testifying were mistaken in this case. Thus, such testimony, according to the trial court, did not make the fact of the eyewitnesses’ identification more or less probable than without it. According to the trial court, even assuming that the expert’s testimony met the threshold for relevance, the court believed that the probative benefit of such testimony was nominal, as several witnesses identified Appellant, and <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>their encounters with him were more than brief.

Moreover, Appellant was the subject of cross-racial identification, made by witnesses that were under stress, and who were robbed at gunpoint. The police in this appeal did not instruct the witnesses when viewing the array that their assailant may or may not have been included in the array, and finally, while one witness equivocated during her identification of Appellant during the array and lineup, she declared with confidence her identification at trial. Importantly, the trial court’s determination regarding relevancy and probative value were made against the backdrop of our mid-1990s decisions banning such eyewitness identification expert testimony <em>in toto, </em>and without consideration of the authority we discuss above.

The absolute prohibition of such expert testimony simply proves too extreme an approach in determining whether relevant testimony should be admitted in this area. A more flexible framework strikes a crucial balance in determining the admission of expert testimony, as well as between protecting a defendant’s rights while enabling the Commonwealth to meet its responsibility of protection of the public. While the general principles regarding expert testimony offered in <em>Abdul-Salaam, Simmons, </em>and <em>Spence </em>remain valid, the specific holdings in those cases barring expert testimony concerning the specific area of eyewitness identification are inconsistent with our opinion today, and, thus, are so limited. We now allow for the possibility that such expert testimony on the limited issue of eyewitness identification as raised in this appeal may be admissible, at the discretion of the trial court, and assuming the expert is qualified, the proffered testimony relevant, and will assist the trier of fact. Of course, the question of the admission of expert testimony turns not only on the state of the science proffered and its relevance in a particular case, but on whether the testimony will assist the jury. Trial courts will exercise their traditional role in using their discretion to weigh the admissibility of such expert testimony on a case-by-case basis. It will be up to the trial court to determine when such expert testimony is appropriate. If the trial court finds that the testimony satisfies <em>Frye, </em>the inquiry does not end. The admission must be properly tailored to whether the testimony will focus on particular characteristics of the identi<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>fication at issue and explain how those characteristics call into question the reliability of the identification. We find the defendant must make an on-the-record detailed proffer to the court, including an explanation of precisely how the expert’s testimony is relevant to the eyewitness identifications under consideration and how it will assist the jury in its evaluation. The proof should establish the presence of factors (e.g., stress or differences in race, as between the eyewitness and the defendant) which may be shown to impair the accuracy of eyewitness identification in aspects which are (or to a degree which is) beyond the common understanding of laypersons.</p>

What we do is remand for the possibility of a <em>Frye </em>hearing in this matter, leaving open admissibility questions such as relevance and probative value. Indeed, in his dissent, Chief Justice Castille’s characterization of this Court as accepting as “definitive” the research and studies noted above, misapprehends the nature of our determination today. What the dissent does not acknowledge is that an absolute ban on expert testimony is the exception to our otherwise accepted process of allowing expert testimony, where a trial court, in performing its gate-keeping function, deems it to be appropriate. Instead, the advent of DNA evidence, as well as hundreds of studies and the experience of virtually all jurisdictions that have entertained the issue, have highlighted the potential of expert eyewitness identification testimony in certain situations and the possible educational value of expert testimony, rendering the absolute bar on this evidence no longer supportable.

The Commonwealth relies on the Martire and Kemp article to support its argument that the absolute ban against expert evidence concerning eyewitness identification should remain because studies have not confirmed that such testimony results in the jury, in essence, arriving at a correct decision. The Commonwealth's reliance on this article is misplaced. A close review of the Martire and Kemp article undercuts the Commonwealth’s broad claims that expert testimony in this area is unreliable and that we should maintain the absolute ban on such testimony. Specifically, citing the article, the Commonwealth asserts that only "3 of 24 studies have produced any kind of positive result, and only 1 of 24 ... produced a significant positive result.” Commonwealth Sur-Reply Brief at 5. Yet, the authors of the article specifically rejected 21 of the 24 studies reviewed as methodologically unable to accurately test for juror accuracy. Martire and Kemp at 28-29, 31-33. Thus, according to the authors themselves, just three of the studies reviewed employed a methodology which could properly determine juror accuracy; of these three studies, one established that expert testimony can significantly improve a juror's ability to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate eyewitness identifications. According to the authors, the other two studies, which were subject to the peer review process, including the authors’ own 2009 study discussed below, did not provide "evidence that the testimony of an eyewitness expert significantly improved juror ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate identifications.” <em>Id. </em>at 33. Yet, the authors’ earlier conclusion is important: "Further investigations applying this methodology are clearly necessary in order to determine whether the single observed instance of improved [sensitivity to eyewitness accuracy] is the exception or the rule.” <em>Id. </em>at 32. In short, the Martire and Kemp article, another important piece of scholarship in this field, recommends additional study, and does not <em>ipso facto </em>mandate the continued imposition of a ban on expert testimony in this area, especially in light of the experience of virtually all jurisdictions which have considered this issue. Finally, and related thereto, the Martire and Kemp article, to a large extent, relies upon a prior article published by these same authors two years earlier, in which they conclude the impact of expert evidence was not significantly different from that of focused jury instructions. Martire and Kemp, The Impact of Eyewitness Expert Evidence and Judicial Instruction on Juror Ability to Evaluate Eyewitness Testimony, 33 Law and Human Behavior 225, 234 (2009). Thus, based upon the Martire and Kemp articles, the preference for jury instructions proffered in the dissents of Chief Justice Castille and Justice Eakin is potentially called into question.</p>

For similar reasons, a <em>Kloiber </em>instruction would not serve as a sufficient reason to deny categorically the use of expert testimony in appropriate cases. A <em>Kloiber </em>instruction warns jurors that they should receive evidence of eyewitness identification with caution where: "the witness is not in a position to clearly observe the assailant, or he is not positive as to identity, or his positive statements as to identity are weakened by qualification or by failure to identify [the] defendant on one or more prior occasions.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Yet, factors such as cross-racial identification, weapons focus, stress, or correlation between confidence and accuracy of identification are divorced from the compromised position of the witness, his or her lack of positive identification, or any expressed qualification of statements regarding identification. In his dissent, Chief Justice Castille, suggests unspecified revision to the existing <em>Kloiber </em>instruction; yet, for the above-noted reasons, such revisions would entail a complete remaking, rather than a mere reworking, of the instruction.</p>

If one holds to the premise that such information impermissibly intrudes upon the jury’s credibility making function, it is difficult to understand such information, coming from a judge by way of instructions, would have less of an impact on the credibility function of the jury. <em>See </em>Commonwealth Sur-Reply Brief at 15 ("Since the Commonwealth considers defendant’s proffered expert testimony false and misleading, it obviously will not stipulate to his expert's testimony, much less to a judicial endorsement of his expert's testimony”).</p>

      <p id="b542-6" data-blocks='[["BL_542.6",542,[317,775,1120,1374]]]'>Specifically, Chief Justice Castille, and Justice Eakin in his dissent, asserts that modifying the absolute ban will involve monetary costs, including those to the local court system. There are, however, costs to wrongful convictions, not discussed by the dissenters, if the problems regarding eyewitness identifications are not addressed. Indirect costs for wrongful convictions, as noted above, include suffering on the part of the innocent individual and his or her family, and trauma to the victim or witness, due to the guilt of convicting an innocent person. Finally, there is a societal cost when the criminal who perpetrated the crime remains at large with a chance to continue committing crimes. Moreover, Chief Justice Castille, by offering his dire prediction that today's decision will permit "thousands” of violent criminals to "walk away scot-free,” merits little comment, as it fails to give credit to our jurors, our traditional adversarial system, or the limited circumstances in which such testimony may be used, and the 44 states and federal jurisdictions who have permitted expert testimony in this limited area. Related thereto, Chief Justice Castille suggests that our modification to the absolute bar on expert testimony merely benefits the defense bar. Yet, while defense counsel must zealously advocate on behalf of his or her client, the prosecution owes a duty to not only prosecute for the Commonwealth, but also to do justice. An "us-versus-them” perspective regarding the possible allowance of expert testimony in this area improperly discounts the benefit to both defense and prosecution, including, possibly educating jurors about aspects of positive eyewitness identification by a victim and identification of an alternative perpetrator by the defense, as well as the overarching goal of avoiding miscarriages of justice. Indeed, contrary to the dissent’s view, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, courts, and legislatures have begun to recommend a variety of modifications, including the use of expert testimony. <em>See, e.g., </em>Supreme Judicial Court Study Group on Eyewitness Evidence, Report and Recommendation to the Justices, <em>supra </em>(study group comprised of judges, police officials, academics, and prosecutors setting forth various recommendations to Supreme Court of Massachusetts regarding eyewitness identification, including the use of expert testimony at trial).</p>

I am also skeptical, in the absence of any record demonstration and testing of the “science” proffered here, because the science happens to dovetail so nicely with the preferences of the criminal defense position.

It appears that the Majority’s analysis largely follows lockstep the conclusions of other courts, with scant substantive evaluation of the “scientific” literature itself, resulting in a paucity of support for the Majority’s ultimate legal determination. The Majority begins its analysis by correctly noting that our existing ban of expert testimony regarding eyewitness reliability rests on the experience-based notion that such testimony creates an “unwarranted appearance of authority invading the province of the jury’s credibility determination,” and that there exist “alternative means of challenging the reliability of eyewitness testimony[.]” Majority Op. at 475, 92 A.3d at 781. The Majority then asserts that “science” has changed everything, because our prior precedent “did not consider or mention the advent of scientific research on the issue of reliability of eyewitness testimony or the experience of other jurisdictions on this topic. Thus ... it is important to recognize the considerable empirical research that has been conducted regarding eyewitness identification,” as well as the extra jurisdictional decisional law admitting expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 92 A.3d at 781.</p>

But, how does this “science” promise to enhance the search for reliability? And, does the Majority’s framing of the appropriate manner in which the expert testimony should proceed better ensure reliability? As always, the <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>devil is in the details — details not subjected to factual examination below and not fully appreciated by the Majority here.</p>

The impressively labeled “empirical research” touted by the Majority references studies about how people respond to a variety of stimuli <em>(e.g., </em>the studies seek to assess the accuracy of human memory under stress, or in the presence of a weapon, etc.); the articles try to create a bridge from the research and into the courtroom by explaining the expert’s role of assisting the jury to carry out its truth-determining function when an eyewitness has encountered these stimuli.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> The research no doubt supports the idea that there exist “an array of variables that are most likely to lead to a mistaken identification” — most trial lawyers and judges could tell you that. But, does the empirical research demonstrate the effectiveness of expert testimony at educating jurors in such a way that they will be better able to determine which identifications are reliable and which are not? It is on this point that there is a clear disconnect between the research the Majority embraces and the solution proposed within these articles, which the Majority accepts as grounded in settled scientific research.</p>

Rather, the question is whether the proffered expert testimony does anything to rectify this issue, in other words to ensure that identifications are more reliable. Surely, the point is not to convince juries to distrust <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>all identifications, for the proffered “science” does not and cannot say that.

Proponents of admitting expert testimony in these cases explain that “[tjypically, eyewitness experts are prepared to testify in court about the extent to which the research literature explains how a particular factor, considered alone or in combination with others, likely would affect the reliability of an identification.” Richard S.

The science is grounded in negativity: at its essence is the concern that identifications are wrong or unreliable, and here are the reasons why they may be. But, there obviously are manifold instances of accurate identifications notwithstanding the stress factors the experts identify. How is such negative data, generically explained as the Majority proposes, supposed to help jurors separate the reliable from the unreliable? Are the experts, in their supposed roles as independent “educators” of the jury, as familiar with studies about positive factors as negative ones? Have studies of that type even been conducted? The authors cited by the Majority paint a noticeably one-sided picture.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> Although the Majority claims that it can “envision” how this would proceed in our courts, I remain skeptical.</p>

The Majority then proceeds to identify fifty-four jurisdictions (forty-four states and ten federal circuits) that have allowed this testimony, yet fails to independently evaluate any of the research itself because, I suppose, it hopes or assumes that <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>someone along the way knuckled down and did the hard work. <em>Id. </em>at 782-83 (stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Supreme Court of Connecticut engaged in an “encyclopedic review of [the] topic” in <em>State v.

I understand the attraction of the lemmings to the sea approach, but I also try to keep in mind the cliff awaiting — especially in a case where we have no factual development and findings below, and the Commonwealth here has contested the issue. I also appreciate that the “science” can change and evolve as other studies are conducted, and as prosecution authorities come to realize the effect of the new evidence. It is notable that the Majority only once, and then parenthetically, alludes to research that may show whether expert testimony in this area may actually assist the trier of fact in distinguishing reliable from unreliable identifications. Majority Op. at 478, 92 A.3d at 783 (citing the Utah Supreme Court in <em>Clopten, supra). </em>But, a review of the <em>Clopten </em>court’s actual analysis reveals a grand total of three sentences dedicated to the subject,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> followed by a citation to a near-twenty-year-old book by psychologists Brian L.

There is still a compelling concern that a potentially persuasive expert testifying as to the generalities of the inaccuracies and unreliability of eyewitness observations, that are already within a juror’s common knowledge and experience, will greatly influence the jury more than the evidence presented at trial. By merely being labeled as a specialist in eyewitness identifications, an expert has the broad ability to mislead a jury through the “education” process into believing a certain factor in an eyewitness identification makes that identification less reliable than it truly is. Moreover, expert testimony on eyewitness identifications can be more prejudicial than probative because it focuses on the things that produce error without reference to those factors that improve the accuracy of identifications. The expert testimony presumes a misidentification, in the absence of presenting factors which support the validity of the identification. This fosters a disbelief of eyewitnesses by jurors.</blockquote>

Moreover, the question of whether every negative factor of concern to researchers interested in mistaken identification is -within the jury’s common knowledge does little to dispel the likelihood that this expert testimony will do more harm than good in assisting a jury to distinguish reliable from unreliable identifications. Notably, the Commonwealth here contends that the American Psychological Association (“APA”), in their <em>amicus </em>brief, selectively ignore more modern studies that show that expert testimony on eyewitness reliability increases juror skepticism and juror confusion, and that such testimony “is more than twice as likely to cause unfair prejudice to the prosecution as it is to fairly help the jury.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 16-17 &amp; n. 16 (citing Martire &amp; Kemp, <em>supra </em>).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a> The parties obviously view the literature in this area very differently; there are obvious strategic, political, and litigation interests implicated, and we have had no hearing to sort through the issues.

The Majority declares that this inability “is especially true when cross-examining a neutral, credible, and confident witness before a jury, which may overestimate the veracity and reliability of eyewitness identification” and baldly asserts that “such information would not be within the permissible scope of cross-examination.” Majority Op. at 483, 92 A.3d at 786 (citing Jules Epstein, <em>The Great Engine That Couldn’t: Science, Mistaken Identity, and the Limits of Cross-Examination, </em><a href="/citations/?q=36%20Stetson%20L.%20Rev.%20727" class="citation" data-index="260" data-cite="36 Stetson L.

Majority Op. at 486-87, 92 A.3d at 788.

But, of course, the Commonwealth cannot appeal an acquittal, so the law will develop in only one direction. Moreover, what room is there for a <em>Frye </em>hearing? The Majority has already rendered its verdict on the “science”; trial judges are no more vested with discretion to ignore the Court’s verdict on the science today than they were vested with discretion to ignore <em>Simmons </em>yesterday.

I am reminded of the observation of the Chief Justice of the United States, a renowned appellate advocate before his ascent to the bench: "Pick up a copy of any law review that you see and the first article is likely to be, you know, the influence of Immanuel Kant on evidentiary approaches in 18th-century Bulgaria, or something, which I’m sure was of great interest to the academic that wrote it, but isn’t of much help to <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>the bar.” Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts, Jr., Interview at Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Annual Conference, June 25, 2011, available at <em>http://www.cspanvideo.org/progmm/FourthCi. </em>Even with less arcane subjects, the potential difficulty with law review articles rests itself in human nature: many professors devote their time and energy to projects they care deeply about and, lawyers being lawyers, few are truly "neutral” when writing to "hot topics” of the day. Primers to assist one side of a debate or another on a legal issue are not necessarily the most reliable of sources for tribunals.</p>

While there are evolving studies about identification testimony, I believe the more prudent course would be to recognize such concerns through enhanced jury instructions from the court, rather than authorizing a testimonial battle of opinions from experts.

Indeed, if the witness is not recognized as having the appearance of authority, the witness is not qualified to opine in the first place. The jurors will learn the witness’s opinion is given to them because the court believes the witness knows more about identification than they do. Such recognized-as-authoritative testimony will necessarily and impermissibly intrude upon their role as the sole arbiter of witness credibility— testimony about “characteristics” of the identification and “explaining” how this affects other evidence tautologically invades the jury’s function. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Apparently the witness will say, “Here are some things that ‘call into question the reliability of the identification’ — but I’m not really giving you my opinion the testimony is wrong.” The expert, <em>by definition, </em>is a witness called to express an opinion, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 702, and the way to “call into question” another person’s testimony is by giving an opinion.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[284,645,1154,571]]]'>The majority minimizes the practical effect of this ruling, rejecting the suggestion that thousands of cases will be impacted. Given the number of criminal cases filed in Pennsylvania each year, “thousands” is in fact a realistic, and not insignificant, number. The majority also brushes aside the expense as the cost of doing business, which is easier to say when we are not paying the bill. But such cost is not irrelevant to the client, or the defenders and prosecutors of our local court systems, which must pay the new experts, pay for their reports, pay for their appearance at the required <em>Frye </em>hearings, and pay them for their appearance at trial.</p>
    <p id="b562-6" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[284,1239,1151,679]]]'>It may be true the impact of allowing such testimony has not resulted in appellate complaints around the country, but, realistically, the actual cost, in time and money, is never going to be an appealable issue litigated at the appellate level. Nor can an appellate court really appreciate the impact on a jury. It is at the trial level where this reality will exist and where the non-esoteric side of this will be evident. Indeed, the only time this Court is likely to confront the issue is on collateral review. While such issues are recognized by the majority, they are not discussed, yet in every case of identification it will of course be ineffectiveness for defense counsel to fail to call such a witness now — what reasonable strategy is advanced by failing to do so?</p>

Yet, if such testimony does not invade the province of the jury and will assist the jury in understanding matters beyond its ken (a predicate for allowing such testimony), then it will also be admissible as direct evidence, just like other <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>forensic opinions, such as ballistics, fingerprints, DNA, or the like. The prosecution will be able to bolster its case-in-chief with an expert opining why the identification witnesses are credible. And if experts may opine about identification, why would they not be equally admissible on other peripheral matters, such as witness recollections of time, dates, places, colors, types of cars, clothes, directions, and a host of matters which any given witness is likely to confuse? There being no logical difference, likening this decision to the camel’s nose under the tent is not an exaggeration.</p>

That course is to revise and enhance the standard jury instructions on identification evidence. If current sociological studies<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> have identified factors that may affect identification, such can be append<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ed to existing instructions from the court. There are already comprehensive proposals that would accomplish this; in fact, there are proposed jury instructions for Pennsylvania, drafted with the participation of the very Dr. Loftus mentioned favorably by the majority and cited by Justice Brennan. This is, in my judgment, a better path, educating the jury without starting a war of hired doyens attacking each other’s opinion, and more significantly, attacking the veracity of witnesses and victims of crime. We have finally recognized the judicial system should not victimize these citizens again — let us not subject them to being publically discredited, their testimony given under oath torn down in view of all by specialists hired for the singular purpose of “calling into question” what the witnesses have said was true.</p>

Can we not avoid the attack on the witness by the less-than-impartial advocacy of those whose studies give them a point of view that lead to their hiring in the first place? After all, no defendant will hire someone whose opinion confirms an identification, nor will the prosecution present someone who disputes the eyewitness — and surely there will be experts willing to opine in favor of whatever side wishes to employ them.</p>
