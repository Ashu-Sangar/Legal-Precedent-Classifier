The Commonwealth noted that Appellee, in his motion for such an expert, did not allege that the police had influenced or coerced him to give a false confession. Commonwealth’s Motion to Exclude Defense Expert in False Confession and for a <em>Frye </em>Hearing on the Admissibility of Said Expert,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> filed 6/6/07, at ¶¶ 3, 12. The Commonwealth averred that the determination of whether an individual falsely confessed to a crime is within the jury’s own ability to evaluate. In addition, the Commonwealth argued that expert testimony regarding the phenomenon of false confessions in general, proffered in order to give rise to the inference that Appellee’s confession must also be false, would undermine the fact-determining process because such testimony would be based on mere speculation. <em>Id. </em>at ¶ 12. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asked the court to deny Appellee’s motion as not relevant because the jury was capable of assessing whether the evidence established that non-police sources might have influenced Appellee to confess falsely.</p>

Dr. Leo then explained police interrogation as a two-step psychological process: the first step is to convince the suspect that he or she is caught and denial is futile, and the second step is to motivate the suspect to believe that it is in his or her best interest to make a full confession. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46. Dr. Leo testified that there are two different types of false confessions that may result from police interrogation: 1) a “compliant” false confession in which a suspect is psychologically coerced to lie, knowingly giving a false confession in order to end the interrogation and perhaps to be treated more leniently; and 2) a “persuaded” or “internalized” false confession in which a suspect confesses to a crime under the belief that he or she did in fact commit the crime although he or she has no memory of doing so.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> N.T., 6/17/08, at 50-52.</p>

Second, in terms of the specifics of this case, Dr. Leo would discuss the specific interrogation techniques he discerned from interviewing Appellee about what took place during his interrogation, and identify any possible risks of false confession posed by those techniques.

We followed them around the corner to the café on Rising Sun Ave. where all this happened. When we got to the café, Angel peeped in the window to make sure that the guys were in there. Angel says they are in there so we go in. Angel went in first then everyone else. I went in last and stayed by the door. Everybody just started fighting, tables and chairs started flying. I started to back up and as I did that, I pulled a gun out of my waist. I pointed it at the guys and told them to stop throwing chairs. The guy threw another chair and the gun went off. Everybody started running; one guy was trying to run to the back door and I fired two shots at the door while he was running. After that I ran out of the place. I ran to my right and up Clarkson. As I was running, I heard someone say “drop the weapon”. I thought it was the Police, so I dropped the gun and kept running. Then I just went home.</blockquote>

In this regard, I believe <em>Walker </em>represents an exercise in judicial modesty. After <em>Walker, </em>no longer will we intone that jurors’ life experience and common sense will necessarily guide them to the truth when the essential inquiry encompasses understanding the complex subjects of perception and memory. Rather, in appropriate cases — where the science is sound and the evidence is deemed probative and necessary — we will not inflexibly block litigants’ attempts to educate jurors about matters we are learning may be further from the realm of everyday experience than our predecessors had envisioned.</p>

    <p id="b497-4" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[166,505,1154,1067]]]'>I realize there are costs associated with moving beyond holding that everyday experience and common sense alone are sufficient to effectuate justice in cases requiring crucial judgments relative to eyewitness testimony and the behavior of those subject to interrogation. As the Commonwealth observes, the strategic use of expert testimony in litigation invites a counter-presentation and may make the prosecution’s task of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt more difficult. Nevertheless, the alternative of blanket exclusion of relevant evidence based upon unanalyzed assumptions about juror capabilities, even as these assumptions are challenged by demonstrations of wrongful convictions and developing behavioral science, is no longer satisfactory from my viewpoint. <em>Cf.
