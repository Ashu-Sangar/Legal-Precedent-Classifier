With that right of refusal came the statutory employer doctrine, which gave employees the ability to receive workers’ compensation benefits from, in the most common scenarios, a general contractor when the injured worker’s employer, the subcontractor, elected not to carry workers’ compensation coverage. However, even general contractors could refuse to elect to provide coverage for a subcontractor’s employees, so long as prominent notice was provided in the workplace, but, “[i]t soon became clear that only foolish contractors would reject the Act in this fashion, since acceptance of workers’ compensation financial responsibility provided concomitant immunity to common law negligence claims, pursuant to Section 303.... ” Richard M.

As a former member of this Court cogently noted, “[i]n reality, application of [the 1974] amendments rarely, if ever, will result in the general contractor assuming responsibility for providing workers’ compensation insurance because in the modern construction workplace, general contractors will rarely, if ever, award a contract absent the subcontractor showing proof of workers’ compensation coverage.” <em>Fonner v.

In that same light, the subcontractor, more often than not, a small “mom and pop” business like Patton Construction, which did nothing wrong, would obtain a right of subrogation against the negligent general contractor, assigning blame where it belongs and reducing the small business’s cost of workers’ compensation insurance. Finally, it would help to ensure safety in the workplace, and hopefully lead to the prevention of tragic accidents due to someone’s carelessness (as seen in the instant case), by incentivizing general contractors to adopt more rigorous safety regimes.</p>
