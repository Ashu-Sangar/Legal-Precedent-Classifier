On March 16, <em>1949, </em>petitioner conveyed all of lot 15 and a triangular portion of lot 14 to Helen V. Poster, after he had constructed a dwelling thereon. The total area conveyed Avas 20,130 square feet. A portion of lot 14 was included in the conveyance in order to comply with the 20,000 square feet required by the Zoning Ordinance. Petitioner retained title to a rectangular portion of lot 14 containing an area of 12,448.42 square feet, or approximately 62% of the area required for a residence under the ordinance. • ■</p>
