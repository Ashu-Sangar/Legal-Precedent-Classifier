His will, which he had executed in 1932 while married, was rendered largely inoperative because of the effect of his subsequent divorce on his testamentary dispositions to his wife. He left surviving him two children who, by reason of the exclusion of their mother, became the accelerated and sole legatees in equal shares under their father’s will. One of the children, a daughter, is an adult; the other is a minor son of whose estate Fidelity <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>Trust Company, of Pittsburgh, the executor, is testamentary guardian.</p>

The insured had originally named his wife as the beneficiary of the policy, but after their divorce he had made his children the beneficiaries with his father as contingent beneficiary. However, on July 9, 1951, just ten days before his death, he initiated a further change of beneficiary as per the following requested endorsement: “If married and living with my wife, payable to her. If not married or estranged, to my estate.” He died without having remarried. The Veterans’ Administration recognized the insured’s estate as the beneficiary of the National Service policy and paid the proceeds to his executor. Without the proceeds of the insurance policy, the decedent’s estate was insolvent.</p>

The evident purpose of the foregoing provision was to make the payment of benefits under a National Service policy of insurance exempt from claims of creditors either before or after receipt of the proceeds by the beneficiary. And, where the beneficiary was the insured’s estate, the creditors excluded would, of course, be the insured’s creditors.</p>

We can find no logical basis for this conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[261,702,1148,923]]]'>The Veterans Acts from 1917 onward have evidenced a congressional intent to exempt, from the claims of creditors of the insured and of the beneficiary, the benefits of a military service insurance policy. The history of the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, which is the statute that authorized insurance, under government auspices, for members of the Country’s military forces in World War II, closely paralleled the history of its predecessor, the War Risk Insurance Act of October 6, 1917, c. 105, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Stat.%20398" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="40 Stat. 398">40 Stat. 398</a>, which provided for term insurance for members of the Nation’s military forces in World War I. The decisions under the earlier Act and its amendments are no less pertinent to the question here involved under the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940. A review of the history and experience of both Acts is therefore essential.</p>

Approximately a year after the cessation of hostilities with the signing of the armistice on November 11,1918, Congress amended the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917 by enlarging the class of permitted beneficiaries, adding thereto certain specified collaterals and providing further that, if there was no person within the permitted class of beneficiaries, the insurance should be paid to the estate of the insured: Act of December 24,1919, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Stat.%20371" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="41 Stat. 371">41 Stat. 371</a>.</p>

This Act, known as the World War Veterans Act, provided, inter alia, that “the compensation, insurance, and maintenance and support allowance” payable under the various Veterans Acts should not be subject to the “claims of creditors of any person to whom an award is made” under the provisions of such Acts. Also, Section 301 of the Act of 1924 required that all existing term insurance of veterans should be converted to government insurance by July 2, 1926. The date of conversion was thereafter successively extended to July 2, 1927.</p>

By that amendment, all restrictions with respect to the class of permitted beneficiaries of converted term insurance were removed. Thenceforth, practically all veterans term insurance that was converted to United States Government life insurance was unlimited as to permitted beneficiaries. The legislative history of the Act of 1928 so confirms: see Report No. 1297, 70th Cong., 1st Sess., Congressional Record Vol. 69, Part 6, p. 6575.

Subsequently, the Code of Federal Regulations interpreted §454a as meaning that “The proceeds of a United States Government life insurance policy shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of the insured or creditors of any beneficiary to whom the proceeds may be awarded . . .”: 38 Code of Federal Regulations §10.3062 (1938 Ed.).</p>

In an exhaustive and well-reasoned opinion the surrogate held that the proceeds of a deceased veteran’s government policy paid to his administrator were exempt from claims of creditors of the decedent. The opinion discussed and considered the effect of the decision in <em>Pagel v. Pagel </em>and concluded that the pointed alteration by §454a of the <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>limited language in §454 “must be deemed a demonstration of an intention [on the part of Congress] to alter the law as thus declared” in <em>Pagel v. Pagel. </em>In <em>Haley v. United States, </em><a href="/f-supp/46/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="46 F. Supp. 4" data-case-ids="4206902" data-case-paths="/f-supp/46/0004-01">46 F. Supp. 4</a> (1942), which involved a matured War Risk insurance policy, the insured had named himself as beneficiary, and the proceeds of the policy were paid to his personal representative. The court, in reliance on the decision in <em>In Re McCormick’s Estate, </em>held that the insurance money was exempt from the claims of creditors, administrative expenses and attorney’s fees. The most recent case in point is <em>In Re Frazier’s Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=124%20N.Y.S.2d%20295" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="124 N.Y.S.2d 295">124 N.Y.S. 2d 295</a>, 297, <a href="/misc/204/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="204 Misc. 542" data-case-ids="976975" data-case-paths="/misc/204/0542-01">204 Misc. 542</a> (1953). In that case the deceased veteran had a policy of National Service Life insurance the proceeds whereof became payable to his estate upon his death in 1950. A claim was filed against the insured’s estate for moneys advanced out of public funds for past support of the deceased veteran. The court held that the proceeds of the National Service Life insurance policy were exempt by virtue of §454a from claims of creditors of the decedent even though the particular creditor asserting the claim was an agency of the State and, under local law, a preferred creditor. The court said, inter alia, that “It is clearly the intention of the government that the proceeds of War Risk Insurance shall be payable to those <em>dependents </em>and <em>relatives </em>of the veteran whom he would have preferred to receive them, exempt from the claims of any creditor and it appears that the act as now effective [since §454a] secures this result.”</p>

It is our opinion that in the various Acts relating to the insurance of veterans, both under the War Risk Insurance Act of 1917 and the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940, Congress clearly indicated an intent that the proceeds of a matured policy of veterans’ insurance should be exempt from <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>claims of creditors of the insured. Such intent was not retracted in the slightest degree <em>by </em>the 1946 amendment which removed the restrictions on the class of permissible beneficiaries. The 1946 amendment was not concerned with the abrogation or even limitation of the benefit of exemption from claims of creditors. In short, there was no relationship between the legislative provisions concerning the designation of beneficiaries and the provision of §454a exempting the proceeds of a National Service Life insurance policy from the claims of creditors.</p>
