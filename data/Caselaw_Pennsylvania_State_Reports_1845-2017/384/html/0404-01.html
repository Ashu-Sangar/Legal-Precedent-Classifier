IT. Lasher granting to the latter an exclusive right to strip mine the flint clay on the land, which “lease” was assigned by J. H. Lasher to defendant Cresson Hills, Inc. J. H. Lasher is the president of Cresson Hills, Inc. and his son, Humes T. Lasher, is the secretary and treasurer. Cresson Hills, Inc. contracted with defendants Solley and Arnold to remove the overburden and actually mine the clay. At the point where Solley and Arnold began to remove the overburden on the Hiles’ land, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>there is a steep hill and the highway cuts across the side of this hill. Operating on the lower side of the highway, Solley and Arnold pushed the strata over the clay down the hill and away front the highway by means of bulldozers. After a few days’ work, cracks appeared in the highway and it subsided about two feet. The berm and guard rail subsided also and slid partway down the hill. The stripping was stopped before any clay had been removed from the tract.</p>

Highways to do so. If the owner fails to restore the highway, the subsidence is declared a public nuisance ■ which can be abated by appropriate proceedings in law or equity. Section 419 of the Act then goes on to say: “If such owner fails or refuses to provide for the restoration and replacement of the highway, then the department may proceed with such restoration and replacement, and the underlying owners of the subjacent or adjacent strata, both at the time the vertical or lateral support was removed and at the time the subsidence occurred, and their respective assignees, lessees or grantees shall be jointly and severally liable for the cost of restoration.”.</p>

In the <em>Panhandle Mining Company </em>case, the Commonwealth sued to recover the cost of repairing a portion of a State highway which subsided due to mining operations performed by defendant’s predecessor in title. We held the defendant not liable, quoting, at p. 19, the following rule from the lower court’s <em>opinion: “c. . . </em>Before the Commonwealth could recover in a case of this kind, it must aver and prove that the owner whose premises abutted on the highway has actually mined the coal that caused the damage complained of, and that such mining was the proximate cause of the subsidence of the surface. . .’ However, subsequent legislation now before us for consideration changed the law as above pronounced.</p>

The lease was for a term of one year with an option on the part of the lessee to renew for a like term.

Cresson Hills, Inc. likewise is covered-by the same provision since, being owner of the clay in the ground, it is an OAvner of the adjacent strata' and Accordingly obligated" for the restoration. This section' of the Act further provides that if such owner fails 'to restore the highway, then thé Commonwealth <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>may proceed with such restoration and the underlying owners of the subjacent or adjacent strata, together with “their respective assignees, lessees or grantees”, are jointly and severally liable for the cost. The Hiles, by owning all of the land except for the clay, and Cresson Hills, Inc., by owning the clay itself, are both owners of the adjacent strata within the meaning of the statute, and therefore are jointly and severally liable for the cost of restoration. In addition, Cresson Hills, Inc., by the purchase of the clay, is a “grantee” of the Hiles, the owners in fee of the land adjoining the highway in question. Section 419 of the State Highway Law, by changing the law so that a lessor of a mineral deposit is now jointly and severally liable for the cost of restoring a State highway damaged through mining operations performed by his lessee, insured that at least the value of the adjoining land would be available to indemnify the Commonwealth for the cost of repairs.</p>
