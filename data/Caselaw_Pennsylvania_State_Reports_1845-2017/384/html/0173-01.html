There is but one legal estate, which, by a long course of judicial decisions, has been buttressed against inroads attempted either by the parties themselves or by their individual creditors. Thus, a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, under a judgment against the husband, does not acquire any right to possession, joint or exclusive, during the life of the wife: McCurdy and Stevenson v. Canning, <a href="/pa/64/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="64 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1021236" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0039-01">64 Pa. 39</a>. Where there is a judgment against the husband, the surviving wife takes the property free of it, nor can a <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>tenancy by entireties be changed into one in common by any act or deed of the parties so long as they remain the owners of the property and the marriage relation continues: Hetzel v. Lincoln, <a href="/pa/216/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="216 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="950325" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0060-01">216 Pa. 60</a>. A trustee in bankruptcy of the husband is not entitled, during the life of the wife, to any part of the principal or income of the estate: Meyer’s Estate (No. 1), <a href="/pa/232/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="232 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="977841" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0089-01">232 Pa. 89</a>. The wife’s enjoyment of the property cannot be restricted in order that the husband’s creditors may be protected: Meyer’s Estate (No. 2), <a href="/pa/232/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="232 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="977820" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0095-01">232 Pa. 95</a>. The husband’s trustee in bankruptcy cannot restrain the husband and wife from alienating the property: Weiss v. Beihl, <a href="/pa/232/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="232 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="977847" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0097-01">232 Pa. 97</a>.</p>

They could not have attached it or his interest in it. It could have been conveyed by him and his wife so as to be forever beyond their reach. They could seize upon it only if, on the death of the wife, it had not been conveyed and the husband survived. He was not under a legal duty to see that this possible interest was preserved for the benefit of his creditors. The situation is wholly dissimilar from the more familiar one where the owner of property which is subject to the claims of creditors conveys it away in an attempt to free it from that liability. It is not a fraud in contemplation of law to deprive one of that to which he has no right.”</p>

    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[243,446,1156,1274]]]'>• In the equity case, the plaintiff sought to impress against Robert M. Lewis and his wife, jointly, his judgment against Robert M. Lewis, individually. I agree that a general liability cannot be so imposed notwithstanding the wife stood by and tacitly, if not culpably, saw her husband obtain $2,500 from the plaintiff as a part payment on. the aborted auction sale of the Lewis’ hotel property, owned by them by the entireties, as the. property of the husband, individually. That $2,500,-by diverse transfers, was used by the Houtzdale Bank to satisfy a mortgage, in like amount, of the Lewises jointly on the hotel property. In other words, Mrs. Lewis and her husband have wrongfully received the benefit of the plaintiff’s $2,500 which he is unable to collect from the husband alone out of the jointly held hotel property. In my opinion, the facts present a clear case of unjust enrichment of both Mrs. Lewis and her husband for which the plaintiff’s judgment against Lewis should be reformed so as to be against Lewis and his wife, jointly, with the lien thereof limited to the hotel property. This would be in accordance with equitable principles and a specific prayer of the bill of complaint.</p>
