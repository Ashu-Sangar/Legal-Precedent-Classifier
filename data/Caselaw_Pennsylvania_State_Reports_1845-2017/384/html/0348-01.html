An affirmation of that order by the New York Court of Appeals was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States: <em>Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, Commissioner of Education of New York, </em><a href="/us/343/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="343 U.S. 495" data-case-ids="11340482" data-case-paths="/us/343/0495-01">343 U.S. 495</a>. The appellant there argued that the statute was a violation of the right of free speech, and also that the term “sacrilegious” was so vague and indefinite as to constitute a denial of due process. The court held (p. 502) that “expression by means of motion pictures is included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,” but hastened to add (pp. 502, 503) that “It does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and all places. . . Nor does it follow that motion pictures are necessarily subject to the precise rules governing any other particular method of expression.” While the Court stated (p. 503) that “This Court recognized many years ago that ... a previous restraint is a form <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned,” it apparently did not base its decision on that ground but on tbe conclusion that the term “sacrilegious” did not provide a sufficiently definite standard for the guidance of a censor and therefore vested in him an almost unlimited restraining control over motion pictures. The Court’s opinion ends with the statement (pp. 505, 506) that “Since the term ‘sacrilegious’ is the sole standard under attack here, it is not necessary for us to decide, for example, whether a state may censor motion pictures under a clearly drawn statute designed and applied to prevent the showing of obscene films. That is a very different question from the one now before us. We hold only that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments a state may not ban a film on the basis of a censor’s conclusion that it is ‘sacrilegious.’ ” In a concurring opinion Mr. Justice Reed emphasized this limited scope of the decision by saying (pp. 506, 507) “Assuming that a state may establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, <em>an issue not foreclosed by the Court’s opinion, </em>our duty requires us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored.”</p>

As we view it, the United States Supreme Court has not <em>ipso facto </em>taken away all community control of moving pictures by censorship, and this court will not do so under the claim of complete unconstitutionality of censorship laws.” The court held that while the criteria by which films were to be judged under the terms of the statute could doubtless have been made more definite their connotation was sufficiently clear to permit of their valid enforcement.</p>

A picture had been rejected by the authorities on the ground that it was “immoral” and “would tend to corrupt morals.” The Court said (p. 346, N.E. p. 507) that “Viewing the statute under consideration in its proper setting . . . <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>the words ‘immoral’ and ‘tend to corrupt morals’ as used therein relate to standards of sexual morality.

However, Chief Justice Wexgandt dissented, saying (p. 269, N.E. p. 772) that “The basic difference of opinion among the <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>members of this court is whether the federal Supreme Court has in fact held the Ohio statutes unconstitutional. The conclusion of the majority seems to be that this has been done inferentially. It is the view of the minority that if, at a time when delinquency — both juvenile and adult — is a problem of unprecedented concern, the federal Supreme Court intends to hold that every film, no matter how obscene, profane, inflammatory or subversive can be shown, this is too serious a matter to be left to mere inference alone.”</p>

The Court, after reviewing and discussing the decisions of the United States Supreme Court hereinbefore referred to, concluded that they were not intended to invalidate all film censorship but were to be interpreted as holding merely that the standards employed in the statutes there under consideration were so broad or vaguely drawn as to sanction the suppression of some films which might not constitutionally be censored. The Court held that the term “obscene” had a sufficiently precise meaning to describe a class of films which the State might validly suppress. It further held that the term “immoral” in the ordinance must be construed as referring to that which is immoral because it is obscene, and accordingly determined that the Commissioner’s refusal to issue a permit on the ground that the picture was “immoral and Obscene” was not invalid on any ground of unconstitutionality or otherwise.</p>

The Court, reviewing the decisions of the United States Supreme Court previously referred to, held that the provision of the act in question was void on its face as a prior restraint on the freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and added that it was not necesary to determine whether it was also void for indefiniteness under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

      <em>us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case </em>to determine whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored. <em>This film </em>does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view.”</p>
    <p id="b415-3" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[169,711,1149,775]]]'>The Supreme Court also said in the <em>Burstyn </em>case that: “It does not follow that the Constitution requires absolute freedom to exhibit every motion picture of every kind at all times and at all places .... Nor does if follow that motion pictures are necessarily subject to' the precise rules governing any other particular method of expression.” The Majority Opinion here cites this quotation but declines to apply it to the situation before us. So far as the Majority Opinion is concerned, the vilest motion picture devised may not be censored in Pennsylvania and it may not be kept out of movie houses attended by children. This is indeed a deplorable state of affairs and cannot be passed over with a shrug of robed shoulders.</p>

After the decision of the Majority will have been handed down, those same shameful, shameless, degrading films may be projected anywhere in Pennsylvania publicly, the distributors and exhibitors being subject only, <em>after the showing, </em>to the penalty provided under criminal law. In the meantime, however, grievous harm will have been done. At the hearing before Judge Lewis, the following ..significant colloquy occurred between the attorney for Hallmark and the Court: “The Court: Well, you have to examine :it [the film]-.sometime ..or other... Do. you mean to show it first, and then censor if? Mr,.

Damage is done at the very first exhibition of the film. There are theatres in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia which accommodate as many as 4,000 patrons for one show. If a picture should last but one day, many thousands would nevertheless have seen it by the time it is withdrawn from circulation. That is why reason dictates that control over immoral films must be found in prevention and not in subsequent punishment.</p>

The net result of the action of the Board of Censors, sitting as a tribunal of inquiry and review, is, therefore, to enjoin a nuisance. Thus, there can be no legitimate complaint that owners and distributors of questionable films are being denied due process of law, especially in view of the fact that appeals to the courts are always in order.</p>

A good citizen not only does not object but is happy for the fact that someone far more skilled than he determines whether the can of peaches he opens or the box of pills he obtains at the drug store is free of poisonous and deleterious ingredients. A worthy member of society, who is just as much concerned about mental purity as he is over bodily cleanliness, is grateful that the government which protects him from contact with physical contagion will also save him from association with moral trash and garbage. No one can sensibly object to the regulation by municipal authorities over the use of public highways, parks, streams, tunnels and buildings. The streets of a city cannot be used for immoral purposes.

However, there is nothing vague or uncertain about the words, “obscene,” “indecent,” and “immoral.” There is nothing ambiguous about “debasement and corruption of morals.” Any citizen with a fairly good education, excellent character, good religious upbringing, social consciousness and devotion to the ideals of democracy, can pass with satisfactory results on whether certain motion pictures are moral and proper. The Board is made up of three persons appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate, all of whom are charged by the Constitution with fidelity to the welfare of the Commonwealth. Competence and reliability in the board members can, therefore, fairly be assured. If, however, the Board should be unduly uncritical, one way or the other, in its appraisal of pictures, there is always an appeal to the courts for correction of error. It is thus inexplicable why this Court should deprive the people of the pro<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>tection of motion picture censors, whose action can only be helpful and never hurtful to the people.</p>

The Statutory Construction Act of 1937, May 28, P. L. 1019, Art. IV, Sec. 55 (46 PS §555), provides that: “The provisions of every law shall be severable. If any provision of a law is found by a court of record to be unconstitutional and void, the remaining provisions of the law shall, nevertheless, remain valid, unless the court finds the valid provision, of the law are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision, that it cannot be presumed the Legislature would have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete or incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.”</p>

Why then does the Majority outlaw the provisions of the Act which <em>are </em>constitutional? We said in <em>Rutenberg v. </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/329/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="329 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="1181393" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0026-01">329 Pa. 26</a>, 39, that: “It is elementary that a statute may be in part constitutional and in part unconstitutional, and in the event that the various parts of the statute are independent of each other, that which is constitutional will prevail and that which is unconstitutional will be rejected ...

Meyerle, supra, it was said, <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>(p. 265) : 'The constitutional and the unconstitutional provisions may even be contained in the same section of the law, and yet be perfectly distinct and separable, so that the former may stand though the latter falls.’ ”</p>

The standards of what constitutes indecency and immorality are not so inextricably interwoven with those of sacrilegiousness that they cannot stand alone. We said further in the <em>Ruteriberg </em>case: “The test of sever-ability may be stated in simple terms as follows: after the invalid portion of the act has been stricken out, whether that which remains is self-sustaining and is capable of separate enforcement without regard to that portion of the statute which has been cast aside. If this be true the statute should be sustained to the extent of that which remains.”</p>
