Mrs. Allen, the testatrix, left her residuary-estate in trust to pay the income to her sister for life and in the event that her sister survived her, then upon her sister’s death, should Eleanor and Carl Mohnert have arrived at the age of 30 years, the trust should cease and the principal should be paid to them share and share alike, <em>“ . </em>but should they not have arrived at the age of thirty (30) years, . . . then I direct that the share of either or both of them be held in Trust. . . until, he, she, or they, shall have arrived at the age of thirty (30) years and be distributed and paid over to them as above -set out, absolutely and in fee.’ ” The husband of the testatrix contended that since Eleanor and Carl were not 30 when the life tenant died, he had an interest in the principal if they did not live to be 30 years of age. The Court said that <em>from the whole scheme of the will, together with the gift over, </em>if Eleanor and Carl did not attain the age of 30 years, their interest was not contingent but was vested upon the death of the life tenant with full enjoyment deferred. In the instant case (1) there were gifts over both as to income and principal, and (2) the shares of income and'principal varied with each contingency as above set forth, and (3) the entire scheme of the Cannistra will was different from the Allen will. It is obvious, therefore, that <em>Allen Estate </em>is not a controlling authority in this case.</p>

Examples of the determination of this Court to carry out the testator’s intent and to refuse to terminate a testamentary trust unless all of the purposes of the trust have been fulfilled and no ultimate reason for its continuance exists, may be found in the cases which hold that even where a gift is vested and all parties in interest are sui juris and petition the Court to terminate the trust, it will not be terminated if the will contains a spendthrift trust provision, or a sole and separate use provision, or a discretionary power in the trustee to pay or withhold part of the income or to terminate the trust. <em>Spring’s </em>Estate,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> <a href="/pa/216/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="216 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="950336" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0529-01">216 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20110" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="66 A. 110">66 A. 110</a>; <em>Wood’s Estate, </em>261 Pa., supra.</p>

      <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>In <em>Spring’s Estate, </em>216 Pa., supra, the Court refused to terminate an active trust per autre vie notwithstanding the fact that there ivas no gift over. The trustee was authorized to pay to the life tenants such sum as the trustee may deem for their best interest. The Court wisely refused to terminate the trust and said: “As was said by our present Chief Justice in Holbrook’s Estate, <a href="/pa/213/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="213 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="943379" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0093-01">213 Pa. 93</a>, ‘In. Pennsylvania the right of a man to do as he will with his own has always been liberally construed. Accordingly, a donor, not under any obligation to give, may give with such conditions as he pleases, subject only to the restriction that the conditions shall not be clearly illegal.’ That a benefactor has the power to restrict the enjoyment of his bounty through the medium of a trustee during the life of the beneficiary is the unquestionable law of this state: Rife v. Geyer, <a href="/pa/59/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="59 Pa. 393" data-case-ids="426935" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0393-01">59 Pa. 393</a>. . . . Nor does the fact that there was no limitation over affect the validity of the trust, if, as in the case at bar, it clearly appears that it was the intention of the benefactress to create a trust and thus guard her bounty with the protection of a trustee in whose judgment and discretion she evidently had the fullest confidence. It is a primary rule of our eases to give effect to the intention of the testator, and the presumption always is that the intent was lawful. Applying this principle to the present case, there is presented an active trust created by apt words and a testamentary intent clearly expressed, which must be sustained, unless it can be shown that the trust thus created is in Violation of an inflexible rule 6f law or of statutory restrictions. ... It seems to have been assumed by the learned presiding judge in the court below, . . . that in order to support a trust of this character it must' be á coverture trust, or a 'spendthrift trust, or a trust to support contingent remainders. We do not so understand the law. An active trust may be <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>created as a protection to the beneficiary because of his inexperience, improvidence, inability to manage his estate or for any other purpose, not illegal, which the benefactor may deem, wise or expedient in order to carry out his intentions: Perry on Trusts, section 805. Or as is stated in Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence, vol. 2, section 991. ‘They (active trusts) may, except when restricted by statute, be created for every purpose not unlawful.’ ”</p>
