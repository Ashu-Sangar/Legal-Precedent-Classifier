    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[196,432,1149,380]]]'>The plaintiff company sued in assumpsit to recover, under count 1, for the defendant’s failure to pay for goods sold and delivered, consisting of a certain quantity of Insecticide Lamps and, under count 2, for a loss of profits due allegedly to the defendant’s breach of a written contract for the purchase and sale* of 1, 000,000 Insecticide Lanips. -</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[188,831,1154,996]]]'>The case was tried to the court without a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case the defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit. A recess for lunch was taken without any ruling by the trial judge on the defendant’s motion. Upon resumption of the trial and before any action by the court on the motion for nonsuit, counsel for defendant rested and presented a request for a directed verdict which the learned trial judge did not then act upon but granted the defendant’s motion for nonsuit. In accordance with a local rule' of courts the plaintiff, within the time limited therefor, filed exceptions which the court subsequently dismissed and entered judgment 'for the defendant. - We are persuaded from oúr examination of the record that the correct result was reached by the learned court belowT-'The judgment will be affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Watebs which adequately answer the appellant’s contentions.</p>

This writing appears to be an order form of the plaintiff, on which the printed name and address of the plaintiff have been obliterated and the name and address of the defend-. ant inserted in typewriting. It is addressed to Solar Electric Corporation, the plaintiff, is marked 'Order No. 43260,’ and calls for 1,000,000 60w ST19B1 In<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>secticide Lamps.. It carries in typewriting the statement, ‘This order is subject to a cancellation charge in event of a cancellation by us,’ followed by a signature said to be that of Philip Rochlin. The order is undated but bears a rubber stamp purporting to show that it was received by the plaintiff on June 15,1953.</p>

    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[213,1020,1150,827]]]'>“We need not consider whether this writing constituted a valid contract between the plaintiff and the defendant or whether the defendant breached- the contract because we have concluded that the plaintiff’s proof of damages was wholly inadequate. The plaintiff’s only witness was its treasurer, and, his. testimony on the subject of damages was confined to, the reading of portions of a letter alleged to have been written by the plaintiff’s general manager to the defendant setting forth an ‘inventory of Exterminator raw material and finished lamps,’ a copy of which is attached to the complaint as exhibit ‘C’.. The witness’s testimony lacked the detail and personal knowledge of the transactions necessary to establish a claim for damages chargeable against the defendant for breach of contract.</p>

The testimony of the' plaintiffs witness indicated not only that the prices were agreed upon in advance but that the shipments alleged to have been made were made in pursuance of a bulk order for future delivery. In fact, most of the invoices offered to support the book entries bear the legend ‘Your Order No. 43252-4/16,’ and one invoice bears the legend ‘Your Order No. 5260-6/5/53,’ which appears to be the purported order for 1,000,000 lamps which formed the basis of plaintiff’s elaim in count II.</p>
