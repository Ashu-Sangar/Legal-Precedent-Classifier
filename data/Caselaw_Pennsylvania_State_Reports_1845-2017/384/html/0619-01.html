Testatrix further provided that, subject to the provisions of the eighth paragraph of her will, her executors should sell and dispose of all of her real estate, and then directed that her residuary <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>estate, including the proceeds of the sale of her real estate, should be divided by her executors into nine equal shares and “disposed of” to her named nieces and nephews and the named children of a deceased niece.</p>

This option shall be subject to the limitation that with respect to the heirs, devisees and legal representatives of either party after acquiring an interest in said real estate, they shall be free to bargain and sell from one to the other within their own group any right or interest in said real es<a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>tate, or create an estate by the entireties with tbeir respective spouses, without notice to the other party or her heirs, devisees and legal representatives, as they respectively may desire.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b671-4" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[168,587,1147,316]]]'>The agreement also recited that testatrix and Stella should continue their ownership of the real estate as tenants in common during their lives or the life of either of them; and that the agreement shall be binding upon the parties, their heirs, devisees and legal representatives.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[169,923,1147,327]]]'>Testatrix had undoubtedly a right in and by her will to extend Stella’s rights under the agreement so far as her own legatees or devisees were concerned; and she could, likewise, limit in and by her will the rights which her legatees or devisees were given under the agreement. This she unquestionably did in her will.</p>
    <p id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.6",671,[169,1261,1148,495]]]'>The executors and Stella claim that the will by its terms creates an active trust to endure during the lifetime of Stella or until the time that Stella exercises her right to purchase, and that in the meantime the executors had the right to manage and lease the property and collect and distribute the rents until the real estate was sold. No one has questioned the validity of the agreement between testatrix and Stella — they only question its interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b671-7" data-blocks='[["BL_671.7",671,[169,1768,1148,606]],["BL_672.1",672,[269,366,1148,1109]]]'>While the will and the agreement, when read and construed together, are far from clear, we believe this is what the testatrix intended: The executors should have the power to manage and lease the real estate and collect the rents and distribute the net income until her interest therein was sold or disposéd of by the executors. However, if no sale was made by the executors within a reasonable time, the beneficiaries (or devisees) of the próceéds of sale had the right to take the real estate in kind. See <em>Harrar’s Estate, </em>244 Pa., supra. The testatrix also intended that Stella should <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>have the right to purchase testatrix’s interest or share in the real estate at a valuation mutually agreed upon between Stella and the executors, in which event the executors were directed to sell and convey the interest to Stella. If, however, Stella and the executors did not agree upon a mutually satisfactory sale price within a reasonable time, then under the facts and the law, the named residuary legatees or devisees would have the right to take the real estate in kind. The residuary legatees or devisees would have the right to sell from one to the other within their own group their respective right or interest in the real estate; but if they (or their heirs or devisees or legal representatives) desired to sell to a third party the undivided interest which testatrix had owned in said real estate, Stella would have the option to purchase said interest at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as contained in an acceptable offer (said option to exist for 30 days after notice), with the further privilege of making settlement within three months.</p>
