The various contracts were consolidated into one on June 18, 1930, and this was in turn amended on February 20, 1931. It is important to note that the increased royalties provided in the aforesaid <em>modified </em>agreements were paid to Cromwell by his father’s estate without question or objection by anyone until the executor filed its Seventh Partial Account on June 7, <em>1932. </em>Testator’s widow and Mrs. Dean objected at the audit of this account in 1932 to payments to Cromwell of the aforesaid excess royalties, as well as to his employment by the estate at a salary. The excess royalties over and above $18,000. which at first were small, had greatly increased, and these increases, if payable to Cromwell, necessarily decreased the amounts of <em>net </em>income payable to the widow and to Mrs. Dean. The case was appealed to this Court: See <em>Hand’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/315/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="315 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="1156706" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0238-01">315 Pa. 238</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20A.%20718" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="172 A. 718">172 A. 718</a>. In that case <em>all of the ambiguous agreements here involved were considered by this Court </em>and the validity and interpretation, though not the duration thereof, were necessarily determined. The Court decided: (a) that Cromwell had not exerted fraud or undue influence on his father; (b) that the excess royalty payments were not gifts but valid enforceable contracts; (c) that Cromwell’s employment by the executor was in accordance with Dr. Hand’s will; (d) that the widow was bound by her agreement of <em>January 9, </em>1921/.; (e) that that agreement, although not signed by Mrs. Dean, had been acquiesced in by her; (f) that from January 9, 1924, until the filing of exceptions to the executor’s Seventh Account in 1932 neither the widow nor Mrs. Dean objected to the payment to Cromwell of the aforesaid Excess Royalties which the executor had paid in accordance with Cromwell’s agreement with his father and subsequent modifications thereof; and (g) said payments were approved and affirmed.</p>

So far as the daughter is concerned, the father had the unquestionable right to make such gifts to or such contracts with his son as he pleased. <em>She has no standing whatever to complain. </em>Even if the contracts were unduly favorable to the son, this is of no moment so far as she is concerned.”</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[176,1055,1148,996]]]'>Appellants’ position in the instant appeal is “that Dr. Hand provided by Agreement No. 3 [November 10, 1920] for the compensation to be paid Cromwell for negotiating the contract of February 19, 1920 and fixed such compensation at a specified share of the royalties received under ‘said agreement’ that Cromwell had negotiated; that the right to receive such compensation expired with the termination of ‘said agreement’ and was revived only by Agreement No. 4 with Charlotte [the widow], in which Mrs. Dean, but not her sons, acquiesced and which extended Cromwell’s right to receive such compensation to ‘any modifications’ of ‘said agreement’; that the effect of Agreement No. 4 ended at Charlotte’s death since Charlotte, being but a life beneficiary, could not contract in respect of income of the estate for longer than her own life . . . and thus that there is no compensation still due which Cromwell’s estate would have any right to receive.”</p>

Appellants in effect seek to have us reverse or limit this Court’s prior decision in <em>Hand’s Estate, </em>315 Pa., supra, and interpret the agreements entirely differently from the way they were interpreted in that decision and from the way they have been interpreted by all parties involved from February 14, 1921 until 1953. Dr. Hand in his lifetime acquiesced in the payments of excess royalties to Cromwell <em>under two modifications </em>of the agreements of January 27, 1920, and February 19, 1920. After Dr. Hand’s death the widow and Mrs. Dean acquiesced in the payments to Cromwell of excess royalties <em>under nine modifications </em>of the Company’s agreement, and likewise made no objections to the payment to Cromwell of <em>increased </em>excess royalties under the modified agreements as shown in and by the many accounts of the executor and in the trustee’s Second Account after the widow’s death.
