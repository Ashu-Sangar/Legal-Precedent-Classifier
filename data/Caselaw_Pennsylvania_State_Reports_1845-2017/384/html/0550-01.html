A secondary question is also presented: do the trustees or the great-grandchild’s guardian have the duty to apply the minor’s income for his maintenance, education and support during minority? The learned court below ruled that the interest of the minor was vested subject to be divested. It was held that it was the duty of the testamentary trustees, and not that of the guardian, to apply the income during the minority.</p>

It is apparent that the will was skilfully and professionally drawn.. The testamentary scheme is plain. The residue of the estate was placed in trust, with named trustees, to pay the income to testator’s wife, Anita M. S. Taylor, for life, and upon her decease, to his two daughters, Marjory T.

Testator, therefore, directed that the income on any such share should be paid to that child, or issue, for <em>twenty-one years after the date of death of the daughter, </em>at which time the principal is payable to him or her absolutely. Provision is made for disposition of the principal should such beneficiary die with or without issue.

However, the interest of any child of the daughter <em>born after testatoTs death, </em>and the issue of any child of the daughter <em>who shall predecease the daughter, </em>possess a different 'status. Such an interest is <em>not </em>vested since testator provided that they should only <em>receive income for twenty-one years, at which time the principal is payable, </em>with a further provision for payment of the principal, in case of death with or without issue before twenty-one years.</p>

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>Testator’s reason for making the distinction in interests is apparent. It was in order to avoid the creation of an interest which might prove invalid because in violation of the rule against perpetuities. The doctrine is encompassed in <em>Throm Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/378/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1250870" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0163-01">378 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.2d%20815" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="106 A.2d 815">106 A. 2d 815</a>, where we said (p. 166) : “In testing a testamentary provision relative to the rule against perpetuities the limit for the creation of an executory interest to commence was, under the common law, <em>within the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, allowing for the period of gestation. </em>Its validity was determined by <em>possible </em>and not actual events: Coggins’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/124/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="124 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="563106" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0010-01">124 Pa. 10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.%20579" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 A. 579">16 A. 579</a>. Under the Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, sec. 4 (b), 20 PS 301.4 (b), the rule is to be measured by <em>aetual </em>rather than possible events. Since testator’s death was in 1931, prior to the Act, this will must be interpreted under the then existing law. For a discussion of the doctrine of remoteness see Warren’s Estate, <a href="/pa/320/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="320 Pa. 112" data-case-ids="1163620" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0112-01">320 Pa. 112</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20396" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="182 A. 396">182 A. 396</a>; Harrah Estate, <a href="/pa/364/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="364 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="1223487" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0451-01">364 Pa. 451</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="72 A.2d 587">72 A. 2d 587</a>.” Testator died June 23, 1943, prior to the Estates Act of 1947, supra. We are, therefore, required to apply the common law rule. It is quite <em>possible </em>that the interest of any child of the daughter born <em>after </em>the death of testator, or the issue of any child of the daughter who might <em>predecease the daughter, </em>would transgress the rule and be void because of remoteness. But, in any event, testator had the power to make the disposition which he did.. His language is clear. He did not intend, in the event specified, that all his grandchildren and great-grandchildren should receive an equal share. He was insuring against a void gift because of remoteness, and was bringing such gift , within the permitted limit of the rule.</p>

It was further provided that in case of the death of such beneficiaries prior to receiving the principal, the corpus should be paid to their issue. In absence of issue, then such principal is payable to the children of the daughter then surviving, <em>per stirpes. </em>The right to principal is, therefore, contingent upon the survival of the beneficiary for twenty-one years from the death of the daughter.
