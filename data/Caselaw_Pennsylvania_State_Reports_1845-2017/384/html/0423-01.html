      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>Plaintiff is a builder and real estate developer. Defendant Skelly is in the real estate business and is and was at the times in question a director of the bank. Plaintiff submitted an offer of purchase to the owners of a 19 acre tract of undeveloped ground known as the Simon Tract, on the condition that he was able to obtain a change in zoning from A to B Classification. On January 8, 1948, the owners advised plaintiff by letter that they would sell him the ground for $35,000. cash;</p>

On January 14, 1948, plaintiff signed a printed form of application for a loan of $27,000. to be secured by a first mortgage on plaintiffs home and the Simon Tract, upon Barrett’s assurance that it would be acted upon in three or four days. Plaintiff paid Barrett $15. [the usual charge] to cover the cost of an appraisal of the real estate, which was to be made by the bank’s appraisers. On January 19, 1948, Mr. Steel, Mr. March and defendant Skelly, all of whom were directors of defendant bank, informed plaintiff they had been designated by the bank to appraise the real estate offered by plaintiff as security for the proposed mortgage loan. On January 28th, plaintiff received a letter from defendant bank, dated January 27, 1948, the pertinent part of which is as follows: “. . . our Executive Committee felt they would not be justified in recommending this loan for approval for the investment of trust funds due to the conditions surrounding it, with which, of course, you are familiar. This entire programme depends on wheth<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>er or not you will be able to have the zoning ordinance changed, permitting the erecting of a super market on a part of the vacant tract; the actual purchase of the property depends on this zoning ordinance being changed to permit this. Presuming you would have the ordinance changed, possibly your prospective purchasers would not go through with the purchase, in which case we would have rather a large mortgage, <em>secured to a great degree by vacant ground.</em>

On <em>February </em>9, <em>194-8, </em>plaintiff informed counsel for the owners that he desired to accept the offer set forth in the owner’s aforesaid letter to him dated January 8th. Counsel for the owners then informed plaintiff he could not accept the offer because Skelly had submitted an offer of $40,000. for the Simon Tract, which offer had been accepted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> “Pursuant to [Skelly’s] offer, the heirs of Catherine Simon conveyed to David E.

Plaintiff further averred that on or before January 12, 1948, <em>defendant Shelly </em>— -with the knowledge and acquiescence of defendant bank, through its secretary and director, Barrett, and its directors and appraisers, March and Steel — used the confidential information as to plaintiff’s plan, to become the secret competitor of plaintiff for the purchase of the property “to the private profit of defendant Skelly”. Plaintiff further averred that defendant bank had wrongfully appointed defendant Skelly to act as its agent in making an appraisal of the property and that Barrett and March, directors, knew of Skelly’s adverse interest. Plaintiff then avers that the fair market value of the Simon Tract, which he could have bought for $35,000. cash, is, exclusive of all buildings and improvements, not less than $399,350.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Skelly was acting as an appraiser (together with two other appraisers) for the bank for the sole purpose of appraising the market value of the property upon which plaintiff desired to make a mortgage loan in the amount of $27,000. In negotiating for the purchase of the property by the Freedmans, Skelly was acting solely for himself and was not acting within the scope of his employment or within the actual 'or apparent scope of ■ his authority. Moreover, defendant bank did not in the remotest degree benefit or profit from Skelly’s negotiating for another the purchase of the Simon. Tract and had no interest in or connection therewith, or with the financing thereof, if it. was financed.</p>

Furthermore, plaintiff does not aver <em>any facts </em>which show that the bank acted unlawfully, or if it did, that he was injured by the bank’s unlawful action.</p>
