She was convicted of first degree murder with recommendation of life imprisonment. She seeks a new trial because of trial errors.</p>

When the objection raised by defense counsel was overruled, she replied: “In prison.” The district attorney then asked: “What is she in there for?” After defendant’s objection was overruled, she answered: “Murder.” The district attorney then brought out that defendant had seen her aunt every day since she was in prison. When the district attorney asked “What is she in there for,” defendant objected. “Your honor, I am objecting on the record. This line of questioning . . .is irrelevant to start with, it is prejudicial, inflammatory, trying to imply something that isn’t even in the case.”</p>

In cross examining the chief of county detectives who had obtained this statement, defendant asked whether he, the detective, had gotten the defendant to initial the sheets on which she had made corrections in her statement. The Judge then said: “The Court: Just a minute, I would like to interrupt. Are you intimating that the chief county detective and the county detectives deliberately planted mistakes in these kind of statements in order to trick the defendant, is that what you are intimating? Mr. Lord: Well, their testimony, your honor is not exactly in accordance with what we understand. The Court: What you understand, but you are saying now by your cross examination that they deliberately plant mistakes in these statements so they call the defendant’s attention to it and have it corrected, is that right? Mr. Lord: No, sir. The Court: What are you trying to do? I would like to know. Mr. Lord: We are asking him how this mistake got into this transcript? The Court: Yes, but your question was a strong intimation that he deliberately or somebody else for him planted this mistake in this, or these series of mistakes in this statement; did you mean that? Mr. Lord : I did not mean that intimation, your honor. The Court: All right, as long as it is straight. The answer of the witness was to the effect that he understood what you meant.

    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[244,437,1154,1154]]]'>I concur in the decision of the Court that a new trial is imperative because the presiding judge allowed the trial assistant district attorney to put questions to the girl-defendant on the subject of her aunt’s conviction for murder, which certainly had nothing to do with the issue before the Court and jury. Much has been said lately about guilt by association, but here the district attorney was attempting to suggest guilt by kinship, raising a possible inference that the defendant came from a family of murderers, for whom homicide was common occupation and killing a routine. The aunt’s domicile, her habits and difficulties with the law had no possible association with the defendant’s case, and all questions appertaining to them should have been excluded by the judge. Just as it is the duty of a pilot to guide a vessel through the safe channels of navigability, steering clear of all submarine hazards, so is it the responsibility of the trial judge to hold the helm of relevancy firm, in order to avoid the banks of irrelevancy on one side and the shoals of prejudice on the other.</p>
    <p id="b204-5" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[239,1622,1149,537]]]'>The trial judge had had ample warning of the rocks of prejudicial irrelevancy in the offing, but he declined to consider the damage they might inflict to the fairness of the trial. When the district attorney first questioned the defendant about her aunt, and the judge overruled defense counsel’s objections, defense counsel inquired of the Court: “What relation has it, Sir?” Instead of calling for an offer at side bar, the trial judge said: “It might have a lot. I don’t know. Go ahead.”</p>

      <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>In Ms opinion refusing a new trial the trial court sought to justify the excursion into the aunt’s criminal record by stating that defense counsel had already made reference to the aunt. A study of the record reveals that this reference was of little or no significance, so far as the issue of murder was concerned. Defense counsel had asked one Commonwealth witness where the defendant had lived prior to the hoxmcide, and the witness had replied “with her aunt.” On another occasion defense counsel had asked a Commonwealth witness if he had not made certain remarks to the defendant about the aunt and the witness replied that he had not.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[147,1110,1151,1269]]]'>The trial judge is also of the impression that if he erred with regard to allowing evidence on the aunt’s conviction of murder, he corrected the error by telling the jury to disregard the evidence. The attempt to sterilize tainted testimony is not always successful. The germ of prejudice may have taken such root in the minds of the jury that no instruction can extirpate it, no admonition deaden it. It would appear that the Judge’s remarks to the jury, in this case, instead of Mlling the germ, watered and nurtured it. He said: “ ‘And then it came out that she has an Aunt in the same prison and she sees her every day. <em>The aunt is in there for murder. </em>And she has talked to her about her case, but the defendant said not to any great extent. . . Now with reference to the aunt in prison, while <em>that is a fact, </em>you should dismiss that from your minds entirely as far as the consideration of this case is concerned. <em>It is a fact </em>that she is there, but you do not decide the guilt or innocence of this girl <em>upon the fact </em>she has an aunt in prison <em>who is serving time in Broad-meadows for murder, </em>it has nothing to do with the defendant in the case as far as the guilt or innocence is concerned.’ ”</p>

      <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>It will be noted that while the trial judge tells the jury to dismiss from their minds the fact that the defendant’s aunt is in prison, he declares four times that it is a fact that the aunt is in prison. Nor does he leave any possibility for doubt in the jury’s mind that the aunt is in prison “serving time . . . for murderAfter an emphasis of this character, it was utterly useless to tell the jury that the aunt’s homicidal tendencies had nothing to do with the charge against the defendant.</p>

Superior Ct. 165</a>, 169, a police officer, referring to a photograph of the defendant, explained that it was a “penitentiary photograph,” thereby quite clearly informing the jury that the defendant was already a convicted felon. Commenting on this testimony the Superior Court said: “It was incompetent and highly prejudicial testimony, and although the court in its opinion denying a new trial reports that the case was tried in an ideal atmosphere, without altercation of feeling between appellant’s counsel and the district attorney, we are of opinion that its instructions did not and could not eradicate the effects of the statement. . . The testimony must have left a deep and lasting impression of truth, and, for reasons presently to be developed, we cannot confidently assert that the instructions wholly abstracted it from the interplay of impressions and convictions which generated the jury’s ultimate conclusion. . . It is not an unwarrantable assumption that it [the jury] experienced trouble in arriving at a conclusion, and we cannot be certain that appellant’s criminal record was not placed in the scales in the formation of the ultimate judgment. These circumstances indicate more than a possibility that appellant’s legal right to a fair trial was substantially impugned by the incompetent and prejudicial testimony. The court should have withdrawn a juror, and the error was not <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>cured by its instructions. It was serious error, and it impeaches the conviction.”</p>

The law intends that no witness’s testimony shall make any appeal except to the jurors’ reasoning faculties; in actual practice, a witness’s testimony sometimes makes more of an appeal to the emotions than to the reason.”</p>

In deciding whether this charge is substantiated, one does not need to speculate. The 800-page printed record is replete with instances of the judge’s participation in the trial more as an advocate and partisan than as an impartial arbiter of the law. In the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Myma, <a href="/pa/278/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="278 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1080524" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0505-01">278 </a></em><a href="/pa/278/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="278 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1080524" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0505-01">Pa. 505</a>, 508, this Court laid down a standard of conduct for trial judges: “The practice of a judge entering into the trial of a case as an advocate is emphatically disapproved. The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and <em>from whom the litigants expect absolute impartiality. </em>An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quickly- reflected <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>in. the jury box and at the counsel table. To depart from the clear line of duty through questions, expressions or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice. It has a tendency to take from one of the parties the right to a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed under our system of jurisprudence. Judges should refrain from extended examination of witnesses; they should not, during the trial, indicate an opinion on the merits, a doubt as to the witness’s credibility <em>or do anything to indicate a leaning to one side or the other, </em>without explaining to the jury that all these matters are for them.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[235,1056,1149,431]]]'>In the case before us the trial judge apparently honored all these rules in the breach rather than in the observance. He ridiculed the defendant’s case, harassed and lampooned defense counsel, hampered legitimate cross-examination, volunteered statements from the bench which amounted to testimony and generally reflected an unchanging, unremitting bias in favor of the prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[232,1502,1150,771]],["BL_209.1",209,[148,385,1147,202]]]'>Although the administration of justice has undergone many changes since the first tribal chieftain climbed to the top of a bowlder to sit in judgment on his fellow-tribesman, all civilizations since then have attested that any one entrusted with the awesome responsibility of deliberating on the fate of others must be patient, considerate, reflective and temperate — ever holding the scales of justice with an equalizing hand. The judge in this case, unfortunately, was impatient, inconsiderate, intemperate and, throughout the trial rested his arm in the scale assigned to the prosecution. Under his domination the proceedings were no longer a trial by jury as it has come down through the venerating centuries. He used the courtroom as a stage for a <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>solo performance of judicial despotism. The repertoire of his tyranny was limited only by the number of the defense who appeared before the footlights of his unrestrained ire and sarcasm.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[147,616,1149,541]]]'>The defense counsel were particularly favored by the judge with the lash of his scorn. While, of course, a judge is within his province in criticising and even censuring lawyers for improprieties committed in his presence, it is not proper for him to make speeches which imply misconduct which does not exist. Nor is he warranted in extolling a witness, as against another witness or counsel, when that witness’s credibility, competence or honesty is being attacked by one side or the other.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[147,1186,1150,1165]],["BL_210.1",210,[243,382,1148,870]]]'>At the time of the defendant’s arrest she was questioned by the police. Her questions were reduced to written form and she signed the resulting statement. In the course of cross-examining the chief of county detectives, defense counsel asked him if he had, as a matter of procedure, prevailed upon the girl to enter her initials on the varying sheets containing corrections made by her. This legitimate inquiry was regarded by the judge as an attack on the police, and it roused him to an unjust censure of the defense lawyer: “The Court : Just a minute, I would like to interrupt. Are you intimating that the chief county detective and the county detectives deliberately planted mistakes in these kind of statements in order to trick the defendant, is that what you are intimating? Mr. Lord : Well, their testimony, your honor is not exactly in accordance with what we understand.

No one can doubt the magnificent work done by police departments throughout the nation, but no one can say that in the entire history of law enforcement no policeman has ever executed a guileful maneuver, even in the attempt to gain what he regarded as the truth. On this subject Judge Reno, in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Claiborne, <a href="/pa-super/175/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="175 Pa.

Superior Ct. 42</a>, 49, sagaciously observed: “Clearly, the judge solemnly pronounced the police surgeon’s testimony superior to appellant’s notwithstanding that police officers are fallible, can be mistaken, share common prejudices, and have been known to commit perjury. The credibility of police officers is to be judged by the same standards applicable to all witnesses. They are supposed to be disinterested witnesses, as the trial judge suggested in his charge, but whether or not they are so in fact is a jury <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>question.

If they had to do that they might as well .close up the police department and the courts too.”</p>
    <p id="b211-5" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[152,997,1149,603]]]'>The judge’s remarks here could well have conveyed to the jury the impression that there was something wrong about the defendant having a lawyer. His language was also unnecessarily strong as well as inaccurate, because there would be no need for the police to close up shop and for the courts to board up their doors simply because a helping hand might be lent to an accused person seeking counsel. Although the judge may not have regarded the matter as important, there is a constitutional guarantee that every accused is entitled to be represented and guided by counsel.</p>

The trial judge interposed: “The Couet: Before you answer that, doctor, <em>I am going to ask the assistant district attorney to object to it. </em>Are you trying to prove this infant died of a specific disease? Is that what you are trying to prove. That is what your question leads to. If you are not trying to do that it is not cross-examination. Me.

While celerity in any trial is recommendable, and expeditousness is always desirable, speed must not overshadow the prime requisite of a trial, namely, the ascertainment of truth. The following illustrates how the court badgered counsel: “The Court: Do you have any more questions? Mr. McGoldrick : Yes, sir. The Court : How many more? You are reiterating an awful lot. <em>I am not going to stand for it much longer.. How much more? </em>Mr. Mc-Goldrick : We wish to go through the rest of the questioning period before the statement was taken. The Court: The rest of the questioning period?

When defense counsel asked Dr. Teabeaut a medical <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>question, the judge, without permitting the answer, interrupted: “Now may I interrupt right now and inject what the court thinks about this report of that type, that portion of the report? Every coroner’s physician report that I have seen, and I was seventeen and a half years in the district attorney’s office, would give a general description of the vital organs of the body, stating whether they were diseased or not diseased, those principal vital organs that are understood to sustain life generally. That would not mean that the coroner’s physician was predicating his conclusion on the fact that he found the spleen normal or that he found any other part of the body normal. The abnormality is the thing that he concentrated on, after he had given his description of his findings when he opened up the body and posted it. Now that is all Dr. McKnight would mean by saying that the spleen upon examination in his opinion as a physician was normal, not that he connected it with drowning.” Having testified in this manner and at such length, the defense counsel could not help but feel that the judge had made himself a witness in the case, and accordingly defense counsel began to cross-examine the judge: “Mr. Lord: In other words, are you saying your honor, that he did look at organs and negatived, in other words, eliminated other causes of death.” And His Honor, not abashed at the undignified position in which he had placed himself, placidly testified further: “The Court : In other words, if he looked at the spleen and he recorded that it was normal, he could still look at some other part of the body and find the cause of death from the other part of the bodyN Eater on the judge testified some more from the bench! “The Court: If that is the case, then that eould be another observation of Dr. McKnight’s, just the same as he said the spleen is normal, I took out a section of the lungs and they <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>floated; that does not prove a thing, whether the child was drowned or whether he was asphyxiated with gas or what happened to him.”</p>

However, whatever may <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>have been the motivation behind the judge’s humor, it had no place in the serious business of a murder trial. Humor which is purposefully generated detracts from the solemnity of court procedure and can work an unjust disadvantage to the accused, as indeed it can have a similar effect on the efforts of the Commonwealth seeking a just verdict. Nor is every judge qualified to produce humor and distil wit which is interesting, much less entertaining. The sallies of the judge in the case at bar (as he must himself admit on reflection) fell somewhat short of attaining immortality in any anthology of wit and humor at the bar or on the bench. Illustrations taken from the record will reveal what Judge Reno of the Superior Court- so appropriately characterized as “judicial humor [which] rarely rises above the dismal.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">*</a> When defense counsel asked the detective, who had taken the defendant’s statement, whether he had advised her of her rights not to incriminate herself, the detective replied: “No, I did not go into the Fifth Amendment; she was told before she made this statement.” This caused the judge to exclaim: “The Fifth Amendment? . . .
