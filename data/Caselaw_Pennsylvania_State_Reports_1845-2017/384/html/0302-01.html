The lessee obtained a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off and also a rule to show cause why it should not be opened. The court below discharged the rule to strike off the judgment without prejudice to the rule to open. From that order the lessee now appeals.</p>

Garrett, Deceased, as lessor, and Samuel G. Schiffer, trading as Sally Shops, as lessee. It leases the first floor and basement of premises 133 South 13th Street, Philadelphia, as a women’s specialty shop for a term of one year from January 1, 1953, and then from year to year in default of notice by either party to terminate. • The lessee vacated the premises on May 31, 1955, having paid all the rent then due. Meanwhile, on March 1, 1955, the lease had been assigned by the lessor to James J. Grady, the plaintiff herein.</p>

But the clause in question cannot be so construed. In clause 6(e), (d) and (e) the lessee agrees to pay to lessor <em>as additional rent </em>certain items of fire insurance premiums, water rent, and sewer rent, indicating that when the intention was to make such items <em>part of the rent </em>the lessor trust company, which prepared the lease, clearly knew how to express such intention. The provision in clause 6(a) that the pay-, ments -there provided for were to be <em>in addition to the rental therein reserved </em>clearly makes such payments,, not a <em>part of the </em>rent, but sums to be paid <em>in addition, to </em>the rent. The general heading of clause 6, “Additional rent,” is obviously applicable only to clauses (c), (d) and (e). Nor is the entry of judgment for such sums justified by the provision of clause 8(a), that the “Lessee agrees that any charge or payment <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>herein reserved, included, or agreed to be treated or collected as rent and/or any other charges or taxes, expenses, or costs herein agreed to be paid by the Lessee may be proceeded for and recovered by the Lessor by distraint or other process in the same manner as rent due and in arrears,” since the phrase “distraint or other process” does not cover, and cannot be extended to apply to, a confession of judgment. It is a firmly established rule of construction in the case of warrants of attorney to confess judgments that the authority thus given must be clear, explicit and strictly construed, that if doubt exists it must be resolved against the party in whose favor the warrant is given, and that all proceedings thereunder must be within the strict letter of the warrant: <em>Boggs v.

Clause 13(e) provides that “In the event of the failure <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>of Lessee promptly to perform the covenants of Section 8(b) hereof, Lessor may go upon the demised premises and perform such covenants, the cost thereof, at the sole option of Lessor, <em>to be charged to Lessee as additional and delinquent rentP </em>Here therefore, there is an explicit provision.making such cost a charge reserved <em>as additional rent, </em>thereby bringing it under the express terms of the warrant of attorney.
