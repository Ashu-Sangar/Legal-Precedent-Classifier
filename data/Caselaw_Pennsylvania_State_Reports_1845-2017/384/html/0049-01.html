On February 11, 1955 two of the defendants, E. R. Crown Construction Company and E. R. Crown, filed a petition and rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and the defendants be let into a defense. Plaintiff’s preliminary objections to the petition for rule to open judgment having been overruled, plaintiff on April 18, 1955 filed a timely answer to the said petition. Thereafter depositions were taken and testimony introduced by defendants only.</blockquote>

Pursuant to the provisions of said building agreement a cash deposit in the sum of $5,500. was paid by plaintiff to E. R. Crown Construction Company on account of the total consideration of $55,500. Simultaneously with the execution of the building agreement, plaintiff advanced the sum of $15,000; and, a judgment note on which the subject judgment was entered was delivered to plaintiff; and, jointly with all the defendants herein, plaintiff entered into an agreement which, by its terms, was ‘made collateral to and concurrent with the agreement of sale dated April 6,1954.’ The ‘collateral agreement’ which refers to the defendants collectively as ‘Crown’ contained the following provisions: ‘Dozor has advanced to Crown the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, under the following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

Defendants’ nncontradieted testimony discloses further that after signing the agreements, plaintiff made various demands for changes in the house, thereby causing delay in the construction thereof — such as increasing the size of the house, adding additional rooms, and changing the location of the house; plaintiff also insisted upon a type of stone that could not be obtained locally and was not called for by the plans and specifications; plaintiff repeatedly stated that he was not in any hurry for the house and did not object if delay ensued; plaintiff requested that the construction mortgage be obtained through Colonial Mortgage Company and, to satisfy the plaintiff, the mortgage was placed with that company; Colonial Mortgage Company insisted that additional money be put up when the house was under roof; plaintiff by letter dated July 23rd, 1954 agreed to advance an additional sum of $7,500 to the said Colonial Mortgage Company when construction reached that stage; when the house was under roof in October, 1954, plaintiff, although requested to put up the additional money, declined to do so; plaintiff was arbitrary in the selection of plumbing fixtures; plaintiff, while insisting upon an enlargement of the house (not provided for in the building agreement) nevertheless refused to indicate definitely where the addition was to be located. Defendants’ substantial, credible, and uncontradicted testimony indicates that the house was not completed because of these actions on the part of plaintiff.</blockquote>

      <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>“We can find no reason for the application of the parol evidence rule to this case. The respective rights of the parties must necessarily be governed by the collateral agreement quoted, supra. By the terms of this agreement the advance of $15,000, secured by the judgment note, was to be repaid at the time of settlement as fixed in the building agreement which was executed simultaneously with the note. It is immaterial for the purpose of these proceedings whether the $15,000 advanced by the plaintiff is called a ‘deposit’ or a ‘loan.’ In either event the agreement provided that the sum was to be repaid by a ‘credit of $15,000 ... at settlement on account of the purchase price for completed premises ... in accordance with the terms of the agreement of sale.’ If we assume that there is credible testimony that plaintiff was responsible for the failure of settlement to be consummated, we must ask ourselves whether plaintiff, by his own action, could avoid his obligation and thus deprive the defendants of their right to secure the $15,000 credit at settlement. To ask this question is to answer it in the negative.</blockquote>

Our appellate courts have repeatedly held that a warrant or power of attorney to confess judgment is to be construed strictly against the party in <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>whose favor it is given. <em>Rambo v.

Super. 456</a>, 460 (1947). Plaintiff would have us construe the language of the collateral agreement to mean that although judgment was to be entered only upon default of the defendants, E. R. Crown and E. R. Crown Construction Company, judgment once taken at any time and under any circumstances, could not be attacked, even if the plaintiff, rather than defendants, was actually the defaulting party. The contract does not so read, and certainly the strict rule required for the construction of warrants of attorney to confess judgment would forbid such an extension of the contract language used by the parties.</blockquote>
