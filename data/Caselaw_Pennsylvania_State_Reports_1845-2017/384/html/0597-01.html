    <blockquote id="b646-9" data-blocks='[["BL_646.11",646,[252,1257,1149,547]]]'>“The plaintiff, Irene Frick, is the widow of William G-. Frick. Her complaint alleges that on June 23, 1947, her husband, while in pursuit of his duties as custodian of Peabody High School of the School District of Pittsburgh, ‘struck his head on a projecting metal lock at said school’. He ‘suffered,’ she avers, ‘a laceration of the forehead,’ was treated by a fellow employe and continued to perform his tasks until the end of his working day. He returned to his home, spent a normal evening at home with his wife, retired for the night.</blockquote>

Being unable to do so, she called defendant Dr. George W. Olah, a physician, duly licensed to practice in this commonwealth. Doctor Olah examined the deceased, and, after being told by the plaintiff of the accident, attributed the death to cerebral hemorrhage. Doctor Olah reported the sudden death to Coroner McClelland, who ordered an autopsy. This autopsy was performed June 24,1947. The body was removed from the Samson mortuary for this <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>purpose, plaintiff having given her permission to said mortuary to prepare the body for burial.</blockquote>

The court, speaking through Adams, J., held that no cause of action was stated against the coroner in the original complaint and gave leave to the plaintiff to amend her complaint to state a cause if she could as to all the present defendants. It must now be decided whether or not the plaintiff has met this responsibility.</blockquote>

In the absence of bad faith or of arbitrary and capricious acts, the authority of the coroner to perform his statutorily assigned duty cannot be successfully attacked. In the Hirho<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> case, the court had before it a <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>trespass action for damages on the basis of an unauthorized autopsy. Chief Justice Maxey sustained the coroner and dismissed the complaint, saying that when the coroner holds an inquest the presumption . . . operates in the case at bar.</blockquote>

Against the coroner it is alleged that he performed an autopsy ‘wilfully, wantonly and unlawfully,’ without the ‘consent, knowledge or permission of the plaintiff.’ (Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint, Nos. 21, 22). As this court has already stated, whenever the coroner acts within his duty it is unnecessary that he act with the consent, knowledge or permission of the plaintiff. The allegation that the coroner acted ‘wilfully, wantonly and unlawfully’ is not an allegation of fact but a conclusion of law.</blockquote>

Doctor Olah had no personal knowledge of the accident. He was not there. He talked to no witnesses. He had received information — the reliability of which he did not know — that an accident had occurred. The only allegation of fact is that Doctor Olah summoned the coroner.</blockquote>

There certainly is a duty on a physician to notify the coroner whenever the physician is aware of a sudden death. Equally certain is it that this death was sudden. This is all Doctor Olah did. He notified Coroner McClelland, who then proceeded without any authority or direction from Doctor Olah, who had no authority whatever over the coroner’s actions. The court, in the opinion by Judge Adams, sustained the demurrer of defendant Olah on the ground that no liability could arise from his conduct as pleaded.</blockquote>

They are essentially the same pleadings which were held by the court en banc, in an opinion by Adams, J., to be inadequate for legal liability. This court is of the opinion that the amended complaint is not sufficient in law to establish legal liability. The preliminary objections of Doctor Olah are sustained.

    <blockquote id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[254,695,1149,545]]]'>“The real basis of the action against Doctor Smith seems to be that he induced the performance of the autopsy just to protect the interests of the School District of Pittsburgh. An investigation by a physician attached to the School District is as much for the protection of the employe’s claim, resolving all honest doubts in his favor, as it is for the interest of the school district. That is the position taken by the City of Pittsburgh, the School District and other public bodies in connection with Workmen’s Compensation cases.</blockquote>
