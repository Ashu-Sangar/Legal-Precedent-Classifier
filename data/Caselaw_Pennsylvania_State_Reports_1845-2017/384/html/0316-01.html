    <p id="b365-9" data-blocks='[["BL_365.17",365,[201,1609,1150,714]]]'>The plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband, brought the present action against the defendant company, the husband’s employer, for damages for his allegedly wrongful death. The defendant filed preliminary objections, in the nature of a demurrer, to the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff’s exclusive remedy was under the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The learned court below sustained the objections and dismissed the complaint in an order from which the plaintiff has brought this appeal. The opinion of the learned court below disposed of the plaintiff’s contention so completely that the order will be affirmed on the following excerpts therefrom.</p>

The complaint recites that the decedent was a coal miner employed by defendant and was fatally injured by a roof fall in the mine while in the course of his employment. Clearly then, since the pleadings establish an employer-employee relationship, the Workmen’s Compensation Act would seem to be applicable.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[232,697,1156,1051]]]'>“Plaintiff seeks to avoid the application of the act by a showing that the accident resulted from defendant’s neglect of a statutory duty. However, this court can perceive no such distinction in the act. Article III, section 302 (a), 77 P.S. Sec. 461, provides that ‘In every contract of hiring ... expressed or implied .. ., it shall be conclusively presumed that the parties have accepted the provisions’ of the act unless written notice is given to the contrary. And section 303 of the act provides that acceptance of the act ‘shall operate as a surrender by the parties thereto of their rights to any form or amount of compensation or damages for any injury or death occurring in the course of the employment, or to any method of determination thereof, other than as provided in Article III of this act. Such agreement shall bind the employer and his personal representatives, and the employee, his or her wife or husband, widow or widower, next of kin, and other dependents.’</p>
