Article XIX, Section 7 of the National’s Constitution (which is the same as Article XIII, Section 7 of the Constitution and ByLaws of defendant Local No. 2, quoted supra) provides that appeals may be made “first to the Executive Board of the Local, second to the Executive Board of the National Organization and third to the National Convention”. Plaintiffs filed their appeals with the National Executive Committee approximately seven weeks after they had appealed to the Local’s Executive Committee and approximately a month before the Local notified plaintiffs that their appeals were denied.</p>

Article XIX, Section 7 covers the matter of appeals in summary fashion. It is far from explicit. It does not provide that the appeal to the National Executive Committee shall be from the decision of the Local Executive Committee. The appeal provided for, from all that appears, <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>contemplates a hearing de novo and not a review of the proceeding before the Local Executive Committee as in appellate court proceedings. While the implication may be drawn from the provision that there should be a disposition of an appeal taken to the Local Executive Committee before appealing to the National Executive Committee, so important a matter affecting the propriety of an expulsion from the union should not be left to implication. Inaction by the Local Executive Committee could indefinitely deprive an expelled member of the benefits of membership and employment in his vocation. In the instant case after appealing to the Local Executive Committee the plaintiffs waited seven weeks for a decision by that tribunal before appealing to the National Executive Committee. During this period they were deprived of their means of livelihood. This at least was an urgent reason for their appeal to the National Executive Committee, and as persons unlearned in the law, they were not required to scrutinize the loosely drawn provisions for appeal with legal nicety. And even if determination of an appeal to the Local Executive Committee be considered a prerequisite to an appeal to the National Executive Committee, we agree with the court below that the National Organization could waive procedural requirements unless individual rights were adversely affected. Moreover, strict conformance is not exacted in proceedings of this kind. The procedures before the tribunals of an unincorporated labor organization are not subject to the technicalities of a court of law so long as they are conducted in good faith and substantial justice is effected: See <em>Engle v. Pottsville Division No. 90, Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em><a href="/pa-super/66/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="66 Pa.

It is not expected that the proceedings of a trial of this character, which are conducted in most cases by persons unlearned in the laAV, will be expressed with absolute technical accuracy, or will be subjected to the severe scrutiny which is applied, by persons of critical professional skill, in courts of law. . .”.

There it was held that plaintiff members of defendant union were improperly convicted on appeal by the International Executive Board after acquittal by the Local trial board, and consequently were entitled to wages lost through interference with their employment, and certain injunctive relief. In that case the National Union’s by-laws provided that appeals <em>“must” </em>be filed within thirty days and the Local’s Executive Committee, in appealing the Local trial board’s action of acquitting the plaintiffs, failed to meet this thirty-day limitation. It was pointed out that the word “must” was used in its mandatory sense and that therefore the Local Executive Committee was under a strict obligation to appeal within the time fixed by the, by-laws; In the instant case, Article XIX, Section 7 of the Ná1 tional’S Constitution, provides that appeals <em>ma,y </em>be made to the Executive Board of the Local, and to the Executive Committee of the National. In addition; here the appeal is by individual members of thé union rather than by the local organization, and the question is hot whether the National Organization could itself dispense with a time limitation for appeal but merely whether the National’s Executive Committee could de-<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>termine plaintiffs’ appeal before the Local Executive Committee had passed on the question.</p>

It is sufficient to state that this contention is here made for the first time and was not presented to or considered by the court below. In their answer to the plaintiffs’ complaint the defense interposed was that plaintiffs had not properly followed and exhausted their remedies under the appellate procedure provided for in Article NIN, Section 7 of the National Constitution. This was the defendants’ position throughout the proceedings in the lower court and there was no reliance placed upon the above quoted Article VI, Section 5 which, consequently, was not discussed or considered by the chancellor or the court en banc. We have repeatedly held that on appeal matters not raised in, or considered by, the court below cannot be invoked by the appellant. See <em>Sherwood v. Elgart, </em><a href="/pa/383/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="383 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1261967" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0110-01">383 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="117 A.2d 899">117 A. 2d 899</a>; <em>Magazzu Election Case, </em><a href="/pa/355/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="355 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="468962" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0196-01">355 Pa. 196</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20411" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="49 A.2d 411">49 A. 2d 411</a>; <em>Montgomery County Bar Association v.

It may be - observed, however, that even if the point were properly raised there is grave doubt of its efficacy.

Plaintiffs were entitled to be reinstated by defendant Local No. 2 under Article XIV, Section 5 of the National Constitution, supra, when ordered to do so by the parent body on July 9,1951, and consequently were entitled to damages for wrongful interference with their right of employment for the period from July 9, 1951 to October 16, 1952 when the National Organization revoked the earlier order of reinstatement. The lower court found that the average earnings from other employment of plaintiff Sunderland, after his removal from the Local, were greater than his earnings as a master or mate, and this is not disputed here. With respect to plaintiff Williams, however, the lower court awarded him $2,600 in damages. Appellants contend that Williams did not fulfill his duty to mitigate damages in that he did not seek or obtain employment as a master or mate on sea duty outside of the City of Philadelphia. Unquestionably, the burden of showing that by reasonable efforts plaintiff Williams could have found such employment was upon the defendants: <em>Babayan v. Reed et al., </em><a href="/pa/257/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="257 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="1032375" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0206-01">257 Pa. 206</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20339" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="101 A. 339">101 A. 339</a>; <em>J.

During the period in question, July 9, 1951 to October 16, 1952, Williams was recognized by the National Organization as a union member, and certain evidence was presented tending to show that had he gone to New York or some other port, he could have obtained employment as a master or mate since he was backed by the National union. However, there was also evidence to show that hot only was Williams unable to obtain' such employ<a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>ment in Philadelphia because he was not recognized by defendant Local No. 2, but also that if he had obtained such employment in another city, he would be dropped as soon as Local No. 2 found out about it and objected. The lower court expressly found that defendants had not proved plaintiff Williams could obtain or keep work as a master or mate on sea duty during the period in question. The record supports this finding.</p>
    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[155,827,1150,660]]]'>' Even assuming that plaintiff Williams could have obtained employment in ports other than Philadelphia where he resided, legally he was not compelled to do so in order to mitigate his damages.
