The question presented is whether the appellant applied for an exemption, and was relieved thereby, from service in the armed forces of the United States on the ground that he was an alien. The trial court ruled that he had and, therefore, was ineligible to become a United States citizen.</p>

On March 2, 1942, appellant was examined by a Selective Service Local Board and, on the basis of War Department instructions excluding all enemy aliens from service, was placed in class 4-C, the class for unacceptable aliens. On August 12, 1942, petitioner furnished information from which an “Alien’s Personal History and Statement” form (DSS 304) was completed. Section 41 of this form, allegedly signed by appellant, reads as follows : “41.1 do object to service in the land or naval (do, do not) forces of the United States.</p>

When war broke out with Nazi Germany in 1941, he had already been a resident here for eleven years but he had made no application for American citizenship. The citizenship which he desires today was no less worthy in 1942 when he Was given the opportunity with millions of other Americans to uphold the democratic institutions of this country by shouldering a riñe in her defense. There Were legions of young men of Germanic origin or derivation who saw no Teutonic ideal in the program and policies of the tyrannical Nazi regime, and who were <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>■willing and eager to join with Americans of every national origin to defeat Hitler and thus bring Germany back into the sisterhood of God-fearing, international-law-abiding nations.</p>

He said in a letter he wrote to the Local Selective Service Board on August 17, 1942 that “it would be hard for me to go against my own kin.” However, in December, 1943, local boards were directed to notify all enemy aliens that they could, by withdrawing their previous objections to military service, ask for assignment to a theatre of war where they would not be required to fight against fellow-nationals or blood relatives. This alternative did not interest Schulz because, it soon became apparent, it was not fighting against his own kin which disturbed him — he spurned serving in the United States forces anywhere. In February, 1944, after questioning Schulz on this whole matter of military service, the Chairman of the Selective Service Board wrote to the Legal Advisor at State headquarters in Harrisburg that “it was his opinion and conviction that he [Schulz] did not want to enter the Army under any circumstances,” and added that Schulz “seemed unwilling to enter the United States Army for service <em>even in continental United States ”</em>

The Naturalization Examiner, who conducted the preliminary examination on Schulz’s petition for naturalization, reported to the Court of Common Pleas that Schulz did, in fact, “apply for relief from training and service in the armed forces”: “It is submitted in the opinion of this Service, that an alien enemy who on D.S.S. Form 304 expressed his objection to service in the Armed Forces and who by reason thereof was found ‘not acceptable’ by the Armed Forces, thereby being deferred from training and service, is to be regarded as <em>one who applied for and was granted exemption on the ground of alienage and is therefore ineligible to become a citizen by virtue of the provisions of Section 315.</em>

No one particularly enjoys the prospect of going to war with the potential prospect of returning to civilian life maimed and crippled or not returning at all, but men of honor and of devotion to truth and justice place the fate and destiny of the nation above individual convenience or desire. It does not seem fair, in the universal appraisement of what is just, to those who did their grim duty in the gory and muddy foxholes, in the harrowing holds of battered and sinking ships, and in the sulphurcharged clouds of embattled aircraft, to give to unhelping enemy aliens the same honorable reward which was purchased by patriots at the expenditure of sweet blood and salty tears. It is for that reason that Congress solemnly declared that “any alien who applied or has applied for exemption or discharge from . . . service in the Armed Forces . . . and is or was relieved . . . from such . . . service on such ground, shall be permanently ineligible, to become a citizen of the United States.” If there is to be any modification of this rule, it is for Congress to make the modification, not the Courts. In the confused, half-starved, disordered and even perilous state of the outside world today, American citizenship has become perhaps the most treasured possession on either hemisphere. It should not bé casually conferred, as indeed it should not be casually taken away.</p>
