The Railway Company joined the City of Reading as an additional defendant alleging that the City was solely or jointly liable to the plaintiffs. The City of Reading answered and then moved for judgment on the pleadings averring that the plaintiffs had not complied with the Act of July 1,1937, P. L. 2547, 53 PS §2774, requiring the plaintiffs to give written notice to the City of their claim within six months from the date of its origin. This motion was denied by the court below in an opinion holding that the City was properly joined as an additional defendant for the purpose of conveniently determining in one suit the right of the Railway Company, if found liable for plaintiffs’ damages, to obtain contribution from the City as a joint tortfeasor, but that the City could not be held solely liable for plaintiff’s injuries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The case was tried before <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>a jury in May, 1951, when, after the plaintiffs had completed their testimony on the question of negligence, the court entered compulsory nonsuits in favor of both defendants. Thereafter, an application to take off the nonsuits was granted and the case was retried in April, 1954. The jury returned verdicts of $134.00 for Mike Stevens and $2,900.00 for Clara Stevens, against both defendants. Defendants filed motions for new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto and the court en banc, one judge dissenting, entered judgments n.o.v. in favor of both defendants.

Accordingly, the facts may be stated as follows: On the morning of December 11, 1948, a clear, dry day, the plaintiffs were passengers for hire on a bus owned and operated by the defendant, Reading Street Railway Company, a common carrier. The bus was traveling in a southerly direction on North Fifth Street, approaching the intersection of Fifth and Washington Streets in the City of Reading, where the plaintiffs and other passengers intended to alight. The bus regularly stopped on the west cartway of Fifth Street flush with the west curb and with the front of the bus about even with the north line of the north crosswalk over Fifth Street. On the day of the accident, however, defendant’s bus stopped a considerable distance north of its regular stopping place, at an angle, with its front end approximately one and one-half feet away from the west curb and the rear end five or six feet from the curb.</p>

The bottom step at the exit door which was located toward the rear of the bus, was fourteen and a half inches from the surface of the roadway. Mrs. Stevens, in alighting, stepped off this bottom step with her right foot first, and then her left foot went into a hole seventeen inches long, a foot wide and about six inches deep, throwing her to the ground. Part of the hole was under the bus and part extended out beyond the south side of the exit steps. When Mrs. Stevens stepped down to the road surface, two passengers were standing to her left at the exit door which prevented her from seeing the hole. Another woman passenger who preceded the wife-plaintiff from the bus, fell at the same hole, but Mrs. Stevens did not witness this incident, and did not know how it occurred. Mrs. Stevens never saw the hole until she fell and did not know of its existence.</p>

The law is clear that a common carrier for hire owes a duty to its passengers not only to exercise the highest degree of care and diligence in carrying them to their destination, but also must exercise reasonable diligence to give passengers a safe place to alight and pass out of <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>danger: <em>Harris v.

In <em>O’Malley v. Laurel Line Bus Co., </em>snpra, p. 255, the rule is clearly stated that “. . . If the person in charge of a car used for the carriage of passengers for hire, knowingly permits one of them to get off the vehicle at a dangerous place, which is not the usual stopping place, and the dangerous character of which the passenger could not see and did not know, the carrier will be liable for the resulting injuries, if any, to the passenger: McCollum v. Pitts. Rys. Co. (No. 1), <a href="/pa-super/51/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="51 Pa. Super. 637" data-case-ids="430452" data-case-paths="/pa-super/51/0637-01">51 Pa. Superior Ct. 637</a>, . . .”. We are of the opinion that the present case is governed by the above stated rule of law. Here the hole in question had existed for at least six weeks prior to the accident. The hole was a large one, being approximately one and a half feet long, a foot wide and six inches deep. During the entire six weeks that the hole was continuously in existence, it was directly in the route of defendant’s bus operator in approaching the regular bus stop. From this evidence the jury could reasonably infer that defendant’s employe knew or should have known of the existence of the hole and of the apparent danger to passengers if they Avere to alight at this point. In addition the Avife-plaintiff testified that the operator of defendant’s bus said to her immediately after the accident: “I am sorry, it is my fault, I stopped at the wrong place.” No objection was made at the trial to the admission of this statement into evidence. Accordingly defendant’s complaint in this Court that the evidence was improperly introduced because it was hearsay and not a spontaneous utterance sufficient to come within the res gestae exception, is without merit since no objection was interposed. Where inadmissible evidence, including hearsay, is admitted without objection arid <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>is relevant and material to tlie fact in issue, it is to be given its natural probative effect as if it were in law admissible: Pol<em>uski v.

While it is true that common carriers are not liable for injuries resulting from <em>ordinary </em>defects in the street (Perret v.

This the Bus Company failed to do. The driver of the bus knew that plaintiff would have to reach the sidewalk. He also knew or should have known that at the place where he stopped the bus the mounds of earth and the unevenness of the ground would make this a hazardous venture. By discharging plaintiff in a place of obvious danger, the driver failed to exercise the degree of care which the law requires. . .”.</p>

In <em>Carroll v. </em>Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/368/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="368 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1230343" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0436-01">368 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20505" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="84 A.2d 505">84 A. 2d 505</a>, the plaintiff stepped from defendant Pittsburgh Railways Company’s trolley car which was stopped at the regular stopping place, into a hole which she described as being about three inches deep and larger than a dinner plate. This Court held that the question of negligence on the part of the defendant railway company was not for the jury, stating at p. 444 that “. . . it would be unjust and impracticable to hold street railway companies liable to passengers alighting from their cars on busy city streets, where, especially in the case of asphalt pavings, <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>
      <em>there are </em>frequently holes, depressions and worn out places of various dimensions which may remain for considerable periods of time until repairs are made by the public officials who alone are responsible for the maintenance of the highway in good order and repair. . Attention was called to the fact that many holes existed at the particular intersection where the trolley car regularly stopped, “. . . and holes no doubt existed at many other intersections, so that ... it would have been practically impossible for it to stop its cars at the various streets along the route which it traversed.” However, this situation is not present in the instant case since rather than stopping at the normal stopping place, the operator of defendant’s bus elected to stop a considerable distance therefrom and in such a manner that the hole was underneath and directly beside the exit door. It was also pointed out in the <em>Carroll </em>case at p. 440 that “. . . there are authorities to the effect that where a passenger is mistakenly led to alight at an extremely dangerous place which is not the usual stopping place the carrier may be held liable for any injuries which the passenger thereby sustains. [Citing cases] But in the present instance the car stopped at a regular stopping place at the intersection of two city streets, . . .”. While the cases referred to in the foregoing statement are properly characterized as holding that there is liability where the bus stops at an <em>extremely dangerous </em>point for alighting between intersections, the holding in these cases does not preclude a finding of liability where the condition, although not <em>extremely </em>dangerous, is of such character as may be reasonably foreseen as a hazard that could produce injury: Restatement, Torts, §284. Here the hole in the street was sufficiently dangerous to cause the fall of two alighting passengers. The question is whether a reasonably prudent person in the position of the bus opera<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>tor, chargeable with knowledge of the condition which existed, exercised the care required under the circumstances, and this was a question for the jury. Unquestionably the hazard was created by the stopping of the bus at other than the regular stopping place so that the exit steps were over the hole in the street which caused the accident. Aside from the fact that in the <em>Carroll </em>ease the depression in the street created a much less dangerous hazard than in the instant case, the reasonableness of the bus operator’s action there must be considered in the light of the necessity of discharging passengers at street intersections; the risk was not of such magnitude as to outweigh the utility of the act. See Restatement, Torts, §291.</p>

L. 720, 36 PS §102, under Section 2 of which North Fifth Street originally became a State highway, provides, inter alia, that those streets taken over by the Commonwealth are “. . . to be maintained, constructed, reconstructed and resurfaced at the expense of the Commonwealth upon the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations hereinafter provided.” Section 522 of the Act of June 1, 1945, P. L. 1242, 36 PS §670-522, known as the State Highway Law, states that “After the streets designated as State highways shall have been taken over by the Commonwealth, they shall be maintained, constructed, reconstructed and resurfaced by the department at the expense of the Commonwealth, . . . Maintenance shall not include snow removal or street cleaning, and shall be limited to the portion of the street between existing curb lines available to vehicular traffic. . .”. Section 525 of the State Highway Law provides that no opening can be made in any State highway until a permit is obtained from the highway department or from the City if the City is authorized in writing to act for the department. Section 526 states that before the commencement of any work authorized by Section 522, the City, on proper notice from the Secretary of Highways, must establish and maintain an adequate detour until the work is finished. Section 407 of the Act, 36 PS §670-407 provides: “For the purpose of uniform, efficient, <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>and economic maintenance and repair of the State highways, the department shall purchase all necessary material, and shall appoint and employ all necessary labor or repirmen, who shall at all times in the year keep the State highways free from holes, ruts, sticks, loose stones, or other impediments of any kind, which tend to interfere with free and easy travel, or which if permitted to exist might tend to the deterioration, injury, or destruction of the highway.” The effect of these provisions was to place the control and responsibility for repair and maintenance of North Fifth Street, the scene of the accident, upon the Commonwealth. Since the Commonwealth, by statute, has relieved the City of the obligation to repair the hole, the City cannot be guilty of negligence since there must be a duty and a breach of that duty to produce a right of action.</p>

The Sproul Act provided that the roads taken over in the State Highway System should thereafter be constructed, improved and maintained by the State Highway Department at the expense of the Commonwealth. In.affirming the lower court’s action of entering a compulsory nonsuit against the plaintiffs, we held that the township was not liable unless there was- legislation compelling repair and maintenance of the road in question, stating at p. 394: <em>: . </em>When the State took over the highways under the Sproul Act, it provided that they should.be. constructed,'.improved and maintained by the state highway department, at the sole .expense of the 'Commonwealth, and that they were, to be under the' exclusive jurisdiction of the state highway- depart<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>ment.
