In the <em>Corn-mean </em>Case which similarly involved a judgment entered On the pleadings, the sole allegation Of the defendants in their answer as the reason for the plaintiff’s discharge was that he was “in<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>subordinate”, “untidy” and “failed to cooperate” in the performance of his duties. Thus he was discharged for delinquencies in his work, a cause personal to him as an employe. Under these circumstances we held that he was entitled to notice of the charges against him and a hearing before dismissal. Here under the pleadings the dismissal occurred for the impersonal reason that the position was abolished for reasons of economy and efficiency. Neither in <em>Carroto </em>nor <em>Gornman </em>was the employe’s position allegedly abolished and consequently the question now arising out of a dismissal because of abolishment of the position was not before us. There is a basic difference between a dismissal for causes personal to the employe and dismissal as a result of the abolition of a position. Where the employe is dismissed because of failure to properly perform the duties of his employment, his position continues for performance of its duties by a successor. Where the position is abolished, it no longer exists and there is no position to which the dismissed employe can be reinstated. Moreover, where the position is abolished for reasons of economy and efficiency, there is nothing for the dismissed employe to explain or justify as there might be where the dismissal is for insubordination, untidiness, lack of cooperation or other matters personal to the employe. The employe has no voice in the elimination of a position for reasons of economy or efficiency. This is a matter solely for the judgment of the governmental authority in whom the power to eliminate the .office is vested.</p>

Mr. Justice Sadler, speaking for the Court, stated: “Civil service acts are designed to secure the appointment of competent public servants, and protect them in their employment from attacks on personal grounds, so long as they are well behaved. They are not intended to retain in office at public expense those whose services may be dispensed with for economy. 'The purpose of the civil service statute, and of other laws prohibiting the discharge of employees without cause assigned, notice, and a hearing, is to insure the continuance in public employment of those officers who prove faithful and competent, regardless of their political affiliations. These statutes are not intended to affect or control the power of the city council, or the executive officers of the city, to abolish offices when they are no longer necessary, or for reasons of economy. They are not intended to furnish an assurance to the officer or employee that he will be retained in the service of the city after the time when his services are required. They do <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>not prevent his discharge in good faith without a trial, and without notice, when the office or body is abolished as unnecessary, or for reasons of economy’: 2 Dillon Municipal Corp.

(Emphasis supplied). Public policy requires the elimination of needless positions and it is of no importance in whom the power to abolish is vested. The Philadelphia City Charter effected a complete change in the handling of personnel matters and gave to the executive branch complete freedom within the framework of the overall budget to establish positions to the number required and the compensation pertaining to them, and, at least by necessary implication, the power to reduce the number of positions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

But so could council. Under the Charter the power to eliminate a position is given to the executive officer. While the exercise of the power is open to attack as not made in good faith, the power exists. To buttress this argument counsel again refers to the “Lay-Off” regulation (Footnote 2, supra) promulgated by the Civil Service Commission pursuant to Section 7-401 (o).

Much of appellee’s argument proceeds upon the assumption that this was the only reason for his dismissal.

The abolishment of the position thus alleged without more prevented . summary judgment for ■ the plaintiff not being entitled to notice and hearing before dismissal under the <em>Essinger </em>rule, no additional averments with respect thereto were required in order to. set forth a defense. It is unnecessary to again discuss contentions made by appellee in this regard which were considered and rejected in the <em>Gaul </em>case, supra.However,, appellee’s counsel makes the additional argu-. mentthat, unlike.the <em>Gaul </em>case where plaintiff did not plead whether or not notice was given to the employe, the plaintiff here havihg set forth that notice was given, and "Such'notice .stating that plaintiff’s Services- would “no longer-' be required, for cause”, it- must be assumed that the.'cause .of the dismissal was for reasons personal: to; .the employe, Jhat is, some delinquency .in the-per:., <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>forman.ce of Ms duties. Certainly the elimination of an employe’s position is as much a cause for his dismissal as the unsatisfactory performance of his duties. In <em>Crede v. Pittsburgh et al., </em><a href="/pa/355/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="355 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="468952" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0369-01">355 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.2d%20700" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="49 A.2d 700">49 A. 2d 700</a>, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Drew, said: “. . . In the instant case, the <em>elimination of two of the positions </em>of Assistant Engineer by City Council <em>for economy reasons was ‘just cause’ </em>for the discharge of two employees: . . . There was, therefore, nothing more for the Director to establish. . .”. (Emphasis supplied). However, assuming that the words “for cause” in the notice sent appellee have the restricted meaning ascribed to them by counsel, a sufficient answer to the contention based thereon is that appellee’s dismissal having occurred because of the abolishment of his position, no notice of any kind was required. That appellee’s employer did more than he was required to do is of no avail. Such volunteered action did not derogate from the propriety of the dismissal without notice under the <em>Essinger </em>rule. It is true that the notice given to the dismissed employe in the <em>Gornman </em>case was emphasized in the Opinion of the Court, but this must be taken in connection with and related to the admitted fact that the discharge there occurred because of delinquency in the performance of the employe’s duties. The underlying and basic reason for the decision in the <em>Gornman </em>case, as appears from a careful analysis of the Opinion of the Court and the Concurring Opinion was that as a matter of fundamental justice a municipal employe who enjoyed tenure of office was entitled to know and meet before dismissal the charges of delinquency made against him. Obviously this reason for notice and opportunity to be heard is not aplicable where the position in question is lawfully abolished. There can be no reinstatement to an office which no longer exists, and the manner in which the dismissed <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>incumbent performed the duties of his employment is of no consequence.</p>

She further averred that the first and only notice of dismissal she had received was a letter from the sheriff which read: “For just cause, your employment in the Sheriffs Office has been terminated, effective January 2, 1953. Any unfinished business, your Sheriff’s badge and identification card must be turned in to your immediate supervisor at once.”. As in the <em>Gaul </em>and <em>Jacobson </em>cases, the plaintiff prayed that she be restored to her position and be paid her damages. Defendants filed an answer denying that the plaintiff was employed as a chief clerk but that she had only performed clerical duties consisting of taking care of the purchasing items required by the sheriff’s office and seeing that the vouchers were properly forwarded, and also assisted in writing up summonses for prospective jurors and that the plaintiff was dismissed for . . just and proper cause, in the further reorganization of the Sheriff’s Department in order to effect efficiency and economy”, and that “plaintiff’s position was abolished and no other person was appointed to perform the functions and duties formerly performed by her”. Under New Matter it was <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>averred that on January 12, 1953 plaintiff had filed an appeal with the Civil Service Commission, which appeal was still pending and undetermined, averring that plaintiff had been earning compensation since her dismissal for which she had failed to give credit in her complaint and that “Defendants are further advised that to reinstate the plaintiff would impose an undue burden upon the City, would unjustly affect the public interest, and would tend to disorder and confusion.”. Following a motion by plaintiff for judgment on the pleadings the City was granted leave to file an amended answer which was filed and in which the averments of the original answer were repeated as to the abolishing of the plaintiff’s position. It was further averred that in addition to the written notice of January 2, 1953, plaintiff received oral notice shortly before that date from the deputy sheriff to the effect that in the process of reorganization of the sheriff’s office the duties which she performed were being consolidated and taken over by other employes of the office, naming them; and that although plaintiff had the opportunity to do so, she did not answer or attempt to answer these reasons.
