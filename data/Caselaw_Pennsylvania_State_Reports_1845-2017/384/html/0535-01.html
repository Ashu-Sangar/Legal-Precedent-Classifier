In reducing this amount, Judge Dallett in his adjudication in 24 District Reports 215, stated at page 221: ‘As was represented at the audit, the cemetery now holds a fund of $1000 for the care of this lot. Such reasonable amount as should be added for the purpose will be added, and the auditing judge, in the absence of an agreement of the parties, will determine what that amount should be at a subsequent audit.
