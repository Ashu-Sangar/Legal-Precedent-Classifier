The Pike at the point where the accident occurred was straight for three-quarters of a mile. The road varied in width from 18 to 21 feet and was divided by a white line in the center. Jensen’s motorcycle was following defendant’s automobile, which was on the proper side, namely, the right hand side of the road, and proceeding north on Limekiln Pike. Plaintiff testified that Jensen blew his horn to signify his intention of passing defendant, who was driving about 40 miles an hour; that defendant then <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>waved to Jensen to come by; that when Jensen was five or six feet to the rear of defendant’s car and had pulled cut to pass, defendant’s car drifted to its left — although still remaining on his own side of the road — thus causing a collision between some part of the motorcycle and the left rear fender of defendant’s automobile, as a result of which the motorcycle collided with the left side of Crew’s car coming in the opposite direction. Crew’s car was on his proper side of the road.</p>

The driver of Crew’s ear testified on behalf of the plaintiff, but did not materially aid plaintiff’s case. Defendant denied that he ever waved his hand or signaled to Jensen to pass him, although at best for plaintiff this would be an invitation to pass when safe, and not a command to pass or an all-clear signal. Cf. <em>Lewis v. Quinn, </em><a href="/pa/376/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="376 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1246202" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0109-01">376 Pa. 109</a>, 113, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20382" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="101 A.2d 382">101 A. 2d 382</a>.

The signed statement, incidentally, made no reference to any waving of the hand or similar signal by the defendant nor was any such signal seen by any other witness. Plaintiff at the trial denied knowledge of his signed statement and also denied his signature thereto. It is clear from the verdict that the jury must have believed defendant and the witnesses who testified in his favor. The negligence of Jensen, the driver of the motorcycle, was so obvious and flagrant, and the negligence of the ■ defendant so doubtful or non-existent, that it is clear that the jury brought in the only verdict which it <em>justly </em>could have rendered. • ■</p>

Evex*yone in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is of course entitled to a fair and impartial trial, but that does not mean that a trial Judge must be “a mere moderator”: <em>Welsbach v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/318/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="318 Pa. 166" data-case-ids="1159594" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0166-01">318 Pa. 166</a>, 170, <a href="/citations/?q=178%20A.%20126" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="178 A. 126">178 A. 126</a>. A Courtroom is a Court of Justice and not just a battleground for the tilting of attorneys or a testing of their wits and oratory — to so limit it would often jeopardize or defeat Justice. Judges should, within reasonable limitations, allow attorneys to try their own cases; they should refrain from extended examination of witnesses; they should not unnecessarily interrupt or rudely treat witnesses or counsel; and they should not, <em>unless the facts of the particular case and the interest of Justice warrant it, </em>express an opinion on the merits of the case or the witnesses’ credibility; and if they do so they must clearly explain to the jury that the facts and the credibility of the witnesses and the truth or falsity of their testimony is a matter solely for the jury. The Judge should also bear in mind that undue interference with the trial of a case and <em>undue </em>emphasis of one side of the case or intemperate treatment of witnesses or counsel are not in the interest of Justice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Myma, </em><a href="/pa/278/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="278 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1080524" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0505-01">278 Pa. 505</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20486" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="123 A. 486">123 A. 486</a>; <em>Welsbach v.

However, it is equally true that the facts in a particular case and the interest of Justice, which is paramount; may justify and sometimes may require a trial Judge to express his opinion of the credibility of witnesses or of the implausible story they fabricate or tell, and in such circumstances he is privileged to do so — provided there is rea<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>sonable ground for his comments and he clearly and unquestionably impresses on the jury that it is their understanding and recollection of the facts and their judgment of the witnesses’ testimony and the witnesses’ credibility which prevails.</p>

Kun of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The speech is a masterpiece in its partisan appeal under the guise of juristic logic, in its call for a unilateral verdict in the name of impartiality, and its appeal to a single track of thinking over a double track of argumentation.</p>

      <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>The facts of the lawsuit briefly are as follows: On October 6, 1951, the plaintiff Keating was a passenger on a motorcycle being operated by Edward Jensen in a northwardly direction on Limekiln Pike in Upper Dublin Township, Montgomery County, at a speed of about 40 to 45 miles per hour. On the same highway, and at a similar speed, proceeding in the same direction ahead of the motorcycle, the defendant William H. Belcher was driving a Packard automobile. Intending to pass the automobile, Jensen twice sounded his horn, whereupon, according to Keating, Belcher waved to Jensen to come ahead. Jensen denied that he so waved. What actually happened at the exact time of the accident became the issue of fact at the trial. The plaintiff contended that at the moment Jensen began to pass Belcher, Belcher turned to the left, the left rear of his car coming into contact with the front of the motorcycle which lost balance and was struck by another car (a Buick) coming from the opposite direction. As the result of the collision Jensen was killed and the plaintiff sustained grave injuries whose harrowing details need not be described here. The defendant, as indicated above, denied that he motioned Jensen to come ahead and he testified also that he was entirely unaware of the motorcycle behind him until he heard a crash and saw the motorcycle and two persons flying through th$ air.</p>
    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[158,1883,1149,487]],["BL_184.1",184,[228,387,1145,208]]]'>The resulting factual issue was a simple one. The plaintiff maintained that the defendant, without warning, swerved to the left into the motorcycle’s path after he had invited the motorcycle to proceed forward. The defendant insisted that he did not move into the motorcycle’s way, but that presumably the motorcycle driver carelessly ran into the rear of his car. If the accident happened as described by the plaintiff, he was entitled to a verdict; if it happened as the defendant narrated <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>it, the defendant was dne the verdict. According to the Judge’s charge, however, the jury was to reject the plaintiff’s claim, regardless of the contentions of the respective parties.</p>

But a reading of the record before us reveals that the Judge’s charge bears no resemblance to a measured, calm recital of facts and a reflective application of pertinent law to those facts. The charge was not a judicial pronouncement. It was a speech, an argument, a ringing appeal for vindication of the defendant. Although it sought to explain away every item of culpability which the evidence directed toward the defendant, it took up the plaintiff’s case point by point and replied to each with the all-annihilating condemnation of an advocate.</p>

But the speaker was not standing at the jury box rail as a lawyer, he was exhorting, in black robes, from the bench — as the voice of the law. And that voice made it clear from the very beginning — as the jury was compelled to appraise the picture — that the law was sounding a death knell to the claims of the plaintiff: “You must understand the duties that you have to perform as jurors. <em>You are not here to be moved by any emotional approach or suggestion or because, some person appears before you on crutches </em>or because as might happen in another case some person was killed somehow or other in an accident of some kind.

But in the <em>defendant’s </em>conduct the Judge perceives only unimpeachable correctness: “The main and almost exclusive duty of a person who is driving an automobile is to keep his eyes ahead of him. As a matter of fact, a person fails in his duty of operating an automobile if he does not keep his eyes ahead of him. He has to know where he is going, he has to look and see what is going on in front of him, and it is only in a rare kind of case that a person driving a car can be responsible for something that happens in back of him, because his duty, naturally, is to see where he is going and what conditions are ahead of him.”</p>

But it is not true that the defendant could exculpate himself from the charge of negligence by the simple remark that he looked ahead. What the Judge should have added at this point was that while the defendant must look ahead, there is a duty devolving upon him also, through the use of his rear mirror, to ascertain if anyone is endeavoring to pass him from behind, especially when some one sounds a signal from behind. The Judge neglected here, in addition, as indeed he did throughout the charge, to point out that while the car operator must keep the road ahead in his vision, he must also keep his car in the lane in which he is travelling unless he gives suitable warning to those immediately to the <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>rear that he intends to enter into another lane. The Judge apparently did not regard it appropriate here, as he did when discussing the plaintiff’s case, to tell the jury to “mark these qualifications.”</p>

Furthermore, it was possible that the officer honestly and innocently misunderstood what the plaintiff said, and it is also possible that the plaintiff himself erred in some detail of recollection. The horror of the accident was still upon him, he was trussed up in a painful cast, and he was under the influence of many medicines. The jury should have here been instructed to reconcile the conflicting testimony if possible and, if not, decide, using the standards of credibility, which witness more correctly recalled what was said. Instead, and without justification, the Judge placed his imprimatur on the officer’s unimpeachability and, in effect, branded the plaintiff a liar.</p>

In presenting his case to the jury he made no mention of anything like that. Mr. Winnet: No, because we didn’t stand on it, your Honor. However, it was brought out— The Court : It was not brought out properly. Mr. Winnet: I want to ask him now if he <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>knows at what period did he have delusions after the accident. The Court : He would not know that. It is an improper question.”</p>
    <p id="b199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[153,552,1149,437]]]'>The Judge here was triply improper. He was unjudicially contentious, he unfairly criticized plaintiff’s counsel, and he was tenaciously inaccurate on a scientific fact. It is not true that a former mental patient may not relate what he has experienced. There are many books written by persons who, having been in hospitals for the mentally ill, have well described their symptoms, treatments, and cures.</p>
    <p id="b199-6" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[151,998,1150,659]]]'>The Judge’s animadversions against counsel were only reflective of his attitude toward the whole plaintiff’s case, which he apparently was ready at any moment to condemn, disparage and belittle. When Mr. Winnet asked the plaintiff how far the defendant’s car had gone to the right, the Court broke in with a scoffing observation: “The Court: <em>Don’t draw on your imagination. </em>If you can answer these questions honestly, say so, <em>but don’t try to draw on your imagination. </em>If you can conscientiously answer the questions, do so, but if you cannot, don’t do it. This was all in fast motion, you see.”</p>

Since the whole issue in the trial was whether the defendant swerved his car into the path of the motorcycle or whether it swayed or drifted to the side, the Judge repeated several times that the car was not confined to a track: “The Court: Well, you have to be sure. You have to remember the words. You know, an automobile does not run on a track and there is a certain amount of weaving, you know, whoever is driving. It cannot be helped. Anyway, that is the way <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>he described it, that when they gave him the horn and all that, the car drifted a little to the right, and then his impression was that it drifted to the left a little.” . . . “The Court: As we remarked before, neither the car nor the motorcycle were on a rail. They were in motion and there is a certain amount of side motion, naturally, all the time. . . By the Court: Q. You know that, don’t you? A. Yes, your Honor. Q. It is not on a fixed rail. That applies not only to the automobile, but to the motorcycle. But, naturally, in trying to pass, whether it is an automobile or a motorcycle or whatever it is, you have to give yourself enough room to pass.”</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[264,1093,1151,542]]]'>Of course, it was inevitable that the jury would return a verdict for the defendant. Since the Judge made the last speech and there was no one to reply to the inaccuracies and irrationalizations in his summation, the jury accepted his version of what constituted truth and justice and returned the verdict he so obviously sought. In refusing the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, Judge Kun uncloaked his prejudice against the plaintiff by the very first sentence of his Opinion: “The plaintiff presented a rather extraordinary claim.”</p>
    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[260,1647,1149,544]]]'>The Judge said further: “As we have indicated, this was an unusual kind of claim, and what plaintiff really complains about is that the Trial Judge took too much caution by reminding the jury too frequently that their basic responsibility was to determine whether the defendant had been negligent. This approach to the conduct of the case is, it appears to us, necessary when there is a case of very severe injuries resulting from an unusual kind of occurrence, in which the basis for a defendant’s liability is rather nebulous, as in this case.”</p>
    <p id="b200-7" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[258,2203,1145,157]],["BL_201.1",201,[165,379,1147,267]]]'>Whether the defendant’s liability was “nebulous” was never really determined because the jury was so intimidated, coerced and practically bludgeoned into <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>their verdict that no conclusion can be based on their decision alone. The jury had no choice in returning the verdict they did without actually rebelling against the man who, wearing the indicia of absolute authority, became their master and dictated their judgment.</p>
