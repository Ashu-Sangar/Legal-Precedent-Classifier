    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[136,718,1149,716]]]'>On February 23, 1949, an unnamed driver for the defendant, Trenton Fast Freight, was driving a large commercial truck northwardly on Fifth Street when, for personal reasons, he stopped within the tunnel, without displaying any signal or illumination to warn other motorists of the danger his halted vehicle presented. This tunnel, which represents a continuation of Fifth Street, is a heavy travelled, through highway and is lighted with overhead bulbs. The truck, however, was of such enormous size that its bulk (it stood 25 feet against a 30 foot ceiling) shut off from motorists in the rear the overhead lights in front of the truck, thus creating a curtain of darkness before it.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[136,1448,1150,940]],["BL_116.1",116,[269,386,1143,146]]]'>While the defendant’s truck was so parked, the plaintiff in this case, Anthony Notarianni, was driving his automobile on Fifth Street and had started down the descent which leads into the tunnel. Because of the steep grade at this point, it is impossible for a traveler to see into the tunnel a greater distance than 5 or 10 feet. Having reduced his speed from 25-30 to 10-18 miles per hour Notarianni entered the tunnel. As he did so he experienced the sudden ephemeral blindness which strikes anyone who passes from the bright sunshine outdoors into a dimly lit indoors. Quickly blinking back to full vision, he presently perceived for the first time the defendant’s truck pointing into the curtain of darkness, and apparently moving forward. As the distance between the two vehicles shortened, however, he became aware that the truck was really stationary. Now only 10 feet away, he tried unsuc<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>cessfully to avoid striking the truck, and a collision followed, the plaintiff sustaining injuries irrelevant to the discussion here.</p>

The lower Court entered judgment n.o.v., which this Court has, I believe, unjustly affirmed. The Majority holds that the plaintiff’s failure to stop within the assured clear distance ahead constituted contributory negligence as a matter of law. It may well be that as against a norm of <em>perfect </em>driving, Notarianni erred in his appraisal of the conditions he found in the tunnel, but I fail to see where his conduct was so far removed from the standard applicable to the average safe motorist that it can be declared culpable by the Court. In <em>Todd v.

The negligence of the truck driver was uninhibited and flagrant. Only the most blunderheaded ineptness or insipid recklessness could have caused him to halt his truck in a heavily travelled passageway knowing that because of the lighting peculiarities of the locale, he would not be immediately visible to those entering the tunnel after him. The truck was a leviathan of the road, it was encrusted with mud and dirt, <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>its height blotted out the lights in front of it, it blended into the underground obscurity, and then became a menace to all travelers on the way.</p>

Even without the momentary blindness which curtained for an instant the vision of every motorist entering the tunnel, Notarianni could easily have been deceived into believing that the truck was in movement. He had only a second or two to analyze all the factors involved and conclude mentally that his senses were being deceived by an optical illusion. To penalize him for not possessing an acuity of vision not common to mankind is to impose patterns of behavior that the fairness of the law should abhor. It was not only Notarianni who was deceived. The motorist following him, a John Bigley, testified that he also was of the impression, when first seeing the truck, that it was moving.</p>

Since it was without fault on his part, we can no more say that he was bound to know what to do and actually to do it, within the short space of two seconds, whatever the cause of his blinding, especially as suddenly stopping would have put him in peril from the cars closely following him on the highway.”</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[254,996,1150,711]]]'>The momentary blindness which the plaintiff experienced in the case at bar was as fortuitous a visitation as a flash of lightning or a dazzling beam in the eye from another automobile’s headlights, in either of which cases the plaintiff is immune from the charge of contributory negligence. Why should he not be exonerated from blame here? In Pennsylvania the charge of contributory negligence is one ladened with dread. It represents the clap of doom to an injured claimant no matter how tainted with fault the defendant may be. Courts should, therefore, be hesitant in sentencing a plaintiff’s claim on that basis unless every inference supports the irrevocable and fatal condemnation.</p>

It simply means doing what one should not do, or failing to act as one should. The standard of performance as to what one should or should not do is intended to be that conduct which one expects in a reasonably prudent person. What is a reasonably prudent person? It is not a perfect man with perfect vision, hearing, perspective, intuition, foresight and hindsight. The reasonably prudent person whom the court decisions uphold as an exemplar of virtue is not a composite of Einstein, Lindbergh, Dr. Salk and Admiral Byrd. So far as the gasoline world is concerned, a reasonably prudent person <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>is one who, with ordinary faculties, comports himself according to the gauge of the average individual who has no desire to harm anyone else on the highway — and much less himself.

If the assured clear distance rule were to be applied with dogmatic literalness, recoveries would be exceedingly rare, for in each instance of a collision between a moving car and a stationary object, the motorist conceivably always has the capacity to see the object before he physically comes into contact with it. However, whether he sees it a thousand feet ahead or only 10 feet ahead depends on many factors which the law evaluates in the light of all the contending forces bent on mischief. Legal liability then attaches or detaches according to the reasonable possibility open to the motorist to avoid the mishap.</p>

If, however, a car should actually be parked or resting there in a disabled state without warning signal or light, the oncoming motorist could not be held guilty of contributory negligence if he crashed into it. If the law were to be interpreted otherwise, it would mean that every motorist approaching the crest of a hill would have to stop and conduct a reconnaisance before proceeding.

Breuer, </em><a href="/pa/363/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="363 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="1221607" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0101-01">363 Pa. 101</a>, the defendant placed on the highway a coil of steel <em>á </em>feet in diameter and 2 1/2 feet in height. The plaintiff driving at 30 miles per hour was momentarily blinded by the undimmed headlights of an approaching car <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>moving in the opposite direction. When' 40 feet from the obstacle he observed it for the first time. He explained at the trial that it seemed to him to be merely a patch in the road, its real character not being discernible because of the black tarpaulin cover on the black-top highway. In removing the nonsuit entered in the Court below, this Court, speaking through Justice Hoeace Steen (now Chief Justice), analyzed the phrase: “assured clear distance ahead”: “The question arises, then, as to the meaning of this latter phrase, that is to say, whether the word ‘assured’ is to be interpreted in an objective or a subjective sense. Does it mean the <em>actual </em>clear distance ahead, or does it mean what <em>appears </em>to a reasonably prudent driver, exercising due care, to be the clear distance ahead? . . . It would seem wholly unreasonable and unjust to hold that the operator of a motor vehicle was . . . subject ... to the characterization of his conduct as contributorily negligent because he did not lessen the speed !of his car in the face of what was actually an obstruction on the roadway but was so camouflaged or deceptive in appearance that even a reasonably careful driver would not have been able to <em>realize </em>that it was such until he was actually upon it.” (Emphasis in original Opinion.)</p>
