        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne:\nThis appeal is from a denial by the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County of appellant\u2019s petition for naturalization. The question presented is whether the appellant applied for an exemption, and was relieved thereby, from service in the armed forces of the United States on the ground that he was an alien. The trial court ruled that he had and, therefore, was ineligible to become a United States citizen.\nAppellant, a German national, has resided continuously in the United States since 1930. On March 2, 1942, appellant was examined by a Selective Service Local Board and, on the basis of War Department instructions excluding all enemy aliens from service, was placed in class 4-C, the class for unacceptable aliens. On August 12, 1942, petitioner furnished information from which an \u201cAlien\u2019s Personal History and Statement\u201d form (DSS 304) was completed. Section 41 of this form, allegedly signed by appellant, reads as follows : \u201c41.1 do object to service in the land or naval (do, do not) forces of the United States.\n\u201cYou are informed that if you are an enemy alien or subject of a country allied with the enemy, you will not ordinarily be acceptable for service in the land or naval forces of the United States if you indicate in Item 41 above that you object to such service. If you are a citizen or subject of any other country, you may indicate in Item 41 whether you do or do not object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States but such objection may be disregarded. If you are a citizen or subject of a neutral country, and you do not wish to serve in the land or naval forces of the United States, you may apply to your local board for Application by Alien for Relief from Military Service (Form 301) which, when executed by you and filed with the local board, will relieve you from the obligation to serve in the land or naval forces of the United States, but will also debar you from thereafter becoming a citizen of the United States.\u201d\nOn the basis of this statement, appellant\u2019s 4-C classification was continued. In 1944, appellant\u2019s case was reviewed by the Selective Service Board. It was reported by the Board\u2019s interviewer that appellant was unwilling to enter the United States Army. No forms were signed by appellant at this time and the 4-0 classification was continued. At no time did appellant complete an \u201cApplication of Alien for Relief from Training and Service in the Armed Forces\u201d. It is doubtful whether or not he would have been permitted to do so had he wished. Cf. Petition of Zumsteg, 122 F. Supp. 670, 672.\nIn 1953, appellant filed a petition for naturalization. A hearing was held before'an examiner who recommended that the petition be denied. The examiner concluded that petitioner was ineligible, for citizenship by virtue of Section 315 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 .Stat. 242, 8 U.S.O.A. 1426, which provides: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b) of this Act, any alien who applies or has applied for exemption or discharge from training or service in the Armed Forces or in the National Security Training Corps of the United States on the ground that he is an alien, and is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground, shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen of the United States, (b) The records of the Selective Service System or of the National Military Establishment shall be conclusive as to whether an alien was relieved or discharged from such liability for training or service because he was an alien.\u201d\nFollowing a trial, at which testimony was produced by both sides, but before disposition of the matter, the examiner withdrew the unfavorable recommendation and substituted a favorable recommendation. This was caused by the conclusion of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization that the phrase \u201cI do object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States\u201d by an enemy alien, did not constitute an application for exemption within the meaning of Section 315 of the Act. Notwithstanding the favorable recommendation, the trial court concluded: \u201c. . . that petitioner did apply for exemption from service ... on the ground that he was an alien, and was relieved from such service on such ground and that therefore he is ineligible to become a citizen.\u201d\nThe Federal Constitution, Article I, section 8, clause 4, provides that: \u201cThe Congress shall have power . . . to establish a uniform rule of naturalization. . Section 310 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 239, 8 U.S.C.A. 1421, confers upon specified Federal courts and all courts of record of the States and Territories_, the jurisdiction to naturalize persons as citizens of the United States. \u201c. . . All [Federal and State courts] are, for the purposes of the naturalization acts, federal courts, . . . one set of courts is not foreign to the other. . .\u201d.: United States v. Aaker vik, 180 Fed. 137, 141. State courts, therefore, must apply the Federal law. The Federal acts on naturalization are to be uniformally enforced in view of the express requirement that the rule of naturalization shall be uniform: In re Tomarchio, 269 Fed. 400; In re Martinez, 73 F. Supp. 101. In Clarke\u2019s Case, 301 Pa. 321, 152 A. 92, this Court stated (p. 325) : \u201c. . . such cases arise under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. . .\u201d. However, \u201c. . . . the state court does not act solely as a federal agency, but exercises judicial functions. . .\u201d. (p. 325) Thus the courts of common pleas of this state have jurisdiction to naturalize and while they can exercise independent discretion, such jurisdiction should be exercised in conformity with Federal law.\nWe also held in Clarke\u2019s Case, supra, that where a court of record of this state refuses an application for naturalization, an appeal in the nature of a certiorari is of right. This Court will examine the record in its broadest sense to determine the fundamental questions involved and, in so deciding, apply Federal law.\nThe District Court, Southern District of New York, in the Petition of Zumsteg, 122 F. Supp. 670, had before it the precise question here presented: Whether an affirmative answer to Question 41 in the \u201cAlien\u2019s Personal History and Statement\u201d is equivalent to an application for exemption from military service. That court held that it did not, stating (p. 672) : \u201c. . . The use of the words \u2018application * * in the manner prescribed by and in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the President\u2019 would appear to require that the applicant take a more affirmative step than merely giving an answer to one of the questions on a questionnaire relating to an alien\u2019s personal history, such as Form DSS 304. This is particularly so since neither the Act not (sic) the Selective Service Regulations permitted an \u2018application\u2019 to be made by an enemy alien, and, so far as the Selective Service Regulations were concerned, an affirmative answer to Question 41 on Form 304 would not necessarily relieve the applicant from military service.\u201d\nMarch 13, 1956 :\nThis decision, though not controlling in this appeal, is persuasive. Its conclusion is further buttressed by the decision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to withdraw its objection to petitioner\u2019s naturalization on the ground \u201c. . . that further evidence would be required to show that an affirmative application was made.\u201d\nFor these reasons, we reverse the order of the court below. The record is remanded to the court below to enter an order in accordance with this opinion.\nPee Curiam,\nThe foregoing opinion was prepared by the late Justice Allen M. Stearns before his death on February 28, 1956. It is now adopted and filed as the opinion of the Court.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno:\nIn August, 1942, when this country was at war with Nazi Germany, when American soldiers and sailors were being killed on land and sea, when Nazi airplanes were bombing helpless civilian populations of countries allied with America, when Nazi submarines were sinking ships bearing the flag of the United States, when, in short, the very existence of the United States was being threatened and the entire nation was on a war footing, Franz Albert Schulz, the petitioner in this case, being of draft aae. walked into the office of the Selective Service Local Board in Paoli, Chester County, and declared: \u201cI do object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States.\u201d\nThe privilege to refuse military service was one which this generous and noble nation afforded to any one who was a citizen of an enemy country, but it was a privilege not lightly acquired or indifferently proffered. By choosing to refrain from aiding the United States during war, the petitioner Schulz chose also to forfeit any claim he might have to citizenship in the country which he willingly disavowed in her hour of greatest need. Section 315 of the Immigration and Nationalization Act, 66 Stat. 242, provides: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 405 (b) of this Act, any alien who applies or has applied for exemption or discharge from training or service in the Armed Forces or in the National Security Training Corps of the United States on the ground that he is an alien, and is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground, shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen of the United States \u201d\n\u25a0Schulz came to America in 1932 and, with the exception of two trips back to Germany in 1935 and 1936, has remained here ever since. When war broke out with Nazi Germany in 1941, he had already been a resident here for eleven years but he had made no application for American citizenship. The citizenship which he desires today was no less worthy in 1942 when he Was given the opportunity with millions of other Americans to uphold the democratic institutions of this country by shouldering a ri\u00f1e in her defense. There Were legions of young men of Germanic origin or derivation who saw no Teutonic ideal in the program and policies of the tyrannical Nazi regime, and who were \u25a0willing and eager to join with Americans of every national origin to defeat Hitler and thus bring Germany back into the sisterhood of God-fearing, international-law-abiding nations.\nSchulz affected to see in American military service an inevitable warring upon his own family. He said in a letter he wrote to the Local Selective Service Board on August 17, 1942 that \u201cit would be hard for me to go against my own kin.\u201d However, in December, 1943, local boards were directed to notify all enemy aliens that they could, by withdrawing their previous objections to military service, ask for assignment to a theatre of war where they would not be required to fight against fellow-nationals or blood relatives. This alternative did not interest Schulz because, it soon became apparent, it was not fighting against his own kin which disturbed him \u2014 he spurned serving in the United States forces anywhere. In February, 1944, after questioning Schulz on this whole matter of military service, the Chairman of the Selective Service Board wrote to the Legal Advisor at State headquarters in Harrisburg that \u201cit was his opinion and conviction that he [Schulz] did not want to enter the Army under any circumstances,\u201d and added that Schulz \u201cseemed unwilling to enter the United States Army for service even in continental United States \u201d\nWith this history of the case before us, it would seem as obvious as an unsheathed bayonet that Schulz did, in every sense of the word, apply for exemption from military service, that the exemption was granted and that, therefore, under Section 315 of the Naturalization Act he made himself ineligible for United States citizenship.\nThe Majority of this Court, however, is of the opinion that Schulz did not disqualify himself for citizenship. When Schulz first reported to the Local Selective Service Board lie completed a questionnaire, known as D. S. S. Form 304, in wliicli lie stated, as already indicated, \u201cI do object to service in the land or naval forces of the United States.\u201d The Majority says that this statement does not show that he applied for exemption from military service.\nThe Majority endeavors to support its position by asserting that Schulz never executed, during the war, a formal \u201cApplication for Belief from Training and Service in the Armed Forces.\u201d But this conclusion of the Majority plants a dead tree in the forest of argumentation: There is nothing in the Selective Service Act which says that the relief from military service must be applied for on any particular form or in any designated phraseology. The Naturalization Examiner, who conducted the preliminary examination on Schulz\u2019s petition for naturalization, reported to the Court of Common Pleas that Schulz did, in fact, \u201capply for relief from training and service in the armed forces\u201d: \u201cIt is submitted in the opinion of this Service, that an alien enemy who on D.S.S. Form 304 expressed his objection to service in the Armed Forces and who by reason thereof was found \u2018not acceptable\u2019 by the Armed Forces, thereby being deferred from training and service, is to be regarded as one who applied for and was granted exemption on the ground of alienage and is therefore ineligible to become a citizen by virtue of the provisions of Section 315.\n\u201cUnder the regulations of the Selective Service System and under the policy of the War Department, an alien of enemy nationality who did object was thereby, as a matter of policy, relieved from service in the Armed Forces.\u201d\nThus, no matter what printed form was used, the fact is as historically established as Hitler\u2019s defeat, that Schulz, because of representations made by himself, was relieved from service in the Armed Forces. It is also incontrovertible that despite his excuses that he objected to military service because he was reluctant to fight his own kin, Schulz did in fact refuse military service, as reported by the Naturalization Examiner, \u201cin a non-German theatre of war or as a non-combatant.\u201d The verities in this whole case are, and the record vividly demonstrates them,- that Schulz found it convenient to use his enemy alienage as a parachute of safety from the dangers of war. No one particularly enjoys the prospect of going to war with the potential prospect of returning to civilian life maimed and crippled or not returning at all, but men of honor and of devotion to truth and justice place the fate and destiny of the nation above individual convenience or desire. It does not seem fair, in the universal appraisement of what is just, to those who did their grim duty in the gory and muddy foxholes, in the harrowing holds of battered and sinking ships, and in the sulphurcharged clouds of embattled aircraft, to give to unhelping enemy aliens the same honorable reward which was purchased by patriots at the expenditure of sweet blood and salty tears. It is for that reason that Congress solemnly declared that \u201cany alien who applied or has applied for exemption or discharge from . . . service in the Armed Forces . . . and is or was relieved . . . from such . . . service on such ground, shall be permanently ineligible, to become a citizen of the United States.\u201d If there is to be any modification of this rule, it is for Congress to make the modification, not the Courts. In the confused, half-starved, disordered and even perilous state of the outside world today, American citizenship has become perhaps the most treasured possession on either hemisphere. It should not b\u00e9 casually conferred, as indeed it should not be casually taken away.\nIt is true that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization has withdrawn the unfavorable recommendation made by the Examiner, but we are not bound by the Commissioner\u2019s conclusions. We will accept the facts found by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but the interpretation of the law is to be left to this Court. And in that respect I do not understand why the Majority of this Court goes along with the Immigration Service in straining at the gnat of the phrase applying for exemption from military service and swallowing whole the camel of the petitioner\u2019s statement that he objected to military service.\nWhat is the difference between \u201capplying for exemption from military service\u201d and \u201cobjecting to military service\u201d? It is the difference between a white horse with black stripes and a black horse with white stripes.\nI dissent.\nMr. Justice Bell joins in this dissent.\nAll italics mine.",
