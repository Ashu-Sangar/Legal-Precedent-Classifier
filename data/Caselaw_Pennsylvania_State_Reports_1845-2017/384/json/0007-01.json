        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nIn this case a draft of a proposed agreement for the leasing of coal lands with certain surface rights for a stripping operation was submitted to the prospective contracting parties. Following a description of the properties, the writing contained eleven consecutively numbered paragraphs of terms and conditions. Paragraph 9 provided that \u201cNo modification, alteration, waiver or addition to this agreement or any part thereof, shall be valid or binding or be set up or relied upon by either party unless the same is in writing and signed by Haddock and Petrie. No evidence of any such modifications, alterations, waiver or addition shall be received in any controversy arising out of this agreement, unless it is in writing and signed as aforesaid.\u201d\nThe agreement, as drawn, was not acceptable to tbe lessors because of tbe limitation, under tbe terms and conditions of paragraph 2, placed upon tbe lessee\u2019s responsibility for tbe filling in of excavations with tbe waste and spoil from tbe coal stripping. Tbe lessors were unwilling to enter into an agreement, and so stated, unless it provided that, after tbe coal bad been removed from tbe tracts of ground by tbe stripping method, tbe lessor would \u201cback fill all of tbe excavations, restoring tbe land as near as possible to its present contour.\u201d This condition was assented to by tbe lessee subject, however, to tbe addition of a further clause that tbe provision last above-quoted \u201cdoes not mean that [tbe lessee] shall bring on to tbe property new ground.\u201d This qualification was satisfactory to tbe lessors and a new paragraph 2 was drafted with an introduction that \u201cTbe following paragraph is substituted for paragraph 2 of the original agreement.\u201d A presently immaterial clause (c) was also included as an addition to paragraph 7 of tbe contract. A copy of tbe additional writing, titled \u201cAddenda\u201d, was then attached to tbe original draft agreement in triplicate following tbe place provided for tbe signatures of the contracting parties. That was done with tbe assent and approval of all parties who thereupon formally executed tbe contract, as so amended, by signing it at tbe place provided in tbe original draft for tbe signatures of tbe parties.\nAfter tbe lessee removed all of tbe coal, tbe lessors sued to recover damages for tbe lessee\u2019s alleged failure to back fill the excavations made in tbe stripping operation so as to restore tbe land as nearly as possible to its original contour. At trial, tbe plaintiffs offered, and tbe learned trial judge admitted over tbe defendant\u2019s objection, testimony supporting tbe plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Tbe defendant\u2019s objection to tbe proffered evidence was that paragraph 9 of the contract, which appeared above the signatures of the parties, by its terms excluded any reference to the substitute paragraph 2 because the latter was unsigned by the parties. The jury returned a money verdict for the plaintiffs upon which the court below entered judgment after refusing the defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial and judgment n.o.v. The defendant appealed and assigns here for error the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony as to the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the condition of substitute paragraph 2 as to back-filling excavations so as to restore the land as nearly as possible to its original contour.\nThe action of the learned trial judge was proper. A party\u2019s signature to a contract is designed to evidence his intention to be bound thereby. There is no requirement that a contract be signed at any particular place so long as the signatories attest the meeting of their minds on the basis of the agreed-upon writings and their intention to be obligated accordingly. What the parties to the contract in suit agreed upon before they signed it was that the attached written paragraph 2 was a substitute for paragraph 2 as contained in the original draft. In short, the substitute paragraph 2 was neither a modification, alteration, waiver nor addition to the agreement but was an integral part of the proposed contract at the time the parties executed it. In such event, a party to a contract may show by parol that an added, although unsigned, written provision was an intended constituent part of the agreement between the parties at the time they appended their signatures to the contract. The ruling in Cox v. Burdett, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 346, 348-350, is directly in point.\nIn the Cox case, supra, the plaintiffs sued in replevin on a contract that had originally been drawn as a bailment of a mill. The defendants alleged, however, that a part of the contract was an agreement by the plaintiffs to \u201c \u2018furnish sufficient (timber to keep the mill in constant operation and . . . not to permit the mill to remain idle for more than twenty days at a time\u2019 \u201d and that this condition was written at the time the original agreement was made, before signing, and was assented to by all the parties, but that their signatures to the contract were placed above the written addition because the place for the signatures had been arranged before the new provision was added. The Superior Court said that the defendants\u2019 offer to prove default by the plaintiffs in furnishing timber for the mill \u201cwas not an offer to contradict or change in any way a written agreement by parol. It was simply an effort to prove that the addition was part of the original agreement and, notwithstanding the fact that the signatures were above it, that it was as much a part of the agreement as though it was above the signatures.\u201d\nThe extended and convincing review of the evidence in the instant case by Judge Thompson in the opinion for the court below renders unnecessary our entering upon a consideration of the sufficiency of the testimony adduced by the plaintiffs to support their allegations respecting the timely adoption of the substituted paragraph 2 of the contract. It is beyond dispute, indeed it is conceded by the defendant, that substitute paragraph 2 was an intended part of the original contract by agreement of the parties prior to their signing the contract. All that the appellant argues is that the parties failed to effectuate substitute paragraph 2 as a part of the contract when they neglected to sign the attached writing.\nJudgment affirmed.",
