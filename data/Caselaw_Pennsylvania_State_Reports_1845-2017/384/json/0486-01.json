        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nPlaintiffs appeal from the refusal of their motion for new trial in this action of trespass for personal injuries to plaintiff-wife, arising out of an automobile collision. The case was tried before a jury and resulted in a verdict for defendant.\nThe sole basis for new trial urged on this appeal is that the court below erred in its affirmance of defendant\u2019s seventh point for charge, which read: \u201cMrs. Sullivan, in making a turn into a private driveway from a through highway where the speed limit was 50 miles per hour, is to be held strictly accountable for the manner in which she drove.\u201d Prior to so charging, the court had fully and properly charged the jury on negligence and contributory negligence in all respects.\nOn the day in question, plaintiff-wife was driving westerly, and defendant was operating his automobile in an easterly direction, on route 322 in the village of Fontana. The highway is 22 feet in width and has a black top surface. As plaintiff reached a point opposite a private driveway to her left, she stopped on the berm on her right side to permit a truck, travelling in the same direction, to pass her. She then looked to the west and, observing no approaching traffic, turned left to proceed towards the private driveway. When she was approximately one-half of the distance across the highway she saw defendant approaching from the west at a fast rate of speed, and at a distance of about 400 feet. From the point of impact there is a clear view to the west for as much as 662 feet. Plaintiff estimated defendant\u2019s speed at 50 to 70 miles per hour. The evidence also established that there were \u201ctwo unbroken parallel skid marks 60 feet long on the eastbound lane from the debris west.\u201d Defendant and his witness testified to a speed of approximately 40 miles per hour; that plaintiff \u201cdarted across the street\u201d; and that he could not avoid striking her. The speed limit was 50 miles per hour.\nA careful examination of the charge is convincing that the jury was fully informed and could have been under no misapprehension as to the law or the facts. As the court below well said:\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff-operator was under the same duty of care as if she were entering a through highway . . .\n\u201c. . . it is clear that this plaintiff, after stopping on the north berm of said through highway, upon entering the through highway, observed the defendant\u2019s car approaching from her right, but continued to cross said highway in front of it although she had ample opportunity to stop and avoid the collision. While she complied with the duty of stopping her car before entering the through highway and complied with the requirements that she should look in both directions before entering the intersection, her duty did not end there. She was required to yield the right of way to vehicles approaching from either direction on the through highway. When she moved forward and entered the intersection it was also her duty to continue to look as she advanced in the intersection and to keep her car under control so she could stop at any moment to avoid a collision. . . .\n\u201cAs to defendant\u2019s seventh Point for Charge, the plaintiffs argue that said Point was tantamount to said court charging the jury that if plaintiff made a turn into a private driveway into [from] a through highway and an accident resulted she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law and that it placed an unfair burden upon the plaintiff. With this argument we cannot agree. 'The phrase in said point, \u2018to be held strictly accountable for the manner in which she drove\u2019, merely means that she would be answerable and liable for any negligence which the jury would find that she was guilty of. The construction of the words, \u2018strictly accountable,\u2019 is said to mean, in the New World Dictionary based on Webster, \u2018answerable, responsible, and liable to be called to account\u2019. In \u2018Words and Phrases,\u2019 Volume 1, \u2018accountable\u2019 is defined to be \u2018liable for\u2019. Wherefore, under the law, and the proper construction of the term used, we are of the opinion that the plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the averment (s) of the said Point(s) for Charge . ..\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno:\nIt is a matter of philosophical wonderment to me how persons of education will, in order to achieve a certain predetermined effect, attempt to stretch, twist, distend, shrink and manipulate the significance of the simplest language into a meaning bearing no resemblance to the intent of the original words. The Trial Judge in this case, in his charge to the jury, said: \u201cMrs. Sullivan, in making a turn into a private driveway from a through highway where the speed limit was 50 miles per hour, is to be held strictly accountable for the manner in which she drove.\u201d This declaration obviously says that Mrs. Sullivan turned from a 50-mile-per-hour-speed-through-highway into a private highway, and by so doing, committed a wrong for which she was liable. This utterance by the Trial Judge stripped from the jury\u2019s deliberations all consideration of the subject of contributory negligence. In words as clear as lettered blocks to a child, the Judge said that Mrs. Sullivan was guilty of a fault for which she was to be held \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d by the jury. And if the jury obeyed the Judge\u2019s instructions, as we must assume they did, it was inevitable that the jury would turn the plaintiff out of court. This the jury did, and the plaintiff has ashed for a new trial.\nI believe she is entitled to that new trial because it was the Judge\u2019s instructions which opened the gate through which-her chance of a recovery disappeared into the mists of oblivion. What are the facts in this case? On June 30, 1953, Mrs. Sullivan was driving her car westwardly on Route 322 in the town of Fontana, Lebanon County, and at about 11:30 a.m., arrived at a point opposite the house she intended to visit. She stopped her car, waited to allow a truck to pass by, and then proceeded from the north side of the highway to the south side, in order to enter the private driveway flanking the house which was her destination. As she was accomplishing this crossing and before she had reached the south margin of the road, she was struck by the defendant\u2019s car. The question for the jury to decide, (holding in abeyance the question of negligence of the defendant), was whether Mrs. Sullivan, in transversely crossing Route 322, had committed an act of contributory negligence. That question was exclusively one of fact. No law prohibited Mrs. Sullivan from passing from the north to the south border of Route 322. The only restriction on her crossing the road was that she exercise due care. Did she exercise due care? The Judge did not permit the jury to decide that factual issue. He categorically announced that by turning from a Through Highway into a private driveway, Mrs. Sullivan committed an act for which she was strictly accountable. In other words, she was guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe Judge\u2019s statement was additionally erroneous in that it conveyed the idea that Mrs. Sullivan swerved from the highway while driving at a high rate of speed (possibly 50 miles per hour) and then dashed across the street, aiming at the private driveway. The facts of course, were otherwise. As already stated, she made a full stop and from a stationary position started across a highway which was only 22 feet wide. She was struck before she could possibly have acquired any appreciable momentum.\nThe Trial Judge attempts to dilute the significance of his phrase, \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d, by saying that it merely means that Mrs. Sullivan \u201cwould be answerable and liable for any negligence which the jury would find that she was guilty of.\u201d But he did not say that. He said that Mrs. Sullivan was to be held strictly accountable period. He did not instruct the jury that they were to weigh all the facts and decide whether her method of crossing convicted her of contributory negligence. He gave the jury no choice of decision whatsoever. And this Court has affirmed the Judge\u2019s conspicuous and flagrant error.\nWhat does the phrase \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d really mean? Invariably it is predicated on an assumed trespass of some kind. It is practically impossible to employ the expression in any but a threatening or punitive sense. Who has not seen signs on private property reading: \u201cPersons crossing this line will be held strictly accountable\u201d?\n\u201cStrictly accountable\u201d easily conjures up the scene of a policeman taking someone into custody; it pictures an aggrieved person instructing his lawyer to prepare an action against the aggressor; it suggests the legal sword h\u00e1lf-dr'awn from the saber. ' ........\nThe Majority Opinion (by, affirming the lower Court\u2019s Opinion) endeavors to explain away the severe connotation of \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d by pointing to the work \u201cWords and Phrases,\u201d where accountable is defined to be \u201cliable for.\u201d But by defining accountable, the Majority only explains one-half of the phrase. The Majority\u2019s explanation can be likened to an argument that there is nothing dangerous about \u201ca snake in the grass\u201d because \u201cgrass\u201d is harmless. It is interesting to note further that the writer of the original Opinion was on the wrong path and turned off at the wrong well when he quoted from \u201cWords and Phrases,\u201d because the definition of \u201caccountable\u201d in the volume cited, has to do with promissory notes, not a motorist crossing the street! \u201cWords and Phrases\u201d says: \u201c \u2018Accountable\u2019 when written on the back of a note after an indorser\u2019s name, means \u2018subject to pay,\u2019 \u2018responsible\u2019, or \u2018liable for/ \u201d This, then, is the authority for allowing a misuse of words which deceived the jury \u2014 and deprived Mrs. Sullivan of a fair trial. The Majority, (still quoting from the lower Court), purports to quote from \u201cthe New World Dictionary based on Webster,\u201d but there, again, the definition is of the single word \u201caccountable,\u201d and not the phrase \u201cstrictly accountable.\u201d Standing alone, \u201caccountable\u201d is as far removed from \u201cstrictly accountable\u201d as \u201cchestnut\u201d is from a \u201cchestnut horse.\u201d\nThe Majority Opinion says that: \u201cA careful examination of the charge is convincing that the jury was fully informed and could have been under no misapprehension as to the law or the facts.\u201d But this observation suggests a reading of the jury\u2019s mind with an optical instrument of some kind which is denied to me. I do not know what the jury thought or under what apprehension they were. I only know what the Judge told them. He said: \u201cUnder the decisions of our Court it is the duty of the Jury to accept from the Court, that is, the Trial Court, the rules of law governing the case, that being the best evidence of the law that the Jury can have; and you may not disregard what the Court says about the law, whether it seems reasonable or unreasonable.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nUnder that definitive instruction, which amounted to an admonition of possible punishment if they did not accept the Judge\u2019s statement, the Jury had to take as Holy Writ what he said to them about the law\u2014 reasonable or unreasonable. There could well have been several jurors who thought that the Judge\u2019s instructions were unreasonable, but they could not refuse the deceptive lantern he handed them.\nBut, even without the above quoted statement on the supreme power of the Judge, the jury looks upon the Judge as the authoritative expression of the law. The word of the Judge in the courtroom is like the directive of an army general in the field, the command of an admiral over his fleet, or the ukase of an absolute monarch in his kingdom. It is because of this required obedience of the jury to the judge\u2019s instructions that the appellate courts are called upon to review the words and the actions of the Courts below. But if we are to take the Trial Judge\u2019s words and force them into a mold which will support the verdict, regardless of their reasonableness, we may as well abdicate our functions of review and proclaim the infallibility of the Trial Judge.\nI believe that this Court should hold Trial Judges strictly accountable for giving erroneous instructions to the jury by requiring the awarding of new trials in such cases.",
