Beaumont Administratrix of Theodore Beaumont, deceased, Appellant.\nMortgage \u2014 Title-Affidavit of defense.\nIt is no defense to a mortgage that the mortgagor had no mortgageable interest in or title to the land. The purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale in foreclosure proceedings will take whatever interest, if any, the mortgagor had in the land, and no more.\nArgued Feb. 7, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 5, Jan. T., 1899, by Mary E. Beaumont, administratrix, one of the defendants, from order of C. P. Chester Co., April Term, 1898, No. 60, making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nScire facias sur mortgage.\nMary A. Beaumont, administratrix of Theodore Beaumont, deceased, filed an affidavit of defense in which she averred that the mortgagors, Rush Beaumont and Theodore Beaumont, had, under the will of Eber Beaumont, which was fully recited in the affidavit of defense, no power to mortgage the premises directly or indirectly \u201c and no power to convey for the purpose of mortgage such real estate.\u201d\nThe court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nJSrror assigned was the order of the court.\nCharles U. Pennypacker, for appellant.\nIs not this the time and place to discuss the validity of the mortgage ? The record was notice to the mortgagee that the mortgagor had no vested interest: Barger\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 289.\nAfter a scire facias on a mortgage has ripened into a judgment the mortgage is merged in it and, even if null and void, is no longer open to attack: Hartman v. Ogborn, 54 Pa. 120; Dorris v. Erwin, 101 Pa. 239; Michaelis v. Brawley, 109 Pa. 7; Shryock v. Buckman, 121 Pa. 248.\nJohn Gf. Johnson, with him .Edmund Gr.
