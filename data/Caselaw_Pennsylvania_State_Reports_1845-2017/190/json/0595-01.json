    "head_matter": "Mary A. Brady, Appellant, v. Northwestern Masonic Aid Association.\nInsurance \u2014 Life insurance \u2014 Payment of premium \u2014 Condition precedent.\nWhere a policy of life insurance provides that the policy shall not be binding until the first premium shall have been paid, and it appears in an action upon the policy that the company had received nothing from the insured except a worthless check, the policy should uoL be admitted in evidence, and a judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiff is properly entered.\nArgued March 22, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 18, Jan. Ti, 1899, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Pliila. Co., Sept. T., 1895, No. 72, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Stekhett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit upon a policy of life insurance.\nAt the trial it appeared that a policy on the life of Frank J. Brady, in the sum of $10,000, in favor of his sister, the plaintiff, was issued by the defendant and delivered to Brady by W. H. Stirling, defendant\u2019s general agent. Brady gave Stirling a worthless check in payment of the first premium.\nThe policy provided as follows: \u201c In consideration of ... . and of the payment of all premiums herein required, the first of which must be paid on the delivery hereof and before this policy shall in any manner be binding upon the association.\u201d\nAfter the check had been dishonored, Brady returned the policy to Stirling who retained it until after Brady's death, when he returned it to the defendant association. During the trial, plaintiff called upon the defendant to produce the policy. The court refused to admit the policy in evidence saying:\nThis case is so simple and so plain that there is no occasion' to consider what the conditions might be if the facts were otherwise than they are. The facts are that this policy, under its terms, was to go into effect upon payment of a premium. Now what was done was that Mr. Brady gave a worthless check, and as has been cited here, the presentation of a check is a representation that there is money to pay it, and therefore tins is in the same position as if it had been paid in counterfeit money, and 1 sustain the objection to the policy. [2]\nThe court entered judg\u2019ment of nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off. [1]\nErrors assigned were (1) refusal to take off nonsuit; (2) rulings on evidence, quoting the bill of exceptions.\nBenj. E. Perkins, with him John F. Keator and John S. Free\u25a0mann, for appellant.\nW. H. Stirling had authority to waive the stipulation requiring repayment of the premium: Richards on Insurance, sec. 93; May on Insurance (3d ed.), sec. 360; Elkins & Co. .v. Ins.

McMillen, 24 Ohio, 67.\nUnder this provision the insurance could not attach until the premium was paid.\nThis provision was brought home to Brady\u2019s knowledge both in the application and in the certificate itself, and he knew that the policy would not go into effect until the payment of the premium.\nAll the evidence shows conclusively that the premium was not paid.\nThis clause expressly forbade any agent to give credit for the premium or to effect insurance without payment therefor.\nGranting that the agent had such power, there is no evidence that he ever attempted or intended to waive the payment.\nApril 3, 1899:"
