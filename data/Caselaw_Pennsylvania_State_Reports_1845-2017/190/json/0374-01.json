The correctness of its judgment is amply vindicated in the opinion of its learned president. , ,\nOn that opinion the judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "The City of Harrisburg v. S. J. Shepler, Appellant.\nMunicipal law \u2014 Divisible contract \u2014 Controller's certificate \u2014 Performance and acceptance.\nWhere the consideration of a municipal contract is divisible, the cost of one part of the work being chargeable to one item of appropriation and the cost of the other part being chargeable to another item, and the work has been performed in accordance with the terms of the contract, and has been accepted by the city, the controller\u2019s failure to charge the estimated expenditure for the former part of the work to the proper appropriation and to certify the fact upon the contract, does not prevent its taking effect in other particulars when, as to the other part of the expenditure thereunder, the controller did his duty.\nMunicipal contract \u2014 Controller's certificate after work done \u2014 Affirmance of contract \u2014 Equities of property owner.\nWhere a sufficient appropriation has been made to meet the expenditure of a proposed contract, and no act necessary to give the contract full effect remained unperformed except the bare indorsement of the controller\u2019s certificate, while performance of this statutory duty cannot be waived by the city officers, yet, if the certificate be placed on the contract after the completion of the work, where the controller had full authority to certify it before the work began, and the city ratifies it, the city is bound as between the city and the contractor, and the rights of the property owner rise no higher than the rights of the city.\nA municipal contract for paving, providing for payment partly in cash for city property and by assessments against property of abutting owners, is one \u201cinvolving the appropriation of money\u201d under the Act of May 23., 1889, P. L. 277, and the validity of the contract is dependent upon the performance of required functions imposed on the controller in the matter certifying the item of appropriation on which it is founded. A certificate failing to indicate the cash appropriation and indicating only the total assessments is defective.\nPublic officers \u2014 Engineer's duties in assessing cost \u2014 Confirmation by city when not required.\nWhere, in a municipal contract for paving, the ordinance directs the city engineer to assess the cost of paving, without directing him to report his schedule to the councils for approval, such duty so delegated to the engineer being purely a ministerial one, a simple mathematical calculation, with which the principal finds no fault, and in which none is alleged, the contract will not be declared invalid on the technical objection that the city has not affirmatively approved the engineer\u2019s figures in his divisions and additions.\nArgued March 9, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 8, May T., 1899, by defendant, from judgment of Superior Court, March T., 1898, No. 47, from judgment of C. P. Dauphin Co., Jan. T., 1898, No. G7, in favor of defendants, on case stated.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from the Superior Court.\nThe case was reported in 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 491, where the facts fully appear.\nError assigned was the judgment of the Superior Court.\nWilliam H. Middleton, for appellant.\n\u00fc. 1L Bergner, with him D. S. Seitz, city solicitor, for appellee.\nMarch 20, 1899:"
