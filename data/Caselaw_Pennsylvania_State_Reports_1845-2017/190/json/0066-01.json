        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThis appeal is from the refusal of the court to take off the judgment of nonsuit entered on the trial of an action for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. No reason of record appears to have been given by the learned court in support of the action complained of, nor does the testimony introduced by the plaintiff disclose any sufficient ground therefor. On the contrary, the evidence was quite sufficient to carry the case to the jury on questions of fact, which, if determined in plaintiff\u2019s favor, would have entitled him to a verdict. The nonsuit cannot be sustained on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury. While there may be some evidence from which a juiy might possibly infer that the plaintiff himself was not wholly free from contributory negligence, it is not of such a character as to justify the court in holding as matter of law that he was guilty of any negligence that contributed to his injury. At best, the evidence referred to is barely sufficient to warrant submission of the question to a jury. Whether the plaintiff was or was not guilty of contributory negligence must be inferred from all the facts and circumstances di&'closed by the testimony, and such inferences of fact are for the jury and not for the court: Merriman v. Phillipsburg Borough, 158 Pa. 78; Borough of Easton v. Neff, 102 Pa. 474.\nIt is unnecessary to refer in detail to the testimony introduced by the plaintiff. It evidently tended to sustain his claim, and clearly involved questions of fact which were for the determination of the jury. We are all of opinion that there is nothing in it to justify the court in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit.\nJudgment reversed and procedendo awarded.",

Ardis.\nNegligence \u2014 Negligent trimming of trees \u2014 Sidewalk\u2014Nonsuit.\nIn an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by being struck by the limb of a tree which the defendant and his workmen were trimming, it is error to enter a nonsuit where the plaintiff\u2019s testimony tended to show that he did not notice the men at work as he passed on the sidewalk under the tree; that no attempt had been made to rope off the pavement upon which the tree stood, and no warning had been given him of the danger.\nNegligence \u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Province of count and jury.\nWhether in an accident case plaintiff was or was not guilty of contributory negligence must be inferred from all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony; and such inferences of fact are for the jury and not for the court.\nArgued Jan. 18, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 319, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1897, No. 432, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Stbrrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Biddle, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that on July 22, 1897, plaintiff was injured by being struck by a limb which defendant and his workmen cut off while engaged in trimming a tree. The evidenee on behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that he went upon the sidewalk under the tree without noticing the workmen ; that no attempt had been made to rope off the pavement upon which the tree stood, and no one had been stationed to warn pedestrians of the danger. One of the witnesses for the plaintiff testified that any one walking on the street could have seen what was going on if he had looked. He, however, testified that he did not see the plaintiff passing. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit without stating any reasons therefor, and subsequently discharged the rule to take off the nonsuit.\nError assigned was refusal to take off the nonsuit.\nIsaac Hassler, with him Henry W. Scarborough, for appellant.\nThere is no sufficient evidence to hold as a matter of law that plaintiff could have seen the danger by the exercise of reasonable care: Kohler v. Penna. R. Co., 135 Pa. 346.\nInferences from the facts are for the jury: Yannattav. Cent. R. R., 154 Pa. 202; Davidson v. Ry. Co., 171 Pa. 522; Ely v. Ry., 158 Pa. 283; Merriman v. Phillipsburg Borough, 158 Pa. 78; Beach on Contributory Negligence, sec. 36.\nThe question whether the plaintiff did see, or ought reasonably to have seen the danger, when he says he did not see, and there is ho clear evidence that he could have seen, is for the jury: Bloomsburg Steam Co. v. Gardner, 126 Pa. 80; Porker v. Sandy Lake Boro., 130 Pa. 123 ; Readdy v. Shamokin, 137 Pa. 92; Biggs v. West Newton Boro., 164 Pa. 341; Chilton v. Carbondale, 160 Pa. 463; Fee v.
