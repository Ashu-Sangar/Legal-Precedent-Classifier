    "head_matter": "Joshua R. Serfass, Appellant, v. Abraham L. Serfass and Orrin Serfass.\nWills \u2014 jRule in Shelley's case \u2014 Fee simple estate.\nTestator directed as follows: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath unto my daughter all that certain lot (describing it) to be held, used, occupied and enjoyed by her during the term of her natural life, and at her decease I do order and direct that the same shall pass and descend to her heirs, or next of kin, in like manner as though she had been seized thereof in her lifetime in fee simple sole and unmarried, and had died intestate.\u201d Held, that the daughter took an estate in fee simple.\nArgued March 6, 1899.\nAppeal, No. 176, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Northampton Co., May T., 1898, No. 2, dismissing bill in equity.\nBefore Green, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for partition.\nMaria M. Serfass died on January 22, 1896, leaving a will which practically cut off her son, Joshua R., the plaintiff, from an interest in her estate. The defendants are brothers of the plaintiff.\nPlaintiff contended that under his grandfather\u2019s will his mother took a life estate merely in the lands of which partition is craved, while defendants contended that by the operation of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case, she took a fee simple.\nSchuyler, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe question is whether Maria M. Serfass took an estate in fee simple, or only a life estate, under the following clause in tier father\u2019s will: \u201c I give, devise and bequeath unto my daughter, Maria, all that certain lot,\u201d describing it, \u201c to beheld, used, occupied and enjoyed by her during the term of her natural life. And at her decease, I do order and direct that the same shall pass and descend to her heirs or next of kin, in the same manner as though she had been seized thereof in her lifetime in fee simple sole and unmarried, and had died intestate.\u201d It is not disputed that if this clause had ended with the word \u201cheirs,\u201d Maria would have taken a fee simple, but the plaintiff contends that the superaddod words show an intent to give her but a life estate. Tf that be so, then the intent must prevail, for while it is true that a testator, after having given a fee simple, cannot denude it of its nature and properties, yet \u201che may restrain the generality of a devise by subsequent expressions and convert that which otherwise would have been a fee simple into an inferior interest: \u201d Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 34. But \u201cthe strong presumption arising from the use of technical words of limitation is of an intention that the remaindermen shall take by descent, a presumption not easily overcome. It may be rebutted, but it can be by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt: \u201d Physick\u2019s Appeal, 50 Pa. 136 ; Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 17. Do, then, the superadded words above mentioned supply this quality of evidence? We think not. Surely, the words \u201cnext of kin\u201d do not, for these words, in the majority of cases, mean the same as the words \u201c heirs at law : \u201d 16 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 703. Nor do the words \u201chad died intestate:\u201d Kuntzleman\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 142. Nor yet do the words \u201csole and unmarried.\u201d The utmost possible effect of these words is to create a separate use for Maria\u2019s benefit during coverture, but a \u201ctrust for coverture is not inconsistent with the ownership of the fee: \u201d Shalters v. Ladd, 141 Pa. 349. We conclude, therefore, for there is nothing else in the will to rebut the presumption arising from the use of the word \u201cheirs,\u201d that the estate limited to Maria is a fee simple. That being so, the plaintiff has no standing in court, and his bill mast be dismissed.\nIt is not to our credit that less than a year ago, when this same question came up on demurrer, we reached a conclusion directly the reverse of the one just announced. This may have been due to the wide range of the argument, thus diverting attention from the pivotal point in the case, or it may have been that owing to the fact that the decision was not final and to a press of other business, the case did not receive the full consideration which we have since given it. Whatever the cause, we are now convinced that our former decision was a mistake. The mistake consisted in assuming that the present case was ended by Shatters v. Ladd, supra. True, these cases have their important features in common. In both of them the limitation is to a wife and her heirs; in both of them the wife taires a separate use; and in both of them the wife survived her husband. But Shatters v. Ladd did not turn on either of these points. The controlling feature in that case was that the will not only deprived the husband of his marital rights during coverture, but it expressly excluded him from his rights as tenant by the curtesy, thus narrowing the line of descent. It was upon that ground, which is entirely wanting in the case at bar, and upon that ground alone, that the wife\u2019s interest was cut down to a life estate. Had that element been absent, the opinion of the Supreme Court clearly indicates that the wife would have taken a fee simple.\nAs there was no request for findings of facts, availing our-self of section 79 of the court rules, we have found none. We have done this the less reluctantly because most, if not all of the evidence, was of doubtful relevancy. It is immaterial, so far as the jurisdiction is concerned, whether the title is disputed, or the plaintiff is in possession or not: Galbraith v. Bowen, 5 Hist. Rep. 352. The plaintiff asks, in the event of the court\u2019s reversing its former decision \u201c as to the meaning of the will,\u201d that he be permitted \u201c to produce evidence which will strengthen his position in that respect.\u201d We cannot hold the bill for such a purpose. The meaning of the will must be gathered from the will itself. ISTo extrinsic evidence that the plaintiff could prcn duce would be of the slightest service.\nApril 4, 1898, bill dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.\nError assigned was the decree of the court.\nJohn Houston Merrill, with him J. E. Serfass and Be Forrest Ballou, for appellant.\nThe controlling feature of the testator\u2019s intention was a purpose to exclude every husband of Ids daughter from all interest in this property. Since the law gives a husband curtesy in any estate of inheritance in the wife, this purpose could be accomplished only by limiting the daughter\u2019s interest to a life estate. Hence by the exclusion of the husband the line of descent was narrowed, the remainder-men took as purchasers and not by limitation, and the application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s case was prevented: Watt v. Watt, 3 Vesey, Jr. 244; Garrick v. Lord Camden, 14 Vesey, Jr. 872; Milne v. Gilbart, 2 DeG. M. & G. 715; In re Norman\u2019s Trust, 3 DeG. M. & G. 965; Ivins\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 176.\nThe fact that, by using language adequate to exclude existing and future husbands, the testator incidentally created a separate use which, under some circumstances, might become executed, or the accident of the death of the husband in his wife\u2019s lifetime, could not prove that the testator intended to give more than a life estate. It is well settled that the intention will be judged from the conditions that existed at the date of the will: Kuntzleman\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 142.\nThere is not a word in the will which limits the separate use for the daughter to the duration of the coverture with her existing husband. Upon his death, either the use could not become executed in her at all, or, if so executed, her estate was converted merely from an equitable life estate into a legal life estate. Any other interpretation of the will would defeat the testator\u2019s intention to exclude the existing and possible future husbands.\nOrrin Serfass and W. S. M. Kirkpatrick, for appellees,\nwere not heard, but in their printed brief said: The rule in Shelley\u2019s case is clearly applicable to this devise, and by its operation Maria M. Serfass took title in fee simple: Shelley\u2019s Case, 1 Rep. 104; Fearne on Cont. Rem. 188; Hileman v. Bouslaugh, 18 Pa. 844; Kleppner v. Laverty, 70 Pa. 70; Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9; Grimes v.
