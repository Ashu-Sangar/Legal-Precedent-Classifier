Her policy lapsed, about August <em>1, </em>189T, because of nonpayment of premiums or dues. Article 20 provides that failure to pay the premium within thirty days after notice shall forfeit membership. The executive committee shall have power to reinstate a delinquent member at any time witbin a year, upon satisfactory evidence of good health and upon the payment of all delinquent premiums. Article 19 of the by-laws provides that only such persons who are between the ages of fifteen and sixty years can become members. It can be found from plaintiff’s evidence that after tbe lapsing she offered to the company evidence showing that she was then in good health, and also that she offered to pay the premiums in arrear. Thereafter the executive committee considered her application for reinstatement and refused it, the ground of refusal was that it was illegal to reinstate her. It can be found that plaintiff was then over sixty-f ive years of age, and that was the ground of refusal.”</p>
