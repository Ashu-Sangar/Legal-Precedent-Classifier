    <p class="summary" id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[147,688,1174,1740]],["BL_506.1",506,[297,353,1177,195]]]'>The question is whether Maria M. Serfass took an estate in fee simple, or only a life estate, under the following clause in tier father’s will: “ I give, devise and bequeath unto my daughter, Maria, all that certain lot,” describing it, “ to beheld, used, occupied and enjoyed by her during the term of her natural life. And at her decease, I do order and direct that the same shall pass and descend to her heirs or next of kin, in the same manner as though she had been seized thereof in her lifetime in fee simple sole and unmarried, and had died intestate.” It is not disputed that if this clause had ended with the word “heirs,” Maria would have taken a fee simple, but the plaintiff contends that the superaddod words show an intent to give her but a life estate. Tf that be so, then the intent must prevail, for while it is true that a testator, after having given a fee simple, cannot denude it of its nature and properties, yet “he may restrain the generality of a devise by subsequent expressions and convert that which otherwise would have been a fee simple into an inferior interest: ” Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Pa.%2034" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Pa. 34">40 Pa. 34</a>. But “the strong presumption arising from the use of technical words of limitation is of an intention that the remaindermen shall take by descent, a presumption not easily overcome. It may be rebutted, but it can be by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt: ” Physick’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20136" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="50 Pa. 136">50 Pa. 136</a> ; Doebler’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Pa.%2017" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="64 Pa. 17">64 Pa. 17</a>. Do, then, the superadded words above mentioned supply this quality of evidence? We think not. Surely, the words “next of kin” do not, for these words, in the majority of cases, mean the same as the words “ heirs at law : ” 16 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 703. Nor do the words “had died intestate:” Kuntzleman’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="136 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="819999" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0142-01">136 Pa. 142</a>. Nor yet do the words “sole and unmarried.” The utmost possible effect of these words is to create a separate use for Maria’s benefit during coverture, but a “trust for coverture is not inconsistent with the ownership of the fee: ” Shalters v. Ladd, <a href="/pa/141/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="141 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="974870" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0349-01">141 Pa. 349</a>. We conclude, therefore, for there <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>is nothing else in the will to rebut the presumption arising from the use of the word “heirs,” that the estate limited to Maria is a fee simple. That being so, the plaintiff has no standing in court, and his bill mast be dismissed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-5" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[295,559,1181,1226]]]'>It is not to our credit that less than a year ago, when this same question came up on demurrer, we reached a conclusion directly the reverse of the one just announced. This may have been due to the wide range of the argument, thus diverting attention from the pivotal point in the case, or it may have been that owing to the fact that the decision was not final and to a press of other business, the case did not receive the full consideration which we have since given it. Whatever the cause, we are now convinced that our former decision was a mistake. The mistake consisted in assuming that the present case was ended by Shatters v. Ladd, <a href="/pa/141/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="141 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="974870" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0349-01">supra.</a> True, these cases have their important features in common. In both of them the limitation is to a wife and her heirs; in both of them the wife taires a separate use; and in both of them the wife survived her husband. But Shatters v. Ladd did not turn on either of these points. The controlling feature in that case was that the will not only deprived the husband of his marital rights during coverture, but it expressly excluded him from his rights as tenant by the curtesy, thus narrowing the line of descent. It was upon that ground, which is entirely wanting in the case at bar, and upon that ground alone, that the wife’s interest was cut down to a life estate. Had that element been absent, the opinion of the Supreme Court clearly indicates that the wife would have taken a fee simple.</p>

We have done this the less reluctantly because most, if not all of the evidence, was of doubtful relevancy. It is immaterial, so far as the jurisdiction is concerned, whether the title is disputed, or the plaintiff is in possession or not: Galbraith v. Bowen, 5 Hist. Rep. 352. The plaintiff asks, in the event of the court’s reversing its former decision “ as to the meaning of the will,” that he be permitted “ to produce evidence which will strengthen his position in that respect.” We cannot hold the bill for such a purpose. The meaning of the will must be gathered from the <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>will itself.

Hence by the exclusion of the husband the line of descent was narrowed, the remainder-men took as purchasers and not by limitation, and the application of the rule in Shelley’s case was prevented: Watt v. Watt, 3 Vesey, Jr. 244; Garrick v. Lord Camden, 14 Vesey, Jr. 872; Milne v. Gilbart, 2 DeG. M. &amp; G. 715; In re Norman’s Trust, 3 DeG.

It is well settled that the intention will be judged from the conditions that existed at the date of the will: Kuntzleman’s Est., <a href="/pa/136/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="136 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="819999" data-case-paths="/pa/136/0142-01">136 Pa. 142</a>.</p>
