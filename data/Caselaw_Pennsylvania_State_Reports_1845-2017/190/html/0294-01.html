W. Jurisch in this court for something over $1,200, and issued an' execution upon it and levied upon certain goods consisting of a stock of sporting goods, I believe they call them, bicycles and bicycle appointments, and all that, which were in the apparent possession of A. W. Jurisch. When the sheriff made the levy, however, he was met with a claim by Mrs. Cokely and Miss Lillian Jurisch, sisters of A. W. Jurisch, that the goods were theirs, and thereupon the sheriff, pursuing what the law directs, came into court here and -*sked that these parties who had made claim to the goods in <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>that way should substantiate as against these creditors who had levied upon the goods as belonging to Mr. Jurisch, the claim which they had thus made. That shows how the parties are here; Mrs. Cokely and Miss Jurisch are the plaintiffs; they claim that the goods are theirs; the defendant is the Sterling Cycle Works, and it claims that the goods belong to Mr. Jurisch. If the latter is true, then the cycle works is entitled to go on with its levy and sell these goods out and realize what it can of its debt against Mr. A. W. Jurisch. If the goods, however, belong to Mrs. Cokely and her sister, then these parties are not entitled to sell them. If you find one way, you find for the defendant; if you find the other, you will find for the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[261,1010,1183,663]]]'>The way the plaintiffs claim these goods is this: It is admitted that the goods in dispute prior to October 19, 1896, belonged to A. W. Jurisch, but upon that date Mrs. Cokely and her sister obtained judgments against their brother, A. W. Jurisch, before Alderman Fuller of the sixteenth ward of Scranton, and executions on their judgments were put in the hands of Constable Bates, who levied upon these same goods and sold them out, and at that sale Mrs. Cokely and her sister, Miss Jurisch, as it is claimed, became the purchasers. If that, under the facts of the case, conferred title to these goods upon them, then the goods belonged to them and they could not be disturbed in their possession or enjoyment. The whole case then turns upon the validity of the constable’s sale. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[263,1681,1179,712]],["BL_317.1",317,[174,343,1176,2008]]]'>[The executions were put in the hands of Mr. Bates; he says that he advertised them. The law requires, of course, that a sale by a constable shall be duly and properly advertised. He says that he put up, as I recall his testimony, at least three public notices. That is in conformity with the law. The law does not require more. It might require more very properly, because in a large place like this a few notices of that kind are not likely to attract very much attention; but if three notices were put up that was sufficient; that was a compliance with the law, and we have nothing to contradict it.] [2] It is claimed, however, that after the levy the store was not closed, and that is dwelt upon as another circumstance. It is said that the business went right on; that Mr. Jurisch made sales of goods, and persons are produced here who say that they <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>went in there and not only made purchases themselves, but saw others. If that were so, that would be contrary to the law; it would be quite a strong circumstance looking toward fraud and collusion. But it is denied. The testimony of Mr. Jurisch is, and of the young men who were working there, that they were told to make no sales, except those that were indispensable, and by that is meant only such sal ss as were necessary to accommodate customers who were there to get their bicycles repaired, and Mr. Jurisch carried on quite a ivpair shop for bicycles, bicycles that were sold coming back to be put in shape again by him. If that was the case, if that was observed, even though the store was not closed, I would not see anything of any great moment in it; but if the other be true, if the levy upon this store was without closing the store and the business all went on just as though there had been no levy, two things would be the result of that; if a man’s store is shut up and a notice put upon it that it is in the hands of a constable or sheriff, all those in the neighborhood are likely to see it, the public have their attention attracted to it, parties who would be interested in being bidders at such a sale have their attention attracted and would prepare themselves, as we would suppose, to come and bid upon the property so that it would realize what it ought to. While on the other hand, if the contrary is the case, if the store is not closed, if it goes right on to-day just as it did yest©rday, parties going in there and buying what they want, no sign up, nobody’s attention is attracted to it, nobody knows that there is to be a sale, and as a result naturally not attracting attention, the thing would be likely to be sacrificed. Furthermore, it would be just like a step a party would be likely to take who wanted not to make a true sale, but wanted to make a collusive sale; who wanted to get the goods in their possession without attracting other bidders or having anybody come in and make bids at the sale who would interfere with it. Several of the neighbors about there, some of them in the same business, who would be naturally interested to buy at such a sacrifico sale as is likely to occur in any forced judicial sale, did not know about it. Mr. Parker, who is in the bicycle and sporting business across the street, said he didn’t know until the sale was nearly through.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[256,596,1182,1181]]]'>[Then the next step would be, how was this sale conducted ? I must say with regard to that, the testimony all is that it was fairly conducted; a suggestion that it was not is hardly sustained by the evidence. Parties were there, while they were not numerous, yet whoever was there had a fair chance to bid, and there were other bids besides those of Mr. Zimmerman representing these ladies. Mr. Foote testifies to that, and he is a witness on the part of the defendant, and there is nothing to show, as I take it, that there was anything but a fair sale. There is some testimony, I believe, by some one, I think it was Mr. Kemmerer, who was in there towards the last of the sale, about some one buying goods in one part of the store while the sale was going on in another, but that is explained by showing that those goods had already been sold by the constable and Mr. Jurisch was merely making a retail sale for the parties who had bought in the goods. The mere circumstances that these goods were bought in for a small amount has very little weight in my mind (perhaps it may have more in yours), because that is always the result of a forced sale.] [3] People, if they go to buy in that way, have got to buy according to the judgment of the moment, and if they buy what is worthless they have no chance of remedying it, and that affects all bidding of that kind; they go at a sacrifice, .they are sometimes called a sacrifice sale.</p>
