An investigation of the question, however, has forced us to the conclusion that she died intestate as to the residue of her estate. In this we may be wrong. If we are, however, we have consolation in the thought that we can easily be corrected without expense to the litigants. The question, it seems to us, is very important, very interesting, and not free from doubt. We have given it our very best consideration, and have reached a conclusion after a most careful investigation. This matter was argued before us at great length and with great ability on the part of those who contend that the residuary estate is disposed of by the will, as well as by those who contend otherwise. The auditor regards it as due, not only to himself, but to the parties as well, that he give his reasons for the conclusions which he has reached. It has been well said that, “ A case upon a will has no brother.” We recognize fully the principle of law that a will is to be construed according to the intention of the testator. Looking at this will, it is apparent that the testatrix had no other intention in making the will than to provide for her burial and monument, give to her friend and counsellor her railroad stock, and disinherit certain of her heirs at law. The words which she uses in the will are, “ The rest and residue of my estate I direct to be distributed by my executor hereinafter named under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, but in <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>no event is Mrs. Murdock, widow of Campbell Murdock, 01 her three children, and Mrs. Kate Johnson or her two children, to receive any portion of my estate in any shape or form.” Reading these words, studying them in every possible light, taking them in connection with the other parts of the will, we are forced to the conclusion that.the testatrix has said nothing more than this: As to the residue of my estate I desire to die intestate, but in no event is Mrs. Murdock, widow of Campbell Murdock, or her three children, and Mrs. Kate Johnson and her two children, to receive any portion of my estate. If we are correct as to the meaning of the words used by the testatrix, then the matter is simple enough, for there is an unbending rule of law which is: “Mere negative words in a will are not sufficient to exclude the title of the heir, or next of kin. There must be an actual gift to some other definite object.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b398-5" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[271,1110,1176,355]]]'>It is argued that the intention of the testatrix to disinherit Mrs. Murdock and Mrs. Johnson is so clearly expressed that we cannot allow them to participate in this distribution without a clear violation of the expressed intention. Granted, yet upon both reason and authority there must be more than an expressed intention to disinherit. There must be an actual gift to some other definite object.</p>

She clearly so expressed it. Having failed, however, to designate the objects of her bounty it was held in a very able opinion by Judge Allison that they were not disinherited. See Will of Louisa Rorer, 7 Plfila. 524. The cáse of Bender v. Dietrick, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 284" data-case-ids="481837" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0284-01">7 W. &amp; S. 284</a>, is clearly in point. There, David Bender, the testator, provided by his will that his daughters should each have 150.00 out of his estate and no more. He did not say who should have the remainder of his estate. It is no more certain that Annie E. McGovran inteüded that Mrs. Loughborough and Philip H. Moore should have the whole of her residuary estate than it was that the two daughters of David Bender should have but $50.00 each. In that case it was held that the testator died intestate as to the residuary estate, and the daughters were allowed to participate. In the case of Coffman v. Coffman, 85 Ya. 459, Hiram Coffman, the testator, used these words: “ It is my will that my son William H. Coffman be excluded from all my estate <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>at my death.” This was the substance of lite whole will. It was held by the Supreme Court of Virginia that William H. Coffman was not disinherited. This case is also reported in <a href="/citations/?q=2%20L.R.A.%20848" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 L.R.A. 848">2 L. R. A. 848</a>, as Coffman v. Heatnole.

Allen, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20How.%20391" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 How. 391">18 How. 391</a>, says: “ In Pennsylvania the heirs must take unless they are disinherited by express words or necessary implication. Conjecture or uncertainty shall never disinherit him.” In Clayton v. Clayton, <a href="/binn/3/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Binn. 476" data-case-ids="1791134" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0476-01">3 Binn. 476</a>, Chief Justice Tilghman uses these words: “The rule of law gives the estate to the heir, unless the will take it from him, and in order to take it from him it must give it to some other person.”</p>

We have not referred to the codicil for the reason that if we arc right as to our conclusions as to the will it necessarily follows that the codicil, in so far as it undertakes to disinherit Mrs. Lehr and the heirs of Boyd Martin, is inoperative.</p>
