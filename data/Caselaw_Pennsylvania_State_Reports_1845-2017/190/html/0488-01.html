L. 47 (entitled to be a supplement to said act of 1874), applied, and cumulative voting was lawful. Defendants insist <em>that </em>said election was governed by <em>the </em>act of 1857 and its supplements, relating to state normal schools, and that said provisions concerning cumulative voting did not apply. The provisions of said article 16 of the constitution relate to private corporations, which term includes joint stock corporations. (Sec. 13.) Section 4 thereof declares : “ In all elections for directors or managers of a corporation each member or shareholder may cast the whole number of his votes for one candidate or distribute them upon two or more candidates, as he may prefer.” Said act of 1876 provides that in all elections for directors, managers or trustees of any corporation, created under the provisions of the said act of 1874, or accepting its provisions, there may be voting as declared by said section of the constitution; its further provisions explain the method of voting and declare that all such elections shall be by ballot, and that every share of stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote. In Pierce v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/104/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="104 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="452172" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0150-01">104 Pa. 150</a>, it was held that said section of the constitution does not require legislation to give it effect, and that it applied to an election of directors of a railroad company. (Corporations to construct railroads are excepted from the power to incorporate by said act of 1874, and its supplements, sec. 2, act of 1874, and Act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 186.) In McLeod v. Central Normal 'School Association, <a href="/pa/152/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="152 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="838076" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0575-01">152 Pa. 575</a>, it was decided that said association which was recognized as a normal school according to said act of 1857, and acting under a charter of the court of common pleas was a private corporation. The question whether said association was a public or private corporation arose under a rule to strike off a mechanic’s lien on its buildings. Said question was distinctly raised and decided. It must be borne in mind that this is a proceeding requiring each of the defendants to show by what authority he exercises the office of trustee of the East Stroudsburg State Normal School. Power to challenge defendants’ right in this form of proceeding exists by virtue of the first section of the Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 621, which declares that a writ of quo warranto may be issued in case any question shall arise concerning the exercise of any office i n any corporation created by authority of law and having the chief <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>place of business witliin the respective county. The averments in the suggestion for the writ bring the relator’s case within said provision of said act of 1886. In the plea to the suggestion, defendants do not deny that the East Stroudsburg State Normal School is a corporation; they aver that they were legally elected trustees of the said corporation; that they use the rights of trustees of the said corporation; they deny, however, that said East Stroudsburg State Normal School was created by virtue of said corporation act of 1874, and by the said decree of this court of August 31, 1893, and assert that it was created in accordance with the provisions of the said act of 1857, and its supplements, and in no other manner. The issue is whether defendants lawfully exercise the rights of officers of a corporation — the corporation named the East Stroudsburg State Normal School — that is the name given by said decree of the court. Inquiry as to the validity of the charter granted by this court would be profitless ; in this proceeding the court could not declare it void and annuled; such inquiry would be collateral; the charter could be vacated only in a direct proceeding for that purpose: Center Turnpike Co. v.

If the legislative intent had been to make them corporations it would have been so declared. It is not stated anywhere in said acts that such associations shall be corporations or bodies politic. The fourth section of the act of 1857 declares that the trustees shall have authority to bring suit in their name as trustees and do all things necessary for the recovery, use and application of the same. In said act of 1877, in providing for the number of votes necessary for certain purposes, is found the expression “ or for the surren<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>tier of tlie franchises of the corporation.” But the last named, act confers no power; it simply repeals a requirement of the act of 1875 respecting a three-fourths vote of the trustees, excepting as to certain matters. A relinquishment of privileges conferred by the normal school acts, not the surrender of the franchises of the corporation, was meant. Referring to an unincorporated association as a corporation does not make it a corporation. A state normal school association that never became incorporated without doubt can act untrammeled by the laws governing corporations including cumulative voting. Its law is the act of 1857 and its supplements. The thought occurs that inasmuch as the corporation in question could lawfully have but fifteen trustees, that four were not to be elected in May, 1897. But it can be taken for granted that there then was occasion to elect four. No question in that regard lias been raised. The issue is as to which two of the four contending persons were elected.</p>
