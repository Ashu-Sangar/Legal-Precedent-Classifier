Evidence has been given to show what rental has been received from this property. That is a fair matter for the consideration of the jury. A person thinking of purchasing a property would be influenced in the value which he would put upon it by the existence and the knowledge by him of the revenue which had been derived from that land in the way of rental. It is not conclusive ; it is simply information for the jury which it is proper for them to consider. You are not bound to say that, because a property rents for a certain yearly amount, you are to capitalize that at six per cent or at any other per cent as a fixed basis for determining the value, but it is proper for you to take it into consideration as one element aiding you in fixing the value of the property, and as such you will consider the evidence that has been given on that subject in this case.</p>

There has been evidence in the case tending to show that for more than twenty years — approaching towards <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>thirty years, perhaps — there have been payments made on that account; and it has been contended with respect to that on the part of the defendant that'it ought not to be taken into consideration because the plaintiffs do not own the water, and the defendant looks upon that as the sale of so much of the water which it says the plaintiffs did not own, and therefore had not the' right to sell. It contends, therefore, that that ought not to be taken into consideration. As to that, we say to you that the plaintiffs did not own the running water that ran through and over their land; they own, however, the right to certain uses of the water. They owned the land over which the water ran; they owned the right to exclude the railroad company from the approach to the water upon their land, and if they had not agreed the railroad company could not have taken any water from the dam. Therefore, the railroad company was paying for a right or a privilege or for the existence of a fact which could not have existed'if the plaintiffs had refused, and therefore, while they did not own the running water, yet they did have possession of the land, and were in a position to prevent the railroad company from getting this water unless they were paid for it: No One had a right to complain of their allowing the railroad company to get the water or of the railroads taking the water, except some one who owned property on the bank of the stream lower down or on the banks of the stream into which this Indian run emptied, and so long as such person did not complain and did not show that some right of such person was invaded, there was no one to complain, and therefore we did not exclude the evidence on this subject; and we say to you that you can take into consideration the fact of the location of this railroad, and this station where it is, and the fact that the owner of this land commands the situation with respect to the approach to the stream, and the fact that for a number of years the evidence shows revenue has been derived from the location, and' the existence of those facts so far as it would affect the value of this property1 in the eyes of intending purchasers. You are not to assume as an absolute fact that this state of things will always continue; you are not to assume as an absolute fact that the railroad company always will want and will take this water; that is a matter for the future. You are simply to consider it so far as it would in the eyes of a prudent person, <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>considering the question of the value of this land, affect that question, and in considering this, as well as considering the fact of the rental that has been derived from the property in its use as a powder mill, and the fact of the existence of the power there, in considering both those questions, you are to take into consideration all the evidence on that subject on both sides.] [20]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[160,668,1190,1388]]]'>[The defendant has called attention to certain provisions in the lease with the railroad company and in the lease with the powder company with respect to the right of the railroad company in the one instance, and the powder company in the other, to purchase the property for a certain sum. With respect to the lease to the railroad company, I think that that right of purchase was given, if I am not mistaken, almost twenty years be-, fore the date of the taking. Now, what the property was worth twenty years ago might be some evidence of what it was worth at the end of twenty years, but it would be by no means conclusive. Neither would the value that the owner put upon it or the contract he made with respect to it at any particular time be conclusive evidence of its value even at that time. It would be strong evidence of what he considered it worth and it might aid the jury very much in determining its value. What I mean to say is, it would not be conclusive. He would not be bound to sell it or allow it to be taken by any one else at exactly that price because he had made that contract. As to the other lease, the option to purchase, so to call it, was made, I think, in 1893, which was some two years before the time when the property was taken. As to that the same thing would be said, that it would not be conclusive of the value, but it would bo evidence which the jury are bound to consider. If by virtue of those leases there is any diminution of the interest which the plaintiffs had in the property that time, that also is to be considered by the jury in fixing the value of the property as owned by the plaintiffs.] [21]</p>

For instance, in this case one witness for the plaintiffs testified that there was a <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>certain amount of power here; that that would be sufficient to generate electricity enough to supply a certain number of arc lights, and that each arc light would be worth a certain price which he mentioned. Now, that was speculation. lie would have to have a place where he could dispose of his arc lights. He would have to put up the machinery to run the concern, and various things of that kind. That is a speculation, and you are not to consider matters of that kind except to the single extent that you have a right to consider what is the water power that is connected with this land and what would be its fair value in the eyes of the persons who intended to purchase it; not what they might make out of it by doing this, that, or the other with it. Therefore you are to exclude from your consideration all speculation. You are not to go into speculative calculations and assume that they will be successful, and give the owner of the land the price and value of those speculations assumed to be successful, where possibly, if they were carried out, they might turn out the other way, and he would have none of the risks, and you would be giving him the advantage. That you are not to do. You will have to ascertain the fair market value from the testimony of witnesses, aided, as I suggested, by whatever pertinent knowledge on that subject you got by your view of the property, the particular advantage of that, however, being to enable you to apply the testimony more intelligently.] [22]</p>
