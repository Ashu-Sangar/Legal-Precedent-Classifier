Moore as the father and of Albert H. Moore as the son, because of the similarity of the names, and I may thereby not be so confusing. A bill of sale was executed by the son. Under the terms of that bill of sale there was a sale of the personal property on Cloverdell farm to the father, and the consideration therein stated was $300,000. It is claimed, however, on the part of the witness, the son, and also on the part of the witness Miss DeGroote, that this was not the whole consideration; that this paper did not fully express the agree<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>ment of the parties. ... If it was agreed at the time of the execution of this paper that the father was to do certain things as a part of the consideration for this agreement, and it was understood that the son would not sign this agreement until that was assented to by the father, and the father assented to it, then this agreement was modified, changed and altered so as to conform to the agreement of the parties made at the time that the contract was executed. But before you can find that a written paper was changed, altered or modified, you must have testimony that is clear, precise and indubitable. . . . The law therefore has wisely said that before a written paper can be changed, altered or modified, or anything can be added to it as forming a part of the contract, the jury must find that such change or alteration is established by the evidence of two witnesses, or by the evidence of one witness and corroborating circumstances equivalent to another witness. One witness alone is not sufficient unless there are corroborating circumstances, and the evidence must show that such modification was agreed to by the parties. The evidence must be of such a character as to show by clear, precise and indubitable proof that the modification was agreed to by the parties.</p>

After considering all the evidence in this case that throws any light upon this branch of the case, you will determine whether the evidence shows by clear, precise and indubitable testimony, that this contract was changed or altered so as to conform to the statement made by Miss DeGroote, or whether the contract before you stands in its terms and provisions just as it was written.] [18]</p>

As between <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>the father and the son that was not necessary, if it was the intention of the parties that the father should have the title to these horses and other articles. It might, however, be entirely different when we come to consider the question as to creditors. Therefore, as I said, you may well find that this title passed to the father for the property on Cloverdell farm. If it did, did it remain in him ? Did he take possession of the property ? He may not have taken such possession as would satisfy the demands of the law where an existing creditor stepped in, and yet he may have had a full title as between himself and his son. In order that a title may pass from the vendor to the purchaser, as to existing creditors, there must be some change of possession, or something must be done, such as the properly is susceptible of from its location, to show that there was a change of ownership. . . .</p>

It does not matter that the executors took possession if the property at that time was the property of the son. Although you may find that notorious and high-handed possession was taken, that would not give title to the executors if the property at that time did not belong to the estate of Andrew M. Moore. But if it belonged to the father, these executors succeeded to the rights of the father, and whatever the rights of the father were, these executors had the right to exercise them, and they must be protected, if they did simply that which the father himself had a right to do. . . . Under this bill of sale, if the title was in the father, although he had taken no possession, if it was the intention of the parties that he should have the title and that they should belong to him, the son cannot claim that they are his unless he shows that they were returned to him or that a <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>gift was made to Mm, and he cannot establish a gift unless there Is evidence here from which you can find such gift. . . . [I only say before you can find that this property was returned to the son, if the title vested in the father under this bill of sale as between the father and son, you must find that there is evidence that satisfies you that the property was returned to the son to be the son’s.] [21]</p>

I do not mean to say that all these matters are not important, but some parts may be more important than others. Much has been said about fraud in this case, and I want so far as possible to bring your attention to the legal principles, and, tedious as I may bo, it is my duty to endeavor to make myself understood as to the legal principles applicable to this case. First, was this transaction between the father and the son a fair, bona fide transaction between them ? Because, although it may not have been good as against existing creditors, it may have been entirely good as between the father and son. .... [Again, if this was not a bona fide contract and arrangement between the father and son, was it fraudulent so far as the son was concerned ? If the father was no party to the fraud, if he had no intention to cheat any creditors or to defraud them, but it was bona fide and good as between himself and his son, still the son may have had some purpose other than a bona fide purpose in selling or conveying the property to the father. Therefore, if the son was about to contract debts of some hazardous business, or expected to engage in some transaction wherein he might Incur liabilities, it might very well he that from the evidence you could find that his purpose and intention was to part with this property so that if he contracted debts the property would not he here to answer for those debts, and if that were so it would he a fraud on his part. If he contemplated making these debts by going into a hazardous business, it might be fraudulent as to the son, and yet the father might he perfectly innocent, because unless he knew this was the purpose of the son, or unless there were some facts and circumstances surrounding the case from which he ought to have known, fraud of the son cannot he charged against the father, but it might still be that while the property remained in the hands of the son and no change was made, creditors of the son <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>for debts that were contracted after the transfer was made might come in upon the property so long as no change had been made.] [19] That would depend upon whether there was any intention on the part of the parties to defraud the creditors that might be created after the transfer took place. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[276,598,1182,1488]]]'>Let us go a step further, however. [Suppose it was the intention of the father and son to withdraw their property from the reach of subsequent creditors, so it could not be levied upon when these subsequent creditors should arise. If it was their intention and purpose to so arrange matters between themselves that when the son, who was about to engage in a hazardous business, should contract future debts, the property should not be reached, if the father was a party to the fraud and knew all about it and agreed to it, and if you find that the creditors were in fact defrauded thereby, then, although the father’s executors may have secured possession of the property, they cannot complain when a party comes in and says, “ I want this property because through your testator’s fraud in fact he induced me to part with my property and give this credit.” If the jury find that that was the fact, then although the property had been taken in possession by the executors, still it might be answerable for the judgment of such subsequent creditor.] [20] But is there any evidence here that the father entered into any fraudulent arrangement with the son? You cannot find such fraudulent arrangement unless the testimony establishes it. Fraud is to be proved like any other fact. ... [If the agreement was that he was to pay the debts, where would the creditors be defrauded ? It was a good consideration for this transfer if he agreed to pay the debts, if that was stipulated or was even understood, and the amount of those debts was a fair .consideration for the property, just as much so as if he had paid the money for it, because if he obligated himself to do so he was responsible for it, and if he was responsible for it, the son could enforce such liability on the part of the father.] [22]</p>
