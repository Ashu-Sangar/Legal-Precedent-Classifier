    <p class="summary" id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[157,867,1176,1440]]]'>One of the reasons suggested why a new trial should be granted is that the court did not fully instruct the jury as to their rights to find a verdict of murder of the second degree. The court was not asked at any stage of the case either orally or in writing to give such instructions: Commonwealth v. Zappe, <a href="/citations/?q=153%20Pa.%20501" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="153 Pa. 501">153 Pa. 501</a>; Commonwealth v. Nevling, <a href="/pa/98/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="98 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="496957" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0322-01">98 Pa. 322</a>; at foot of page 337; Kehoe v. Traction Company, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20Pa.%20486" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="187 Pa. 486">187 Pa. 486</a>. The testimony, including that of the prisoner himself, showed that his crime was a brutal, savage murder, of the kind that induced our predecessors in the administration of the criminal law to charge in the indictment that the accused was “ instigated by the devil,” and naturally it did not occur to either the counsel for the prisoner or the court that it was anything else than murder of the first degree, unless the prisoner was insane when the act was committed. The jury were, therefore, not in terms instructed that they might find the prisoner guilty of murder of the second degree; they were instructed, with reference to the facts of this case, what must be found to constitute murder at common law; that there are two degrees of murder; that there must be a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing to render the prisoner guilty of murder of the first degree; and that they were to determine from the evidence whether it makes out a case of murder of the first degree or not; that all killing not murder of the first degree, if murder at all, is murder of the second degree, and that before they could convict of murder of the first degree they must be satisfied that the killing was wilful, deliberate and premeditated, with an explanation of the meaning of these terms.</p>

In doing so he was merely repeating the act of assembly defining the offense. It is true, the jury have the power even in the case of murder by poison to convict of the lesser grade of crime. So they have the power in such a case to acquit altogether in the face of the clearest evidence. In either case it would be a disregard of their duty and of their oaths. If the learned judge had said to the jury, as in Rhodes v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/48/0396-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="48 Pa. 396" data-case-ids="422264" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0396-01">48 Pa. 396</a>, that they must convict of murder of the first degree or acquit altogether it would have been error. But he did not. He plainly told the jury what the law was, and then in the last paragraph of this charge said to them: If you find him guilty of murder you must also say in what degree. The charge of the learned judge upon this point was not so strong as in the latter case of Shaffner v. The Com., <a href="/pa/72/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="72 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="434742" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0060-01">72 Pa. 60</a>; where the court instructed the jury in a case of murder by poison that ‘ if you are convinced that he is guilty of the crime it is murder in the first degree as declared by the act of assembly, and it is your duty to say so without regard to the consequences to the prisoner.’ This ruling was affirmed in this Court in a careful opinion by Mr. Justice Agnew, in which the previous case of Rhodes v. Com., and Lane v. Com., <a href="/pa/59/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="59 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="426929" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0371-01">59 Pa. 371</a>, were considered. The distinction is between a proper statement of the law and a binding instruction. The latter is held to be error, though the case be never so clear.” We think the instructions given to the jury in the case before us were within this distinction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[241,1837,1174,301]]]'>Another reason suggested why a new trial should be granted is that the court instructed the jury that it was difficult to see how the mental condition of the prisoner could reduce the grade of the offense ; and if they found him not of sound mind, so as to understand' the nature of the act he was committing, and that it was wrong he should be acquitted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[240,2146,1173,146]]]'>This instruction was given with reference to the appeal of counsel to the jury to find the prisoner guilty of manslaughter only, in view of the testimony on the question of his sanity.</p>

There are cases deciding that there is such a grade of intoxication. And in Jones v. Com., <a href="/pa/75/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="75 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1036682" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0403-01">75 Pa. 403</a>, language was used by Agnew, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court, at page 408, which might seem to give some color to the idea that in this respect insanity and drunkenness are alike, but both in law and in reason there is a manifest distinction between them. One is voluntary, the other involuntary; and as it has been said frequently if drunkenness were a defense, every intending murderer would drink in order to escape the consequences of his crime, and there never could be a conviction for homicide if drunkenness avoided responsibility. What is decided in Jones v. Com., supra, was, that intoxication is not an excuse for crime, but if it deprived the intellect of power to think and weigh the nature of the act, it may prevent the conviction of murder in the first degree; and the reference to insanity in the opinion was merely incidental. And in Nevling v. Com., <a href="/pa/98/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="98 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="496957" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0322-01">98 Pa. 322</a>, the Court found it advisable to qualify Jones’s case, and to say that it “ was based upon the peculiar facts exhibited by the testimony, and was limited to the inferences which naturally arose from them; *’ the case being that the accused pleaded guilty and it became the duty of the court to determine the degree ; and he was given the benefit of the doubt whether under the facts he was in a condition of mind, not because of insanity, but of intoxication, to deliberate when the crime was committed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[120,1721,1175,666]],["BL_180.1",180,[263,338,1180,860]]]'>We have referred to but one case in which it has been held that there may be a grade of insanity that, while not sufficient to acquit, may reduce the degree of the crime: Andersen v. State, <a href="/conn/43/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="43 Conn. 514" data-case-ids="748737" data-case-paths="/conn/43/0514-01">43 Conn. 514</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Am.%20Rep.%20669" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="21 Am. Rep. 669">21 Am. Rep. 669</a>. But a consideration of the reasoning in this case will, we think, lead to the conclusion that it ought not to have much weight. The same view is tentatively presented in 1 Whart. &amp; Still. Med. Jurisp. sec. 200, but no decisions are cited to sustain it. In United States v. Lee, <a href="/dc/15/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Mackey 489" data-case-ids="2617219" data-case-paths="/dc/15/0489-01">4 Mackey, 489</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20Am.%20Rep.%20293" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="54 Am. Rep. 293">54 Am. Rep. 293</a>, it is held that there is no grade of insanity sufficient to acquit of murder, but not of manslaughter. Merrick, J., delivering the opinion of the court, said of a request for instructions: “ It rests upon the idea that there is a grade of insanity not sufficient to acquit <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>the party of the crime of manslaughter, but yet sufficient to acquit him of the crime of murder. The law does not recognize any such distinction as that in the forms of insanity. The rule of law is very plain, that in order that the plea of insanity shall prevail there must have been that mental condition of the party which disabled him from distinguishing between right and wrong in respect to the act committed. Now, if the prisoner was so far capable of distinguishing between right and wrong as to be guilty of the crime of manslaughter, he surely was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong in respect of the crime of murder of the identical party. There can be no recognition of the doctrine that a man is incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong, so as to determine that the case is not a case of murder, and yet capable of distinguishing between right and wrong, so as to be guilty of manslaughter. There is no such doctrine and nothing in the books that favors such an idea.”</p>
