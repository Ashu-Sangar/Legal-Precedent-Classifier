Tbe appellant and bis ««defendant, tbe Columbia Avenue Trust Company, then put on record an agreed statement of facts, setting forth tbe connection of tbe company with tbe matter, and tbe appellant filed a cross-bill against tbe Equitable Trust Company denying its capacity to act as committee, its right to bring suit against the husband of tbe lunatic, and raising questions of law upon these and other matters appearing in the bill.

That appeal did not oust or suspend the committee from its functions, or its duty to secure the property of the lunatic. The bill was filed in the same court and of the same term and number as the lunacy proceedings, but that was a mere incident arising from the rules of the courts of Philadelphia county for the proper and convenient distribution of their business.

The extravagance of his claims cannot bar him from his actual rights. In view, however, of the nature of the property in controversy and the facility with which the purpose charged, to remove it from the jurisdiction, might be carried out, the court was authorized to grant a preliminary injunction to protect the lunatic’s interests, should her title be hereafter established.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[299,846,1178,867]]]'>This brings us to the consideration of the terms of the injunction. These are too broad. It appears by the agreed statement of facts that the appellant deposited in the Columbia Avenue Company in November, 1894, a tin box, containing valuables not named, and in April, 1896, rented a safe in the vaults of the said company, and deposited therein a number of things also not specified. These acts were done in his own name, and the later of them more than a year before the proceedings in lunacy began, though the inquisition found that the lunacy had extended back to February, 1896, thus antedating by two months the renting of the safe. The presumption from these facts is that part at least of the property on deposit in the Columbia Avenue Company is the appellant’s own, and though his failure to say so in explicit terms, and to specify the articles he so claims greatly weakens such presumption, yet he should not be deprived of the property without a full opportunity to defend his title.</p>
    <p id="b570-6" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[302,1722,1177,650]]]'>The injunction is also somewhat carelessly worded, so that it appears to be inconsistent in requiring the boxes to be opened by the Columbia Avenue Trust Company, without the presence of the appellant, and in prohibiting him from opening them, while at the sanie time requiring him to make a detailed inventory of their contents. And the last paragraph is clearly excessive, in requiring appellant to produce and deliver to the committee the bonds, mortgages," etc., including his own note in his wife’s favor, the title and even existence of which have not yet been established. This order can only be made on final hearing, the power of the court at present being limited to the preservation of the existing status of the property until the title to it is determined.</p>

But the third assignment of error requires notice of another matter. The court below, on petition of the committee in July, 1897, ordered payment of certain expenses for costs of inquisition, board of the lunatic, etc., out of the lunatic’s estate, and the application of the income thereafter to her board from time to time. When the case was hero before, <a href="/pa/185/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="185 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="898027" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0497-01">185 Pa. 497</a>, it was held that this could be done without notice to the party instituting the proceedings. But it is better practice to give notice to the next of kin, or parties standing in close relation to the lunatic. The danger of not doing so is illus<a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>fcrated by the similar but more extensive order made in July, 1898, whereby the committee was authorized, not only to apply the balance of the income, but “so much of the principal as may be necessary after the income is exhausted ” to the support of the lunatic. This was a highly improvident order. The estate as set forth in the petition of the committee amounted in 1898 to about |9,400, yielding an income of $650, which the expenses of maintenance as at present conducted would exceed by about $175 annually. The situation therefore was one of annually decreasing principal and increasing deficit, a situation calling for the utmost care and discretion in administration. This discretion should not be surrendered by the court to any other tribunal, and especially not to the committee by any general order. The principal of the estate should only be sacrificed to necessity, and such necessity should be determined in each specific instance by the court itself, having before it all the circumstances, including the nature and value of the property, the age, condition of health and situation in life of the lunatic, the effect of loss of accustomed comforts, the prospect of increasing infirmities, etc. It is the duty of the court to see that the future comfort of the unfortunate shall be made as secure as the circumstances permit, and for that purpose to keep present expenses within reasonable bounds. As said by this Court in Wier v. Myers, <a href="/pa/34/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="34 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="418013" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0377-01">34 Pa. 377</a>, “all those expenses ought to be carefully supervised by the court, and considering the helpless condition of the lunatic none ought to be allowed except such as ,are manifestly just and moderate.” Especially is it the duty of the court to see,that the estate is protected in the administration. Commissions, fees and charges of all kinds should be allowed only on the most moderate scale of compensation.</p>
    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[272,1882,1178,446]]]'>We have considered this case as was our duty, in the light of the appellant’s legal rights. But we are not impressed Avitli the merits of his contention. Whatever claim or title he has to any of the property in controversy he should show promptly and clearly. As against the committee he has no right of possession of any of his wife’s property, and, in the language of the chief justice when the case was here before, if he has any such property in his possession he ought to turn it over to the committee and save further trouble.</p>
