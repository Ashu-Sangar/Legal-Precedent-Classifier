Schlegel milch, and paid for by him with their money; that without their consent or knowledge the title was taken in the name of Mary J.

Proof of the payment of the purchase money by the appellants would give rise toa resulting trust in their favor, and trusts of this nature are expressly excepted out of the statute of frauds, and may be established by parol: Bispham’s Equity, 118-20; Lynch v. Cox, <a href="/pa/23/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="23 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="974010" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0265-01">23 Pa. 265</a>; Edwards v.

Dyer, 1 Lead. Cas. in Eq. 333, the general doctrine is thus stated : “ It is well settled in this country, as it is in England, that if a person purchases an estate with his own money, and the deed is taken in the name of another, the trust of the land results, by presumption or implication of law, and without any agreement, to him <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>who advances the money, and the case is the same where the contract of purchase is made by the cestui que trust personally, or where it is made by the nominal grantee as his agent; such trusts are not within the statute of frauds, and may be established by parol, notwithstanding the deed acknowledges the consideration to have been paid by the nominal grantee.” And it is said that the exception which withdraws trusts arising by implication of law from the operation of the statute extends far enough to embrace eveiy trust growing out of a breach of duty, aside from contract.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[305,900,1179,1319]]]'>It is true that a mere refusal to perform a parol agreement to hold or convey lands is not sufficient to create a trust, but that is not this case. The appellants’ equity arose from the fact of their payment of the purchase money, and if they established that by satisfactory evidence they were entitled to a decree in their favor. The answer of a defendant to any matter stated in a bill, and responsive to it, is conclusive evidence in his favor unless it is overcome by satisfactory evidence of two opposing witnesses, or of one witness corroborated by other circumstances and facts which give it greater weight than the answer, or which are equivalent in weight to a second witness: Burke’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="99 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="446142" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0350-01">99 Pa. 350</a>. In applying this rule it should be borne in mind in this case that the essential fact which the appellants were bound to establish was the payment of the purchase money. If they proved this they established the trust. In speaking of the evidence sufficient to establish a resulting trust it was said by Black, C. J., in Lynch v. Cox, <a href="/pa/23/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="23 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="974010" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0265-01">supra:</a> “ It is well settled that nothing more is necessary than to prove that the land was paid for with the cestui que trust’s money. This naked fact is enough to make out a prima facie case. . . . One who takes a deed in his own name for land paid for by another is a trustee by force and operation of law; not because he agrees to hold for the other party, but because he cannot hold for his own use without violating good faith and honesty. The trust results from, and the obligation to execute it is imposed by, not his will, but the nature of the transaction.”</p>

He explained, how the money uune into his posses<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>sion. He had represented the creditors in effecting a sale on their judgments of the personal property of James Galbraith, and had received from the sheriff the proceeds of the sale and had deposited them to his credit in a trust company. When the real estate was sold he drew a check on the trust company for the purchase money and delivered it to the sheriff in payment. The check drawn by him, indorsed by the sheriff and bearing the marks which showed its payment by the trust company, was produced, as were also the return of the sheriff of the sale of the personal property, the receipt given to him by Mr. Schlegelmilch for the amount realized, the praecipes, writs and records which showed that Mr. Schlegelmilch had acted throughout as attorney for the creditors andas such had received the money. These writings and records produced and offered in evidence strongly corroborated Mr. Schlegelmilch’s assertion that he had paid for the property with his clients’ money. The documentary evidence confirmed every statement made by him as to the ownership of the money, the receipt of it by him and the use to which it was applied. It was distinct and independent evidence upon the vital question of the payment of the purchase money. Moreover, the answer on this subject is not fully responsive. In the fourth paragraph of the bill it is stated: “ Mary J. Galbraith did not pay the purchase money of $200 at said sheriff’s sale, or any part thereof, but the money so paid belonged to the complainants and other judgment creditors hereinbefore mentioned.” In the amendment to the third paragraph of the bill it is stated that Mr. Schlegelmilch was empowered to act for the judgment creditors and to exercise his professional judgment in their interest in relation to the sheriff’s sale, and that in pursuance of his duty he attended the sale and bought the property for them, and “ that the purchase money for the said real estate was with the consent of your orators paid by the said Geo. E. Schlegelmilch out of the money in his hands belonging to your orators and other judgment creditors,” etc.</p>
