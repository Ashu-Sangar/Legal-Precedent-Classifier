This deed the defendant refused to accept, and furthermore, refused to pay to the plaintiff the balance of the purchase money, $1,900, alleging that the plaintiff did not hold the title <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>to said premises in fee simple, and therefore could not carry out the agreement.

Brisse of the real estate No. 105 South Ninth street, Reading, Pa.?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b368-7" data-blocks='[["BL_368.6",368,[267,1020,1183,1170]]]'>The item in the will, “ I give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife Catharine Yetzer, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of whatever kind, and wheresoever the same may be at the time of my decease, for her to have, to hold, and to enjoy, during her natural life or so long as she shall remain my widow,” clearly gives her no such power. The estate therein devised is not an estate in fee. But it is evident that the testator intended that, in a certain contingency, she should be the main recipient of his bounty, and, therefore, he further provided: “ I also order and direct that in case my wife cannot support and maintain herself from my real estate, she is hereby authorized to sell the same and use the proceeds for her support and maintenance.” The property No. 105 South Ninth street is the entire real estate of which Yetzer died seized. The will points out no method by which is to be ascertained whether she could or could not support and maintain herself from the real estate, evidently leaving and intending so to leave the ascertainment of this fact to her and her alone. Her judgment is absolutely unfettered. It is also proper to say that defendant admits she cannot support and maintain herself out of this real estate. This fact determined, the power to sell is created and “she is authorized to sell the same and use the proceeds for her support and maintenance.”</p>

Uncertain in its du<a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>ration, it would obviously be of but little value. The testator expressly authorizes her to sell “my real estate ” and not her interest therein given by the preceding clause. As was held in Hemhauser v. Decker, 38 N. J. Eq. Rep. 426, citing 1 Sugden on Powers, 501 <em>% </em>“ To enable the donee of the power to convey a fee it is not necessary when it appears that the donor intended to authorize such grant, that he should specify the estate; it is enough if the power be merely a power to sell. Where the intention is clear, a power may enable the donee to dispose of the fee, though no words of inheritance be used, as where a testator gives a power to sell lands, the donee may sell the inheritance, because the testator gives the same power he himself had.”</p>
