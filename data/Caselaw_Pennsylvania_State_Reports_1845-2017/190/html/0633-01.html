      <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>From the evidence taken in this case, which was very voluminous,' the master reports as follows : That the libellant and respondent, whose name was Pauline Kaelenberg, were married on December 30, 1875, by the Rev. Mr. Spaeth, at his house, and that they lived happily aud contentedly together until some time in 1882, or the early part of 1888. To this marriage were born two children — -John W. Gruninger, aged nineteen, and Herman Gruninger, aged sixteen, both born prior to 1882. About this time the libellant called in the co-respondent as a .family physician, he having been acquainted with the respondent prior to their marriage. During this period numerous events occurred between the respondent and the co-respondent which excited the suspicions of the libellant. According to his testimony, they consisted principally of his long visits to her during her illness, claiming that internal examinations were necessary to be made by him, and that other parties were not present; long and secret interviews in the parlor which, when interrupted by him, would take the form of ridiculous questions and ridiculous answers, with sudden changes of subject; sitting in the bay-window and watching for him, the co-respondent, to pass, and affectionately waving' her hand. These thing so harassed and worried the libellant, that he requested the doctor to discontinue his visits professionally to his house. About this time, on one occasion, the libellant met the co-respondent casually in the street, and was' informed by him that he had just paid a visit of two hours to the respondent, and upon his returning home and questioning her, she positively denied that any person had visited her, which called forth from the libellant the remark, which was ebullition of anger and rage, “You are a -liar.”</p>

However, before this period, the respondent obtained from the carrier a letter addressed to her at New York (according to his testimony) by the co-respondent, which contained “ Dearest ” and “ Dearest Pauline,” and “ nothing but love ” in it, and appointed a meet<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>ing with her upon her arrival in the city, when they would go to a hotel. This letter he closed and forwarded to her, and immediately took stops to intercept this assignation by being present, with himself, his brother and a sergeant of police, at the Ninth and Green streets station at the time of her arrival stated in the said intercepted letter.</p>

On February 19, 1894, the respondent went to town with two women relatives; she was away from them for some hours while in the city and, arriving home as late as 7 o’clock at night, she concocted a falsehood to bo told her husband, to the effect that she had been to her sisters’, including both women to lend color to it; he learned that she was not at her sisters’ and charged her with deception, saying, “ I know where you were,” to which she replied, “For God’s sake if you do, don’t disgrace me.” Tt is evident that there was a period during that day of February 19 which the respondent has not accounted for truthfully, and did not wish to be accounted for, and that the sudden accusation of her husband alarmed her to the extent of making this virtual confession. This is what may be termed the first confession, and is corroborated by the testimony of Mrs. Balz.</p>

If the letters had at that period been known to the libellant, these circumstances, taken in connection with the deception of February 19, 1894, and the previously described and condoned liason of 1883, there could be no doubt in the mind of the master that adultery may be presumed to have been the outcome of such love, devotion, frenzy and secrecy as is contained in these documents. The counsel for the respondent has tried to explain them in argument as love tales, and to belittle their importance, and the respondent has not denied them with such positiveness as would prevent the master from coming to the undoubted conclusion that she did write them, when her handwriting is positively sworn to by the libellant, by Mrs. Balz and the two sons of the libellant, and her own admission to a question of the master, that they looked like her handwriting. There is no doubt, therefore, in the mind of the master, but that they were written on the dates named, and that they were addressed to and received by the co-respondent. In proof of this latter fact, we must look at the internal and external evidence in the case, and keep in mind not only these letters, but all the circumstances affecting tbe relations of these parties in 1888, and the confession of the respondent of 1894; remembering one cause of complaint as stated by the libellant in his own testimony, and also by his remarks to Mr. Lukens was, that be suspected the co-respondent of buying tickets for his wife’s sister to Chicago, which indicated the presentation to her of a present. This fact is stated in one of the letters, and as there is no other party in the known world who was connected with the respondent in this “ ticket affair ” but the co-respondent, the co-respondent could be the only one meant. Again we find in one of the letters, that the respondent speaks of an interview with the corespondent’s wife, in which she states that she has a letter fi om <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>twelve years ago; this letter is exhibit “ F,” and is a letter from the co-respondent to the respondent. To whom would she confide this important secret but to the co-respondent? Then again we have the evidence of Mr. Work and Mr. DeHaven, two honorable members of the Philadelphia bar, which, as it bears strongly upon the identification of the co-respondent with these letters, the master will give more in detail.

The libellant further testifies that previous to this confession he had been acting under the advice of counsel, and that a very short time a fter he again consulted counsel, an d that, as <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>a matter of course, guided his future actions by his advice.

Mrs. Balz testifies that the respondent was in the vestibule of her husband’s house just across the street. “ I went over, she embraced me and cried and went on terrible, and asked me wouldn’t I plead with my brother for her; that she had wronged John so long that she was afraid he would not forgive her again; that she had wronged him for years; that she was guilty of all this trouble; ‘ John was too good to me.’ In the evening, at the front door in the vestibule, she said to me, ‘ I have told John everything; I have confessed all I have done.’ ” Louis Gruninger testifies that about three weeks before the respondent left home she called upon him, and, in answer to his question, “ What is it you want,” she said, “I would like you to speak to John for me, and ask him to forgive me.” She stated that she had confessed to John that she was guilty of what she was accused of. She said, “ I have wronged John for years, and I will do better than I ever did if he will give me another chance.” E. W. Shuttle-worth, a friend of both parties, and undoubtedly a disinterested witness, testified that in the forepart of December, 1895, which must have been prior to the issuing of this writ of subpoena in divorce, the respondent came to Ms house; “ She was crying, and told me that Mr. Gruninger and her had had words, and asked me would I see Mr. Gruninger and try and beg him to forgive her once more, and if he did not she would go crazy; that she had done wrong for several years, and would I see him and beseech him to forgive her. I asked her in what way she had wronged Mr. Gruninger ; she told me through being too intimate with Dr. Boyer. She also told me that he was a good husband and had been a good father all his life, and that he was too good for her.”</p>

This condition of affairs existed until December 14, 1895, when the subpoena in divorce was served, and, as stated by her in her answer, she left the house of the libellant.

In determining this case, the rule by which the master has been governed, is not that the evidence must produce absolute certainty, nor that the evidence must be sufficient to convict the co-respondent of adultery, but whether, under all the circumstances of the case, he is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and this conviction must be absolutely inconsistent with the innocence of the respondent.

This fact having been ascertained, we are now met with the plea of condonation which virtually says, you cannot divorce me because the libellant has condoned the offense. No true, innocent woman, strong in her virtue, strong in the love and affection of her two sons who are not with her in this case, would stand upon condonation when she could crush the destroyer of her honor and her home, by proving that she was absolutely innocent.

The former seeks to obtain a divorce from the latter on the ground of her alleged adulterous intercourse with a married man who, for the sake of convenience, may be designated herein as the co-respondent. The libellant and respondent were married on December 30, 1875, and lived together peacefully until 1882 or 1883, when the intimacy existing between the libellant’s wife and the co-respondent raised a suspicion of improper intercourse and led to a quarrel between the husband and wife which resulted in her temporary absence from their home. On her return to the home there was some bickering, for awhile, between the husband and wife as a consequence of the inti<a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>macy referred to, but it eventually terminated in a mutual understanding that there should be a discontinuance of the obnoxious intimacy and a renewal and proper observance of the marital relation. At that time they had two children of tender age who were entitled to the affection and care of the parents, and this circumstance may have been, and probably was, an important factor in the restoration of peace and the promotion of mutual forbearance. After this reconciliation there was a period of about ten years in which there was no serious altercation between the libellant and the respondent, although subsequent developments tended to show that, while there may have been an interruption of the former intimacy between the latter and the co-respondent, there was not an absolute discontinuance or abandonment of it. Meanwhile the libellant appears to have relied on the pacification of 1883, and to have been unconscious of any violation of the mutual understanding which was the basis of it. It was not until February, 1894, that his suspicion of his wife’s infidelity was revived. The immediate cause of its revival was an occurrence, the true nature of which, according to the testimony of the libellant, the respondent endeavored but failed to conceal from him, and which, on her discovery of his knowledge respecting it, she implored him to refrain from giving publicity to. After the occurrence referred to, circumstances previously unknown to the libellant and corroborative of his suspicion of improper intercourse between his wife and the co-respondent appeared, together with subsequent circumstances of a like nature. According to the testimony of the libellant the respondent, on September 25, 1894, voluntarily confessed to him her guilt. The confession may have been prompted by well-known circumstances or occurrences inconsistent with her innocence, or by an ebullition of penitence. It resulted, however, in the occupancy by the parties of their respective rooms thereafter, in the institution of this suit on December 12, 1895, and in her retirement from his home the next day.</p>

The libellant, his two sons, and his sister, Mrs. Balz, were familiar with the handwriting of the respondent, and they testified positively and distinctly that the letters were written by her. Aside from the oral testimony relating to the source and authenticity of the lettei's there is quite enough on the face of them to establish an unlawful intimacy, and when it is considered in connection with the oral testimony the conclusion that the respondent and co-respondent were parties to it is irresistible.</p>
