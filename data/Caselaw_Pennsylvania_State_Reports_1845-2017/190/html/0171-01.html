      <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>The evidence tends to show the existence of the alleged road over John M. Zimmerman’s land prior to his sale to his son, and its continuance, until 1896 or 1897, when closed by respondent. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent took his conveyances subject to the easement or right of way. There are two questions left, which we will consider together. Will equity interfere before a decision on the question of right in the law side of the courts ? Has the complainant an adequate legal remedy? We need not cite many authorities upon these questions. Both subjects are considered by Mr. Justice Trunkey in Hacke’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20Pa.%20248" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="101 Pa. 248">101 Pa. 248</a> : “ It has long been settled that nuisances to rights of way'are one of the classes of cases in which the equitable remedy by injunction may be sought. This was established in England and accepted as a rule in tins country. No case has been cited where it is denied or doubted in this state. Its existence has been recognized.” This is the language of the learned justice, to which he adds : “ The dictum is that the right should be clear to warrant a decree and injunction to compel the keeping open of a way, and if the right be doubtful a chancellor will pause until it be established by law.” Of course the right should be clear, and no chancellor would interfere in a doubtful case until it be established, but when the right is clearly shown, as in this case, a suit at law is unnecessary and really a useless expense. Upon the subject of legal remedy the same case says, after referring to the subject of nuisances by mills, factories, etc., and irreparable injury, and citing Richards’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="57 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1010471" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0105-01">57 Pa. 105</a>: “ The doctrine of that case applies to many other kinds of business; but not where a man buys land subject to an easement, or grants an easement. He cannot appropriate such property against the owner’s will and say, I will compensate him in damages. 1A judgment for damages does not transfer the plaintiff’s property in the way to the defendant, as would a judgment in trover or trespass for taking goods. Nor will the law restore enjoyment to the owner. He may have repeated actions for damages and neither gain enjoyment, nor lose his right thereto. The law does not offer an adequate remedy. He is entitled to a remedy that will restore him to enjoyment, and is not confined to actions at law for damages resulting from obstructions.” In Ferguson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/117/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="117 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="555789" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0426-01">117 Pa. 426</a>, the above case is cited and ap<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>proved. This case contains a lengthy opinion, reviewing many authorities and recognizing the right to equitable relief by the lower court, and Mr. Justice Paxson cites a number of authorities and affirms the decision of the lower court. The doctrine of the right to equitable relief is again asserted without a suit at law, and applied in that case. As to the rule of “ legal remedy ” the learned justice says: “ The plaintiffs have also an equity. As before stated they have erected an expensive house upon their lot upon the faith of its bounding on Rock street. The injury threatened is of a character that would prevent a recovery in damages, being an adequate remedy. Such recovery would not give plaintiffs the use of the street.” As bearing upon the same subject we cite Pierce v. Cleland, <a href="/pa/133/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="133 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="812879" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0189-01">133 Pa. 189</a>, Commonwealth v. Stevens, <a href="/pa/178/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="178 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="885490" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0543-01">178 Pa. 543</a>, and Gas Company v. Gas Company, <a href="/pa/186/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="186 Pa. 443" data-case-ids="989719" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0443-01">186 Pa. 443</a>. The doctrine of equitable relief, and the right thereto, is recognized in Mowday v. Moore, <a href="/pa/133/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="133 Pa. 598" data-case-ids="812908" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0598-01">133 Pa. 598</a>, when the right is clear, without a suit at law. We think, if the testimony before us was submitted to a jury, there could be but one finding, to wit: in favor of the existence of the road; nor could any other be conscientiously sustained. That equity is the proper remedy, and the only adequate remedy, in such case as this seems to be established by the experience of these parties, judging from the statements made during the hearing. They have had criminal and civil suits, assault and battery, surety of the peace, assault and battery with intent to kill and trespass. A majority of these cases appears to have been disposed of, leaving the parties where they were, but possessed of less ready cash. Of course this is not what is desired; it is, in fact, no remedy, nor can an adequate remedy be obtained by a judgment for damages in trespass for the reasons above given. We, therefore, conclude that the complainant is entitled to equitable relief, and decree accordingly. The motion to amend complainant’s bill is refused, the objection thereto being sustained.</p>

The case was well tried, and the questions involved were correctly decided. For reasons given by tbe learned trial judge in his opinion, we are satisfied he was right in concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief, and in adequately providing therefor by the terms of the decree from which tins appeal was taken. There appears to be nothing in any of the questions involved that requires extended discussion.</p>
