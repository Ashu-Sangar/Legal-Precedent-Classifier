The lot of land is fully described in the petition, printed in the appendix, and contains in front on Northampton street fifty-two feet and in length or depth 240 feet to Church street. This lot, with the appurtenances, was given to the trustees “ to receive and pay over to the said Susan B. Clemens, the wife of Jacob B.

In Keene’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/60/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="60 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1014499" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0504-01">60 Pa. 504</a>, the Supreme Court uses the following language: “ If those who have existing interests, immediate or remote in the time of enjoyment, but winch must certainly fall into possession <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>at some time, do not call tbe executor or trustee to account, or if there be none such, it does not seem to be necessary to the due administration of justice, that one having no interest should maintain a suit that may never result in any benefit to himself.” The subject of controversy in that case was personal property, and it was accordingly held that the owner of a contingent interest in that kind of property had no standing to call for an account. Beyond doubt the decision would have been the same way if the subject of controversy had been real estate, for real estate is in less danger of maladministration and the holder of a contingent interest therein has his remedy by injunction in case of waste. It was in consequence of the foregoing decision that the Act of April 17, 1869, P. L. 70, sec. 1, Purd. Dig. 622, was passed: Keene’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20Pa.%20273" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="64 Pa. 273">64 Pa. 273</a>. That act provided that “ the owner of any contingent interest in the personal property of any decedent may legally require the custodian thereof to file an account.” In view of the language of the Supreme Court above cited, which applies equally to real and personal property, the limitation of the provisions of the act to “personal property ” is certainly significant. The petitioner claims to be the holder of a contingent interest in the decedent’s real estate, and he is now asking that we make a decree requiring the trustee of the particular estate to file an account. The burden is on him to show that we have jurisdiction to grant this relief. We have been furnished with neither statute nor authority, either conferring or recognizing such jurisdiction. It follows that his petition must be dismissed.</p>

Clemens, and the final settlement of said “ trust estate.” It was apparently settled in Heckscher v. Clem<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>ens, <a href="/pa/185/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="185 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="898016" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0476-01">185 Pa. 476</a>, that this paragraph of Wagener’s will created an active trust for Susan B. Clemens for life and for contingent remainder-men, of whom H.arold Clemens, as one of the children of Susan B. Clemens, was one. The interest which he took, whatever it may have been, was vested in him at the time the Heekscher judgment was entered. The language of Wagener’s will with reference to the disposition of this real estate at the death of Susan B. Clemens, the life tenant, is as follows: “ And at her decease I give, devise and bequeath the said real estate with the appurtenances in fee simple, .... equally to and amongst all the heirs of her body if she should have any,” etc.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[303,908,1167,805]]]'>This provision' means that the control of the trustee over the real estate ends at the death of the life tenant; that immediately upon her decease the real estate vests under the will, in the first instance, in her children then living, with the issue of any who may then be deceased, leaving such issue. The trustee would have no power to make any conveyance thereof, and the court would have no power to authorize a conveyance. No act of the trustee nor decree of the court would be needed to perfect the title to such of Mrs. Clemens’s children who may then be living, or their issue, but that title vests at once in such children, or issue, or their alienees under their own deed, or (as in the case in hand) by act and operation of law. The denial of interest set up in the answer was treated in the court below, not as an actual denial of interest, but as an allegation that a contingent remainder in land, like in the case before us, is not the subject of lien, and could not be taken in execution and sold.</p>

    <p id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[144,740,1172,857]]]'>The learned court below was so entirely correct in refusing the petition in this case that it is scarcely necessary for us to say anything more than is contained in the opinion. It is to no purpose to contend that a- contingent interest in real estate may be levied upon and sold upon execution, because the purchaser could not acquire in that manner any other or higher interest than was held by his debtor. Keene’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20Pa.%20510" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="60 Pa. 510">60 Pa. 510</a>, certainly did decide that the owner of a contingent interest in personal estate had no right to call upon the trustee for an account, and when the act of 1869 was passed it gave no right to an account except as to personal estate. As the sixth clause of D. D. Wagener’s will gave all the income both of the real and personal estate directly to the cestui que trust, without the intervention of any trustee, it is difficult to see how the trustee can he called upon to account for any part of the income, but as that question arises in another case, we do not decide it now.</p>
