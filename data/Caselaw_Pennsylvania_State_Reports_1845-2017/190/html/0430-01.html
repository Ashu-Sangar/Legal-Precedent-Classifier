Whitney &amp; Stephenson were brokers, doing business in Pittsburg. They either owned or controlled a majority of the shares of the Central Traction Company, one of the smaller companies, while appellants, as noticed, owned or controlled a majority of the shares in the Pittsburg, Duquesne, Fort Pitt, Allegheny Traction and other smaller companies.

The bill further averred that Whitney &amp; Stephenson, in September, 1896, had attempted to release the syndicate subscribers, including Drexel &amp; Company, from the obligations they had assumed, without the assent of appellants and in violation of their rights.</p>

Undisputedly, it was to unite in one carrying corporation numerous smaller corporations doing business in the same locality. To accomplish such result the shares of the underlying companies, controlled by appellants, must be had ; they would not sell except for cash; the consolidated company could pay in its own shares, but not in cash; some arrangement must be made by which the securities of the purchasing company could be turned into cash for those who would receive nothing else; the execution of such an arrangement would be impossible to the dozens of parties interested in the scheme ; it, necessarily, must be intrusted to some one who would represent them; then, begin the negotiations and agreements with those planning the organization of the consolidated company, which was, to take up the underlying companies; every agreement shows Whitney &amp; Stephenson were selected as the active executive agents to accomplish this purpose ; they were the “ go between ” of the parties; in all the writings they are styled the “ Syndicate Managers,” and nowhere in them is it intimated they are any <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>tiling else. In pursuance of the power intrusted to them, cotemporaneously, they commence consultations and negotiations with Drexel &amp; Company, bankers of large financial ability; consultations are had with them, progress reported to those interested in the consolidated company, and suggestions for modifieations or changes in the different agreements made after learning the imperative demands of plaintiffs. After the syndicate agreement was closed, complainants, acting on the representations of Whitney &amp; Stephenson as to the facts, deposited their underlying shares with Drexel &amp; Company. There is no doubt, they expected, when they first assented to the arrangement, that Drexel &amp; Company would guarantee to them the cash for the preference shares they were entitled to receive; but Drexel &amp; Company refused to do so; then they declined to surrender their underlying shares; whereupon, Whitney &amp; Stephenson agreed to got up the syndicate subscriptions to take up all the shares that Drexel &amp; Company failed to dispose of by October 1, 1896, at which time they would be paid cash for their shares. Whence came the preference shares and common stock to take up these underlying shares ? It is not disputed they were issued by the consolidated company, delivered to Whitney &amp; Stephenson, who carried them to and left them with Drexel &amp; Company, and, whether sold for cash wherewith to lift the underlying shares by Drexel &amp; Company before October 1, or after that date delivered to the syndicate subscribers, who would furnish the cash for the same purpose, they were substantially the consideration moving from the Consolidated Traction Company to the sellers of the underlying shares of the smaller companies. They were never purchased by Whitney &amp; Stephenson from anybody; they and Drexel &amp; Company were but the conduit through which they, or their value, passed to those who delivered to the consolidated company that which was necessary to its life. In all the documents, the correspondence and business conduct of the parties, we fail to discover anything indicating action on the part of Whitney &amp; Stephenson, independent of those interested in the scheme of consolidation. Whitney testifies in support of his averment, that his firm was acting for itself, thus, “ we,” meaning all those interested, proposed to acquire control of these various properties in some way, and the Condolida ted Traction Company got them by the assent of the people <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>who owned a majority of the shares. But the court below, notwithstanding Whitney’s testimony, in view of other significant evidence, finds a fact which to us seems inconsistent with his finding on the whole case as heretofore quoted. ■ He says: “ The evidence in the case satisfies me beyond any doubt that the plaintiffs who have given testimony upon the subject did rely upon the syndicate agreement for the purpose stated, and, what is more, that under the circumstances of the case, as it must have appeared to them, they had good ground for so doing. Particularly with reference to the plaintiffs, Mr. William L. Elkins and Mr. Widener, I may say that the evidence satisfies me that Mr. Whitney did induce them to make a deposit of their underlying shares with Drexel &amp; Co. after they had refused so to do under an arrangement which would give to Drexel <em>&amp; Go. </em>or Whitney &amp; Stephenson the option to determine whether they should be paid for those shares in cash or in preferred shares of the Consolidated Traction Company, by Ms undertaking on behalf of Ms firm of Whitney •&amp; Stephenson to organize the underlying syndicate, which has been already referred to.” And then further on he says: “ Satisfied, as I am that the plaintiffs have been misled and wronged by the acts of the firm of Whitney &amp; Stephenson, I have yet looked in vain through the proofs for the substantial ground on which I could rest an opinion^ that that firm were the agents or representatives of the plaintiffs in the transactions referred to.”</p>

But the court finds this belief was not well founded and that plaintiffs were misled. Why ? They were not children, destitute of common busmess astuteness and prudence, but were men of affairs, having knowledge of large transactions of this character; the writings and all the circumstances were consistent with the truthfulness of the representations of Whitney, and inconsistent with any other theory; the testimony of not less than six reputable witnesses, having knowledge of the project from its inception, strongly supports the same theory. The precise belief of plaintiffs as to the fact which induced them to part with then underlying shares is indicated by this excerpt from the <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>testimony of Mr. Widener, which is in substantial accord with that of other of plaintiffs' witnesses: “Q. You sold those shares, that is, those underlying shares of the Fort Pitt, Duquesne and Pittsburg Traction? A. I did. Q. Did you sell them to Whitney &amp; Stephenson? A. No, sir; I sold them to Drexels and an underlying syndicate. Q. Did Whitney &amp; Stephenson ever enter into any agreement with you to buy or pay for any of those shares ? A. Not at all; only so far as their agency went in dealing with these other people. Q. I mean on their own account. A. Not at all. Q. Was there ever a moment of time at which they, by any agreements that they made with you, became responsible to you to pay for those shares ? A. Never.”</p>

    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[269,962,1184,559]]]'>It is impossible for us now to intelligently determine just what relief plaintiffs are entitled to; there are nine special prayers and one for general <em>relief; </em>this matter was not touched upon in the argument before us; the question discussed here was, whether the court had correctly found the fact on which depended any decree for relief. It may be that all of the special prayers ought to be granted, or perhaps only a part of them; some of them might be oppressive; we cannot tell. The court below will, without doubt, grant such as to equity shall appertain, in view of our finding of fact. It is further directed that appellees pay the costs.</p>
