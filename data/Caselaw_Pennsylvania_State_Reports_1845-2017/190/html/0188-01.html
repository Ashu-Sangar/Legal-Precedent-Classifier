The pleas are non assumpsit, payment with leave, etc., and set-off. At the trial, no defense of fact or law was made against the note itself. The defendant, however, attempted to establish a set-off, alleging that, in July, 1895, and June, 1896, the county had given its notes to plaintiff for $15,000 and $30,000 respectively, upon each of which it had, in fact, received $5,000 less than was called for; that subsequently the face of these notes, with interest thereon, had been paid by the county to the plaintiff in full; and that therefore the latter had received over $10,000 more than it was entitled to. In proof of this allegation it was shown that the money which passed from the bank in the discount of the notes of 1895 and 1896 was paid by it to a clerk sent by the commissioners to the bank for discount; that no receipt was given by the county treasurer to the bank for the proceeds thereof; and that, according to the entries upon his books, the amounts referred to never reached his hands. The evidence adduced on the part of the defendant, consisting both in the oral testimony of its officers and in its books of accounts, tended strongly to prove that the bank paid over to the messenger of the commissioners in each case, the full amount called for by the note presented by him. The court declined to give binding instructions in favor of defendant based upon the facts that the payments were not made to the county treasurer himself or to an agent authorized by him to receive them, and that there had been no receipts therefor issued by him, — reserved the question of the <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>county’s right to claim a set-off because of the former fact,— and submitted to the jury, as decisive of the verdict, the ques tion whether or not the bank had paid the full amounts called for by the notes to the commissioners’ clerk presenting them for discount. The jury having found for plaintiff for the full amount of its claim, defendant obtained these rules, — relying, in support of the rule for a new trial in addition to the positions taken at the trial, upon the further ground that the 820,000 note in suit constituted an increase of the county’s indebtedness and, as such, was illegal and void for want of the statement required by the Act of April 20,1874, P. L. 65, sec. 2. See commissioners v. Snyder, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20Pa.%20C.%20649" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 Pa. C. 649">20 Pa. C. C. 649</a>, and Rainsburg v.

    <p class="summary" id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[178,1000,1172,960]]]'>1. Taking up the last point first, there are two reasons why, whatever, under different circumstances, its merits might or might not have been, it cannot be given any controlling effect at this time. When a case has been tried, submitted and decided upon a certain theory, it is too late to advance another which might have been, but was not, put forward at the trial: Lane v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="108 Pa. 415">108 Pa. 415</a>; Cridland v. Stevens, 43 W. N. 243; Taylor v.

But, further, the point, as now urged, involves one of two propositions, — either that it has been established that there was no such statement as is spoken of in the act of 1874, or that it is to be presumed that there was none. The former is contrary to the fact; for there is no proof on the subject in the case and no admission concerning it in the pleadings. The latter would seem to be in contravention of the principle peculiarly applicable to public officers who act under the obligation of an oath, Warder v. Tainter, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%20270" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 W. 270">4 W. 270</a>, that every duty enjoined has been fully performed, — the familiar principle, omnia prarsumunturrite esse acta.</p>

It is elementary law that the right to claim a set-off depends, inter alia, upon whether or not the party alleging it is in a position to sue the plaintiff for the demand which is sought to be made the ground of defalcation: Leas v. Laird, 6 S. &amp; R. 129. It is necessary, therefore, to inquire whether the facts as they have been made to appear in this case would entitle the defendant to recover from plaintiff in a suit instituted by the former- against the latter the sums for which it asks <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>credit upon the note of September 30,1897. According to the finding of the jury based upon presumptions of fact the correctness of which the court has no means to test, and the conclusions resting on which it has no power to control, Trust Co. v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/160/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="160 Pa. 590" data-case-ids="852128" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0590-01">160 Pa. 590</a>, the bank paid out the full amounts called for by the notes of July, 1895, and June, 1896. Whether those amounts were in fact incorporated with the county funds,— whether the county actually had the benefit of them, is not decisive. The question is whether their payment by the bank to the commissioners’ clerk is now to be treated as a payment to the county or not. Upon that question, the direction of the Act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 543, sec. 37, that “ it shall be the duty of the county treasurer to receive all moneys due or accruing to the county,” is not final. He is to receive such moneys when they come to him; but since, for the most part, they necessarily come to him, not immediately, but mediately through a variety of official channels, it cannot be true that nothing but a payment to him directly can be relied on as a payment to the county. Whether a payment to another official representing the county is a payment to the latter or not depends upon whether that official is, in the first instance, authorized to receive it, being, in his turn, bound to hand the money over to the treasurer. It is conceded that, when money is to be borrowed in the name of the county, the loan is to be made, not by the treasurer, but by the county commissioners. Tt is one of those self-evident propositions, which, in the language of Keith, P. J., in Smoot v. L. &amp; B. Assn., 29 S. E. Rep. (Va.) 746, are “so clear that the attempt to elucidate them serves only to obscure,” that he who has the power to make a loan has, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, the right to receive its proceeds. Good business sense would doubtless indicate as judicious the adoption of some method whereby, in exchange for the county’s obligation, the sum advanced upon it should be at once turned into the treasury, without requiring or permitting it to pass through any intermediate hands. But the criterion here is not wise methods, but positive statutory mandate; and it must be considered that, in the absence of any such forbidding the commissioners, in making a loan for the county, to receive its proceeds for the purpose of transmission to the treasurer, they have that power. If they have it, they <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>can, of course, delegate it to one of their clerks. It is true that parties dealing with one assuming to represent the public are bound to inquire into the existence or nonexistence of his power to do the act he undertakes to do: Roland v. School Dist. <a href="/pa/161/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="161 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="854200" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0102-01">161 Pa. 102</a>. But, in the present instance, not only was the person to whom payment was made a regular official subordinate to the county commissioners and employed in their office, but he produced to the bank what in his hands, and in view of former transactions of like character, was the best possible evidence of his authority, the obligation itself. On numerous other occasions he had presented similar obligations and received the cash upon them precisely as in these instances, and the bank could not suppose that this was unknown to the commissioners whose duty it was to be aware of what was going on. It would be an absurdity to say that the law presumes men charged with a duty to have done their duty, Farnham v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/55/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="55 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1470740" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0053-01">55 Pa. 53</a>; Duff v. Wilson, <a href="/pa/72/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="72 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="434761" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0442-01">72 Pa. 442</a>; Schum v. R. R.

If, in these circumstances, it were needful to go further and ascertain that there was actual authority given by the commissioners to their clerk to receive the money from the bank, there would, under the evidence, be no trouble about that fact. There is no pretense that they forbade the clerk to do what was the obvious purpose of his mission, viz: to obtain the money and take it to the treasurer, — or that they notified the latter to get it, — or that the bank agreed to transfer it to him, — or that he had an account with the bank upon which it might have credited the proceeds of the transaction without actual transfer of the cash. How, then, was the money to reach the treasurer, if not through the medium of the clerk? The truth, apparent in the evidence, is that those commissioners, in each case, after they had sent the clerk to the bank with the note, took it for granted that he had received and turned over to the treasurer the sum it called for. That is the most convincing kind of proof that they did, expressly or impliedly, authorize him to receive it from the bank. A finding to the contrary by the jury, had it been deemed proper to submit anything on this matter to them, could not have been sustained, notwithstanding the testimony of the commissioners themselves that they never gave such authority. “ That actions <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>speak louder then words is sound law as well as proverbial wisdom: ” Graham v. Dempsey, <a href="/pa/169/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="169 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="870672" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0460-01">169 Pa. 460</a>, per Mr. Justice Mitchell; and it is an enlightened rule that there are kinds and degrees of proof which, though controverted, are nevertheless so potential to establish a fact “ that a court, in the due administration of justice, must treat it as a fact: ” Newhard v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/153/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="153 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="840353" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0417-01">153 Pa. 417</a>, per Mr. Justice Dean. It was suggested by counsel at the argument that this case ought to be regarded in the same light as one in which it should appear that the county’s notes had been accidently lost and found by some stranger; that, upon their presentation by him, the bank had, without further inquiry, handed over to him the amounts called for by them; and that he had appropriated the same. It has, indeed, been wisely observed that “analogies are as likely to misguide as to guide safely:” Overman’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="88 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1061188" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0276-01">88 Pa. 276</a>. But between the facts of this case as discussed and those of the case supposed there are so many and radical distinctions that it is hardly needful to dwell upon them in order to emphasize the entire absence of any analogy.</p>

I not only accept, but agree with, the ruling of his Honor, Judge Bechtel, in Com. v. Allen, Rentz &amp; Martin,, quarter sessions, Schuylkill county, No. 1847, November term* 1897, that that enactment is not repealed by the Controller Ac® of June 27, 1895, P. L. 403. But, apart from any other limitation to be drawn from the apparent purpose of the act of 1860, however wide a scope is given to the second section of it, the receipt there exacted is a receipt to be given upon “payment of public money to the treasurer,” and to the “ person making, <em>oi: </em>in whose behalf the payment aforesaid is made.” The statute is; a highly penal one, in more senses than one, and to be construed', with a proper degree of stringency. It is, therefore, only the-person who, or whose agent, has made a payment directly into-the county treasury that is required to obtain the receipt under-pain of having the payment go for nothing. A party who makes a payment to another official duly authorized to receive it, or under circumstances justifying the party in so regarding him, does not fall within its terms and is unaffected by it. And that, as has been seen, was the situation of the plaintiff in respect of the notes of July, 1895, and June, 1896. It was the <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>business of the county commissioners, or of their clerk, not of the bank, to obtain the receipt of the treasurer as an acquittance to them, and if they had done tlieir duty in the premises, as it was plainly enjoined upon them by the statute in question, the county could have lost nothing, and this case would not be here.</p>
