    <p class="summary" id="b606-6" data-blocks='[["BL_606.5",606,[327,517,1179,1528]]]'>This suit is brought by the plaintiff to recover against the defendant as indorser on a promissory note, for the sum of $1,500, dated January 18, 1895. The note was drawn by the Staten Island Terra Cotta Lumber Compaq, of which the defendant was president, to its own order, and was indorsed by that company, and then indorsed by the defendant; and it appears it was given to a man named John W. Peale in payment of coal winch had been furnished by Peale to the Terra Cotta Lumber Company. It was taken by the plaintiff here after maturity, and, therefore, if there is any defense by the defendant here which can be set up against John W. Peale, it is also a defense against the plaintiff here, Rembrandt Peale. [Now, the defense which itis contended that the defendant has made out here is, that the note was indorsed solely for the accommodation of Peale and at his request. If that has been made out to your satisfaction, then it constitutes a good defense against the plaintiff; and the question you are called upon to determine under the evidence that has been presented to you is as to whether this note was indorsed by the defendant for the accommodation of John <em>W. </em>Peale, and for his accommodation alone, or was it indorsed as an accommodation to the lumber company, of which the defendant was president. If it was indorsed by him to accommodate the lumber compan}', then there is no defense in this case.] [3] Now, that is the simple question of fact which you are called upon to determine, and it is a matter exclusively for your determination. It is for you to weigh the evidence, and see to what it points. You will look at the circumstances of the case, and see what they indicate. [Men do not act without a motive at all, and generally, if you inquire into it carefully, you are able to determine questions of this kind.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b606-7" data-blocks='[["BL_606.6",606,[329,2063,1176,350]],["BL_607.1",607,[228,364,1171,96]]]'>The defendant here was president of the lumber company. It appears that he held at least $100,000 of its bonds, and he also tells ris that he had a majority of the stock. He was, therefore, to that extent at least, interested in the welfare of this company. Now, what would be his reason for indorsing in order to accommodate Mr. Peale? Has it been shown that there was such a relation of friendship or obligation as to supply, <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>in your minds, the purpose which would induce him to indorse simply to accommodate Mr. Peale ? ] [4]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[227,571,1178,1744]]]'>The defendant relies upon his own testimony, and he tells you that he did indorse it to accommodate Mr. Peale, and at Mr. Peale’s request. You will give to that testimony such weight as in your judgment it deserves. The defendant also relies upon the letter which was written by Mr. Peale, dated February 2, 1895, and which was written by Mr. Peale prior to this indorsement. You will have that letter before you and you want to examine it witli very considerable care. I have read it and it seems to me to be more or less uncertain in its style. One of the paragraphs of the letter is : “I do not ask you to indorse this paper for the reason that I am dissatisfied with your company’s financial standing, but for the reason that since Mr. Kelly allowed the note due in December to go to protest, and, in fact, stopped payment on it, the National Bank of North America will not have anything to do with your company’s paper without your indorsement.” While that would seem to express a reason on the part of Mr. Peale which was personal to him when he says he does not ask for the indorsement for the reason that he doubts the financial standing of the company, the next paragraph of the letter seems to indicate a different thought. “ Since the trouble of December on the note presented was through no fault of mine, but entirely a matter between your company and Mr. Kelly, I think that it is no more than right that you should indorse this paper for your company.” That expresses the thought that Mr. Peale bad in his mind that the defendant here was under some obligation. He says that it would be only right that the defendant should indorse it, and he says further that his thought is that it would be only light, not that he should indorse it for himself (Peale) nor for any obligation between them, but “ for your company.” So that, on the whole, while it is a question of fact for you, and you must say what was meant by the parties, it seems to me that that letter is more or less uncertain upon tbe question that is presented to you.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b607-7" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[234,2325,1168,94]],["BL_608.1",608,[262,337,1178,507]]]'>You will have also out before you the letters between the officers of the lumber company and Mr. I&gt;eale. fi’hose letters, in <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>the hurry of the trial, I have not had the opportunity of looking at very carefully, but you will have them before you, and you can examine them at your leisure. As I recall them, they express on the part of the officers the thought that Mr. Peale had refused to furnish further coal to the company unless the notes were indorsed, and that that was consummated by an agreement between them that they should be indorsed by Mr. Addicks. Well, if that is what the letters show, that would indicate a purpose which would account for the fact of these indorsements appearing upon those notes.</p>

To meet that, the defendant alleged and testified that the note in suit was indorsed by him at the request of, and solely for the accommodation of John W. Peale. The plaintiff introduced and relied on rebutting evidence, tending to prove that the note was not indorsed for the accommodation of John W.
