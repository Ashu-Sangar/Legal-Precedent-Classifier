It is true that a legacy induced by deception, as in the case of one pretending to be the husband or wife of the testator, may, upon proof of the fact, be treated as a <em>nullity; </em>but this is not on the ground of revocation, but because the perpetrator of fraud is never permitted to take advantage of it. And so where the will is made under a palpable mistake of pure fact, as where the testator acts under the belief that one for whom he would otherwise provide is dead when in truth he is living, a court of equity may, perhaps, have power to afford relief by reforming the instrument so executed. But none of these principles apply to the case before us. The will excluded the wife of the testator for reasons there set forth. Her right, however, to take against the will, in spite of these reasons, the sufficiency of which, in a moral point of view, could not be questioned, would not have been affected had it not been barred by a divorce subsequently obtained by the testator in a proceeding in which he was libellant. That the reasons so stated afforded just ground for the belief which led him to exclude the child born before the marriage was thus dissolved must be conceded, and whether the actual fact with regard to relationship was or was not what he supposed, his absolute right so to exclude was wholly independent of it, or of the legal principle which, under the maxim pater est quern nuptiae demonstrant, imposed upon him the duties of a father irrespective of even positive proof, a principle strikingly illustrated by the well-known case of P.age v. Dennison, <a href="/pa/29/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="982886" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0420-01">29 Pa. 420</a>, emphasized by the vigorous dissenting opinion of Judge Lowbie, reported in <a href="/grant/1/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Grant 377" data-case-ids="225896" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0377-01">1 Grant, 377</a>.</p>

The duty of the father to furnish support, etc., in a manner befitting her social position was averred, and appropriate relief prayed for. The bill was not served on the testator until June, 1893, and after-wards, in pursuance of an agreement of compromise, executed April 26, 1894, the testator filed an answer to the bill, denying that he had neglected* to perform his duty as father of the child, and alleging that he “ is now and has been at all times ready and willing to provide for the support,” etc., but that the maternal grandfather, the next friend, had retained her in his custody, and refused to surrender her, though duly called upon, etc. The answer, though not actually filed until May 26, was sworn to April 26,1894, which was the date of the compromise. From the report of an auditor in the estate of Edward Padelford, it would seem that the bill in equity, though ostensibly to compel maintenance by the testator, was really designed to obtain recognition of the legal status of the child, and avoid any obstacle in the way of her taking under the limitation to his children in the will of Edward Padelford, his grandfather.</p>

There is simply a recognition of a legal liability from which there was no escape, with nothing whatever which altered the “ previous obligations and legal duties ” of the testator, or gave rise to a “ reasonable presumption of change ” of testamentary purpose. It is true the agreement of compromise contains the expression “love and affection” as constituting, in part, the consideration; but the “ love and affection” thus manifested seem to have had their origin in the litigation, and, so far as the evidence discloses, it never found further expression. It does not appear that the testator at any time during the two years of his life following the compromise availed himself of the stipulated privilege of visiting or being visited by the child whoso legal right he had thus recognized. Moreover, his answer to the bill in equity emphatically negatives the idea of changed feelings or relations. It declares, as already stated, that “ he is now and has been at all times ready and willing to provide for his said child; ” but he does not retract any of the assertions with regard to his wife, and there is no suggestion, still less proof, that the facts attending the birth of the child and the previous conduct of the mother were not precisely what he believed them to be. But the case does not rest here. It is shown, affirmatively, that the agreement and answer were the result of his being convinced by the advice of his counsel that in law he was the father, in spite of any knowledge he might have as to the fact, and that there was in reality no change in his feelings on the subject. That this evidence was admissible, we do not doubt. A presumption arising from facts occurring after the execution of the will is relied upon to establish revocation, and it is well settled that such a presumption (as contradistinguished from a conclusive presumption of law, “ founded in the common consent of mankind and often expressed in statutes ”), depending for its establishment upon proof of external circumstances, may be <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>overcome by proof of the same character: Gill’s Estate, 1 Parsons, 139; Miner v.

It was made general, as the evidence shows, because he contemplated the possibility of a future marriage and the birth of children. Subsequently born children, of course, would acquire an interest in his estate notwithstanding the will, while the power of the guardians under his appointment for the child already born would, under well-settled principles, extend to all property of the ward, irrespective of the source from which it came: Sheetz’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Pa.%20D.%20367" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Pa. D. 367">6 Dist. Rep. 367</a>. It may be that the subsequent agreement that the grandfather should retain custody of the person until 1899 would be operative notwithstanding the codicil, since the statute of Charles II., which permitted an appointment by deed as well <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>as will, lias not been superseded in this respect by our act of assembly; but that the operation of the codicil is to change in any way the disposition of the estate of the testator' as declared by the will, is contrary to well-settled principles. The rule has been established by innumerable decisions that “the dispositions of the will will not be disturbed further than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the codicil; ” or, as was said by Tundan, C. J., in Doe v. Hicks, 8 Bing. 479, “ where a devise in a will is clear, it is incumbent on those who contend that it is not to take effect by reason of a revocation in a codicil, to show that the intention to revoke is equally clear and free from doubt as the original intention to devise.” See Williams on Executors, 9, 10, 220, Wetter’s Appeal, 20 W.
