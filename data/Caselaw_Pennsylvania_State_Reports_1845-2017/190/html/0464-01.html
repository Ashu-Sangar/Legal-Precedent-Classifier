Minot, supra, “ the income,” means the whole income unless the will shows that it means something less. The rule is not modified by the fact that there is a direction to pay the fund to trustees who are to invest and pay over the income, nor is it so held in Phillips’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=138%20Pa.%20426" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="138 Pa. 426">138 Pa. 426</a>, as contended by the learned counsel for the executors. The fund in that instance was to be turned over to the trustees at the convenience of the executors, without interest, and as stated by G-keen, J., in Eichelberger’s Est., <a href="/pa/170/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="170 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="872170" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0242-01">170 Pa. 242</a>, the decision was put directly upon the latter ground ; that it was to be at the convenience of the executors could have no bearing without overturning what was decided in Pennsylvania Co.’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Leg.%20Int.%2026" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="41 Leg. Int. 26">41 Leg. Int. 26</a>, where that was practically the provision, and yet interest from the death of the testator was allowed. Even a direction to invest under the supervision of the orphans’ court was held in Eichelberger’s Est., just cited, to be no ground for postponing the interest; if it were, the executors, as is there pointed out, would be able to frustrate the will of the testator by simply delaying their application to the court.</p>

There have been three accounts filed, a first partial account, June 6,1892, a second partial account, March 25,1895, and a third, final account, May 30, 1898. To the first exceptions were filed and an auditor appointed who passed upon them and distributed to the parties entitled thereto the funds found by him in the hands of the executors. To the second account no exception was filed and it was confirmed finally but no distribution made. The third account was excepted to and we now have the report of the auditor passing on the exceptions and distributing the balance appearing by the last two accounts. The first account embraced by far the larger part of the decedent’s estate, the total covered by it being $36,837.88, and the balance for distribution after all allowances, $26,215.35; while the second account covers a total of but $10,555.46, with a balance for distribution of $9,498.92, and the third account, $4,815.06, with a balance of $3,796.60, the last two accounts together being <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>thus just about one half of the first one. Two thirds of the estate have, therefore, been distributed by the former audit and paid out by the executors without the question which is now pressed upon us being raised. As to that which is so disposed of the exceptant is clearly concluded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[144,605,1176,1796]],["BL_488.1",488,[284,348,1184,2055]],["BL_489.1",489,[150,331,1178,872]]]'>The first account is made up not only of the principal of the estate reduced to money by the executors, by the collection of debts, etc., but of interest and income as well. Of interest alone there is an aggregate of over $1,500, made up of numerous items; of rents, another source of income, there is nearly #160 dollars; and there are two or three items where principal and interest are blended. Here, then, is some $1,600 or $1,700 of income which has gone to swell the general residue of the estate and been distributed as such to the benefit of the exceptant to the extent of his proportionate share therein. By the capitalization of income in this way the result to him in dollars and cents may not be large, he having merely the interest on one sixth of it, but to the executors the overturning of it would be serious; one sixth of the income so capitalized amounts to from $250 to $300, and as to whatever we decide with regard to this exceptant would have to be followed as to Mrs. Nichols, if we should now award to these two parties the amount so due them, some $500 or $600, it would have to come out of the pockets of the executors personally, a thing which we are not prepared to sanction. The exceptant had notice of the former audits and opportunity to make his claim, and he should have done so. As he did not, the adjudication there made must stand. In Lawrence v. Security Co., <a href="/conn/56/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="56 Conn. 423" data-case-ids="513456" data-case-paths="/conn/56/0423-01">56 Conn. 423</a>, a testator bequeathed two thirds of the residue of his estate in trust for the benefit of his daughter for life with remainder over. The executors having exhibited their final account, distribution of the funds reported by them was duly made, and some $40,000 turned over to the trustee. The residue, as so reported by the executors, included $5,000 interest, rents and dividends on investments which had accrued since the death of the testator, and this sum was blended with the principal and distributed with it without distinction as part of the general residuary fund; it was held that the legatee was bound thereby and could not subsequently claim her share of the income included in and disposed of on the distribution. It is true that that was a final account; but <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>in Moyer’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%20387" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="119 Pa. 387">119 Pa. 387</a>, <a href="/pa/141/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="141 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="974867" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0125-01">141 Pa. 125</a>, where, under the provisions of the decedent’s will, a certain sum was directed to be invested and the interest paid to the beneficiary, a claim for interest from the death of the decedent made upon the settlement of a subsequent account was held barred by the adjudication upon the first one, which rules the question squarely. The case of Townsend’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="106 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="455740" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0268-01">106 Pa. 268</a>, may at first blush seem at variance with this, but there are two things which appear to distinguish it. In the first place, after the confirmation and distribution of the first account, the legatees, by bill of review, endeavored to have the adjudication reopened, and while they were not successful, the court was careful to preserve their rights by dismissing the bill without prejudice. And in the next place the executors were also the residuary legatees, and in compelling them to account for the accrued interest they were merely required to give up so much of the residuary estate in their own hands. This was an equitable adjustment which was not cut off by the first distribution: Grim’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/109/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="109 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="542287" data-case-paths="/pa/109/0391-01">109 Pa. 391</a>. Besides that, the amount distributed was small, which seems to have had its influence. “ The appellees are not concluded,” says Stereett, J., “ by the confirmation of the executors’ account or distribution of the small balance then in their hands.” Consideration being given to these circumstances the decision may be reconciled with the others cited; we do not regard it as intending to modify them. But as to the interest and income to be found in the two accounts before us the rigid of the exceptant is clear. He is not bound to await the transfer of the fund to the trustees who are the executors themselves, and their investment of it for his benefit. The interest earned or income received on investments which must necessarily go to make up the residue as ascertained by the executors’ final account are his, and he is entitled to them in the hands of the executors as such, just as much as in their hands as trustees. This is the unquestioned rule where there is the bequest of a specified sum in trust for investment, and was applied in Hilyard’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 30" data-case-ids="478866" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0030-01">5 W. &amp; S. 30</a>, Townsend’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/106/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="106 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="455740" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0268-01">106 Pa. 268</a>, Pennsylvania Co.’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20Leg.%20Int.%2026" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="41 Leg.

The point was squarely raised hi Green v. <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>Green, <a href="/nj-eq/30/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="30 N.J.

Eq. 451</a>, where one fifth of the residue of the estate was given by the testator to his executors in trust to pay the interest as to a certain portion to his daughter for life. “ It is suggested by counsel of the executors,” says Runyon, Ch., “ that all the cases cited on the hearing, in which the rule under consideration has been applied, are cases in which the residuum has been given to a legatee for life with remainder over, and that the rule does not apply to such a ease as this where the residuum is given to trustees in trust to pay interest, etc. But it does apply to the case where the gift is to a trastee charged with the duty of investment so far as securities are concerned upon which interest is received within the year, whether the securities be new investments or old, whether they be investments in which the fund is received from the estate of the testator or new ones made by the trustee. The fact that a trustee is interposed between the legatee and the legacy can make no difference in the application of the rule.”</p>
