McDowell, one of the jury commissioners who assisted in filling the jury wheel and drawing the jury therefrom for June term, 1898, was not a legally elected jury commissioner and that thé array of jurors should for that reason be quashed. McDowell was elected in 1894 and re-elected in 1897. He was elected only twice, and consequently was not “re-elected more than once in any period of six years.” The prohibition is only against a re-election more than once in <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>said period. If the legislature had intended that a jury commissioner should serve only one term in six years the most appropriate language would have been “not elected more than once,” etc. Re-elected is a term that can bear but one meaning, i. e., to elect again — that is he shall not be again elected twice in six years. Webster’s Dictionary defines re-elect, to elect again. The Century Dictionary defines it, re-elect, to elect again. Re-election —election a second time for the same office, etc. When we say that A has been re-elected twice we mean that he has been elected three times — the word re-election referring to his second election. In speaking of B as having served as recorder for eighteen years we say that he has been re-elected five times. The period from which re-election is computed in all eases commences from the end of the first election. In this case therefore the six years during which John H. McDowell could not be re-elected dates from the expiration of his first term and he has been re-elected only once.</p>

The array of jurors for March term, 1898, was quashed by the court because of an irregularity in the method of selection and not because of any objection to the jurors themselves. At the same time the court directed that the names remaining in the jury wheel be taken therefrom and that 800 names be placed therein to serve for the balance of the current year. In pursuance of this order the names were taken from the wheel and de posited in a sealed envelope which remained unopened in the custody of the clerk of the jury commissioners until brought into court during this trial. The judge and two jury commissioners then refilled the wheel from names selected from the body of the county, not using the paper’s on which the names of those taken from the wheel had been written. It happened <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>that amongst the names thus deposited were a number who had been placed therein at the filling of the wheel in January,'1898, but none of whom except one had served as a juror during 1898. The first filling of the wheel was on January 12, 1898, and the second on April 20 and 21,1898. The first term of court in 1898 was the March term, beginning first Monday of March; the second term was June term, beginning first Monday in June.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.4",226,[277,693,1175,1678]]]'>It is now contended that, because the names of some of those who had been taken from the wheel had again been selected and deposited, the whole selection and filling was illegal. It was not' pretended or shown, but on the contrary it was disproved, that the names taken from the wheel were again bodily put back or that the ballots were again used. On the contrary each commissioner and the judge came with new lists made up without reference to those who had been selected in January. It was in every sense a new selection from the body of the county, even if some names were the same as had been before deposited. The case of Kell et al. v. Brillinger, <a href="/pa/84/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="84 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1053564" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0276-01">84 Pa. 276</a>, did not present the same facts for in that case after the names had been taken from the wheel they were divided amongst the commissioners and again redeposited. That was not a new selection. In the present case 800 names were again prepared irrespective of those that had been taken out and were deposited alternately as required by law. The persons whose names were taken from the wheel by direction of the court were not ineligible. The commissioners were required to make a new selection only and not to adopt the first one. If they had decided that the names taken from the wheel could not again be used in a new selection it would not have been from the body of the county, and if such is the law, in some counties with a sparse population if the array should be quashed more than once in any one year, there might not be enough persons subject to jury duty. In Com. v. Baranowski, 6 Pa. C. C. Rep. 157, Judge Pershing in quashing an array and directing a refilling ordered that the names of those men in the jury wheel should be excluded in the new selection, but afterward concluded that such action was in contravention of the act which requires jurors to be selected from the whole qualified electors of the county, and he revoked his former order. This reason is therefore overruled.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.3",227,[142,333,1167,560]]]'>
      <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>8. When the jury commissioners and judge met to take out the names from the wheel and again fill it, the wheel was produced and the sheriff was obliged to be present to unlock it. The names were then taken out by the sheriff or commissioners, but certainly in the presence of the judge and commissioners, and under their supervision and direction. We do not see <em>any </em>irregularity or impropriety in this, even if we admit that the sheriff removed the names. The essential act was to empty the wheel. This was done by direction of and in presence of the jury commissioners, and by no possibility could this defendant be injured by such action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[140,900,1171,1368]]]'>4. This reason is partly disposed of by our ruling on the second reason. John P. Jones had served as a petit juror at March sessions, and by mistake his name was again placed in the wheel at the refilling. He had been drawn and served as a juror at March sessions before the array was quashed, but was not drawn for the June term at which this case was tried. The requisite number of jurors were drawn and appeared at tbe June term and defendant, therefore, had no cause of complaint, for he was not injured in his challenges. The act of assembly forbids the return to the wheel of the name of any person who may have served as a juror during the year in which such service shall be rendered, and provides a penalty on the officer who shall intentionally do so, but this is a matter of which the defendant cannot complain as it did not curtail his challenges. A defendant has no right to any particular jurors, nor can he complain that a less number of qualified persons were summoned: Buchanan v. Com., 5 Central Rep. 738 : Holland v. Com., <a href="/pa/82/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="82 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1047901" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0306-01">82 Pa. 306</a>; Foust v.

If this reason should sustain a challenge to the array, then the placing of the name of any one unqualified person in the jury wheel would always be a ground for challenge. Considering the difficulty of selecting 1,000 names, as is now done in Montgomery county at the beginning of each year, it would be almost impossible not occasionally to make a mistake arising from change of residence, death, noncitizenship and other causes. This view of the law would make it absurd, and we cannot sustain the view of defendant’s counsel.</p>

The second bill of indictment was sent before the grand jury by leave of court, and the first bill was quashed before commencement of the trial on the second bill, the reason assigned being that the first bill was found by a grand jury composed of the array which had been quashed.

The offer complained of in this reason was to prove a matter having no possible relation to the case on trial.

Kaiser, Jr., was called as a witness he was objected to as incompetent upon the ground that he had been found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to be hanged. Kaiser was a willing witness in the sense that he was willing to testify, although it would implicate himself. He was allowed to testify, and this is assigned as error. Whatever may have been the status of this witness before the passage of the act of 1887 we think that under said act he was competent. The object of the act itself and those which preceded it relating to the competency of witnesses was to render all persons competent except a certain class designated in the act of 1887. Before the passage of the enabling acts a defendant in a criminal proceeding amounting to a felony was incompetent as a witness. This was not by statute but a common-law disqualification — our criminal laws did not refer to the subject and in Com. v.

Copley, <a href="/pa/67/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="67 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1022522" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0386-01">67 Pa. 386</a>, Judge Agnew also says, “Infamous crimes are treason, felony, and every species of the crimen falsi, such as forgery, perjury,” etc. It will therefore be seen that the disqualification followed any conviction of felony whether murder, robbery, burglary and also perjury. When the legislature passed the act of 1887, it had knowledge that a conviction for certain offenses disqualified the person convicted as a witness. In order to distinguish between offenses that would hereafter disqualify and those that would not, the act specifies those in which persons are not competent and all other persons shall be fully competent. As perjury was an infamous crime, disqualifying as a witness, its retention in the act of 1887 as the one disqualification clearly evidences the intention to remove the disqualification in all other cases of conviction. At common law murder was no more an infamous crime than treason, felony or forgery. “ It is the infamy of the crime, and not the nature or mode of the punishment, that de<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>stroys competency: ” Schuylkill Co. v. Copley, <a href="/pa/67/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="67 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1022522" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0386-01">67 Pa. 386</a>; Com. v.

In Com. v. Barry, 8 Pa. C. C. R. 216, the defendant was indicted for an assault with an intent to kill, and offered himself as a witness. The record of his conviction and sentence for manslaughter was then offered in evidence for the purpose of impeaching his credit as a witness. In ruling on the subject Judge Arnold said: “ Under the old law the prisoner would not have been compelled to testify in any case. His conviction and sentence for a felony would have excluded him as an infamous person, etc. The objection to competency having been removed, by the development of the common law as well as by statute, the previous conviction and sentence of a witness may now be shown to affect his credibility.” The object of all evidence is to develop the truth — under the old law the parties most cognizant of the fact were excluded, but time and experience has demonstrated that the best way to elicit the truth is to allow all persons to testify (except in enumerated cases), and allow the jury to pass upon the credibility of the witness. If defendant’s contention is correct then, if Kaiser had been willing to admit his own guilt and Clemmer’s innocence, he would have been excluded. The result of such ruling shows its impropriety; and if a conviction of murder disqualifies so also could a conviction for larceny, robbery, forgery, or any felony. Such lias not been the view taken by the courts since the passage of the act of 1887, for at least in this court convicted felons have been brought into court to testify without objection. It is strenuously urged that in law Kaiser was civilly dead because of his conviction and sentence. This doctrine has no place in the jurisprudence of Penn' sylvania. In 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (1st ed.), p. 27.", it is thus defined: Civiliter mortuis — civilly dead. The legal punition or extinction of a person’s rights and capacities among his fellow members of society. — Abbott’s Law Diet. A man is said to be civilly dead when he has been attainted of treason or felony, etc. He must be attainted before he is incompetent as a witness. A conviction of a felony without attainder does not destroy the competency of a witness : Skinner v. Perot, 1 Ash. 57. In Pennsylvania there can be no attainder by legislation, for by the constitution it is expressly provided, sec. 18, art. 1, Declaration of Rights, “ No person shall be attainted of treason <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>or felony by the legislature.” By sec. 10, art. 1, Constitution of the United States, it is provided that “No state shall pass any bill of attainder.” If there is an attaint it must therefore follow from the conviction. As the act of 1887 prescribed the qualification of witnesses, it removed the disqualification imposed by the common law, and thereafter all persons are witnesses except those convicted of perjury. In England and most of the United States the disqualification of infamy is removed by statute, leaving the fact of conviction to be proved for the consideration of the jury upon the sole question of credibility. Such is the present state of the law in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin: 10 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (1st ed.), p. 612. The doctrine is odious and not in harmony with the more advanced humane ideas of modern society. We no longer treat criminals with the rigor of olden times but as human beings subject to punishment, but without the unreasonable consequences which followed conviction in the earlier ages. The basis of the exclusion of an infamous witness Avas the unreliability of his testimony, but that a man on the threshold of the grave, Avith every inducement then to speak the truth, should be disqualified, although the jury might believe him truthful, because he has been comdcted of a crime, has not been declared to be the law by any court in this state, and we are unwilling to adopt such a doctrine, except in the cases especially designated by the legislature.</p>

Why should the jury reconcile testimony not material or which did not point to his.guilt conclusively ? It was simply saying to the jury, immaterial testimony need not be considered, nor any testimony that does not point unerringly to Iris guilt.

It would be almost impossible without reading the entire notes for the court to refer to every circumstance. We tried to recall the prominent points for and against the prisoner, and if the preponderance was in favor of the commonwealth it was because there were so few in favor of the prisoner. His defense consisted of his own unsupported assertion that he was not at the scene of the murder and there was nothing for the court to dilate upon. Considering the length of time taken in the trial of this case, the volume of testimony and the number of witnesses, it is of course easy to say that all matters were not recalled to the jury. This is not unusual in trials of this character, but unless serious omissions are made or unless the court unfairly presents the ease against the prisoner it should not be good cause for a new trial.

    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.8",237,[145,1132,1167,251]]]'>On an indictment properly charging the defendant, James A. Clemmer, with the murder of Emma P. Kaiser, on the evening of October 28, 1896, he was duly tried, found guilty of murder of the first degree and sentenced to suffer the penalty affixed by the law to that high felony.</p>
    <p id="b237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_237.9",237,[144,1390,1169,1020]],["BL_238.1",238,[269,377,1178,910]]]'>The testimony introduced by the commonwealth tended strongly to prove not only that Mrs. Kaiser was brutually murdered at the time and place laid in the indictment, but also that the murder was committed by the defendant and Charles O. Kaiser, Jr., the murdered woman’s husband, in pursuance of a conspiracy, the object of which was to secure the proceeds of certain policies of insurance which had been placed on Mrs. Kaiser’s life; that, while driving with her husband, Mrs. Kaiser was intentionally shot and killed by the defendant, who, at the same time, and in pursuance of the prearranged plan, shot and wounded her husband in the arm. On the trial, the murdered woman’s husband testified, in substance, that the defendant fired the fatal shot. One of the commonwealth’s witnesses, Elizabeth DeKalb, testified that the defendant admitted his guilt to her and gave her Mrs. Kaiser’s watch, with instructions to throw it away. Letters from the defendant to the same witness, urgently requesting her not to testify against him, were also produced and put in evidence by the commonwealth. It was also testified that on the evening of the murder the defendant had hired a horse which was subsequently seen near the <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>scene of the murder; and one of the witnesses identified the defendant as a person he had seen near the place of the shooting and about the time it occurred. Numerous facts and circumstances were also in evidence which tended to corroborate the commonwealth’s witnesses and establish the fact of defendant’s guilty participation hi the murder. Among these were his admissions and expressions to several persons, tending- to show his knowledge of the killing of Mrs. Kaiser; also his flight from the state, change of his name, and the finding of the murdered woman’s watch at Pottsville, where Elizabeth DeKalb testified she had dropped it at the defendant’s request. Without further reference to the substance of the evidence on which the commonwealth relied, it is sufficient to say that, if believed by the jury, it was quite sufficient to establish the corpus delicti, and the fact that the defendant actively participated in the murder of Mrs. Kaiser, under circumstances which indicate that the killing was wilful, deliberate and premeditated — a coldblooded murder.</p>
    <p id="b238-5" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[265,1305,1193,963]]]'>After a fair and impartial trial, in which all the defendant’s rights appear to have been carefully guarded, the case was fairly. submitted to the jury in a clear, comprehensive and fully adequate charge, to which no just exception can be taken, and they by their verdict pronounced him guilty of murder of the first degree. A subsequent consideration of the defendant’s motion in arrest of judgment, reasons for a new trial, etc., appears to have satisfied the learned tidal court that there was no material error in the proceedings leading up to and including the verdict; and thereupon, final judgment was pronounced. Our consideration of the record, including the rulings and instructions of the court, has satisfied us all as to the substantial correctness of the proceeding in the court below; and we might well conclude with an affirmance of the judgment, but the zealous efforts of counsel in behalf of their client have induced them to present numerous specifications of error, nearly all of which have been satisfactorily disposed of by the learned trial judge in his opinion overruling the motion in arrest of judgment and reasons for new trial.</p>
    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[267,2284,1171,149]],["BL_239.1",239,[158,358,1169,962]]]'>The first specification charges error in refusing to quash the array of petit jurors on the ground that John H. McDowell, who participated in the selection of the persons whose names <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>were placed in the jury wheel, was not eligible to the office of jury commissioner at the November election in 1897. This is the result of an erroneous construction of the act under which Mr. McDowell was re-elected jury commissioner in 1897, but if this were not so, a sufficient answer to the objection is that, as against all parties except the commonwealth, his acts as jury commissioner, under his second election, could not be called in question. He was at least jury commissioner de facto: Campbell v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/96/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="96 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="494665" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0344-01">96 Pa. 344</a>. In that case, two persons sat as associate judges not learned in the law, and participated with the president of the court in the trial and sentence of persons convicted of arson. It was objected that under the present constitution the electors of the county in which the court sat had no power to elect lay judges; but this Court held that the associate judges in question were judges de facto, and as against everybody except the commonwealth they were judges de jure, and that their title to the office they respectively held could not be questioned in any other way than by writ o£ quo warranto at the suit of the commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b239-5" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[162,1338,1165,812]]]'>The second, fourth and fifth specifications, relating to the refusal of the court to quash the array of petit jurors, because certain names that had been in the previous array, which had been quashed, had been again placed in the wheel, etc., cannot be sustained. It appeared that the former array had been quashed by the court because of an irregularity hr the method of selection, and not because of any objection to the jurors themselves. The learned judge of the court below, in his opinion on the motion in arrest of judgment, says: “Each commissioner and the judge came in with new lists made up without reference to those who had been selected in January. It was in every sense a new selection from the body of the county, even if some names were the same as had been before deposited ” in the wheel. It thus clearly appears that the defendant could not have been in any way injured by the action of the jury commissioners.</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[162,2159,1166,251]],["BL_240.1",240,[259,362,1172,187]]]'>There is no merit in the third specification which complains of the court’s action in sending the bill of indictment on which the defendant was convicted before the grand jury while a previous indictment was pending. In Rosenberger v. Com., <a href="/pa/118/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="118 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="556769" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0077-01">118 Pa. 77</a>, it was said: “ It was also urged that no conviction <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>could be bad upon tbe second indictment so long as the first— the missing indictment — was undisposed of. There is no merit in this. If both indictments had been in court, the defendant could have been tried on either.”</p>
    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[259,567,1170,250]]]'>The sixth specification, alleged incompetency of Charles O. Kaiser, Jr., as a witness for the commonwealth, because he had been previously convicted of murder and, when called, was under sentence of death. Under the Act of May 28, 1887, P. L. 158, we think he was clearly a competent witness.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[249,825,1185,505]]]'>The seventh to the thirteenth specifications, inclusive, and also the twenty-first specification, relating to various rulings of . the court below on evidence offered to prove that the motive of the murderer was to obtain the proceeds of insurance policies on the life of the murdered woman, cannot be sustained. There was uo error in any of these rulings. Nor do we find any error in the instructions referred to in the fourteenth to the twentieth specifications, inclusive, and in the twenty-second and twenty-third specifications. There is nothing in either of them that requires extended comment.</p>
    <p id="b240-7" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[262,1339,1173,395]]]'>We find nothing in the record to justify the two remaining specifications. They both appear to be lacking in fairness to the learned trial judge. The amount of testimony introduced by the defendant was very much less than that of the commonwealth, and it is not at all surprising that the time required for necessary reference to the former should be very much less than that necessarily occupied in calling the jury’s attention to the latter.</p>
    <p id="b240-8" data-blocks='[["BL_240.7",240,[263,1752,1174,352]]]'>Fourteen points for charge, bearing on nearly every possible phase of the defense, were submitted to and answered by the learned trial judge quite as favorably to the defendant as he was entitled to. Ten of these points were affirmed without qualification, two were properly qualified and the remaining two were refused.

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>“ 3. It is not sufficient that the circumstances, pointing to guilt create a probability, even a strong probability, of the prisoner’s guilt; but to convict, the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the circumstances exclude, to a moral certainty, every other hypothesis except that of guilt. . . .</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[173,637,1166,302]]]'>“5. Questions, concerning the identity of persons, animals and vehicles are liable to confusion, uncertainty and mistake, and before the jury can convict the prisoner of the murder of Emma P. Kaiser it must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prisoner was present and either assisted in the killing, or was present counseling and abetting it. . . .</p>
    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[173,945,1165,301]]]'>“ 8. An accomplice occupies a position of disrepute; and from the very character of such a witness, the law and the courts look with great caution upon their testimony, whilst their credibility is for the jury, yet taking into account their disreputable character and position, it would be very dangerous and unsafe for the jury to convict the prisoner upon such testimony. . . .</p>

The burden of proof rests upon the commonwealth from first to the last to satisfy the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the prisoner either committed the murder of Emma P.
