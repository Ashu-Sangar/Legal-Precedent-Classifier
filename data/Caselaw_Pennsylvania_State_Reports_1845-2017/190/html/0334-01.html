She declares, however, that she knows what was said, adding “ I wouldn’t have done it if I had known that I would get fast.” Her husband deposes that, just before signing the papers, “ she asked Mr. Sehweyer, she hoped it wouldn’t go further than the thirty-four acres,” and “ then Sehweyer said, ‘ It shall not go further than the thirty-four acres.’ ” He emphatically declares there was no previous conversation or arrangement on the subject — nothing but what was said when the papers were executed. Nor, according to his statement, was there, at that time, anything said about the bond. The material portions of the scrivener’s testimony are as follows: “ Mrs. Walbert when she signed it (the bond and mortgage) told me that she didn’t want to bind her other property, something to that effect .... I think he (Sehweyer) was by; that is my recollection .... I couldn’t say (what Mr. Sehweyer said) .... Mrs. Walbert told me to read these papers to her and explain it to her, and she said, ‘Now it is understood that I do not bind my other property,’ that is, her property that she had at that time. I said, ‘ Yes, that way it is understood,’ and I understood it so too.” On cross-examination, after stating that there was no conversation between Mrs. Walbert and Sehweyer (DeLoug not being present), he testifies:</p>

In the present case, it would be inaccurate to say that there is any evidence whatever to show that the original purchase of the property by Sarah Walbert was induced by any understanding concerning the extent of her liability upon the bond and war<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>rant she subsequently executed. There seems to have been no mention of the subject at that time. Indeed, it is undisputed that the terms of the original purchase are fixed by the agreement of January 4, 1890. But that agreement, in so far as it refers to the security to be given for such part of the purchase money as shall remain unpaid, speaks only of a “ mortgage on the said premises.” A mortgage does not import any personal liability for the money it secures: Scott v.

Hence, according to the precise terms of the agreement, Sarah Walbert was not bound to give an obligation which would create a personal liability. If she was nevertheless induced to give one by an agreement limiting its effect, the transaction would fall within the rule above stated. It is suggested, however, with much ingenuity, that what the defendant here alleges is not an agreement to relieve her of personal liability on the bond, but only an agreement to restrict the lien of the judgment authorized to be entered by the warrant of attorney attached to the bond, so as not to constitute a continuing incumbrance upon her other real estate. This suggestion is based upon the decision in Stanton v. White, <a href="/pa/32/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="32 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="986761" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0358-01">supra.</a> If, as in that case, the question of the effect of the agreement here alleged depended upon the legal interpretation of the terms of a writing evidencing it, and were therefore one of law, it would be for the court to say whether the phrase used, “ bind,” “ go further,” etc., imported only a restriction of the lien, or a restriction of liability. If the former, the rule in Stanton v. White would apply. But the alleged agreement, in this case, rests in parol. Where a contract is made orally, the question of its effect is not one of mere interpretation, declaring the legal meaning of terms employed. The inquiry then is, in the first place, What was the language used by the parties ? and, in the second place, What was intended and understood by them when they used it ? and these are questions of fact, not of law: Maynes v. Atwater, <a href="/pa/88/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="88 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="1061217" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0496-01">88 Pa. 496</a>; Forrest v.

Upon each of them in the present case (and upon their decision as questions of fact must depend the applicability of the doctrine laid down in Stanton v. White) the evidence — embracing both the depositions of the witnesses <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>and the admitted facts — is such as to suggest, as a prudent course and in fairness to both parties, the aid of a jury, and therefore, under the doctrine of Jenkintown Nat. Bank’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="124 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="563065" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0337-01">124 Pa. 337</a>, Fisher v.

It cannot, of course, be denied that the grounds upon which the latter is based involve the reformation of a written instrument. See Irwin v.

A discussion in detail of the testimony here offered would, at this time, be unadvisable. As opposed by the explicit denials and averments of the plaintiff’s assignors, its effect depends upon the credibility of witnesses whom the court has not now before it, upon presumptions of fact, and upon the weight of evidence as tested by the considerations just mentioned.
