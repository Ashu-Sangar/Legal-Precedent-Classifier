Now the question I asked you was whether you remember whether there were screens in the breaker for the preparations of pea coal during those years ? A. We shipped no pea during my time. Q. Were there screens for its separation and preparation there ? A. I think there were. Q. What kind of coal was the steam generated with that was used? A. With pea coal. Q. Now do you remember the character of the veins that were mined by the company, as to thickness, as to quality, and the character of the coal; if so, tell us what <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>your recollection is as to that. A. The coal that we got from what I presume 3rou call the plaintiff’s tract there, what we call the Carbon Hill tract, was very thin; the vein was very thin, and mixed very largely with rock and slate; it was dirty, it was very costly to mine. Q. Now coming down to 1882 and those four years following, 1882 to 1886, and including the year 1886, what were you personally engaged in then? A. I was engaged in the work of the Hillside Coal and Iron Company in those years. Q. In what official position if any ? A. First as superintendent, and afterwards as president. Q. It was mining in this region, was it not, during these years, from 1882 to 1886 ? I don’t mean in the Mudtown breaker, bat in this section of Pennsylvania ? A. Yes, sir. Q. How many collieries did you have during those years ? A. Part of the time four, part of the time six. Q. Was the work of the company during those years under your personal supervision and control ? A. General oversight, I should rather call it. Q. Did you have opportunities to ascertain the prices of coal in the market during those years and the demand for the several sizes? A. To some extent, yes. Q. 'Phis company mined quite a large tonnage, did it not, during these years? A. Well, we thought it was a larges tonnage, but we don’t consider it large today. Q. Well, it ran into the hundred thousands? A. Yes, sir, five or six hundred thousands a year. Q. And the mining was done through breakers witli screens in tbe preparation that was then used ? A. Yes, sir. Q. And the company bad eoal dumps in connection with tbeir breakers ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now I want to ask you whether culm dumps were regarded as of anjr value during any of those years from 1882 to 1886 ? A. Some companies during those years separated their depletus; tbey threw it away; the culm and whatever size might be in it below chestnut; then again other collieries separated tbe slate and rock from tbe other. Now these culm dumps which contained no rock were considered valuable. Q. I mean where the dumps were thrown in promiscuously with the sulphur and bone and rock and slate and some pea and buckwheat and smaller stuff, when it was all in one dump, were those dumps regarded as of any value during those years? A. Very few, if any. Q. Were there any endeavors around here with which you were familiar during those years where they attempted to utilize those dumps ? A. Not that I <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>remember. Q. Isn’t it a fact that culm dumps were used during those years in filling, grading, ballasting of tracks of railroads, filling the streets and excavations? A. Yes, sir.”. [4]</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[272,589,1182,1077]]]'>[If you find that it is proved that culm was taken by the defendant, then you will inquire whether the plaintiff had any damages. Ordinarily where one man unlawfully enters upon the land of another, there the complaining party is entitled to some damages, although he cannot show that what was done there was any special injury, or what was taken away was of any special value. The law says that for the invasion of a man’s right he shall recover damages, even though none have been specially shown. In such eases the court direct the jury, if they find there was a trespass, to award nominal damages if nothing more; that is, six cents, or one dollar, or some other small sum. This, gentlemen, however, does not apply to this proceeding. The plaintiff by his proceeding has placed himself under the act of assembly which provides that the plaintiff shall have damages if any have been proved, and so I say to you that, although there has been a taking here of this culm, unless it is proved that the plaintiff had damages; that it was an injury to him, a deprivation to him of something that was of value to him, if you find there were no damages, then you will find in favor of the defendant, although the culm was taken.] [5]</p>

One relates to the admission of testimony offered by the defendant to show that the materials taken by it from the <em>plaintiff's </em>land had no market value, and the other to the instruction fcj Lie court that there could be no recovery by the plaintiff without proof of actual loss.</p>

      <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>The plaintiff is the owner of coal lands on which from 1868 to 1876 mining óperations were conducted by its lessees. Quantities of culm from the breakers were deposited at the side of the bluff near the defendant’s road. In 1886, according to the plaintiff’s contention, and iu 1882 and 1883, according to the defendant’s, a considerable quantity of the culm was removed by the defendant and used by it for ballast, filling, excavations and in constructing embankments. Under the provisions of special acts incorporating the Pennsylvania Coal Company and the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company, which were merged with the corporation defendant, the plaintiff in 1892 filed a petition in the common pleas for the appointment of a jury “ to view the premises, estimate and determine the quantity, quality and value of the materials so taken as aforesaid, and to estimate and determine, as provided by law, whether, and, if any, what, damages have been or may be sustained,” etc. The plaintiff appealed from the finding of the jury, and on the trial in the common pleas of the issue thus arising the defendant claimed that the culm at the time it was taken had no market value. In support of this claim it offered testimony to prove that in the same general locality from 1882 to 1886 culm was used generally for the purpose of grading streets and railroads, and for other like purposes, and that the owners of culm piles gave the material away, and were glad to get rid of it without expense to themselves.</p>

No land was taken, and there was no injury to the land by reason of the removal of the piles of refuse. The only thing taken that had a possible value was the coal in the culm piles, and the plaintiff’s case rested on proofs of the amount and value of the coal. The inquiry was then narrowed to the market value of the culm piles at the time they were taken. That culm was used for the same purposes as stone, sand and clay, and was given away by the owners with a desire to get rid of it, was illustrative and confirmatory of the assertion that it had no market value. A single instance, it is true, would not be enough, as a particular sale of land is not evidence of the market value of other land in the same <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>vicinity, as it may have been compelled by necessity or lmve been the result of caprice or folly: P. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Patterson, <a href="/pa/107/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="107 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="8858174" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0461-01">107 Pa. 461</a>. Culm piles at that time were not sold; they were not retained by the owners with a view to a prospective value. Evidence that they were generally used for the commonest purposes, for which other materials could have been had without cost, and that they were freely given away, went directly to their market value.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[160,767,1173,714]]]'>In an action of trespass for taking its property the plaintiff would have been entitled to recover nominal damages without proof of actual loss. But this was a statutory proceeding to determine “ whether, and, if any, what damages, had been sustained.” The entry was under the right of eminent domain. The culm was taken with the full knowledge and passive assent, if not with the actual permission of the plaintiff, who acquiesced without objection in all that was done by the defendant. The whole proceeding was to recover damages based, not upon a wrongful invasion of the plaintiff’s rights, but upon an act of assembly which authorized the taking of the property, and made the defendant liable for the damage actually done. We therefore see no error in the instruction that the plaintiff was not entitled to a verdict without proof of actual loss.</p>
