After the date of the lease defendant acquired title to the lot occupied by plaintiffs, and also to the adjoining lot, for the purpose of erecting thereon a large office building. Before work was begun, defendants wrote plaintiffs’ attorney that during the progress of the work the alleyway would be preserved intact, and a clear passage through it afforded to plaintiffs. To this the attorney replied that his clients were pleased to receive the information and would rely upon defendants’ assurance that they were to have the unobstructed use of the alley. While the alley was necessarily changed in appearance above and underneath, during the progress of the work, it was not obstructed, but was maintained at its full width, and in a condition for plaintiffs’ constant use. <em>Held, </em>that the court committed no error in refusing an injunction.</p>

The facts are very fully found by the court below. The complainants, under a lease for a term expiring March 10, 1899, are in the occupancy of premises 1344 Chestnut street, with the privilege of a four feet alley west<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>ward to Broad street; the defendant, the Real Estate Trust Company, became the lessee for fifty years of 1348 Chestnut street, cornering on Broad and extending along Broad southward to a four feet alloy leading westward to Broad from the premises 1344 occtipied by plaintiffs. The trust company, also, about the same time, became the owner of lot 109, South Broad street, bounded on the north by the same alley; it thus became the lessee and owner of the entire frontage at that point on Broad street embracing the alley, but subject of course to plaintiffs’ right to use of same. This right is described in plaintiffs’ lease as “ the privilege of the passageway in the rear leading into Broad street.” In addition to the frontage on Broad street, embracing the exit from the four feet alley, the trust company, on February 1, 1897, acquired by proper conveyance the fee simple of premises 1344 occupied by plaintiffs, who afterwards attorned to and paid rent to the company. All these purchases were made by the trust company, with a view to the erection of a large and costly building on that corner covering the entire front of its ownership on Broad street. In its plans and specifications for building, and its contract with Doyle &amp; Doak, the builders, the company recognized the privilege of plaintiffs during their term in the passageway or four feet alley, and exacted from the builders a stipulation, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[125,1583,1173,709]]]'>“ The general contractors agree to use, provide, and make all proper, necessary, and sufficient arrangements, construction, and provision for keeping open for free, safe, and uninterrupted use of same by the tenants of 1344 Chestnut street, the alley i eading from Broad street to the last mentí oned property. They will maintain the floor of this alley at all times, and will provide the necessary roof to the same; they will at no time allow 1'ree access to, from, and through this alley by such tenants to be interfered with in any manner whatever. And the general contractors further agree that they will so conduct the general construction of this building, in other particulars, outside of the question of this alley, as not in any manner to interfere with or violate any of the legal rights or privileges of the said tenants of said property, No. 1344 Chestnut Street.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[125,2300,1168,94]],["BL_152.1",152,[289,338,1171,503]]]'>The court below has found as a fact, that during the progress of the building, the alley was maintained at its full width, and <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>although, necessarily changed in appearance, above and underneath, by the character of the structure built over, under, and around it, yet that nothing was done which in any way restricted plaintiffs’ privilege or right as theretofore enjoyed by them. And further, as a conclusion of law from the written documents in evidence, the court held, plaintiffs had but an easement of right of passageway from 1344 to Broad street, and as no act had been committed in derogation of this right, their bill for the. injunction was dismissed. Plaintiffs now appeal.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[287,851,1172,863]]]'>The main contention of appellants, is, an allegation of error in the conclusions of law, as to the relative legal rights of the parties under the writings exhibited in evidence. It is argued from these, that the right to the alley was common to both parties, so that neither, without the assent of the other, had the right to alter the character of the alley in any particular, or in any way or manner to obstruct the same, even temporarily for the purpose of building. Ellis v. Academy of Music, <a href="/pa/120/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="120 Pa. 608" data-case-ids="559863" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0608-01">120 Pa. 608</a>, and many other authorities, are cited in support of this contention. We think, in view of the undisputed facts, a discussion of the technical legal rights of the parties is wholly unnecessary. Plaintiffs had a right of passage in the four feet alley, let the legal definition and scope of the right be what they may; defendants conceded this right; but almost three months before they struck a pick, this correspondence took place' between Judge Jenkins, attorney for plaintiffs, and Mr. Hippie, president of the trust company:</p>
