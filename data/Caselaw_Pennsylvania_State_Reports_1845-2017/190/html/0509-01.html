Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20Pa.%20508" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="155 Pa. 508">155 Pa. 508</a>. The legacies are cumulative. She is entitled to both: Manifold’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="126 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="968886" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0508-01">126 Pa. 508</a>.

If the trust for life, with limitation over, in the eleventh clause, had been for the petitioner alone, it is probable the rule would apply to the bequest in this codicil: Lejee’s Est., <a href="/pa/181/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="181 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="891447" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0416-01">181 Pa. 416</a>. In the case cited, however, there were more specific and definitive words, expressing a purpose “ to add to the legacy of my niece.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[166,656,1173,860]]]'>The rule is not universal, nor is it more than prima facies, Pike v. Walley, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Gray%20346" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 Gray 346">15 Gray, 346</a>, and it is only where the subject of the first gift is absolutely bestowed, or made defeasible, that it is applied. It is not extended either so far as to alter an absolute second gift into an estate for life, with limitation over to the person designated to take in the first one, after the legatee’s death, for that would give him something that plainly was not intended: Williams on Executors (6th Am. ed.), p. 1296; In re More’s Trust, 10 Hare, 171; Overend v. Gurney, 7 Sim. 128; Mann v. Fuller, Kay, 624. And, standing alone, the second legacy vests absolutely. The rule can be invoked only when consistent both with the terms of the gift itself and the scope of the rest of the will: King v. Tootel, 25 Beav. 23. The purpose always being to serve the intention of the testator, as we may be able to read it, mere artificial rules devised for interpretation only, unless technical rules of property, will not arrest the consummation of it.</p>

This bequest could not be added to the principal of that joint legacy, and dispositions of it be made either before or after the death of one, in exact accordance with the direction. Doubtless there would be no practical difficulty in preserving the two funds, either distinct or in one investment for the payment of the income in unequal shares to the persons constituting this class, but it is not clear enough that he intended io make the second gift a part of this particular trust with its limitations, although he may have purposed it to be separately held for similar uses of the legatee since he desig<a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>nated it “ to be left in trust.” Without further definition of it, however, and treated singly, it vests absolutely. The word “ and ” by which the second legacy is introduced does not seem to direct the thought back to the first gift as if intended to be a part, but rather implies a substantive gift and independent of it, if it can have any significance at all. It followed immediately the cancelation of three other paragraphs. I have been directed to no authorities covering these precise conditions; perhaps they do not exist. But after some hesitation, I think the conclusion of the learned auditor is fairly supported by the reasons which he gives and by these additional considerations.</p>
