William Lewis, in the year 1886 and prior thereto, conducted a business next to that carried on by Margaret Steinmetz. In that year he was solicited by her and in her behalf for loans of money; and he then began to make such loans, and, as they grew in frequency and amount, he obtained from her an assurance that she would secure their repayment by the execution of mortgages of the real estate which had passed under the will of her husband. In this way Margaret Steinmetz executed to William Lewis, at Ms request, the mortgage, in fee simple, of all the real estate which was of Adam Steinmetz to secure the payment of $1,000, dated September 18, 1886. In the same manner she executed to him and at his request a similar mortgage of all the same real estate to secure the payment of $3,000, dated April 14, 1888.

The deed is recorded in Philadelphia in deed book, No. 392, p. 188, and William Lewis was made assignee. He filed an inventory and appraisement, collected from debtors and paid to creditors, but rendered no account of his assigneeship, alleging that he was not required by the creditors to do so who knew there was nothing for distribution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[129,1286,1174,1130]],["BL_584.1",584,[312,350,1180,1273]]]'>3. The bill avers that if any valuable consideration passed from Lewis at the time of the execution of the mortgage, it was not used for the estate of Adam Steinmetz, and this was known to Lewis, but it was a transaction between him and Margaret Steinmetz. This is denied in the answer of William Lewis, and it is alleged that the loans made by him were made to the estate; that the notes given for the loans were signed by Margaret Steinmetz as executor or by her attorney as executor, and he believed the money was being used by her for the benefit of the estate. This is directly responsive to the averment, and, therefore, is to be accepted as true, unless overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or of one with corroborating circumstances, or unless it is in conflict with the testimony of the respondent on the same point. William Lewis was cross-examined on the part of the complainant and on this head testified that he knew Margaret Steinmetz was conducting the steam marble mill under the name of A. Steinmetz &amp; Company; that the check or notes given for much of the moneys advanced by him were so signed, or signed A. Steinmetz &amp; Company, per Emma Steinmetz, attorney, or Merceron, attorney, or Kornbaugh, attorney. He further testified that he had, by way of loan, paid a bill to Baird &amp; Son for stone by them furnished to the business of Margaret <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>Steinmetz, and lie had aided in securing for her marble work a contract to furnish material in erecting one of the buildings of a trust company upon which contract he stipulated he should receive ten per centum of the moneys paid. Upon re-examination he testified that he supposed the money which he loaned her was to pay the taxes and interest due by the estate until the real property could be sold. His testimony was in a measure contradictory of his answer, not sufficiently so, perhaps, to overcome its effect as evidence (Spencer’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/80/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="80 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="1042296" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0317-01">80 Pa. 317</a>), but enough to weaken its force. The averment of the bill in this behalf ivas corroborated by the testimony of Kornbaugh that the business straits of Margaret Steinmetz were known to, and were the subject of talk between, him, Merceron and Lewis. This was not denied either by Merceron or Lewis, and the latter had the opportunity to deny it. It was further corroborated by the testimony of Merceron, that at the time referred to Lewis was solicited to loan to the business, and that he did so loan. Hence it is found as a fact that Lewis knew that the moneys loaned by him to Margaret Steinmetz were loaned for the business in which she ivas engaged, and ivas so used by it; that he knew some of it was wanted for taxes and interest due by the estate and ivas so used, but the evidence showed a comparatively small part was so used, and there was no evidence that any of the loans to secure which the mortgages were executed were made to or for the benefit of the estate.</p>

In the latter part of 1888, some of the children of Margaret Steinmetz, doubting her power to mortgage real estate in which they had an interest, consulted counsel with respect to it.

The power to sell included that to pledge in mortgage as the lesser disposition. The disputed mortgages covered the testator’s real estate. They were not executed to raise money to pay the testator’s debts; and even had they been executed to obtain moneys to relieve the accruing burden of taxation and interest upon those debts which the testator had created and made fixed liens upon his real property, such purpose would not have brought them within the requirement of the will in this behalf. For such taxes interest and repairs became obligations of the life tenant. It was argued on behalf of the validity of the mortgages that they were executed for purposes of the testator’s estate, inasmuch as one of those was the conduct by his widow of his business of steam marble works. But this business was not to be conducted for the benefit of the estate, it was for the widow’s sole and separate use and benefit, even to the extent to dispose of it without liability or control. It was further urged that if the power of sale was not intended to be used for the business there was nothing in the intention of the testator that could answer the “ purposes of my estate.” This seems a pure assumption, for the ordinary purposes beneficial to an estate incumbered b}r mortgages at the time of testator’s death as this would be to sell the realty or a part of it at a price higher than would be likely if it were sold under legal proceedings, or to sell if either the rise in the value of real estate, or an impending depreciation would render such a sale expedient. It was finally argued that as the testator relieved an intending purchaser from seeing to the application of the purchase money any sale (or mortgage) by the executors was valid and within the power. But this overlooks the limitation of the power. Exercised as the testator’s will intended and expressed, that is to say, (1) for the payment of his debts, or (2) the purposes of his estate, a purchaser could securely pay to the executors and be free of liability even if they misapplied or otherwise squandered it. But this freedom only existed when the power was legally exercised, and there is no <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>logical connection between such freedom in such exercise, and the conclusion argued that any sale was within the powei granted. With respect to the two disputed mortgages it has been found as a fact that the mortgagee had the means of knowing, and therefore knew, that the money to be raised thereby was intended for use and was used in the conduct of the business of the testator by his widow; and was not therefore for the purpose of paying the testator’s debts, or for any purpose of his estate, and it is accordingly concluded that such mortgages legally bound no more than the life interest of the mortgagor.</p>

The facts found with respect to it lead to but one just conclusion, that it was very reluctantly executed by those in whose power it was to give validity to the otherwise invalid mortgage, and upon the assurance (or threat it may be) of the mortgagee that he would otherwise foreclose, and the pleading of their mother; but they intelligently knew the effect of what they were asked to do; they had the advice of counsel, and, excepting Eva Steimnetz, the granddaughter of the mortgagor, they were sui juris. That the consideration of the agreement was a valuable one was scarcely questioned, and it could not be successfully, for it contemplated the release from the lien of the mortgages of all the property mentioned in it, excepting that on Ridge avenue and Hamilton street, and the effort to prevent sheriff’s sale of the property under the first liens upon it. It is determined, therefore, that by the said agreement all those who were parties to it, and, sui juris, were bound by its provisions, and that the mortgages referred to were as to principal and interest declared valid by those in remainder.</p>

But an agreement to release from what may ultimately be decided to be a voidable lien is a contract looking to the abatement of possible litigation and to repose, and as such, both substantial and valid as a consideration. And although sales of the real property did take place within less than six months from November 30,1888, they were sales at auction, and were not had by the sheriff, excepting one, which were the sort of sales that Lems, by his agreement, had undertaken to provide against, and which are generally believed to produce a less price than sales otherwise conducted. It has been found that Lewis did release from the lien of the mortgages, as the property covered by them was sold, and that by sales under his direction, and at auction, he did prevent those of the same property by the sheriff, and hence it is that not only was the thing agreed to be done by him under the agreement of November 30,1888, a thing of value, but the subject of the consideration was, in fact, carried out.</p>

Although this is not made the subject of pleading, and is not strictly in issue, the evidence upon which the calculation was based and the course taken with respect to it was not, however, the subject of objection, and, therefore (but with some doubt of the propriety), it is considered. It is to be observed that the fl,000 mortgage was assigned by Lewis,-November 11,1880, and that for $3,000 on November 6,1889, and as has been found neither assignee sought for nor obtained the usual declaration from the mortgagor of no set-off by way of defense, and hence each stands in the same legal position that the mortgagee held at the time of the assignment, and such defense as might then be made by the mortgagor against him as cf that date may be made against his assignees.</p>

It was sought to justify this method oE calculation by the argument that Lewis as sueli assignee had the life estate of Margaret Steinmetz and was bound, as she was bound, out of its income or proceeds, to pay rents, interest, etc., only, and was without authority to pay the debts incurred by her — an argument that cannot be successfully assailed. But there is omitted the fact that subsequently to the assignment and by a clause of the agreement of November BO, 1888, Lewis asserted and tbe clause seemingly conceded bis right to act as he might be advised; and in response to the allegation of paragraph eighteen of the bill, itwas answered that Mr. Glenn, as attorney for tbe heirs, expressed bis willingness that tbe proceeds of tbe real estate be devoted by Lewis to tbe payment of creditors of Margaret Steinmetz, and that the consideration of this arrangement was the payment by Lewis, as assignee, of the proceeds of personal property to the discharge of the interest on the mortgage at liidge avenue and Hamilton street, at the request of the heirs, to save it from foreclosure sale; a payment which otherwise would not have been warranted, and accordingly Lewis was advised thus to pay. M. E. Neall and Emma Steinmetz (the heirs who were examined) denied that Mr. Glenn had been authorized to act for them, but that they did not deny tliat such an arrangement as the answer alleged existed, did not deny that the consideration of it was as the answer alleged, nor deny that the interest had been paid as averred. The force of the responsive answer in this behalf remains, and whether or not the heirs authorized Mr. Glenn to make for them the arrangement he did, that arrangement was carried out and upon the consideration named ; they received and retained its benefit, and they cannot, therefore, be heard to repudiate the arrangement. Hence the argument aforesaid on their behalf should not prevail; and it is concluded that Lewis, having expended the said moneys in the payment, as well of the obligations of tbe real estate as those of Margaret Steinmetz, cannot be made to account by excluding therefrom the latter. It is due' to Mr. Glenn to say that he liad ground to suppose he was acting for all tbe heirs; he was retained by Charles W.

All questions necessarily involved appear to have been most carefully and elaborately considered and satisfactorily disposed of by the learned referee, whose report was approved by the court below. We find no substantial error in any of his rulings, findings of fact, or legal conclusions. It therefore follows that the court below committed no error in dismissing the exceptions to the referee’s report and confirming the same. On that report the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants’ costs.</p>
