The plaintiffs title was subject to an incumbrance of $8,500 and he did not own the underlying coal. In 1889 he sold an undivided half of the land to Cornelius Smith for (so far as the consideration in the deed shows) $5,000, which if correct would seem to indicate the value placed upon the property by the parties at that time. In February or March, 1897, the plaintiff bargained the other half to H. N Patrick for $6,000, with the agreement that if he failed to make title to that portion which is covered by the deed to John S. Smith he was to receive $2,800 to $8,000 only. Thus it appears that five years after the date of the John S. Smith deed, the value fixed by the plaintiff upon the property covered by it did not exceed $3,000. In view of these circumstances, the plaintiff’s testimony fixing the value of the entire property at $50,000 must be taken with considerable allowance. The consideration mentioned in the deed is $2,000. But it appears that in addition to this, the grantor was to be paid $15.00 a month from September 15, 1891, until (as the sequel shows) October 7,1895 — over four years — and $104.25, making over $2,800. This shows that the sale to John S. Smith was as favorable to the plaintiff as the one to Mr. Patrick; and that the plaintiff will reap the benefit if this Smith deed is annulled. But if there is a bargain at $3,000 in this undivided one fourth of the land, where is the equity in transferring it from Mr. Smith to Mr. Patrick? If anything is due the plaintiff under the agreement of sale to John S. Smith, either upon the $2,000 consideration mentioned in the deed, or from any failure to furnish support to the plaintiff, he has the right of <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>action to recover it, but this is not the proper court in which to enforce that right. . . .</p>
