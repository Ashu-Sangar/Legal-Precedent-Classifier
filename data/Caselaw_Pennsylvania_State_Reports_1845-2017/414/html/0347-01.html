Appellants’ position is that Paragraph Seven of the will “creates a general residue and within that an ultimate residue”, i.e., that the ultimate and real “residue” is the “balance” of the general residue given to the University, and that it was testatrix’ intent that this ultimate “residue” bear the burdens and take the benefits incident to such “residue” and, therefore, the burden of payment of the federal estate tax liability should fall upon the ultimate legatee of such “residue”, i.e., the University. Appellants’ second, and alternative, position is that, even if the word “residue” be construed to mean Paragraph Seven in its entirety, nevertheless, such federal tax liability would ordinarily fall on the “balance” given to the University under Paragraph Seven, section 29, because such tax liability, has, in effect, been paid by the executors out of the general residuary fund and out of this fund, reduced by the tax payments, the residuary legatees who are to receive specified amounts must first <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>be paid and, only thereafter, does the University take the “balance”.</p>

Testatrix in Paragraph Seven set up a general residuary estate out of which, after testatrix’ aunt’s death, twenty-eight different legatees were to receive legacies in specified-dollar amounts and <em>then </em>the “entire balance” of the trust fund created under this general residuary clause — that is, whatever remained after meeting the obligations provided for in Paragraph Seven — was given to the University. If payment of the pecuniary legacies exhausted the fund, the University would not receive anything.

    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[179,1193,1154,954]]]'>Paragraph Eight, (h), clearly reveals an intent on testatrix’ part that <em>all </em>the legacies under the will should be, if possible, tax free. When testatrix desired to draw a distinction between the treatment to be accorded to what the court below called “preresiduary legacies”, i.e., the bequests other than in Paragraph Seven, and to what the court below called the “residuary legacies”, i.e., the bequests contained in Paragraph Seven, she did so as illustrated in Paragraph Nine, (a). Moreover, Paragraph Eight, (h), reveals testatrix’ intent that <em>all </em>taxes with respect to <em>any </em>legacies should be tax free. The use of the all-embracive word “any”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> coupled with the fact that testatrix drew no distinction in respect to freedom from tax liability between the so-called “preresiduary legacies” and the so-called “residuary legacies” is a clear indication that the testatrix intended the legacies in Paragraph Seven to be tax free.</p>

Had testatrix’ assets been insufficient to pay in full the amount of the pecuniary legacies in Paragraph Seven, the court below concludes that such legacies <em>and </em>the gift to the University, under Section 29, of the “entire balance” of testatrix’ trust fund would have abated proportionately. That is just not so. Had the assets of testatrix’ estate been insufficient to pay in full the twenty-eight legacies in Paragraph Seven, then the gift to the University would not have been <em>abated </em>but <em>extinguished. </em>See: Page on Wills, (Vol. 4) §33.60, p. 395.

Thereunder, testatrix directed that a lapsed legacy should “become part of the residue of [her] estate”. Therefore, the court below reasoned, since the word “residue” refers to Paragraph Seven <em>in its entirety, </em>it would be a “strange and illogical conclusion” to hold that such lapsed legacies were intended to enlarge the University’s share and “not the whole residue of the estate”, i.e., the twenty-eight pecuniary legacies <em>plus </em>that of the University. The most cursory examination of Paragraph Seven contraindicates such reasoning. Each of the twenty-eight legatees in Paragraph Seven are given <em>speeific-dollaramount </em>legacies. Under the rationale of the court below, for instance, testatrix’ bequest of $50,000 to the Animal Rescue League of Boston would be increased, in the event of a lapsed legacy, by its proportionate share of such lapsed legacy. That would be contrary to testatrix’ direction; the testatrix gave the League $50,000 and no more.

Uppermost also in testatrix’ mind was her friend, Eleanor A. Humphrey, to whom she gave jewelry (Paragraph One, <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>(a)), a painting (Paragraph One, (c)), antiques (Paragraph One, (e)), a gift over of automobiles and personal effects (Paragraph One, (f)), a remainder interest in her home and the personalty connected therewith (Paragraph Three), a legacy of $200,000 (Paragraph Four), and a legacy of $150,000 (Paragraph Seven). If the University’s position is correct, Mrs. Humphrey, instead of receiving the legacy of $150,000, would receive approximately $95,000. On the other hand, the University receives a legacy of $200,000 (Paragraph Five, (g)) and the “entire balance” of testatrix’ property under Paragraph Seven, (29); what the latter will amount to will depend entirely on the size of testatrix’ estate. No doubt, the University was intended to be <em>a </em>principal beneficiary but not <em>the </em>principal beneficiary. Even if the “residue” given under Section 29 bears the burden of payment of the death taxes, the University will certainly be <em>a </em>principal, if not <em>the </em>principal, beneficiary dollarwise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
