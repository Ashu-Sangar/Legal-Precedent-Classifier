There, the testator wrote his own name in the testimonium clause of a printed form, but the signature which followed on the line provided for testator’s signature was that of the alderman who had prepared the document.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Unlike the case at bar, in that attestation clause, George Glace’s name was written by this same alderman-scrivener, not by George Glace.</p>
    <p id="b433-7" data-blocks='[["BL_433.8",433,[165,1414,1148,578]]]'>This Court held that “Churchill’s Estate is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument,” and that, as in <em>Churchill, </em>no testamentary signature of the testator appeared at the end of the writing. However, <em>Churchill </em>is factually distinguished from the instant ease by Clara Edna Miller’s use of the word “my” in the attestation clause rather than the word “his” used in <em>Churchill. </em>Therefore, <em>Churchill </em>does not control our disposition here. Moreover, in <em>Glace, </em>we held that there was nothing to indicate that the inserted signature was to serve as more than mere identification.</p>
    <p id="b433-8" data-blocks='[["BL_433.9",433,[165,2011,1147,151]],["BL_434.1",434,[244,375,1150,1124]]]'>Here, decedent, in her own handwriting and words, recorded her testamentary desires and directions and then concluded the writing with her signature.

Rather, it is the place selected by the testator as the logical and sequential end of his dispositive act and at which he writes his testamentary signature. Examination of the entire instrument satisfies us that Clara Edna Miller’s name in her own handwriting appears at the textual and factual end of her writing. The remaining inquiry is: Did she intend this as her testamentary signature or was she merely inserting her name for purposes of identification? On this record, we hold that the instrument, on its face, reveals that decedent did intend to affix and did affix her signature at the end of her testamentary disposition when she wrote her name into the attestation clause. Here, her use of the pronoun “my” manifested a present intention that her signature serve as her testamentary signature to the document she obviously regarded as her last will and testament.</p>

Churchill’s Estate is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument; [and with the Miller alleged will;] indeed it is stronger for probate than the instant one. In Churchill’s Estate, the alleged will was written — as was Glace’s [and Miller’s] —by <em>filling in blank spaces on a printed form. </em>Church<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>ill wrote Ms name in <em>three blank spaces </em>in the printed paper, <em>first at the </em>top, <em>then in the testimonium clause, </em>and <em>then in the attestation clause. </em>He did not sign his name at the end of the paper. The Court said, ‘It is apparent that in writing his name in the three blank spaces in the form, decedent did not intend his name as a signature. A writing in of a name, in those circumstances, was not a signature and did not constitute an execution of a Will in conformity with the Wills Act. The place chosen by this decedent to affix his signature was at the point where the appointment of his executors was consummated’. Churchill’s Estate, we repeat, governs the instant case. Our conclusion is further supported by Griffith Will, <a href="/pa/358/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="358 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="8845786" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0474-01">358 Pa. 474</a>, 483, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.2d%20893" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="57 A.2d 893">57 A. 2d 893</a>, and Baldwin Will, <a href="/pa/357/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="357 Pa. 432" data-case-ids="472121" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0432-01">357 Pa. 432</a>, 436, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20263" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="55 A.2d 263">55 A. 2d 263</a>, each of which reaffirmed Churchill’s Estate.</blockquote>
