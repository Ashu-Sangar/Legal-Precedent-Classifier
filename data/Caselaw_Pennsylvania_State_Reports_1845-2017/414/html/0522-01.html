The complaint alleges that the county commissioners, since the beginning of their terms of office to the present (1963), have been reimbursed, from public funds, $150 per month for individual travel expenses, alleged to have been incurred within the county, without submitting itemized accountings or vouchers supporting the expenditures, and that the commissioners have received public moneys as reimbursement for travel expenses outside Beaver County, also without accounting for same.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

It is clear that the practices alleged in the complaint are contrary to law as the court below correctly observed: “With respect to the lump sum payment of expenses without voucher to the Commissioners and Controller, there can be no doubt that this was improper. In Susquehanna County Auditors’ Report, <a href="/pa-super/118/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="118 Pa.

Interestingly enough, in that case the commissioners apparently followed the same historic custom which has prevailed in Beaver County. The Superior Court, however, held that such a custom is not in accordance with law and cannot be approved.”</p>

With this we cannot agree. That act does not prohibit the interference of equity to enjoin improper and illegal conduct while it is actually in progress, nor does it prevent equity from following through with appropriate incidental relief where necessary.

While lump sum payments of expenses without itemization are improper merely and not necessarily illegal or fraudulent, the same cannot be said of payments made without any authority of law. Of course, in the final disposition of this litigation the commissioners and controller will be permitted, so far as they are able, from books or memoranda kept by them, to itemize and justify the expenses which weré paid to them. But if such itemization cannot be supplied, the payments cannot be <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>sustained and there must be a surcharge. All of this was indicated in Susquehanna Auditors’ Report, supra, p. 54. Therefore, since the possibility exists of money due the county both from past and future acts in 1963, it is imperative that lump sum payments must be stopped. It is no answer that the county would be entitled to a money judgment if a successful appeal was later maintained as to 1963; recoupment of improper items permitted to be paid would, at least, be problematical. Nor is it any answer that the commissioners, by recent resolution, have discontinued the practices which heretofore obtained. That resolution, like its predecessors, can be altered at any meeting.”</p>
