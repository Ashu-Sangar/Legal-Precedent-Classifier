On April 1, 1953, he was given a preliminary hearing before a justice of the peace where he entered a general plea of guilty to the charge of murder. At this hearing, he was not represented by counsel, nor was such representation requested. On May 11, 1953, he was indicted on the charge of murder. On May 25, 1953, the court appointed two lawyers to represent him. On Novem<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>ber 30, 1953, he was arraigned before the court in the presence of his counsel and entered a plea of guilty to the indictment. Testimony on behalf of the Commonwealth and the defendant was presented before a court of two judges on December 17, 18, and 23, 1953. The record of the proceedings at the preliminary hearing before the magistrate was not entered in evidence. The admission of guilt before the magistrate was not used against the defendant at this hearing. On March 8, 1954, the court adjudged Mm guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the punishment at life imprisonment. No appeal from the judgment was filed.</p>

No lawyer was definitely designated to represent him, although he was accused of a capital crime, until the very morning of the trial. As pointed out in the court’s opinion, the young illiterate defendant, charged with an atrocious crime, was put in peril of his life within a few moments after counsel, for the first time, began to represent him. Failure of the court to make an effective appointment of counsel, and to give the defendant a reasonable opportunity to prepare and defend, clearly constituted a denial of due process under the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>

      <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>It is readily apparent that the above cases are factually inapposite to the case at hand. Herein, the defendant was represented by competent and experienced counsel at the time of arraignment, as well as at trial. Herein the defendant entered a plea of guilty to the indictment after more than six months had elapsed from the date counsel had been designated to represent him. Ample opportunity to prepare and defend was thus afforded. While he did plead guilty to the charge at the preliminary hearing before the magistrate, this admission was not used against him at the hearing before the court. It in no way entered into the court’s deliberation in assessing the degree of guilt. Further, his plea of guilty to the charge at the preliminary hearing, when he was without counsel, was the same plea he entered upon arraignment and at trial, when he had the services and advice of counsel. Under such circumstances, it is clear that the single reason now submitted for the appellant’s release from prison is completely without merit. A denial of due process is not present.</p>
    <p id="b59-3" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[152,1521,1149,465]]]'>It should be noted that under Pennsylvania law, the preliminary hearing before the committing magistrate and the arraignment of the defendant before the court, prior to trial, are distinctly separate proceedings. The former is conducted immediately after or within a reasonable time following the arrest. The latter is conducted subsequent to indictment and prior to trial. The nature, purposes and significance are materially different.</p>

It seeks to prevent a person from being imprisoned or required to enter bail for a crime which was never committed, or for a crime with which there is no evidence of his connection. It is not a trial in any sense of the word. It does not purport or at<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>tempt to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, nor is he required to speak, plead or offer testimony in defense.
