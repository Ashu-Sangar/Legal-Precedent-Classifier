No appeal was taken from that order even though the Act of May 20, 1891, P; L. 101, §1, 12 P.S. §1100 makes such an order appealable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On November 26, 1963, more than 16 months after entry of the order opening judgment and more than 13 months after the time for appeal from that order elapsed, plaintiff-appellant filed a motion <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>for judgment on the pleadings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The motion was denied and this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b682-4" data-blocks='[["BL_682.4",682,[251,467,1148,309]]]'>The sole impact of the motion for judgment on the pleadings was to request the court below to reconsider its prior determination that the judgment should be opened and the parties should proceed to trial. In effect, this new motion seeks to collaterally attack the lower court’s prior determination.</p>
    <p id="b682-5" data-blocks='[["BL_682.5",682,[248,788,1149,741]]]'>It is not necessary to labor the point that all issues raised in the original motion to open judgment and all issues that could have been raised are similar to those which confronted the lower court on the motion for judgment on the pleadings. Hence, this motion for judgment on the pleadings is nothing more than an attempt to reargue a previous ruling from which no appeal, although available, had been taken. The same pleadings were before the court on both motions. We do not find any question raised by the petition for judgment on the pleadings that could not have been raised for decision on the original motion to open. See <em>Adams v.
