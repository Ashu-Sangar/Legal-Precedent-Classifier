They traveled to the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, rented an apartment under fictitious names and went into hiding. Shortly thereafter, they devised a plan to rob a bank in Westville, New Jersey. To help carry out . the plan, the services of others were obtained, namely, Ethel Nielsen, Yito Belfiore and Romeo Mercantini. The details were discussed and rehearsed.</p>
    <p id="b68-4" data-blocks='[["BL_68.4",68,[225,809,1153,1450]]]'>On December 4, 1961, by prearrangement, Negri, Lenahan, Belfiore, Nielsen and Mercantini met on a parking lot behind a diner located near the bank. According to plan, Nielsen and Mercantini remained on the lot in two separate automobiles which they were to drive in the getaway. Negri and Lenahan, well armed, proceeded to the bank in a third car driven by Belfiore. They held up the bank and seized a substantial sum of money. When they arrived back at the parking lot, it was discovered that Mercantini, for some unknown reason, had disappeared. The four others in on the job then fled from the area in the Nielsen car, to the Nielsen home located only minutes away. There, the loot was counted and its division discussed. Lenahan insisted that Mercantini had run out on the gang, was a “weak link” and in order to prevent a double-cross should be liquidated. The defendant described the conversation in this way: “After we counted the money in Ethel’s house . . . Jimmy said to me . . . that Goo-Goo [Mercantini] was the weak link and that if I didn’t kill him that he would have to, and it was easier for me because I drove around with him. Later when I spoke with Jimmy on the phone I told him that I was going to meet Goo-Goo at seven o’clock and he told me to remember what I had to do. I knew what he meant, that I was supposed to kill him at seven o’clock when. I met him at the apartment.”</p>

Nielsen then drove Negri to Philadelphia. When Mercantini arrived at the apartment, he demanded his promised share of the loot. Negri informed him that Lenahan was still in possession of the money and no division had been made. Negri then phoned Lenahan and arranged to meet him at a certain tavern in Philadelphia about 11:30 p.m. Negri told Mercantini to meet him around midnight on a back street nearby.</p>

That night about nine-thirty o’clock, while being questioned by police officers from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey, he told of Negri’s connection with the bank holdup, gave them sufficient facts to lead to the belief that Negri <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>had killed Mercantini, and was registered under an assumed name at a certain hotel in New York City.</p>

Others were directed to return to Philadelphia, obtain a warrant, and then proceed to New York City with the warrant after word was relayed that Negri had been apprehended. When the former arrived at their destination, they immediately notified New York City police of their presence and purpose, and accompanied by some New York police officers proceeded to the hotel, arriving there about 2:55 o’clock a.m. on December sixth.</p>

The room was then searched and disclosed the gun, fully loaded, used in the holdup and killing, hidden in the webbing of the bottom of a chair. A substantial sum of money was also found.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[244,1502,1147,423]]]'>Prom the hotel, he was taken to a nearby police precinct. The New York authorities filed a formal complaint charging him with possession of a gun without a license. Officers from Philadelphia arrived about 9 :30 a.m. with a warrant charging Negri with murder and with being a fugitive from justice. He was informed of the charges, questioned for about two hours, but refused to answer any questions.</p>

The magistrate explained the seriousness of the listed offenses and appointed counsel to confer with and assist him. After Negri conferred privately with his counsel, the latter informed the magistrate that Negri desired to return to Philadelphia. He was im<a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>mediately taken before a general sessions judge in New York City, before whom he signed and acknowledged a waiver of extradition.</p>

He slept or dozed during most of the trip. Just before the train arrived at the Philadelphia station, he awakened and asked one of the officers, “Did Yito [Belfiore] blow the Avhistle on me?” Upon being informed that this was so, he said, “All right. I’ll tell you when we get back to city hall.”</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[143,970,1150,632]]]'>The party arrived at the Philadelphia detective headquarters about seven o’clock in the evening.

He claimed that he had no intention of killing Mercantini and the gun was accidentally discharged in a struggle over its possession. The statement was recorded on a typewriter. When it was completed about nine o’clock, he read it and suggested certain changes and corrections. When these Avere made, he initialed them and signed the statement.</p>

If due process requires that the state provide a person with counsel from the very moment of arrest, then the next logical step is to prohibit the police from ever questioning individuals suspected of or charged with crime. Such a rule would be unsound, unrealistic and in complete disregard of the rights of all citizens to be protected from crime and criminals. Due process rightly requires the protection of those accused of crime from any unfair advantage. This Court has great respect for the constitutional rights of an individual, and has always exacted fair and proper conduct which respects constitutional safeguards of individuals charged with crime. By the same token, we do not think that any coddling is required or unreasonable road blocks should be placed in the path of public officials to help criminals escape detection and prosecution.</p>

However, coercion is asserted on the sole basis that counsel, although requested, was denied before the interrogation. That such a request was made is categorically denied by the police officers. In view of the verdict, the Commonwealth must be given the benefit of all favorable testimony: <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, the defendant was given counsel in New York City and permitted to ask his advice without restrictions. His trial testimony that he requested counsel before intérr rogation in Philadelphia lacks credence.

Clearly, the information given the police by Belfiore, a co-conspirator in the bank holdup, who was present when Lenahan insisted upon the victim’s liquidation, and also present when Negri returned from the killing and informed Lenahan that the matter had been taken care of, furnished ample grounds and was sufficiently trustworthy to form reasonable belief and probable cause. Important factors to be considered in determining the practicability of the officers first having obtained a warrant are: the time of night of the arrest, and the need for haste to capture a dangerous felon who was already in the process of flight.</p>

It is submitted that the lawfulness of the arrest must be determined in reference to the law of New York State, and under §178 of its criminal code, an officer must announce his office and purpose before entry through breaking in. First, it is apparent that any such announcement would have been a futile gesture since the room was empty when the officers arrived. Again, assuming that the offi<a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>cers’ entry, by use of a key obtained from the hotel clerk, is the legal equivalent of a “breaking in,” it has been recognized from the early common law that a “breaking in” without prior announcement is permissible in executing an arrest under certain circumstances. See, 4 Wharton’s Criminal Law and Procedure, §§1624, 1625 (1957), and <em>Ker v. </em>California, supra. Here justification for the officers’ mode of entry was emphatically present. Involved was a well-armed fleeing felon whom the officers had every right to believe would not be taken without a fight. That they were in serious peril cannot be questioned. The danger would be increased had entrance been demanded or purpose announced. A decision had to be made quickly on the basis of the facts then before them. Under such circumstances, the method of entry was not unreasonable when viewed either under state law or constitutional standards.</p>

Again, this question was not specifically raised in the court below and is here presented for the first time on appeal. As noted before, we do not consider questions not raised below. However, the following should be pointed out. There is no doubt that the defendant knew when he was taken into custody that the men involved were police officers. In fact, in his testimony at trial, he mentioned previously knowing one of the individuals as a police officer in New Jersey. Under Pennsylvania law, when it is reasonably apparent that the defendant at the time of the arrest knows that the arresting officers are police officials, the validity thereof is not destroyed merely because the defendant is not informed of the officers’ intention to make an arrest, or the cause thereof.

As stated in <em>Long </em>at 647: “The necessity for giving notice to the fleeing felon, and the character of the notice, depends entirely upon the special facts attending the arrest. While in most cases it may be prudent for the officer to give the notice before making the arrest, it is going too far to say in effect that he is required to do so: Shovlin v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/106/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="106 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="455575" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0369-01">106 Pa. 369</a>. A warning or notice of arrest might, in some cases, be imperatively required, in others it would be of no avail, and not necessary in order to protect the officer or the private person who immediately pursues a known felon.” Flight not only consists in the act of leaving the jurisdiction, it also includes continued concealment to avoid arrest and prosecution: <em>Commonwealth v.

While this is the general rule, there is some doubt that failure to obey the command of §180 voids an arrest to the extent of making seized evidence inadmissible. See, <em>Squadrito v. Griebsch, </em><a href="/ny-2d/1/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="1 N.Y.2d 471" data-case-ids="2241541" data-case-paths="/ny-2d/1/0471-01">1 N.Y. 2d 471</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20N.Y.S.2d%2037" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="154 N.Y.S.2d 37">154 N.Y.S. 2d 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20N.E.2d%20504" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="136 N.E.2d 504">136 N.E. 2d 504</a> (1956). Further, §180 specifically states that notice is not mandatory where an arrest (without warrant) is made in pursuit of an escaped felon. Also, it has been ruled that if an accused is effectively informed of the cause of the arrest within a reasonable time thereafter, or if the attending circumstances manifestly suggest that the accused knows why he is taken into custody, the <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>failure to give explicit notice at the time does not void the arrest.
