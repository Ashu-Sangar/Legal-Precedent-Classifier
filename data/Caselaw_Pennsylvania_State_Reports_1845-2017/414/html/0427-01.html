The Commonwealth certified that guilt rose no higher than murder in the second degree, and the court heard extensive testimony to determine the degree of guilt and to fix the penalty. Appellant was adjudged guilty <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>of murder in the second degree and was sentenced to imprisonment of not less than nine nor more than eighteen years.
