    <p id="b92-5" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[253,697,1149,953]]]'>“The property in question covers an area of approximately fourteen acres and is located in that area of Upper Providence Township which is known as Indianhead Park. It fronts on Perkiomen Creek and includes three dwelling houses, a barn, a garage, two pavilions, a mill building and shed. From approximately 1948 until Labor Day of 1959, one Donald Van-Billiard, occupied and used the premises as an ‘amusement park-carnival’. In addition to amusement rides in the park, VanBilliard maintained facilities for boating, swimming, fishing, shooting gallery, baseball, areas for parking, picnics, as well as skating in the winter. All of these activites were open to the public. There were also signs on the property designating areas such as ‘boating area’, ‘swim area’, ‘picnic area’, ‘parking’ and others. The number of people present at the park on any one day varied from a maximum of fifteen hundred to none at all.</p>
    <p id="b92-6" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[251,1671,1148,475]]]'>“The Philadelphia National Bank held a mortgage on the property during this period which at various times from July of 1957 to July of 1959 was in default. In July of 1959, the Bank instructed its attorney to institute foreclosure proceedings on the property. Pursuant to these instructions, judgment was entered on the bond and warrant of the mortgage and VanBilliard was at that time given notice of the proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b92-7" data-blocks='[["BL_92.6",92,[250,2158,1148,206]],["BL_93.1",93,[164,378,1152,2050]]]'>“On the day after Labor Day of that year (September 8, 1959) after removing all of his mobile equipment the night before, VanBilliard placed on the property a sign stating ‘closed’. The property was sold at Sher<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>iff’s Sale on October 26, 1959 and was bid in for costs by counsel for the Philadelphia National Bank. From November 7, 1959, the Bank tried unsuccessfully to sell the property at a private sale and held the property until October 6, 1960 at which time it was auctioned off to one Mr. Miller. During the period from November of 1959 to October of 1960 when the Bank held the property, it was not legally empowered under the banking law to utilize it for an amusement park as had been done by VanBilliard. Therefore, during this period, the property remained unused. When Miller obtained the property, he sought a permit to use it as a day camp and swim club. The zoning officer of the Township denied the permit to use the property since by an Ordinance enacted in May of 1955, the property in question had been placed in an ‘Agricultural-Residential Zoning District’ which did not allow the requested use. Miller thereupon appealed to the Board of Adjustment and requested a variance to permit the desired use. When the Board denied appellant’s application, an Appeal was taken to this Court. This Court in an Opinion and Order (Miller v. Upper Providence Township, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Montg.%20189" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="78 Montg. 189">78 Montg. 189</a> (1961)) held that although there were no grounds for the grant of a variance, the zoning officer should nevertheless have granted the permit requested since the property in question was subject to a nonconforming use which had not been discontinued. On Appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, this decision was reversed on the ground that the question of the nonconforming use was not before the Court and that the only issue was whether or not the Board abused its discretion or committed an error of law in denying the variance. The Supreme Court further stated that ‘to raise this issue [of nonconforming use] appellee must submit a new application to the zoning officer, specifically requesting therein a permit to continue the nonconforming use’.

(Miller’s successor in interest) requested a permit to use the property as a day camp and swim club. By a supplementary letter dated June 5, 1962, the appellant asked that the application be regarded as ‘an application to a zoning officer to continue the nonconforming úse as an amusement park, the same as it had been used by our predecessor’. When this application was denied by the zoning officer, an Appear to the Zoning Board of Adjustment of Upper Providence Township followed. . . .</p>

    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[140,928,1149,422]]]'>This Court has held that the word “discontinued” in the section of a zoning ordinance dealing with nonconforming uses must be the equivalent of “abandoned.” Further, the temporary cessation of a nonconforming use does not establish abandonment of that use. <em>Upper Darby Township Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/391/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="391 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1276846" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0347-01">391 Pa. 347</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.2d%2099" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="138 A.2d 99">138 A. 2d 99</a> (1958) ; <em>Haller Baking Company’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/295/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="295 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1115136" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0257-01">295 Pa. 257</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%2077" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="145 A. 77">145 Atl. 77</a> (1928).</p>
    <p id="b95-7" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[140,1361,1150,848]]]'>The board of adjustment relied upon VanBilliard’s conduct to demonstrate intentional legal abandonment. While his conduct might be construed to be a factual “abandonment” in that he seemed to abandon not only the nonconforming use but also his living quarters on the property, VanBilliard’s actions did not constitute a legal abandonment. He had full knowledge that the bank was going ahead with foreclosure proceedings and that he would no longer own or be entitled to use the property. The land was being sold against his will. He had no choice but to leave, either with or without his equipment, some of which he chose to sell, some of which he left behind. That his children did not return to the school they had attended indicates nothing more than that the VanBilliard family had left the school district.</p>

It is, realistically, a continuation of the prior use on a more restricted basis. No <em>material </em>difference between operation as an amusement park and as a day camp-swim club exists for the purpose of the ordinance here involved. Thus, appellee may conduct a day camp and swim club on its property.</p>
