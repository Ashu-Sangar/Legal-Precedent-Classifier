The appellants were not parties to, nor did they sign, these agreements. However, it is undisputed that they knew plaintiff’s products were “fair traded” and, with this knowledge, advertised and sold such commodities below the stipulated minimum prices.</p>

      <em>Old Dearborn, </em>as a careful study will bear out, is not precedent for the proposition that the nonsigner clause in a state price fixing statute, delegating legislative power to private individuals, does not violate the state constitution.
