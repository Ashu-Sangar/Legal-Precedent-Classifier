L. 1333, added, March 6,1951, P. L. 3, §11, as amended, August 13, 1963, P. L. 707, §24, 25 P.S. §3146.8 (Supp. 1963), and is substantially in the language thereof, is sufficient to require that a hearing be held thereon in conformity with that section of the Code. There is no requirement in the Election Code that a challenge to an absentee ballot be supported, at the time of challenge or prior to hearing, by an affidavit or memorandum. Furthermore, this record discloses a sufficient and adequate challenge under <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>the law to require a hearing by the Board of Elections on the validity of the challenged ballots.</p>
