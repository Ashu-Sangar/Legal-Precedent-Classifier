Emert (Emerts), instituted a trespass action in Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County against Larami Corporation (Larami). In their complaint, the Emerts alleged: that they reside in Perkasie, Bucks County;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> that Larami is engaged, as manufacturer, employer, supplier, wholesaler and/or manufacturer’s representative, in the wholesale toy business in Philadelphia, Philadelphia County; that Larami, in its several capacities, distributed childrens’ <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>toy sling shots to R &amp; N Enterprises (R &amp; N), Souderton, Montgomery County; that R &amp; N, in turn, distributed certain of these sling shots to Horace Cress-man (Cressman) in Perkasie; that the minor, Roger Emert, purchased from Cressman a sling shot; that the handle of this sling shot — made of plastic material— “was inherently weak so that when ordinary application of pressure was applied in pulling the sling back to shoot the handle was caused to break”; that, while the minor, Roger Emert, was using the sling shot, the handle broke causing him personal injuries; that Lara-mi was negligent in: (a) failing to use due care in testing the sling shot; (b) failing to see that the sling shot material was strong; (c) failing to thoroughly inspect the sling shot and (d) failing to give proper directions and warning on the sling shot wrapping.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Larami issued writs of summons to join as additional defendants R &amp; N and Cressman. Cressman was served with such writ by the Sheriff of Bucks County who was deputized to make service by the Sheriff of Philadelphia County. Cressman moved to set aside the service of this writ upon the ground that such service violated Rule 1043, Pa. R. C. P.

However, in <em>Shenandoah </em>and <em>Cox </em>our courts were determining whether the negligent conduct alleged in an amended complaint in trespass introduced a new theory of negligence after the running of the statute of limitations and in <em>Stewart </em>whether the negligent conduct proved varied from that alleged. Emphasis in all three decisions was upon the character, type or theory of “negligent conduct” alleged, an entirely different situation than that existent in the case at bar.

Upon eating bread made from this flour, plaintiff swallowed pieces of glass and became ill. Suit was instituted in Washington County. The sheriff of such county deputized the sheriff of Dauphin County to serve the writ under Section 1011 of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, P. L. 364, 15 P.S. §2522-1011, which provided that process might be issued against a foreign business corporation “in the county in which the <em>right of action </em>arose”. The Court said at page 169: “Where did the right of action arise in the present case? <em>Undoubtedly in Washington, Pennsylvania, not in Buffalo, New York, </em>because ‘To constitute a tort there must be an injury; mere negligence establishes no right of action. <em>The place of wrong is, and the tort must be deemed to arise, where the injury is inflicted, not where the negligent acts leading to it were committed’: </em>Mike v.

The occurrence of the injury furnished the basis and gave life to the cause of action. The cause of action did not arise until some person suffered injury or loss by reason of Larami’s alleged negligent conduct. “No matter how great the negligence of the defendant, nor where it began or continued, there was no cause of action to anybody until an injury was received”: <em>Hoodmacher v. Lehigh Valley R.R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/218/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="218 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="999527" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0021-01">218 Pa. 21</a>, 23, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.%20975" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="66 A. 975">66 A. 975</a>. As no actionable tort could have been committed until a person was injured, it seems clear that, if the language of Rule 1043 is to be given its reasonable meaning, the cause of action arose in the county where the tort was in fact committed by the infliction of injury. To give to this Rule the construction contended for by Larami would in many instances confine the provisions of the Rule to the county of a defendant’s residence or place of business, whereas it was intended that the Rule should apply where the person was injured, which is quite often the county of residence of the complaining party.</p>
