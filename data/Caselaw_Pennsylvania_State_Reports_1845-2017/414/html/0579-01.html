Appellants further contend (1) that this eonstrúctión is fortified by testator’s evident intent to .keep this residuary trust estate in his family blood line, since (a) he made no provision therein for a spouse of a deceased grandchild, nor (b) did he give a deceased grandchild a. power of appointment, and (2) that this construe<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>tion would obviously have the desirable result of a colossal tax saving for his descendants.
