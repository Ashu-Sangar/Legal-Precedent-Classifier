    <p id="b551-7" data-blocks='[["BL_551.10",551,[132,1357,1150,419]]]'>The essential facts are not in dispute. On August 21, 1952, Richard C. Symons, Jr., was at work in Am-bridge, Pennsylvania, as a molding machine operator when he met with an accident. He suffered a crushing type injury which immediately caused a compound fracture of both legs. This compelled the amputation of both legs at points above each knee. Claimant was twenty-nine years of age at the time.</p>

    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[250,632,1148,474]]]'>Accordingly, after the accident, the parties entered into a workmen’s compensation agreement, providing for payment of compensation at $30 per week. This amount was paid for 430 weeks from August 28, 1952 (one week after the accident), until November 23, 1960. However, during this time, claimant participated in a remarkable rehabilitation program which was a cooperative undertaking by claimant and the workmen’s compensation carrier for the employer.</p>

Rehabilitation efforts there included both psychological preparation and extensive physical treatment, training and guidance by orthopedists, physical therapists and occupational therapists to assist claimant in compensating for his devastating physical handicap. Claimant was initially given boots in each of which was incorporated an articulating or movable foot to increase their utility. He was trained in the use of these initial prosthetic devices during his first stay at the center, which lasted until February, 1953, and “he became extremely agile” and “self-sufficient in the use of these boots.” He returned to the rehabilitation clinic in September, 1953, and obtained new prostheses in the form of full-length artificial legs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He was given a job as inspector in defendant’s wire and cable division, the duties of the job being: “Under supervision to inspect wire and cable in various stages of process; to interpret specification charts and detailed drawings; to inspect material and processes on the following equipment : tube insulators, stranders, bunchers, and similar types of equipment; to check the following when applicable against physical specification requirements: diameter of copper, number of strands, diameter overall; thickness of insulation; length and direction of lay, copper and conductor or tape.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

To the contrary, this very job classification was in existence prior to the time he handled it and was performed by other employees. The same witness testified that claimant performs his work “without any undue or unreasonable assistance,” he does not receive any more assistance than any other inspector, and claimant has “a very good work record. . . . His record indicates in all factors of quality, quantity, etc., he has been conscientous and has done a good job.” Claimant’s job is not temporary, but is likely to continue. He works a regular weekly period of five days at eight hours per day. He drives his own automobile to work, places it in a park<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>ing space at the plant, and from that parking area walks to his job without assistance.</p>

However, the job as inspector, which claimant is successfully able to perform and at which he earns his wages, pays considerably more. From his initial rate on January 28, 1954, of $1.82 per hour, he received five increases, the last four all reaching amounts higher than even the increased molding machine operator’s rate in force at the time of the hearing. For four years prior to the hearing (since September, 1957), claimant had been earning wages at the rate of $2,275 per hour, or $ .735 per hour higher than his wage at the time of the accident.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>In the <em>Shoop </em>case, the employer filed a petition for <em>termination </em>(not suspension) of compensation on the theory that since claimant, after numerous jobs, had found a position paying more than he earned at the time of the accident, he was no longer totally and permanently disabled. The referee and the board found to the contrary, that the amputation of claimant’s legs did represent total disability. On appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, the decision was reversed. However, the Superior Court in turn reversed the court of common pleas and reinstated compensation.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[243,1031,1149,581]]]'>The <em>Shoop </em>decision is distinguishable from the case at bar. The board, on the facts before it, refused to “otherwise determine” and to find that claimant was not totally disabled. In the absence of a determination by the board to the contrary, the total disability continued with respect to payment of workmen’s compensation. Here, however, the board has made the contrary factual finding. In Anew of the degree of finality which must be accorded to the board’s findings, as previously indicated, we cannot reverse those findings where there is evidence to sustain them.</p>
    <p id="b560-5" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[240,1622,1150,419]]]'>Although it may be argued that the board cannot find other than total disability where there is a loss of both legs, such argument flies directly in the face of the language of §306(c) that the loss constitutes total disability <em>“unless the hoard shall otherwise deter</em>mine.” The Legislature has vested a discretionary power in the board. That discretion may be removed or diminished only by the Legislature.</p>
    <p id="b560-6" data-blocks='[["BL_560.6",560,[237,2051,1148,261]]]'>It is significant that the Superior Court which decided the <em>Shoop </em>case found nothing inconsistent in affirming, per curiam, the decision of the board in the instant case on the basis of the board’s exercise of its clearly stated discretion.</p>

Such a rule would result in great injustice to the employee who, at the time of the accident, appears unhurt but later becomes disabled as a direct result thereof.</p>
    <p id="b561-3" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[143,696,1151,689]]]'>The argument by appellant that an adverse decision penalizes him for his cooperation and industry in seeking and achieving rehabilitation fails to recognize that claimant’s compensation is governed by the statute rather than by such policy considerations. Furthermore, it would indeed be a rare claimant who would intentionally reject rehabilitation in order to receive disability payments of a comparatively small amount, as against receiving all the physical and psychological benefits of rehabilitation with subsequent earned wages not only far in excess of the amount provided under the statute, but, in this case, also in excess of his pre-accident wages.</p>
    <p id="b561-4" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[141,1398,1150,412]]]'>Were a question of policy to apply, the employer should not be penalized for the many thousands of dollars spent in rehabilitation by being told that despite the successful rehabilitation, compensation payments will not be suspended. Such a policy would substantially discourage further large investments by workmen’s compensation carriers in such rehabilitation efforts in the future.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[139,1830,1151,359]]]'>Both claimant and the insurance carrier are to be commended on the excellent cooperation so encouragingly manifested in the rehabilitation project.
