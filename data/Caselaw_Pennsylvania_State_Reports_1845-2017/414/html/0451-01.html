Inter alia, this jointure contract provided for the construction of a junior-senior high school (high school) in Scott Township (Scott), to accommodate all high school students in the system and, further, provided that the effective date of the contract would be the first Monday in July <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>1959 and would continue for a two-year period and, thereafter, for three-year periods, unless one or more of the districts elected to discontinue the contract by giving notice thereof one year prior to the expiration of any such period.</p>

The Department of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth approved the project; the school site in Scott Township was selected and approved by the necessary public agencies; the site was duly authorized for transfer to the Authority. Provisional plans were prepared by architects and test borings, well drillings and rough site clearing were completed. In order to expedite the financing, the Authority borrowed from several banks in Pennsylvania and obligated itself to make further expenditures so that by May 1962 the Authority had incurred obligations amounting to approximately $280,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Final plans and specifications for the project were approved by the joint board and, thereafter, by necessary public agencies, and the property selected as the site for the school was conveyed to the Authority.

Since that time Scott has refused' to take any part in the joint school program, including the proposed construction and equipping of the school.</p>

Scott filed preliminary objections and an answer to the petition raising new matter to which the Authority filed a reply. The court upheld the preliminary objections as to jurisdiction in declaratory judgment and dismissed the petition. The Authority appealed to this Court and, by an equally divided Court, the court below was affirmed.

It is clear beyond any question that between the parties to this litigation an actual controversy exists. In <em>Cryan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1126421" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0386-01">301 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20675" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="152 A. 675">152 A. 675</a>, this Court stated (p. 395) : “If difference between the parties concerned, as to their legal rights, have reached the stage of antagonistic claims, which are being actively pressed on one side and opposed on the other, an actual controversy appears; where, however, the claims of the several parties in interest, while not having reached that active stage, are nevertheless present, and indicative of threatened litigation in the immediate future, which seems unavoida<a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>ble, tbe ripening seeds of a controversy appear.” In tbe case at bar, the Authority, the joint district and the member districts maintain that, under the provisions of the jointure contract, Scott, as a signatory thereto, is under a legal obligation to cooperate in the construction and equipment of this high school and to pay its proportionate share of the rentals, etc., in connection therewith; on the other hand, Scott maintains, apparently, that it has no such legal obligation and it refuses to assume any responsibility whatsoever in the matter. As a result of this diversity of opinions, all plans for the construction of this school are necessarily held in abeyance and, until such diversity of opinions is resolved by a court, the construction of the school cannot be financed and, a fortiori, the school cannot be built. The obviously antagonistic views and positions adopted by the parties indicate not only the existence of an “actual controversy” but of a controversy which will imminently, unavoidably and inevitably lead to litigation and there is no other adequate remedy. Under such circumstances, relief by declaratory judgment provides <em>the only efficient and expedient </em>method of terminating the controversy. The relief sought herein is not advisory in any sense.</p>

The averments of fact in the petition for declaratory <em>relief </em>— facts, <em>which for the purpose of this </em>appeal, <em>must be assumed to be true since they are well pleaded </em>— reveal: that the site for construction of the high school has been duly approved by the proper authorities on both local and state levels; that an investment firm, to aid in the financing, and an architect have been chosen; that the land which will constitute the site of the new school has been condemned and physical possession thereof taken; that, on both local and state levels, the construction plans <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>have been approved; that the land site has been conveyed to the Authority; in reliance on the jointure contract, the Authority has authorized temporary bank' borrowings; that obligations of $280,000 have already been incurred in connection with the project. The only major steps remaining to be taken are financing of the project and construction of the school.

In the instant situation, does another available and appropriate remedy exist? We think not. Mandamus will not lie since mandamus is not available to enforce a general course of official conduct or the performance of continuing duties such as involved in the case at bar: <em>(Dorris v. Lloyd (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/375/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="375 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1244349" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0474-01">375 Pa. 474</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20924" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="100 A.2d 924">100 A. 2d 924</a>) and, unless mandamus will settle the en<a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>tire controversy, it is not an appropriate remedy <em>(McCandless Township v.

Moreover, a complaint in equity for specific performance will not lie since the issuance of such a decree is dependent on the contract being clear and unambiguous, which is not the situation in the case at bar <em>(Berberich v.

It is to be noted that, after rendition of our original opinion, the Authority then proceeded to institute an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County and Scott filed specific objections in such action averring that equity had no jurisdiction which proceeding is now pending.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Lastly, assumpsit will not lie because the basis for any assumpsit action cannot arise until the bonds of the Authority are issued, the school completed and rentals accrued.

L. 1283, 24 P.S. §2-202, it being the opinion of the court below that that statute abolished this joint district. At reargument of this case, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting through the Attorney General, was permitted to intervene for the purpose of having clarified the impact upon joint districts throughout the Commonwealth of the Act of 1961, supra. The question herein at issue is whether the court should entertain this declaratory judgment proceeding, a question raised by Scott’s preliminary objections and, upon such posture, we decide <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>the question only on the averments of the complaint and beyond such averments we do not go. The question of the impact of the 1961 Act appears neither in the complaint nor the preliminary objections and the only reference thereto is in paragraph 34 of new matter contained in Scott’s answer on the merits. In determining whether it should entertain declaratory judgment, the court below, in considering the 1961 Act, went beyond the averments of the complaint, and, in so doing, committed error.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The instant situation demands and compels a declaration of rights under the jointure agreement from the viewpoint of all the parties to this litigation as well as the inhabitants of this joint district. Unless such a declaration of rights is <em>now </em>made through the medium of this declaratory judgment proceeding, the construction of this school will be delayed interminably and, in all likelihood, may never take place. Whether or not Scott under the jointure contract is under a legal obligation to cooperate in the financing and the construction of this school <em>must </em>be determined before the financing can take place; only <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>an <em>immediate </em>declaration of the rights of the joint district and the member districts vis-a-vis Scott under the jointure contract can solve the present impasse.</p>
