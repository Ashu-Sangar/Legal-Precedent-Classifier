The defendants filed an answer denying plaintiff’s material allegations and set up new matter alleging ratification of the acts in issue.

In 1960 Brown-Borhek’s sales to Raydel totaled $550,562, or 37% of all sales. On December 31, 1960, Brown-Borhek carried an account receivable from Raydel of $262,010, which amounted to 60% of Brown-Borhek’s receivables and 29% of all its assets. In 1961, Brown-Borhek’s sales to Raydel amounted to approximately $1,050,290, 50% of all sales.

In defendants’ new matter, they aver that this transaction was <em>part </em>of a composition by Raydel with its major creditors and that in addition Raydel made a cash payment to BrownBorhek of $50,000. This cash payment was admitted by plaintiff in his reply. Brown-Borhek’s President stated at the annual stockholders’ meeting that Raydel is presently in bankruptcy, and that nothing of value has been realized as yet from the preferred stock or from the promissory note.</p>

Furthermore, plaintiff alleges that the Raydel stock and promissory note were worthless at the time of receipt. All of these allegations were specifically or substantially denied by defendants, who suffered far greater financial losses from this Raydel account than did the plaintiff. Both sides agree that the defendants set credit limits on sales to Raydel which they subsequently did not adhere to, and that Raydel’s receivables were carried on the average for a longer period than those of other customers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> Finally, plaintiff alleges that during the last half of 1961 the President of Brown-Borhek spent his full time campaigning for the office of Mayor of Bethlehem and that its Vice President was similarly engaged in the management of the United Gas Improvement Company. Defendants aver that these outside activities did not prevent these officers from attending to their respective duties and particularly to this Raydel account and furthermore that the vice presidency had always been only a part time job. Defendants admitted that the directors failed to remove these officers, but denied that this failure was due to negligence on their part.</p>

We believe that plaintiff portrays defendants’ alleged failure to act as he would have had them do, as a failure to exercise wise business judgment in the light of the disastrous business transaction from which they suffered far greater losses than he. The meaning and application of the “prudent man rule” (a) in the field of a testamentary or inter vivos trust, containing relatively few securities and (b) in the business or banking world are very different. For example, in the banking business bad loans or sour investments or unsuccessful business transactions are part and parcel of that business and are charged off every year, either voluntarily or on directions from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking or from the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the business world of profit and loss, which is often popularly described as the profit system, it is too often forgotten that all businesses do not flourish, nearly every business has some losses and some bad accounts, and many insolvencies and bankruptcies frequently occur<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> even in these prosperous times. If the test of negligence which is applicable in the field of torts or in the estate field were similarly applicable in the business or banking field, it would <em>realistically </em>be very difficult if not almost impossible to secure the services of <em>able and ewperienced </em>corporate directors. Such persons would rarely ever accept a directorship if they could be held liable for every “bad” account or every mistake of judgment. From an early date this Court has consistently and realistically recognized the danger of subjecting corporate directors to liability whenever any of the transactions of the company did not meet with success. <em>Hunt v.

It is clear that defendants gave considerable effort to preserving Raydel as a func<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>tioning business enterprise, hopeful of its success. In extending credit and in further extensions of credit they had to balance (a) the outlet for their merchandise and (b) the opportunity for repayment in full, against (c) a very substantial reduction of their market and (d) a fractional payment of their claim out of insolvency or the wreck of bankruptcy. We make this observation not to condone or approve any of the defendants’ acts but in support of a legitimate inference that they were indeed managing, as opposed to ignoring, the affairs of their corporation or the Raydel account.</p>
