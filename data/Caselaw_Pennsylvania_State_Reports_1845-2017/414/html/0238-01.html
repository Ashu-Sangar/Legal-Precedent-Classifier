Gibbs, shortly after alighting from a bus of the Pittsburgh Railways Company (Railways). Separate actions of trespass for personal injuries were instituted against Gibbs and Railways. The actions were consolidated for trial at which the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against both defendants in the amount of $6133. Railways’ motion for a new trial, and Gibbs’ motions for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial were denied below. Both defendants appealed from the judgments entered on the verdict.</p>

The right front end of the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>bus was located up against the curb and the left rear end thereof extended out into the cartway for a distance of approximately three feet. He immediately proceeded to a point approximately ten feet in front of the bus and started to walk across Beaver Avenue. When he reached a point directly in line with the left-hand or outer side of the bus, he momentarily stopped, looked first to his right and then to his left for approaching traffic. From his left, he saw the Gibbs’ automobile approaching on Beaver Avenue, traveling in the middle of the roadway in the same direction as the bus and approximately 30 feet to the rear thereof, or 65 feet from the point where the plaintiff was standing. At that moment, the bus started in motion, the plaintiff took one step further into the cartway and was immediately hit by the Gibbs’ automobile as it passed the bus on the left-hand side. The plaintiff could not estimate the speed of the Gibbs’ automobile before or at the time of the accident. Nor could he describe where it stopped after the impact. Other uncontradicted testimony showed that the car stopped almost instantly.</p>

Herein, there was no evidence that Gibbs’ automobile was being operated too fast or at an unreasonable rate of speed. The fact that it came to a stop almost instantly after hitting plaintiff is strong evidence to the contrary. Nor does the proof establish that the plaintiff was in the cartway within the unobstructed vision of the driver of the automobile for a sufficient length of time for the latter to have seen him, appreciated the danger and avoided the collision. <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>See, <em>Grein v.

Further it is pointed out that while the accident occurred on February 28, 1957, and suit was instituted against Gibbs on June 14, 1957, the action against Railways was not started until February 26, 1959. It is also urged that in explaining the reason for the delay in suing Railways, plaintiff’s testimony was evasive and inconsistent.
