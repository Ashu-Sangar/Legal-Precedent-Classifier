White submitted his application for admission to the Montgomery County Bar to the Montgomery County Board of Law Examiners. The application set forth in detail White’s qualifications, including his admission to the Bar of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on November 11, 1957; to the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on July 16,1957; to the Orphans’ Court for the County of Philadelphia on July 10, 1957; to the Municipal Court of Philadelphia on August 15, 1957; and to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on August 28, 1957.</p>

White appealed to the State Board of Law Examiners which Board reversed the Montgomery County Board and ordered that a certificate be issued by the Montgomery County Board recommending his admission to the Montgomery County Courts.

This allegation cannot be better answered than it has in the brief of the appellee from which we fully quote: “Appellants’ somewhat elusive argument that this Court is constitutionally prohibited from providing in Supreme Court Rule [footnote <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>omitted] for an appeal from a County Board of Law Examiners to the State Board seems to rest not upon the constitution, but upon the Act of April 14, 1834, P. L. 333, Section 68, 17 P.S. §1602. That section, which merely gives all courts power to admit attorneys and is but a small part of a comprehensive statute governing the operation of all of the courts of the Commonwealth, is hardly authority for the proposition that the decision on admitting attorneys to practice before a county court rests only with the county court. This Court has decided otherwise, as has the Legislature in the Act of July 11, 1923, P. L. 1069, 17 P.S. §1605, which provides: ‘Admission now had or that may hereafter be had to practice as an attorney-at-law in the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth shall, <em>upon the approval of the local examining board, </em>qualify such attorney for admission to practice as an attorney-at-law in every other court of this Commonwealth, and <em>upon such approval shall operate as an admission of such attorney in any other court of this Commonwealth upon his filing, in the office of the prothonotary or cleric, of said </em>court, <em>a certificate of admission in the Supreme Court and a certificate of approval from the local examining board </em>and the payment to such prothonotary or clerk of a fee’of one dollar.’ (Emphasis added.)</p>

It would be quite illogical to have an appeal lie from the State Board to the county court, with which the State Board has no connection. In those cases of disbarment from or reinstatement to a local bar which come before the Board of Governance of the Pennsylvania Bar, a similar procedure is followed. Under Rule 17(I), the Supreme Court has made provision for obtaining the views of both the local bar and the Board of Governance of the Pennsylvania Bar before <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>an appeal is taken to the Supreme Court.

Chief Justice Jones (then Mr. Justice Jones) made this clear in his concurring opinion [joined in by Justice Horace Steen] in Stewart v.

It has never been disputed that the admission of attorneys to the practice of law involves the exercise of judicial power which, by Article Y, Section 1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, is vested in the various courts of the Commonwealth; and, the paramount supervisory power over the courts of the Commonwealth is reposed in this Court by virtue of the Act of May 22, 1722, 1 Sm. L. 131, 140, Sec. XIII, which became constitutionally entrenched with the advent of our first State Constitution in 1776. It follows, therefore, that relief of the nature sought by the appellant can be competently afforded only, if at all, by further appropriate rules of this Court. In the meantime, so long as local examining boards are permitted to approve or reject applications for admission to the practice of law in courts of this Commonwealth, the rules whereby such boards operate must not be unreasonable and, so, constitute proper subjects for review.’</blockquote>

Nearly two and one-half years have elapsed since Mr. White first applied for admission in what was thought to be a routine application.
