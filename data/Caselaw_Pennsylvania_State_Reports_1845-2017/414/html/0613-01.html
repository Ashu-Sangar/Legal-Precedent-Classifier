The legislative omission to do so is highly significant: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Cartwright v.

The legislative aim was not to create a felony limited to a special legal breed of collectors of taxes but to protect all taxes, on their way. from the taxpayers, from embezzlement by any persons who happen to be charged with the collection of such taxes.

Section 573 provides, inter alia, that any person, maintaining a place of business in Pennsylvania and selling or ■ leasing tangible personalty, the sale or use of which is subject to the sales tax, who wilfully fails, neglects-or refuses to collect the tax from the purchaser, and rqmit the tax to the Commonwealth is guilty of a piisdemeanor. Section 573 does not include the offense of embezzlement. While §573 does include a failure to remit the sales tax as an offense, a very essential element of proof essential to a conviction under §823 is not required, i.e., the conversion or appropriation of the collected taxes to the vendor’s use in any way whatsoever. The crimes created under §573 are administrative in nature, require no .proof of monetary gain and are properly classed as misdemeanors.. The crime created under §823 is an entirely different mat<a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>ter, involves an element of culpability and is properly classed as a felony.</p>
    <p id="b667-5" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[101,477,1150,1390]]]'>The most complete answer to the contention that §573 precludes prosecution under §823 is provided by §601 (b) of the Sales Tax Act (72 P.S. §3403-601) which provides, inter alia: “the criminal offenses and penalties therefor prescribed by this act [the Sales Tax Act] shall be <em>in addition </em>to any criminal offenses prescribed by the general laws of this Commonwealth, which may arise out of the same transaction or transactions.” (Emphasis supplied). That section leaves applicable the provision of The Penal Code unless such are duplicated by §573 of the Sales Tax Act and there is no duplication of the crime defined in §823 of The Penal Code to be found in §573 of the Sales Tax Act. The essence of §573 is the thwarting of those who would block the administration of the Sales Tax Act; the essence of §823 is the conversion or misappropriation of such tax. If anyone converts taxes to his own use he is guilty of the crime charged by §823. While such conversion might add to the opprobrium of failure to remit under §573 of the Sales Tax Act, it would not be an essential elemént of proof of violation of §573 nor would it alter the legal effect of such violation. Clearly, §601 (b) of the Sales Tax Act demonstrates the legislative intent not to make §573 the exclusive criminal remedy with respect to a failure to remit sales taxes.</p>
