The sewage system ivas maintained by and its use furnished by the Corporation for approximately twenty-two years to the occupants of such homes without charge. On March 10, 1958, the Corporation sold the sewage system to Balazick for $1, plus a credit of |3,000 to be applied against future charges to the Corporation for use of the sewage system and Balazick later assigned his rights to the Company. This conveyance was conditioned upon receipt by the Company of a certificate of public convenience from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for operation of the system.</p>
    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[147,1401,1149,846]]]'>The Company applied to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for a certificate of public convenience which application was opposed. In the meantime, the Authority was chartered and, by appropriate proceedings under the Municipality Authorities Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382, §1 et seq., as amended, 53 PS §301 et seq., acquired the sewage system by eminent domain. The Public Utility Commission refused the Company’s application for a certificate of public convenience upon the ground that the Company did not have and was not in a position to acquire the facilities necessary to render the service. This order of the Public Utility Commission was affirmed by the Superior Court in <em>Bobtown Sewage Company v.
