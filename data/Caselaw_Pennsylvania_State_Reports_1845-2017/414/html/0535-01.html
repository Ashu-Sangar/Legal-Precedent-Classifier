    <p id="b580-9" data-blocks='[["BL_580.14",580,[239,1254,1145,195]]]'>Appellees, children of Frank and Clara Tallarico, on October 5, 1963, filed an action to quiet title against the personal representative of the estate of their father.</p>
    <p id="b580-10" data-blocks='[["BL_580.15",580,[234,1470,1149,690]]]'>The complaint alleges that prior to November 5, 1956, their mother owned four parcels of land in Washington County. On that day, Frank and Clara Tallarico (Frank and Clara) executed a writing wherein Clara promised to convey all of her property to herself and her husband as tenants by the entireties. The writing provided that: “In the event that either the Husband or Wife should remarry after the death of the other, it is hereby agreed that title to the said real estate shall pass to and be vested in the children of the Husband and Wife, their heirs and assigns in fee simple, from and after the date of the said remarriage.”</p>

    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.3",581,[134,364,1149,249]]]'>
      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>On that same day, November 5, 1956, Clara, by her deed, created a tenancy by the entireties in herself and her husband, but the deed made no reference to the agreement and imposed no condition upon the conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[134,633,1150,310]]]'>The complaint further alleges that Clara died on October 20, 1959, and that Frank, on November 5, 1960, married Maria Mauro (Maria) in Italy. Frank died August 31, 1963, a resident of Washington County. Goldie P. Bellotti was appointed his personal representative on September 27.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[134,955,1149,313]]]'>The complaint pleads a breach of the condition imposed by the writing of November 5, 1956, and prays that the deed of the same day be revoked and set aside and that the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County enter a decree awarding title to the real estate to plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[133,1279,1150,574]]]'>Maria, decedent’s second wife, not a party to the action, without petitioning for leave to intervene, filed preliminary objections to the complaint, in which she questioned the court’s jurisdiction over the subject matter. She urged that the Orphans’ Court of Washington County had exclusive jurisdiction and that the action in the court of common pleas should be dismissed. No question was raised in the court below as to her standing to file these preliminary objections, and the court passed upon the merits of the jurisdictional issue.</p>
    <p id="b581-7" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[132,1872,1149,418]]]'>The court below concluded that decedent’s ownership of the real estate terminated upon his remarriage so that the property never became a part of his estate. Accordingly, the court held that the deed did constitute a cloud upon the title of plaintiffs and that the court of common pleas had jurisdiction over the subject matter. The preliminary objections were dismissed. Maria Mauro Tallarico appeals.</p>
    <p id="b581-8" data-blocks='[["BL_581.8",581,[132,2303,1148,99]],["BL_582.1",582,[236,366,1149,473]]]'>Appellees, for the first time, question Maria’s standing to file preliminary objections. Despite the <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>absence of a formal petition for leave to intervene, the court below obviously treated her as having standing. Because the question was not raised below, we shall not deal with it here and shall consider appellant as one who had been granted leave to intervene. There is no doubt that Maria’s interest in the outcome of the action to quiet title is such that she would have been granted leave to intervene pursuant to Pa. R.. C. P. 2327(2),(4), had a proper petition been filed.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[233,850,1154,843]]]'>Without deciding the other legal consequences, if any, of the writing of November 5, 1956, it is clear that it was not, in itself a conveyance. The deed of November 5 clearly created a tenancy by the entireties in Prank and Clara. The deed itself recited that the express purpose of the conveyance was the creation of this tenancy. Had the deed contained the limitation imposed by the separate writing or incorporated its terms in some legally acceptable manner, a different question would be presented. Therefore, taking the factual allegations of the complaint as admitted for. the purpose of. disposing of the preliminary objections <em>(Bechak v.

When he died, the subject property became an asset of his estate.</p>
