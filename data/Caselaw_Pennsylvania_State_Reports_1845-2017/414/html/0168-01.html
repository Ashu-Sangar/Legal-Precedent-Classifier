    <p id="b213-10" data-blocks='[["BL_213.18",213,[147,1854,1165,368]]]'>MeCandless Township (Township) duly authorized the installation of certain water lines in the Township. Pursuant thereto, the water lines were installed. Installation of the water lines was by the West View' Water Authority, under a contract with the Township, and the ultimate cost of such installation to the Township was $41,841.27.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>At the Township’s instance, the court of common pleas appointed a board “to ascertain the costs, damages,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> if any, and expenses of [the project] and to assess the benefits of said improvement”. The Board prepared a report — herein called the schedule — in which the Board found there were no damages involved and that the total cost of the project was $41,-841.27 and <em>it imposed the entire cost of the project upon the property owners charging nothing against the Township. </em>Certain property owners excepted to this schedule and, after a hearing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the Board levied assessments for benefits against the property owners total-ling $30,595.50 and charged to the Township the difference between the entire cost and the total amount of benefits assessed, to wit, $11,245.77. An examination of that report indicates that the Board made a general “across the board” reduction of the assessments. As we noted in <em>McCandless Appeal, </em>supra, this “report contain [ed] no findings of fact nor any reason or explanation for the reduction of the assessments made in the original report or for the placement of a portion of the costs of this project on the Township.” (p. 287).</p>

Pursuant to our mandate, the court below properly returned the matter to the Board with instructions that the Board comply with our order.</p>

    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[157,592,1150,582]]]'>Two questions are presented: (1) whether this <em>supplemental </em>report of the Board complied with the mandate of this Court? (2) in view of the Board’s failure to find that the design and plan of the water lines’ project were improper or faulty or that the- project costs were excessive or that the Township acted in bad faith or in a fraudulent manner, did the Board have the power and authority to assess against the property owners only a portion of the project costs and charge the balance of such costs against, the Township?</p>

This supplemental report indicates: (1) the Board inferentially questions the validity of our order because (a) there was no record before the Board upon which findings of fact could be based and (b) it was never the Board’s practice to make findings of fact unless requested; (2) the procedure adopted by the Board in making its <em>original </em>report; (8) a statement by the Board that its <em>original </em>report was erroneous “in that certain properties were demonstrated to have different frontages and lesser benefits than had first appeared”, although the Board now acknowledges that such error had no bearing on the Board’s final determination “since the amount charged to the Township [was] in excess of the total value of these frontages”; (4) a statement of the Board’s belief that “all of the properties together were not benefited to the extent of the whole cost of the improvement as [the Board] first had thought” and, therefore all, of the assessments were reduced “in the interest of uniformity and justice”. The modus operandi by which <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>the Board determined and allocated the portion of the project costs to be paid by the Township and the portion of such costs to be paid by the property owners is not divulged, <em>how </em>the Board ascertained the actual amount of benefit to each property involved is not disclosed nor is the report in any respect informative as to the justification for what is obviously and manifestly an “across the board” reduction of the assessments from those made in the schedule. All the Board states is that “uniformity and justice” required such a reduction. Such ipse dixit neither complies with the order of this Court nor the statutory duties and obligation of the Board.</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[237,1081,1149,1170]]]'>For some reason or other, this Board has utterly failed to carry out our instructions and those of the court below. Inherent and explicit in such instructions was the requirement that the Board set forth its reasons and the factual basis for the reduction of the assessments and for the placement of a portion of the cost of the project on the Township; such requirement the Board has not met. If a hearing is necessary, as we deem it to be, at which both the Township and the property owners may present factual data to support their respective positions such a hearing must be held and, after such hearing, the Board should then file a report which clearly and expressly sets forth <em>why </em>it determines that a portion of the costs of the project should be placed on the Township and <em>how </em>it determines the amount of benefits to be assessed against each property involved. The unsupported and unexplained conclusion that “uniformity and justice” require a placement of a portion of the costs on the Township and an “across the board” reduction of the assessments against the property owners is clearly insufficient.</p>

The Township urges that Section 1502 of The First Class Township Code (Act of June 24,1931, P. L. 1206, §1502, cl. XY; Act of July 18, 1935, P. L. 1312, §1; Act of May 27, 1949, P. L. 1955, §31; Act of August 19, 1953, P. L. 1090, §1, 53 PS §56515) fully supports its position that it may not be held liable. Section 1502 provides, inter alia: “. . . in all cases where said township shall have established a water system and shall construct main water lines in said township, [the Township] <em>may charge the cost of construction </em>of any municipal water lines . . ., <em>or such portion of the cost of construction as the </em>[Township] <em>may deem proper, </em>upon the properties benefited or accommodated thereby. . . .” (Emphasis supplied). The Township argues that, under Section 1502, if the Township adopts the “benefit” method of assessing the costs rather than the “foot front” method, it is the Township alone which determines whether all or only a portion of the costs of the water lines shall be placed on the property own<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>ers and that it is the sole function of the Board to apportion among the property owners the allocable cost of the project.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[141,533,1155,804]]]'>It is to be noted that Section 1502 provides that the “charges [for the cost of construction of the water lines] shall be assessed and collected in the manner provided [in the Code] for the assessment and collec-. tion of charges for the construction of sewers.” Section 2408 of the Code (53 PS §57408) provides that-, when assessments are to be made “upon the several properties abutting on the sewer in proportion to benefits” (as in the case at bar is to be made on properties abutting on the water lines), the “amount of the charge on each property shall be ascertained” under Section 2409 of the Code, i.e., by the court appointment, of a Board of Viewers who shall proceed in the manner provided in the Code “for the assessment of damages and benefits by viewers. . . .” (53 PS §57409).</p>

Even though there be no bad faith or fraudulent conduct on the Township’s part, even though the cost of the project be reasonable and the plan and design of the project proper, even so the Board, in the assessment of benefits, is restricted to <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>levying assessments on the basis of the <em>actual </em>benefits accruing to the property owners.
