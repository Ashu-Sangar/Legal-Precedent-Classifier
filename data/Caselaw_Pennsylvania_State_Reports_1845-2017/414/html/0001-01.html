Eller and his wife own approximately 13 acres of land in London Britain Township, Chester <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>County. The Ellers purchased the property in 1951 and, since that time, have been engaged in raising mushrooms. At the time of the purchase, the land was improved with a house, a barn, some chicken houses, and a double mushroom house.</p>
    <p id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[166,642,1151,693]]]'>In 1952, the township enacted a zoning ordinance which classified the entire township “District A,” a residential and farming district. Permitted uses include a “mushroom house provided it is located at least 500 feet from the nearest official roadside line and 1000 feet from all other lot boundaries.” Since the Eller’s mushroom house was 400 feet from the adjacent road and 180 feet from the nearest property line, it constituted a nonconforming use. In 1956, pursuant to a recent amendment to the ordinance, Mr. Eller applied for and obtained a permit to expand his nonconforming use by 100 percent. An additional double mushroom house was immediately constructed.</p>
    <p id="b47-4" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[167,1346,1150,638]]]'>In 1959, appellee applied for a permit to construct ■two additional double mushroom houses which would double his then existing facilities. From the refusal of the permit, an appeal was taken to the Board of Adjustment of London Britain Township. After a public hearing, the board affirmed the refusal of the zoning officer to issue the permit. It held that since the special exception to expand, granted in 1956, had exhausted the board’s power under the ordinance, Eller’s request had to be treated as a petition for a variance. The board held that the owner’s burden to sustain the grant of a variance had not been made out.</p>

Without taking additional testimony, the court held that the board properly found that Eller had failed to sustain his burden of proof as to the variance. However, the court sus<a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>tained the constitutional challenge, reversed the hoard, and directed the issuance of the necessary permit. The board of adjustment appeals.</p>

First, it is contended that the court could not properly consider the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance where the question was not raised before the board and where no additional testimony or evidence was requested or presented in •that court.

The issue was raised for the first time before the court en banc on appeal from the trial court. Our Court said (at 46-47, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20587" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="131 A.2d 587">131 A. 2d at 593</a>) : “In limine, we consider whether this section of the ordinance was constitutional. Appellee urges, however, that this question cannot be now considered because appellant did not raise the question in the court below. It is well settled that, as to appellants, ‘Matters not raised in, or considered by, the court below cannot be invoked on appeal even though they involve constitutional questions’: [citing cases]. That rule, however, is inapplicable in the present situation because the question of constitutionality was raised — albeit tardily — in the lower court, that court sitting en banc fully considered the question and, therefore, the evil sought to be avoided by the rule is non-existent.”</p>

In the words of the court below: “Mathematical calculation of the effect of the limitations of Sec. 24(e) of the Ordinance demonstrates the absurd effect of their application upon a permitted use in an area which is part of the acknowledged mushroom growing center of the world. A set-back of 500 feet from any roadside line and a distance of 1000 feet from any property boundary, (without considering the dimensions of the mushroom house itself,) require that a property be 1500 feet deep from the roadside line to the rear boundary and 2000 feet in width, containing an area of 3,000,000 square feet, or <em>68.86 acres. </em>Under those requirements no property containing less than about 69 acres may have even a <em>single mushroom, </em>house. When the dimensions of a single mushroom house are necessarily calculated in addition thereto the absurdity is more apparent, and when it is considered that not less than three double mushroom houses, each 40 x 60 feet in dimensions, will support a growing operation without economic loss the confiscatory nature of the regulation is clear, amounting to a taking of property without compensation and a violation of due process of law.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
