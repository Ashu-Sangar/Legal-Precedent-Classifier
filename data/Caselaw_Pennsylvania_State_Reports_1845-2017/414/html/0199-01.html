Doyle, was destroyed by fire. The destruction could have been averted if the Pittsburgh Fire Department, which had responded to the fire alarm, could have obtained water from the fire hydrants, of which there were at least five in the immediate area of the house. None would yield a stream of water for the hoses ready to carry the extinguishing element to the flames which began small but eventually leaped to proportions which engulfed and consumed the dwelling.</p>

The complaint charged the water company with certain acts of negligence which individually or collectively caused the destruction mentioned. The water company filed preliminary objections in which it simply said that the plaintiffs had failed to set forth a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, and moved for an order dismissing the complaint. The court sustained the objections and entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

This is like saying that a person who starves to death dies not because of lack of food but because of physical debility. The plaintiffs specifically charge in their complaint that had the defendant supplied water, their home would not have gone up in flames. This is the charge the defendant must answer to and nothing is gained by the elusive debating dialectic that it was the fire and not the lack of the drenching element which caused the loss of which the plaintiffs complain.</p>
    <p id="b246-5" data-blocks='[["BL_246.5",246,[232,1465,1149,575]]]'>In attempted support of its argument that the lack of water was too remote to be a proximate cause for the plaintiffs’ losses, the defendant cites the case of <em>Grant v.

It was caused by something else than that, and, <em>whether the ultimate loss was caused by the want of water leads us too far into the region of possibility and conjecture to enable any one to say, with any certainty, that such loss can be traced directly to the want of water ” </em>Emphasis supplied by appellee’s counsel.)</p>

In fact, this Court said much to the contrary of that alleged by the appellee, namely, “The purpose of the reservoir being to extinguish fires, and the fire having been shown not to have been extinguished in consequence of the non-performance of the duty imposed, <em>it would be no answer, perhaps, to say that the proximate cause of the injury was the fire, and the want of water only the remote cause. </em>If it were made the duty of a municipality to station a police officer at a particular corner, to protect the foot-passengers from being run over by passing vehicles, it may be doubted whether it would be an answer to an action, to say that the cause of the injury was the horse and wagon and not the absence of the officer.” (Emphasis supplied here.)</p>

The plaintiff contended that in using a rope, instead of a fireproof device, the electric company committed an act of negligence which resulted in the horse’s death. - The trial court entered a nonsuit against the plaintiff, asserting that the proximate cause of the injury was the burning of the rope, due to a casualty which the defendant was not reasonably bound to foresee. The Superior Court reversed, declaring: “While the burning building may be treated as an inevitable accident so far as the defendant company is concerned, in that they were not in any manner identified with the cause of the fire and had no control over it, it may at least be treated as an intervening agency which brought into dangerous prominence that which a jury might find was a negligent act of the defendant, and so combined with it as to cause the plaintiff’s damage. . If this should be so determined against the defendant company it will be sufficient ground on which to base a verdict in the plaintiff’s favor. . . . The precautions which were reasonably necessary to protect the arc lamp in its place, and whether the company failed to adopt an appliance which was recognized as safer than the one he had had in use, and was well known to be of such a character, and in general use in the community prior to the happéning of this accident, was a question for the jury.”</p>

Certainly it could never be said that the fire was an unforeseeable event. Unfortunately, fires are always possible, and the purpose of a fire hydrant, like a Minute Man, is to be ready for fires at all times. It would be wholly unrealistic to say that the water company was not to anticipate the likelihood of a fire, in which event its failing to keep the hydrants and their appurtenances in proper repair could result in the very loss which occurred and in the very manner it occurred. Thus, the defendant cannot avoid liability merely by asserting that the fire and not the defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs’ loss. What was said in <em>Stark v. Lehigh </em>Foundries, <em>Inc., </em><a href="/pa/388/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="388 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1272510" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0001-01">388 Pa. 1</a>, 11, applies here: “ ‘ “ Une who negligently creates a dangerous condition cannot escape liability for the natural and probable consequences thereof, although the innocent act of a third party may have contributed to the final result.’ And when there are two contributing acts, it is not proximity in time that determines which of them is the proximate cause of the resulting injury Mars v.

To support this thesis it cites the case of <em>Thompson v.

It is sufficient to state that in the <em>Thompson </em>case, the Court proceeded on the theory that undertaking the task of ■supplying water to the plaintiff, as in <em>Grant v. Erie, </em><a href="/pa/69/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="69 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1026528" data-case-paths="/pa/69/0420-01">supra,</a> was discretionary with the municipality and that therefore it could not be held liable for failing to exercise a discretionary duty.</p>

Here the-situation is entirely different. The plaintiffs are not relying on the defendant’s breach of duty to supply water but on its breach of a duty to use reasonable care in the operation and maintenance of a water system which the defendant had in fact set up in the vicinity of the plaintiffs’ property.</p>

The municipality here did exercise its discretion and no one challenges that exercise. As a result, of the fulfillment of that choice of action, hydrants were actually set up in the vicinity of the plaintiffs’ property — five of them. Hence, the situation in the case at bar is far further advanced than the one outlined in the <em>Thompson </em>case. Discretion having been exercised and the physical fact of that exercise having <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>become a fait accompli, reasonable care in tbe maintenance and repair of the planted hydrants became im-. perative.

With fire hazard, unceasing vigilance is not only desirable but mandatory. As stated by Judge Cardozo in the <em>MacPherson </em>case: “The presence of a known danger, attendant upon a known use, makes vigilance a duty. <em>We have put aside the notion that the duty to safeguard life and limb, when the consequences of negligence may be foreseen, grows out of contract and nothing else.

In that case the plaintiff Evans was injured when a board from the roof of the elevator in which he was riding fell on his head.

Evans sued the Otis Elevator Company averring that it was negligent in failing to properly inspect the elevator and in failing to notify him of its defective and dangerous condition. Otis defended on the proposition, inter alia, that it owed no duty to Evans, but only to Sperling. This defense was rejected by our Court, Justice Benjamin R. Jones stating: “Generally a party to a contract does not become liable for a breach thereof to one who is not a party thereto. However, a party to a contract by the very nature of his contractual undertaking may place himself in such a position that the law will impose upon him a duty to perform his contractual undertaking in such manner that third persons — strangers to the contract — will not be injured thereby: Prosser, Torts, (2nd ed. 1955), section 85, pp. 514-519. It is not the contract per se which creates the duty; it is the law which imposes the duty because of the nature of the undertaking in the contract. If a person undertakes by contract to make periodic examinations and inspections of equipment, such as elevators, he should reasonably foresee that a normal and natural result of his failure to properly perform such undertaking might result in injury not only to the owner of the equipment but also third persons, including the owner’s employees : Bollin v. Elevator Construction &amp; Repair Co., <a href="/pa/361/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="361 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="476365" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0007-01">361 Pa. 7</a>, 17, 18, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.2d%2019" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="63 A.2d 19">63 A. 2d 19</a>, and cases therein cited.

The quoted matter, with other sentences quoted in the appellee’s brief, are merely selected apples out of a barrel which contains other fruit which give to the barrel a wholly different concept of its contents than can be gathered from the one selection made by the defendant company. The Supreme Court did state that there was no duty on the part of the defendant to supply water to the plaintiff because the contract to supply water was with the municipality and not with the public, but it very specifically pointed out that if the failure to supply water had been alleged to be the result of lack of reasonable care in the set-up, maintenance and operation of its water system, the defendant would have been liable: “It is argued, however, that even if, in the first instance, the law did not oblige the company to furnish property owners with water, such a duty arose out of the public service upon which the defendant entered. But if, where it did not otherwise exist, a public duty could arise out of a private bargain, <em>liability toould be based on the failure to do or to furnish what was reasonably necessary to discharge the duty imposed. The complaint proceeds on no such theory. It makes no allegation that the defendant failed to furnish a plant of reasonable capacity, or neglected to extend the pipes where they were reasonably required. </em>Nor is it charged that what the company actually did was harmful in itself or <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>likely to cause injury to others, so as to bring the case within the principle applicable to the sale of unwholesome provisions, or misbranded poisons which, in their intended use, would be injurious to purchasers from the original vendee. So that, notwithstanding numerous charges of culpable, wanton and malicious neglect of duty, this suit, whether regarded as ex contractu or ex delicto — is for breach of the provisions of the contract of February 14, 1900, which must, therefore, be the measure of plaintiff’s right and of defendant’s liability . . .</p>

In that case the plaintiff’s property was destroyed because the defendant water company failed to supply an adequate water supply with sufficient pressure to extinguish a fire, even though the plaintiff had notified the water company of the fire. The Court held that there was no liability. It is to be particularly noted in that case that in its complaint the plaintiff alleged that the water company <em>failed to “fulfill the provisions of the contract between it and the city of Rensselaer.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Here again the claim, entirely different from the one at bar, was predicated on a contract with the involved municipality. No breach of any duty to use reasonable care in the erection, operation and maintenance of the water system was alleged or relied upon.

Judge Cardozo sought to distinguish the <em>Moch </em>case from the <em>MacPherson </em>case where there was originally no duty toward the plaintiff but such duty arose because of the defendant’s action, stating: “If conduct has gone forward to such a stage that inaction would commonly result, not negatively merely in withholding a benefit, but positively or actively in working an injury, there exists a relation out of which arises a duty to go forward (Bohlen, Studies in the Law of Torts, p. 87). So the surgeon who operates without pay, is liable though his negligence is in the omission to sterilize his instruments (cf. Glanzer v. Shepard, supra); the engineer, though his fault is in the failure to shut off steam (Kelley v. Met. Ry. Co., supra; cf. Pittsfield Cottonwear Mfg. Co. v. Shoe Co., <a href="/nh/71/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="71 N.H. 522" data-case-ids="1813802" data-case-paths="/nh/71/0522-01">71 N.H. 522</a>, 529, 533); the maker of automobiles, at the suit of some one other than the buyer, though his negligence is merely in inadequate inspection (MacPherson v.

The query always is whether the putative wrongdoer has advanced to such a point as to have launched a force or instrument of harm, or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good.”</p>

Judge Cardozo, without apparently intending to do so, contradicted what he said in the <em>MacPherson </em>case which, incidentally, he cited with approval in the <em>Moch </em>case. A refusal to deny a benefit may in itself result in the refusal becoming an instrument of harm. Once Judge Cardozo recognized that the defendant was guilty of a “negligent omission,” he admitted that the defendant had committed a breach of duty since negligence is defined in law as a breach of duty. If there was no breach of duty on the part of the defendant, its conduct could be not characterized as a negligent omission, but would be merely an omission that did not amount to negligence.</p>

At the same time, it is highly significant that the majority fails to spell out wherein <em>any </em>duty was owed to plaintiffs by the water company. The rationale of <em>Moch </em>as to whether a cause of action lies in tort against a water company by an individual whose property has been destroyed by fire when the water company, either through lack of pressure, failure to properly maintain the fire hydrants, etc., fails to provide adequate water to fight the fire may be summarized: (a) “Given a relation involving in its existence a duty of care irrespective of a contract, a tort may result as well from acts of omission as of commission . . . (898); (b) the search is to ascertain “not so much the conduct to be avoided when the relation and its attendant duty are established as existing” but “the conduct that engenders the relation” (898); (c) if the “conduct” has reached a stage that would “commonly result, not negatively merely in withholding a benefit, but positively or actively in working an injury, there exists a relation out of which arises a duty to go forward”, such as in <em>MacPherson; </em>(d) the crux of the inquiry is whether the actor has reached the point “as to have launched a force or instrument of harm, or has stopped where inaction is at most a refusal to become an instrument for good” (898). Applying that rationale to the situation where a home is destroyed by fire by reason of the water company’s failure to supply water for fire fighting, the Court said that the water company, under its contract with the municipality to furnish water for fire fighting, was not brought into such a <em>relation </em>with every inhabitant of the city who might potentially be benefited through such water supply as to raise “negligent performance” by the water company to “the quality of a tort” and that the fault of the water company was the “denial of a benefit”, not <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>“the commission of a wrong” (899).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a> As <em>Moch </em>indicates, <em>MacPherson </em>does not aid plaintiffs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_7" id="ref_footnote_3_7">7</a>

Such failure to do so — the nonfeasance of the contractual obligation — gave rise to no relationship between the water company and Doyles so that such nonfeasance attained <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>the “quality of a tort”.

Having exhaustively reviewed authorities in other jurisdictions, that Court concluded: “The division thus made, between misfeasance, which may support an action either in tort or on the contract, and the nonfeasance of a contractual obligation, giving rise only to an action on the contract, is admittedly difficult to make in borderland cases. There are, it is recognized, cases in which an incident of nonfeasance occurs in the course of an undertaking assumed. Thus, a surgeon fails to sterilize his instruments, an engine fails to shut off steam [citing a case], a builder fails to fill a ditch in a public way [citing a case]. These are all, it is true, failures to act, each disastrous detail, in itself, a ‘mere’ nonfeasance. But the significant similarity relates not to the slippery distinction between action and nonaction but to the fundamental concept of ‘duty’; in each a situation of peril has been created, with respect to which a tort action would lie without having recourse to the contract itself. Machinery has been set in motion and life or property is endangered. ... In such cases, in the words of [Tuttle v. Gilvert Mfg. Co., <a href="/mass/145/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="145 Mass. 169" data-case-ids="770476" data-case-paths="/mass/145/0169-01">145 Mass. 169</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20N.E.%20465" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="13 N.E. 465">13 N.E. 465</a>], we have a ‘breach of duty distinct from contract.’ Or, as Prosser puts it (Handbook of the Law of Torts [1st ed.], §33, p. 205), ‘if a relation exists which would give rise to a legal duty without enforcing the contract promise itself, the tort action will lie, otherwise not’. Before us, however, we have not such a case. We have simply the violation of a promise to perform the agreement. . . . What we are left with is defendant’s failure to complete his contracted-for performance. This is <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>not a duty imposed by the law upon all, the violation of which gives rise to a tort action, but a duty arising out of the intentions of the parties themselves and owed only to those specific individuals to whom the promise runs. A tort action will not lie.” Negligence is the basis of a tort action; a mere breach of a contractual promise will not suffice. Distinct from a breach of contract, a breach of duty must be shown and such breach of duty is absent in the case at bar.</p>

It is not enough to say, as does the majority say inferentially, that the duty is to be found in the law and cite <em>MacPherson </em>as authority. In <em>Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., </em><a href="/ny/248/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="248 N.Y. 339" data-case-ids="1905144" data-case-paths="/ny/248/0339-01">248 N.Y. 339</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=162%20N.E.%2099" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="162 N.E. 99">162 N.E. 99</a>, it was said: “Negligence is not actionable unless it involves the invasion of a legally protected interest, the violation of a right. ‘Proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do’ [citing authorities]” (99) and “back of [any given] act must be sought and found a <em>duty </em>to the individual complaining, the observance of which would have averted or avoided the injury” (pp. 99,100). (Emphasis supplied). To paraphrase <em>Palsgraf, </em>Doyles must sue in their own right for a wrong personal to them, and “not as the vicarious beneficiar [ies] of a breach of duty to another” (100). When a person enters into a contractual undertaking, he intends to benefit the other contracting party and such persons as may properly be classified as third parties specifically intended to be benefited. The majority of this Court, inferentially, would read into the water company-municipality contract an intent to benefit all who might, by incidence, be benefited thereby. As was said in <em>Moch, </em>supra (897) : “In a broad sense it is true that every city contract, not improvident or wasteful, is for the benefit of the public. More than this, however, <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>must be shown to give a right of action to a member of the public not formally a party. The benefit, as it is sometimes said, must be one that is not merely incidental and secondary. Cf. Fosmire v. National Surety Co., <a href="/ny/229/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="229 N.Y. 44" data-case-ids="90867" data-case-paths="/ny/229/0044-01">229 N.Y. 44</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20N.E.%20472" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="127 N.E. 472">127 N.E. 472</a>. It must be primary and immediate in such a sense and to such a degree as to bespeak the assumption of a duty to make reparation directly to the individual members of the public if the benefit is lost. The field of obligation would .be expanded beyond reasonable limits if less than this were to be demanded as a condition of liability. ... By the vast preponderance of authority, a contract between a city and a water company to furnish water at the city hydrants has in view a benefit to the public that is incidental rather than immediate, an assumption of duty to the city and not to its inhabitants.
