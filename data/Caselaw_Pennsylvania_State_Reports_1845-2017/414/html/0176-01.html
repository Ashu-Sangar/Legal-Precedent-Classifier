Of these forty acres <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>of land twenty acres are owned by one John Kmet, eight acres by St. Patrick’s cemetery and twelve acres by various freeholders. In the area are 45 freeholders of whom 33 freeholders, on February 12, 1962, presented a petition to Canonsburg Borough Council.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[238,644,1148,636]]]'>The annexation petition was adopted and approved, by appropriate resolution, by the borough council on February 20, 1962, and the petition was certified to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Washington County on February 23, 1962. Within the requisite statutory period, the supervisors of Chartiers Township and certain freeholders in the area filed a complaint to the annexation ordinance and petition and requested that the court appoint a board of commissioners to act as a fact-finding body in the matter. On the same day the court appointed a three member board of commissioners to perform its duties under the law.</p>

On October 5, 1962, the court made an order which directed annexation and approved of said annexation. This order recited that it was made after a review of the pleadings, the board’s reports, the applicable statute and that the court found that a majority of the freeholders in the area approved of annexation, that the legal requirements had been complied with and that the court was satisfied of the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>propriety of the annexation. Exceptions filed to this order were dismissed and the previous order approving annexation was confirmed. This order recited, inter alia, that “[w]hile this Court sympathizes with Char-tiers Township with respect to the loss of tax revenue and other disadvantages, <em>this Court . . . is powerless to withhold its approval where a majority of the persons involved, has expressed their desire to he annexed </em>to the Borough of Canonsburg.” (Emphasis supplied).

L. 550, §1 et seq. (53 PS §67501). Under that statute, initiation of annexation is by “a majority of the freeholders in the proposed annexed territory”. (Section 1). After the annexation petition has been presented to and approved by the borough council, the petition is certified to the court of quarter sessions. (Section 2). Section 3 provides that, if within thirty days, an aggrieved party complains to the court, asking for the appointment of a board of commissioners as a “fact finding body”, then the court shall appoint such a board. However, as a prerequisite to the appointment of a board, the court must initially satisfy itself as to the <em>legality </em>of the proceedings and the <em>propriety </em>of the annexation, i.e., that it serves the public interest: <em>Lancaster An</em>

The court stated therein “that it [was] powerless to withhold its approval where a majority of the persons involved, has expressed their desire to be annexed” (emphasis supplied) and, on the basis of this solely assigned reason, the court dismissed exceptions to the original order and approved the annexation. If the reason assigned by the court is correct, then <em>every </em>petition for annexation must be approved and granted for no annexation petition may even be initiated unless signed by a majority of the freeholders in the area sought to be annexed.</p>

Assuming, although the record does not so indicate, that the court <em>prior to </em>the appointment of the board <em>initially </em>determined the legality of the procedure and the propriety of the proceeding, nevertheless it is the duty of the court after the board of commissioners has made its findings of fact to “consider the findings of the board” and “any facts that may be submitted to [the court]” (Section 5) and, after a review of such facts and findings, to reach a final determination. Both the language and logic of the statute requires an <em>initial </em>determination, interlocutory in nature, of the legality and propriety of the annexation and a <em>final </em>determination of the legality and propriety of the annexation on the basis of all the facts then before the court. An order of annexation based solely on the fact that a majority of the freeholders in the area to be annexed desire such annexation is erroneous. The statute clearly makes the wishes of the majority of the area freeholders only one of the factors to be considered; consideration of such factor as the sole factor, as the court clearly indicates in its final order, negates both the language and the intent of the statute.</p>
