In the action by Wigle’s executors against the administratrix of Pritts’ Estate, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>

However, in considering the action of the lower court in granting or refusing a new trial, an appellate court will affirm, unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion, or an error of law which controlled the outcome of the case or the decision of the lower court”. <em>Chambers v.

Pritts was traveling on the through Highway 711. Wigle was driving on Rector-Darlington Road, which is controlled by a stop sign fifty feet from the intersection. The accident occurred at right angles within the intersection. The only eyewitness to the accident was Mrs. Thelma Dudley, a passenger in the Wigle automobile. She testified, inter alia, that Wigle <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>stopped at the stop sign fifty feet from the intersection, then drove into the intersection without stopping at the edge of the intersection. Immediately upon entering the intersection, the accident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[249,594,1149,476]]]'>The failure of Wigle to stop before entering a dangerous intersection is most certainly evidence of sufficient quantity and quality to sustain the verdict of the jury. We have said on numerous occasions that a motorist who enters an intersection, onto a through highway, must do so with care, for such situations are pitfalls for the less diligent and set the scene for serious accidents. <em>Idlette v. Tracey, </em><a href="/pa/407/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="407 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1307359" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0278-01">407 Pa. 278</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%2037" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="180 A.2d 37">180 A. 2d 37</a> (1962).</p>
    <p id="b356-6" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[247,1082,1148,692]]]'>It is the duty of this court to determine from the record the existence of evidence which establishes negligent conduct which was the proximate cause of the accident. <em>Stimac v. Barkey, </em><a href="/pa/405/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="405 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1303585" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0253-01">405 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=174%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="174 A.2d 868">174 A. 2d 868</a> (1961). The failure of Wigle to stop before his immediate entry into a dangerous intersection is certainly conduct out of which negligence can be inferred. The jury could quite properly reason that the negligence in so entering the intersection was the proximate cause of the accident. It is fair to reason that had Wigle not entered the intersection before stopping at the edge to survey traffic conditions on the through highway, the accident would not have occurred.</p>
    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.6",356,[246,1786,1145,316]]]'>The Court should not have granted judgment n.o.v. since there was evidence upon which the jury could properly find as it did, i.e., the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, should have been considered in the light most favorable to the verdict winner Pritts. <em>Chambers v. Montgomery, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.7",356,[244,2111,1147,317]]]'>The appellee raises the point that the negligence which caused the accident was the result of the conduct of Pritts. This, however, is a question which, once put to the jury, lies within its realm. The jury heard all the evidence, saw all the witnesses and as such was in the best position to determine who was negligent.</p>
