Following the denial of post trial motions and impositions of sentence, an appeal to this Court resulted in an affirmance of the judgment: <em>Commonwealth v.

However, it must be noted that the record discloses that the defendant was arrested within hours after the victim was found stabbed and lying in a pool of blood in his tailor shop; that a woman living in an apartment immediately above heard the quarrel and screams coming from below; that she then looked out of her window and saw a man leaving the premises through a rear exit; that a short time later she saw a man of the same build and appearance a short distance from the scene; that at first she could not remember his name, but afterwards remembered and realized that it was the defendant whom she casually knew. When this information was reported to the police, they went looking for the defendant and in the course of taking him into custody searched the room where he lived. Under such circumstances, this was a lawful arrest and the search as an incident thereto was valid and proper.</p>

This is not the situation here. The appellant plead not guilty at his preliminary hearing and persisted in this course of action throughout the trial. Nothing that happened at the preliminary hearing was used against him at trial, or had the slightest effect thereon. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not expressly or by implication require that a defendant be furnished counsel at the time of the preliminary hearing and the lack of counsel at this time does not, in itself, constitute lack of due process. See, <em>Com. ex rel. Maisenhelder v.
