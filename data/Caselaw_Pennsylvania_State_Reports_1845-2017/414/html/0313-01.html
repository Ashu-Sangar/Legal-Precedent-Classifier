Three months later, George Moehring (Moehring), sole beneficiary under the holographic writing of September 4, 1954, appealed from the probate of the 1951 will.

Shirley L. Lober, decedent’s niece and residuary legatee under the 1951 will, then appealed to the Orphans’ Court alleging (a) the 1954 will had been obtained through fraud, duress and undue influence exerted upon decedent by Moehring and his wife, (b) <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>the said will was a forgery and (c) decedent lacked testamentary capacity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

      <em>The chancellor, who saw and heard these witnesses, in his opinion said “Mrs. Wunderlich and Mr. Vaughan were honest, disinterested and forthright witnesses”, </em>Having thus placed his imprimatur on the credibility of these witnesses, the chancellor’s subsequent repudiation of their testimony, without any apparent or assigned reason, is beyond comprehension. If the <em>“honest, disinterested and </em>forthright” Mrs. Wunderlich is to be believed, decedent could not have been living in Moehrings’ home on September 4, 1954.

Yet, when sometime after the testimony was closed, contestant requested the chancellor to receive further evidence, allegedly found, post-hearing, in old files of Vaughan and Post, which would have substantiated the date of September 15, 1954, the court refused such request. Such evidence was as follows: (1) a cancelled check dated September 12, 1954 from Vaughan to decedent of which the decedent speaks in his letter of September 15, 1954; (2) a letter written by decedent from 210 Bellefield Avenue on August 26, 1954, to Post; (3) a carbon copy of a letter dated August 23, 1954, from Vaughan to decedent, addressed to 2Í0 Bellefield Avenue, wherein Vaughan enclosed two checks of which decedent acknowledged receipt in the letter of August 26, 1954; (4) two cancelled checks, dated August 23, 1954, from Post, Inc. sent to decedent at 210 Bellefield Avenue, which were acknowledged by decedent’s letter of August 26, 1954; (5) a letter dated October 9, 1954 from decedent to Post stating decedent had <em>now </em>secured another room; (6) a letter from Mrs. Wunderlich, dated October 11, 1954, to Vaughan telling him she had “finally” found a room for decedent. Such evidence should have fully satisfied the chancellor’s search for substantiation of the accuracy- of the date in the decedent-Vaughan letter and also would have materially aided in answering the very crucial question where decedent was living on September 4, 1954. Without even requiring proponent to answer contestant’s request, the chancellor denied the request to present this evidence.

Under such circumstances, it is highly questionable whether the presumption noted in <em>Baum </em>should arise until proponent has first proven that the insertion of the date by the testator took place prior to his adjudication as an incompetent. Even so, even though the presumption in <em>Baum </em>were presently applicable, has not such presumption been overcome by the “honest” testimony of Vaughan and Mrs. Wunderlich? Accepting September 4, 1954 as the date of execution of this will, the chancellor failed to consider whether the testimony of Vaughan and Mrs. Wunderlich did not qualitatively satisfy the rule in <em>Baum </em>as to the testimony requisite to rebut the presumption.</p>

Such was clearly error. The evidence must, and does not, fix the date of execution of the will with relation to the date of adjudication of incompetency with some degree of certainty; unless and until such date is fixed the court was not in a position to determine upon whom rested the burden of proof.</p>
