On, or shortly before, July 7, 1953, the claimant, Domenico Rizzo (Rizzo) presented his claim based on an unsealed demand note in the face amount of $2,000. This note was filed with the estate counsel by Rizzo.</p>

At the first hearing held by the auditor, on February 1, 1956, Rizzo appeared and presented his claim.

The witness also testified that, at the time of said conversation, Nicolazzo made payment to Rizzo in the sum of approximately $200, allegedly as interest on the alleged debt. This transaction to which DeLeo testified allegedly took place in June of 1952. The estate challenged the sufficiency of the evidence thus presented by the witness, DeLeo.</p>

He was unable to specify the exact day and time when he visited Nicolazzo’s home. While DeLeo was visiting that home, Rizzo came there and asked Nicolazzo about “my money”. At this time Nicolazzo, according to DeLeo, said that he was unable to do anything about it but said that he would give Rizzo some interest. DeLeo was unsure of <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>the amount given to Rizzo, saying, “I don’t know if it was more or less” than $200. Similarly, while DeLeo understood that the amount of money given to Rizzo was interest, he was not sure of this and did not know whether, if it was interest, for what period of time it was to cover — two years or four months. DeLeo in his testimony said that he understood that the payment was interest hut his testimony is vague as to the period of time for which this interest was paid.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[249,862,1153,1180]]]'>An examination of DeLeo’s testimony demonstrates that in the Nicolazzo-Rizzo conversation there was no mention of any note, of the date of the alleged conversation which he overheard, of what debt the parties were discussing, of the amount of the note or any of the other particulars which would indicate that the note in issue was the topic of this alleged conversation between Nicolazzo and Rizzo. Thus to say that from such testimony there was shown a payment of interest which would imply a new promise to pay the note and thus toll the statute would be violative of the rule set forth by this Court as to the quality of proof required in claims against the decedent’s estate. As we said in <em>Palmer v. Gillespie, </em><a href="/pa/95/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="95 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="492912" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0340-01">95 Pa. 340</a> (1880), in regard to an acknowledgment of a debt: “A clear, distinct and unequivocal acknowledgment of a debt is sufficient to take a case out of the operation of the statute. It must be an admission consistent with a promise to pay. If so, the law will imply the promise, without its having been actually or expressly made. <em>There must not be uncertainty as to the particular debt to which the admission applies.” </em>(p. 344) (Emphasis supplied).</p>

Thus, the testimony given as to the conversation between Nicolazzo and Rizzo could have been as equally directed to this transaction as to <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>the alleged debt on the unsealed demand note dated July 3, 1934.

    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[146,589,1149,632]]]'>In summary, the testimony of DeLeo must be characterized as vague, general and unconvincing. He was unable to specify what debt the parties were discussing ir the basis of it. He could not recall the date or the time of the conversation. He was unsure whether the payment made to the claimant by Nicolazzo was interest and, if it was, for how long a period it was to relate. This vague testimony coupled with Rizzo’s acknowledgment that there were other business dealings and transactions between Nicolazzo and himself leads us to conclude that the standard of proof required to sustain the claim was not attained.</p>
