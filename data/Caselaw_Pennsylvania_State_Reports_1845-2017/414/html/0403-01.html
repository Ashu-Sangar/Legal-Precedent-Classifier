Holmes, a brother and a sister. He and his wife lived together in a friendly family relationship for many years right up to the time of his death. No children were born of the marriage.</p>
    <p id="b448-9" data-blocks='[["BL_448.11",448,[236,1223,1149,573]]]'>During decedent’s lifetime, he purchased with his own funds 150 shares of stock in the Chartiers Saving and Loan Association of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Certificates for 70 shares and 25 shares were issued on June 2, 1946, and March 8, 1948, respectively, in the names of “W. W. Holmes and/or Helen E. Holmes,” and ownership was so carried on the records of the corporation. A certificate for 55 shares was issued on January 20, 1949, in the names of “W. W. Holmes and Helen E. Holmes.” Admittedly, the names on the certificates were the decedent and his wife.</p>

These certificates remained in the possession of the decedent until his death and were kept in the safe in his home.</p>

The widow and the nephews each filed exceptions and claimed ownership of the stock on the basis of separate alleged gifts inter vivos. The court below dismissed the exceptions and ruled that the estate was the owner of the stock. The widow, Helen E. Holmes, alone filed an appeal from this decree.</p>

Therein the claim of gift against the decedent’s estate was asserted by a son. It involved the existence of an alleged joint estate and not an estate by the entireties. The principles of law that obtain, where the gift is between husband and wife and an estate by the entireties is involved, are vastly different.</p>

From the registration alone, a gift is not presumed. However, where stock is purchased by a husband and the certificates are made out in the names of both the husband and wife, even though the certificates are delivered to the husband and retained by him, the gift to the wife is complete. The gift is presumed by reason of the nature of the joint tenancy which is peculiar to the husband and wife relationship and delivery to the husband is considered to be delivery to both the husband and the wife.

Where property or an account is placed in the names of a husband and wife, a gift and the creation of an estate by the entireties is presumed even though the funds used to acquire the property or to establish the account were exclusively those of the husband: <em>Cribbs Estate, </em><a href="/pa/411/0242-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="411 Pa. 242" data-case-ids="1886006" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0242-01">411 Pa. 242</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20379" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="191 A.2d 379">191 A. 2d 379</a> (1963).

It is their actual marital status and not necessarily the words stated or omitted in the instrument that determines their right to take as tenants by the entirety: Ladner on Conveyancing in Pennsylvania, §1.16 (3d ed. 1961).

Even where a husband places the property in both names without his wife’s knowledge or consent, a valid gift occurs: <em>Sparks v.

Likewise, if a husband acquires property with his own funds, and places it in the names of himself and wife, this constitutes a gift and an estate by the entireties, even though he exclusively receives the income therefrom during his lifetime: <em>Loesch’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/322/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="322 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1167920" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0105-01">322 Pa. 105</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20191" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="185 A. 191">185 A. 191</a> (1936).</p>
