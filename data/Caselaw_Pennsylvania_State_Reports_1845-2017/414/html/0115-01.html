    <p id="b161-5" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[146,637,1150,425]]]'>Testator died January 2, 1906, leaving a widow, a son and two daughters. By his will, he created a trust with income to his wife and three children for life. Upon the death of his last surviving child, he directed that the principal of the trust be distributed, . . equally amongst the children of my children, who shall then be living, and the issue of such of them as may be deceased, per stirpes, absolutely and in fee.”</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[148,1070,1150,966]]]'>The last of testator’s three children died on April 30,1962, survived by two children and the two children of a deceased child. Testator’s son previously had been survived by three children, one of whom died in 1916 without issue, and his other daughter had died leaving four children. The issue at audit was whether distribution of the principal in remainder to testator’s surviving grandchildren was to be per capita or per stirpes. The auditing judge held that the will directed a per capita distribution. This determination, confirmed by the full Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County, resulted in an award of one-ninth of the corpus to each of the eight surviving grandchildren and one-eighteenth to each of the two surviving children of a deceased grandchild. Appellants, the only two children of a deceased child of testator’s, take this appeal, contending here, as they did below, that the will directs stirpital distribution.</p>

It is so clear, and his intent so plainly evident, that his will interprets itself, leading expressly and inescapably to the conclusion that he intended a per capita distribution of principal among grandchildren and a stirpital distribution among the issue of deceased grandchildren. Such distribution involves no conflict with the provision in the will for stirpital distribution of income to grandchildren and their issue during the continuance of the trust, i.e., <em>during the lives of testator’s children. </em>Until the death of his last child, testator obviously, and quite naturally, desired to preserve equality among his children in the distribution of income, as against, or in competition with succeeding or substitutionary life tenants, viz.: the children and issue of deceased children. This is the time-honored, almost universal scheme of testamentary distribution of income prior to the termination of a trust. And this is the natural interpretation of testator’s language in the present case.</blockquote>

A study of the philosophy underlying this principle will disclose that when a testator makes a gift to a group of individuals of the same class, he is not mentally dividing them stirpitally, and increasing or decreasing their shares depending upon the fecundity of their parent. He is thinking of each member of the class as an <em>individual. </em>Thus a gift to grandchildren, nephews, cousins, etc., as a class, connotes an equal share to each individual of the class, i.e.: per capita.’</blockquote>
