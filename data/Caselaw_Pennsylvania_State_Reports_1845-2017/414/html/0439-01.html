The lower court in dealing with this issue correctly cites <em>Com. ex rel. Ashmon v.

There is nothing to indicate that counsel for Rivers was not fully prepared and informed of Rivers’ mental condition; Even more important, the record clearly reveals that at the outset of the trial, Mr. Levy, defendant’s experienced counsel, satisfied himself and the Court that the defendant Rivers understood the import and effect of the trial and the effect of his plea. Cf. <em>Com. ex rel. Simon v.

    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[146,1686,1152,529]]]'>The second issue raised by the appellant is that the hearing on the writ of habeas corpus should have been heard by the court en banc. The final reason advanced for this proposition is that Rule 43 of the Rules of the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery and Quarter Sessions of the Peace in part reads as follows: “Pleas of guilty to indictments for murder shall be heard by a Court en banc, consisting of the judge before whom the plea is entered and two other judges who shall be called in by him for that purpose”.</p>

However, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is a civil action and the procedural rules of criminal court do not apply to civil actions.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[250,590,1149,803]]]'>The third point raised by the appellant is that the court erred when it denied the petitioner-appellant’s motion for a continuance. The reason counsel for the appellant sought a continuance was that he had only five days to prepare for the case after his appointment and he was not able to speak with his client until two days before this hearing. Pa. R. C. P. 216 provides the grounds for which a continuance may be granted and, unless the case falls within one of the special exceptions listed in the rule which provides for a continuance, the decision rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. In this case it does not appear that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying a continuance of a case, the facts of which have been litigated several times over the past six years.</p>

To me, this is sufficient to compel this Court to set aside the plea of guilty and place the petitioner in the same position as though a plea had not been entered. The re-imposition of the death penalty by the sentencing court disregarded the evidence that established the petitioner as a low-grade moron, mentally defective and mentally ill, thus depriving him of his constitutional protections.
