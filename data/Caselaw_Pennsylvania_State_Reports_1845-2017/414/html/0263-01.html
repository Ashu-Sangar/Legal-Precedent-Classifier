On April 4, 1955, the property became subject to a first mortgage. On September 24, 1955, appellee United States, pursuant to a favorable tax court decision, filed a tax lien against the Richmans for a deficiency in their 1948 income taxes in the amount of $35,778.59. On June 2, 1958, a second mortgage was created on the hotel which was subsequently assigned to appellant Goldberg. On July 20, 1959, the Richmans conveyed the premises to appellant, Vine-Wood Realty Co. On August 25, 1960, a judgment lien was acquired against the property by appellant, Pennsylvania Laundry Oo.

(Bank) as collateral for a loan. Two notices of levy and final demand were served by the United States on Bank on February 9, 1960, and August 25, 1961. The first was based on the Rich-mans’ 1948 unpaid taxes and the second on their 1959 unpaid taxes. On September 12, 1961, solely as a result of an oral request from Richmans, the United States wrote a letter to Bank agreeing to the liquidation of the collateral security.

However, once the tax lien has attached to the taxpayer’s state-created interests, we enter the province of federal law, which we have consistently held determines the priority of competing liens asserted against the taxpayer’s ‘property’ or ‘rights to property.’. . . . The application of state law in ascertaining the taxpayer’s property rights and of federal law in reconciling the claims of competing lienors is based both upon logic and sound legal principles. This approach strikes a proper balance between the legitimate and traditional interest which the State has in creating and defining the property interest of its citizens, and the necessity for a uniform administration of the federal revenue statutes.” <a href="/us/363/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="363 U.S. 509" data-case-ids="6165941" data-case-paths="/us/363/0509-01">363 U.S. at 513-514</a>. It is undisputed (as to appellants’ marshaling contention) that the United States has a valid lien for 1948 income taxes on both the proceeds of the foreclosure sale and the certificates of deposit and had a lien on the predecessor of the latter — the securities held by Bank as collateral for its loan to the Rich-mans. Hence, the sole question for our determination is one involving the reconciliation of “claims of competing lienors.” The applicability of federal law is therefore clear.</p>

In the recent case of <em>Meyer v. United </em>States, 11 L. ed. 2d 293 (1963), the United States Supreme Court stated that it had never applied the principle of marshaling to federal income tax liens, nor had Congress laid down any rule with reference to the application of the doctrine (11 L. ed. 2d at 297). <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>In <em>Meyer, </em>the United States attempted to invoke marshaling in its own favor. Apparently assuming that the doctrine did apply where asserted in the government’s behalf, the majority of the Court held that no second fund was available for marshaling and decided against the government’s contention. It is to be noted that the United States Supreme Court has not as yet been faced with a case in which marshaling was sought <em>against </em>the federal government in an income tax case, although the lower federal courts have been so confronted and have disagreed on the doctrine’s applicability. Compare <em>United States v. Lord, </em><a href="/f-supp/155/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="155 F. Supp. 105" data-case-ids="4284236" data-case-paths="/f-supp/155/0105-01">155 F.

Jur., Marshaling Assets &amp; Securities, §7. Furthermore, these conditions must be shown to have existed at the time the common fund became available for distribution. Otherwise, the junior creditors would be tempted to delay distribution of the common fund as long as possible in hopes that the requirements for marshaling could be subsequently fulfilled.

    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[245,1023,1151,794]]]'>The proceeds of the foreclosure sale were available for distribution on May 1, 1961. On that date the lien of the United States attached to the securities of the Richmans held by Bank, for the liquidation arrangement had not as yet been entered into. Bank had a first lien on these securities. As the court below aptly stated, “At the time of the sale of the hotel there was no evidence the United States’ 1948 tax lien was or could be satisfied by its levy on the securities held by the bank, since it was subject to a prior lien of the bank.” Hence, there has been no demonstration by appellants that at the time the common fund was available for distribution there existed a second fund which was clearly available to satisfy the claim of the United States.</p>

To hold otherwise would, as indicated, defeat the equitable considerations underlying the marshaling doctrine by <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>causing delay in distribution of tbe common fund to inure to the benefit of junior lienors.</p>

The proposed schedule of distribution of the foreclosure proceeds was filed by the sheriff on February 10, 1961. The sale took place on May 1, 1961. Exceptions to the “amount, validity, and priority” of the United States lien were filed on September 1, 1961. Appellants did not raise their alleged right to marshaling until October 27, 1961 in their answer and new matter to the petition by the United States commencing this action. This was almost six months after the foreclosure sale. The right to marshal is inchoate in nature and is therefore subject to displacement. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York v. Mass. Mut.

Otherwise, junior lienors could cause delay in the distribution of the common fund to the prejudice of senior lienors. Hence, appellants having failed to make timely exceptions based on the applicability of the marshaling doctrine, they have waived the right to now raise it.</p>

We do not agree. There is nothing in the record to indicate that this was the intention of either the United States or the Bichmans in entering this transaction. Furthermore, the fact that the letter of the United States to Bank specifically requested at the behest of the Bichmans that the certificate <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>of deposit be made available for payment of all claims of the United States against the Rickmans clearly negates the appropriation of the fund to the 1948 tax debt.
