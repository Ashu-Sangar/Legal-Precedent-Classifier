This property and building were occupied by Woodrow Graffius (Graffius), under a written lease with Independent.</p>

A hoist for raising vehicles above the floor level, to permit work and attention underneath, is in this room.

Graffius and Larry Schultz, an employee of Graffius, closing the station for the night, were cleaning the station floor. Schultz was engaged in throwing over the floor a mixture of kerosene and gasoline,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and Graffius was sweeping this mixture around, together with soap, to clean the floor. Shortly after starting to spread the mixture on the floor, Graffius heard a “cracking noise” and Schultz heard a “boom”. Both saw a sheet of flame sweep through the service room and then saw both Graffius, Jr. and Green staggering out, severely burned. “The service room showed no evidence of explosion, and very little evidence of fire. According to the explosive expert subpoenaed by [Independent and Graffius], the kerosene-gasoline mixture used was highly volatile and inflammable. Gasoline evaporates into the air, and is heavier than the air. The fumes spread rapidly throughout the air. Any spark or fire of any kind, static electricity, defective wiring, or from a firecracker, could cause the gasoline in the air to ignite, burn throughout the air rapidly, and would make a sound when it ignited . . . .”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Both Graffius, Jr. and Green died as the result of the burns received.</p>

Since the terms of such agreement are not in dispute and since the interpretation and construction of that agreement determines the relationship between the parties, it was the function of the court, not the jury, to determine the relationship between Independent and Graffius. Appellees’ principal contention is that Independent had the right to terminate the agreement without cause and, relying on <em>Feller, </em>supra, p. 486, <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>such right on Independent’s part gave Independent the “right to control” Graffius, thus making the latter an “employee” and not an “independent contractor”. Appellees misread Paragraph 16 of the agreement as well as <em>Feller, </em>supra. Paragraph 16 gives to Independent the right of contract termination if Graffius defaults on his undertakings under the agreement; such termination is not “without cause”. Furthermore, the power “to terminate the relationship at any time with or without cause” is not under <em>Feller, </em>supra, the <em>sole </em>consideration, albeit “an extremely important consideration” in determining whether the person employed is an independent contractor or an employee. An examination of the instant agreement <em>in its entirety </em>indicates clearly and convincingly that the relationship between Independent and Graffius was that of independent contractee-contractor, not employer-employee. The court below, in submitting to the jury the question of the relationship of the parties under the undisputed facts, fell into error.</p>

The court below in its opinion stated, inter alia: “The evidence indicates it was this [kerosene-gasoline] mixture that caused the fire to occur with such rapidity throughout the room rather than the oil which leaked from the hoist. Graffius, Sr. further testified that the gasoline-kerosene mixture was commonly used to clean floors in service stations, and that such would have been used, without respect as to whether or not oil did leak from, the hoist; so that the leaking oil could not, under the evidence, be held as having any causal relation to the fire; the sole cause thereof being the use of the kerosene-gasoilne mixture, under the supervision and direction of Graffius, Sr.” We believe that this view of the court below was essentially sound.</p>
