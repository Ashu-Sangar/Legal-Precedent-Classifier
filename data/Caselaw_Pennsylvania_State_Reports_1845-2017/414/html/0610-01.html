The appellants further alleged tha,t a deed was prepared, executed, acknowledged and delivered which conveyed property fronting 129 feet on the above highway and <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>extending back 130 feet. This action was brought to Compel a reformation of the deed to include the 200 feet of frontage not included in the deed.</p>

This action, however, seeks to. reform a deed and is not, as categorized by the appellees and the court below, an action for specific performance.</p>

Scott, </em><a href="/pa/277/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="277 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="1079517" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0056-01">277 Pa. 56</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.%20804" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="120 A. 804">120 A. 804</a> (1923), and cases cited therein. The law has provided the further requirement that when reformation is sought because of mistake, the mistake alleged must be a mutual mistake. <em>Bugen v. N. Y. Life Ins.

It has even been held that a deed may be reformed when a mutual mistake in the description is made, even though one of the parties denies that a mistake was made. <em>Krieger v.

The complaint alleges in paragraphs 8, 16, 17, 18 and 19, that a mutual mistake occurred. Therefore, we conclude that the complaint alleges, with sufficient quantity and quality, a mutual mistake capable under law of overcoming the defendant-appellees’ demurrer. The fact that the deed was not preceded by a written sales agreement, which fact <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>in most instances would bar an action for specific performance, is not a factor in this case.

However, for the purposes of ■the demurrer, all well pleaded facts in- the complaint must be accepted as true. Since appellants have alleged what, if proved, would entitle them to the, relief sought, they must be granted the. opportunity of proving their allegations at a trial, and the dismissal of the complaint was error.</p>
