Seven thousand dollars monthly so long as she shall live . . ., and after her death the principal of the said estate, upon which she has been receiving the said monthly sum shall become a part of my residuary estate. (2) To establish and maintain an Asylum for the deaf, dumb or blind, to be known as the ‘Nevil Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb or Blind’ — the said net income to be allowed to accumulate until it reaches a sum sufficient, in the judgment of the . . .

The trustee, by preliminary objections, demurred on the ground such notice was not required. The Attorney General, by preliminary objections, raised the same question and also questioned the Society’s standing to present the review petition.

      <p id="b173-7" data-blocks='[["BL_173.7",173,[153,1795,1149,493]]]'> In its brief, the Society states: “If the lower court is upheld in these points, then the wishes of any testator establishing a charitable trust can be nullified by the joint action of one bank officer and one Deputy Attorney General, whose substitute plan for the testator’s estate can be whisked through the Orphans’ Court . . . without any scrutiny by any person acting on behalf of the charity . . . without notice to any other charity . . . .” Such imputation by the Society finds no justification on this record. The facts of record do not in <em>any manner </em>impugn the good faith of the trust officer, the Attorney General or the court below. Such a reckless statement will not be countenanced by this Court.</p>
