Record title thereof was in the name of Kathleen D. Hughes [Hughes], who was the nominee of John Maneely Company [Maneely], a corporation, whose real ownership was evidenced by an unrecorded deed from Miss Hughes. Actual possession, under a year-to-year lease from Miss Hughes (calling for a monthly rental of $500), was in Eddington Plumbing and Heating Supply Company [Eddington], a corporation, ninety-six or ninety-seven per cent of the shares of stock of which were ‘controlled’ by John Maneely Company”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

On Eebruary 9, 1962, this award was appealed to the Court of Com<a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>mon Pleas of Bucks County and, on November 7, 1962, following , a jury trial, a verdict was entered in. favor of the plaintiff-appellees in the sum of $49,766.72.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth then filed a motion for a new trial which was.denied on March 15, 1963, and judgment entered on' the verdict. It is from this'judgment that the instant appeal arises, an appeal which does not . contest the basic award but only the amount of detention damages for which the trial court directed a verdict. The thrust of the Commonwealth’s argument is that detention damages were forfeited from July 15, 1959, the date of the initial taking, to May 15, 1961, due to the continued occupancy and use of the premises by the former owner.</p>

As we stated in <em>Pattison, </em>supra, at page 557: “If, after the paper taking, the person continues in actual occupation of the land, receiving therefrom rents, issues and profits, it would be inequitable for him to have this <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>benefit and full compensation for delay in payment. . . . The <em>net income </em>is, nevertheless, a benefit which the person receives and it is no more than equitable that <em>its value </em>should be ascertained by the jury and deducts ed from the entire compensation for delay.” (Emphasis supplied) Thus, a condemnor may be relieved of its obligation to pay detention damages to the extent it can sustain the burden of establishing that the former owner derived value from the property after condemnation : <em>Pattison, </em>supra. In the instant case, the trial judge came to the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to submit the question of diminution of detention damages to the jury and directed a verdict for the payment of said damages from the date of the taking.</p>

The declared purpose of this Avas to show deductions made therein for rental payments. The court did not allow the returns to be introduced to the jury, indicating that they were not properly identified or explained,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> but did permit them to be included in the record for appeal purposes.

These copies came from a proper source, — the corporation . records, — were introduced, by the Commonwealth’s interrogatories, and are binding on the corpp-. ration involved. The noting of deductions on such forms would, prima facie, indicate that such rental payments. had been made. The returns should have been, admitted and further evidence developed to determine any net gain to the appellees, as a gross receipt rarely represents the profit realized on a fcransac-. tión. As noted previously, the standard which will defeat detention damages pro tanto is that of net gain.</p>
