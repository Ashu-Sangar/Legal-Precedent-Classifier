        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nCharles Negri, the appellant, after trial was found guilty by a jury of murder in the first degree. The penalty was fixed at life imprisonment. Following the denial of post trial motions and imposition of sentence, an appeal to this Court was filed.\nThe facts established by the evidence may be fairly briefed as follows:\nOn November 11, 1961, Negri and one James Lenahan escaped from Leesburg Prison Farm in New Jersey, where they were under penal confinement. They traveled to the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, rented an apartment under fictitious names and went into hiding. Shortly thereafter, they devised a plan to rob a bank in Westville, New Jersey. To help carry out . the plan, the services of others were obtained, namely, Ethel Nielsen, Yito Belfiore and Romeo Mercantini. The details were discussed and rehearsed.\nOn December 4, 1961, by prearrangement, Negri, Lenahan, Belfiore, Nielsen and Mercantini met on a parking lot behind a diner located near the bank. According to plan, Nielsen and Mercantini remained on the lot in two separate automobiles which they were to drive in the getaway. Negri and Lenahan, well armed, proceeded to the bank in a third car driven by Belfiore. They held up the bank and seized a substantial sum of money. When they arrived back at the parking lot, it was discovered that Mercantini, for some unknown reason, had disappeared. The four others in on the job then fled from the area in the Nielsen car, to the Nielsen home located only minutes away. There, the loot was counted and its division discussed. Lenahan insisted that Mercantini had run out on the gang, was a \u201cweak link\u201d and in order to prevent a double-cross should be liquidated. The defendant described the conversation in this way: \u201cAfter we counted the money in Ethel\u2019s house . . . Jimmy said to me . . . that Goo-Goo [Mercantini] was the weak link and that if I didn\u2019t kill him that he would have to, and it was easier for me because I drove around with him. Later when I spoke with Jimmy on the phone I told him that I was going to meet Goo-Goo at seven o\u2019clock and he told me to remember what I had to do. I knew what he meant, that I was supposed to kill him at seven o\u2019clock when. I met him at the apartment.\u201d\nLater in the day, Negri talked to Mercantini by phone from the Neilsen home and arranged to meet' him in the Philadelphia apartment at seven o\u2019clock in the evening. Nielsen then drove Negri to Philadelphia. When Mercantini arrived at the apartment, he demanded his promised share of the loot. Negri informed him that Lenahan was still in possession of the money and no division had been made. Negri then phoned Lenahan and arranged to meet him at a certain tavern in Philadelphia about 11:30 p.m. Negri told Mercantini to meet him around midnight on a back street nearby.\nAround midnight, Mercantini arrived at the appointed place and sat behind the wheel in his parked automobile. Negri joined him in the front seat, informed him he was not going to receive any of the bank money, and shot him twice with the gun he had used in the bank holdup. He then ran back to the tavern where Lenahan, Belfiore and Nielsen were waiting and informed Lenahan, \u201cthat thing you wanted done, is done.\u201d It was then that Negri received his share of the robbery proceeds. He immediately left the tavern, with Belfiore entered an automobile driven by Nielsen, and was taken to New York City.\nThe shots were heard by two nearby residents. The police were notified, arrived on the scene within minutes and found the dead body of Mercantini slumped in the driver\u2019s seat of his automobile.\nLater the same day, December fifth, Belfiore was taken into custody in New Jersey and detained in the Gloucester jail. That night about nine-thirty o\u2019clock, while being questioned by police officers from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden, New Jersey, he told of Negri\u2019s connection with the bank holdup, gave them sufficient facts to lead to the belief that Negri had killed Mercantini, and was registered under an assumed name at a certain hotel in New York City.\nSome of the above officers left immediately by squad car for New York City. Others were directed to return to Philadelphia, obtain a warrant, and then proceed to New York City with the warrant after word was relayed that Negri had been apprehended. When the former arrived at their destination, they immediately notified New York City police of their presence and purpose, and accompanied by some New York police officers proceeded to the hotel, arriving there about 2:55 o\u2019clock a.m. on December sixth.\nThey obtained a key from the night clerk and entered Negri\u2019s empty room. Within minutes thereafter, Negri arrived and was placed under arrest. He was stripped of his clothing, handcuffed, and his clothing searched, after which he was permitted to redon his clothing. The room was then searched and disclosed the gun, fully loaded, used in the holdup and killing, hidden in the webbing of the bottom of a chair. A substantial sum of money was also found.\nProm the hotel, he was taken to a nearby police precinct. The New York authorities filed a formal complaint charging him with possession of a gun without a license. Officers from Philadelphia arrived about 9 :30 a.m. with a warrant charging Negri with murder and with being a fugitive from justice. He was informed of the charges, questioned for about two hours, but refused to answer any questions.\nAt two o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, he was taken before a magistrate where he expressed a willingness to return to Philadelphia and face the charges. The magistrate explained the seriousness of the listed offenses and appointed counsel to confer with and assist him. After Negri conferred privately with his counsel, the latter informed the magistrate that Negri desired to return to Philadelphia. He was immediately taken before a general sessions judge in New York City, before whom he signed and acknowledged a waiver of extradition.\nAccompanied by Philadelphia officers, Negri left New York City for Philadelphia on the five o\u2019clock train. He slept or dozed during most of the trip. Just before the train arrived at the Philadelphia station, he awakened and asked one of the officers, \u201cDid Yito [Belfiore] blow the Avhistle on me?\u201d Upon being informed that this was so, he said, \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell you when we get back to city hall.\u201d\nThe party arrived at the Philadelphia detective headquarters about seven o\u2019clock in the evening. Beginning at 7:30 o\u2019clock p.m., Negri made a statement detailing his version of the facts and circumstances incident to the bank holdup and the killing. He claimed that he had no intention of killing Mercantini and the gun was accidentally discharged in a struggle over its possession. The statement was recorded on a typewriter. When it was completed about nine o\u2019clock, he read it and suggested certain changes and corrections. When these Avere made, he initialed them and signed the statement.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction is not questioned, but it is argued that trial errors and the denial of certain constitutional guarantees require the grant of a retrial. It is first urged that the defendant Avas deprived of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, when upon his arrest he was not immediately given the services of counsel, particularly, before being questioned by the police.\nThere is no legal or constitutional requirement that a defendant or one suspected of the commission of a crime be afforded counsel immediately upon his arrest, before or while he is being questioned by the police: Commonwealth v. Agoston, 364 Pa. 464, 72 A. 2d 575 (1950) ; Commonwealth v. Graham, 408 Pa. 155, 182 A. 2d 727 (1962) ; Commonwealth v. Senk, 412 Pa. 184, 194 A. 2d 221 (1963); Commonwealth ex rel. Maisenhelder v. Rundle, 414 Pa. 11, 198 A. 2d 565 (1964); Begalke v. United States, 286 P. 2d 606 (1960); Cicenia v. LaGay, 357 U.S. 504, 78 S. Ct. 1297 (1958); Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S. Ct. 1287 (1958).\nThe cases of Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55 (1932); Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U.S. 52, 82 S. Ct. 157 (1961); and White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S. Ct. 1050 (1963), cited in support of appellant\u2019s argument in this respect, are inapposite and do not apply.\nThe only function counsel could provide at such a time would be to instruct his client to keep his mouth shut. If due process requires that the state provide a person with counsel from the very moment of arrest, then the next logical step is to prohibit the police from ever questioning individuals suspected of or charged with crime. Such a rule would be unsound, unrealistic and in complete disregard of the rights of all citizens to be protected from crime and criminals. Due process rightly requires the protection of those accused of crime from any unfair advantage. This Court has great respect for the constitutional rights of an individual, and has always exacted fair and proper conduct which respects constitutional safeguards of individuals charged with crime. By the same token, we do not think that any coddling is required or unreasonable road blocks should be placed in the path of public officials to help criminals escape detection and prosecution.\nThe validity of the confession on the basis of involuntariness is not here questioned. Moreover, a reading of the record leads to the inescapable conclusion that the statements of the appellant were willingly given. However, coercion is asserted on the sole basis that counsel, although requested, was denied before the interrogation. That such a request was made is categorically denied by the police officers. In view of the verdict, the Commonwealth must be given the benefit of all favorable testimony: Commonwealth v. Gockley, 411 Pa. 437, 192 A. 2d 693 (1963). In addition, the defendant was given counsel in New York City and permitted to ask his advice without restrictions. His trial testimony that he requested counsel before int\u00e9rr rogation in Philadelphia lacks credence. But assuming this is true, it would not in itself invalidate the confession, nor constitute coercion: Crooker v. California, supra.\nAppellant next argues that the confession should not have been admitted in evidence because before the interrogation he was not advised of his constitutional right to remain silent and also was not advised that his statements could and would be used against him. \u25a0\nThis objection was not voiced at trial. The introduction of the statement was not objected to on this ground. The only objection entered was to that portion of the statement that detailed his involvement in other crimes. Where the reason upon which an objection is based is specifically stated, as was done in this case, all other reasons for exclusion are waived: Commonwealth v. Raymond, 412 Pa. 194, 194 A. 2d 150 (1963). Nor does the record indicate that this question was raised post trial in the court below. Under our long established rules of procedure, appellant is precluded from raising the question for the first time on appeal: Mantz v. Rufft, 403 Pa. 436, 170 A. 2d 101 (1961).\nAdditionally, appellant\u2019s past history clearly indicates that he is not one totally ignorant of his legal rights. His refusal to answer questions while in custody in New York is strong evidence of his awareness of his right to remain silent. Nevertheless, the admonitions under discussion are advisable and important considerations in determining if prejudicial statements are the free choice of the maker. However, this question is not here raised. That his statements were given voluntarily is not questioned. Under such circumstances, the neglect of police officials in failing to admonish an accused before listening to his version of the occurrence does not render his statements inadmissible: See, Commonwealth v. Charles Hosler, 4 Pa. 264 (1846); Commonwealth v. Cavalier, 284 Pa. 311, 131 A. 229 (1925); Commonwealth v. Dilsworth, 289 Pa. 498, 137 A. 683 (1927); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 372 Pa. 266, 93 A. 2d 691 (1953). See also, Commonwealth v. Bryant, 367 Pa. 135, 79 A. 2d 193 (1951), and Commonwealth v. Ballem, 386 Pa. 20, 123 A. 2d 728 (1956).\nAppellant next questions the validity of the arrest and search of his hotel room, both of which transpired without a warrant. It is urged that they were without authority in law and any evidence obtained as a result thereof should have been excluded.\nNo pretrial motion to suppress this evidence was filed as required by the rules of the Philadelphia courts. Moreover, the law is established beyond argument that a search which is incident to a lawful arrest is valid and reasonable even though conducted without the prior issuance of a search warrant: Commonwealth v. Gockley, supra; Commonwealth v. Cockfield, 411 Pa. 71, 190 A. 2d 898 (1963); Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 80 S. Ct. 683 (1960); Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U.S. 381, 81 S. Ct. 632 (1961) ; Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S. Ct. 1623 (1963). The practicability of first having obtained a search warrant is not controlling where the search is justified as incident to an arrest: United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S. Ct. 430 (1950), and Ker v. California, supra. \u201cThe lawfulness of the arrest without warrant, in turn, must be based upon probable cause, which exists \u2018where \u201cthe facts and circumstances within their [officer\u2019s] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d an offense has been or is being committed.\u2019 Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175-176 (1949), quoting from Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925) :\u201d Ker v. California, supra, at 34, 35. Clearly, the information given the police by Belfiore, a co-conspirator in the bank holdup, who was present when Lenahan insisted upon the victim\u2019s liquidation, and also present when Negri returned from the killing and informed Lenahan that the matter had been taken care of, furnished ample grounds and was sufficiently trustworthy to form reasonable belief and probable cause. Important factors to be considered in determining the practicability of the officers first having obtained a warrant are: the time of night of the arrest, and the need for haste to capture a dangerous felon who was already in the process of flight.\nIt is next insisted that the lawfulness of the appellant\u2019s arrest, even if based on probable cause, was vitiated by the mode of entry. It is submitted that the lawfulness of the arrest must be determined in reference to the law of New York State, and under \u00a7178 of its criminal code, an officer must announce his office and purpose before entry through breaking in. First, it is apparent that any such announcement would have been a futile gesture since the room was empty when the officers arrived. Again, assuming that the officers\u2019 entry, by use of a key obtained from the hotel clerk, is the legal equivalent of a \u201cbreaking in,\u201d it has been recognized from the early common law that a \u201cbreaking in\u201d without prior announcement is permissible in executing an arrest under certain circumstances. See, 4 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7\u00a71624, 1625 (1957), and Ker v. California, supra. Here justification for the officers\u2019 mode of entry was emphatically present. Involved was a well-armed fleeing felon whom the officers had every right to believe would not be taken without a fight. That they were in serious peril cannot be questioned. The danger would be increased had entrance been demanded or purpose announced. A decision had to be made quickly on the basis of the facts then before them. Under such circumstances, the method of entry was not unreasonable when viewed either under state law or constitutional standards.\nThe legality of the arrest is also questioned because it is asserted that the arresting police officers failed to announce at the time of taking the defendant into custody the precise charges for which he was being arrested. Again, this question was not specifically raised in the court below and is here presented for the first time on appeal. As noted before, we do not consider questions not raised below. However, the following should be pointed out. There is no doubt that the defendant knew when he was taken into custody that the men involved were police officers. In fact, in his testimony at trial, he mentioned previously knowing one of the individuals as a police officer in New Jersey. Under Pennsylvania law, when it is reasonably apparent that the defendant at the time of the arrest knows that the arresting officers are police officials, the validity thereof is not destroyed merely because the defendant is not informed of the officers\u2019 intention to make an arrest, or the cause thereof. See, 1 Var\u00f3n, Searches, Seizures and Immunities, page 76; Shovlin v. Commonwealth, 106 Pa. 369 (1884) ; Commonwealth v. Long, 17 Pa. Superior Ct. 641 (1901). As stated in Long at 647: \u201cThe necessity for giving notice to the fleeing felon, and the character of the notice, depends entirely upon the special facts attending the arrest. While in most cases it may be prudent for the officer to give the notice before making the arrest, it is going too far to say in effect that he is required to do so: Shovlin v. Commonwealth, 106 Pa. 369. A warning or notice of arrest might, in some cases, be imperatively required, in others it would be of no avail, and not necessary in order to protect the officer or the private person who immediately pursues a known felon.\u201d Flight not only consists in the act of leaving the jurisdiction, it also includes continued concealment to avoid arrest and prosecution: Commonwealth v. Fusci, 153 Pa. Superior Ct. 617, 35 A. 2d 93 (1943) ; Com. v. Myers, 131 Pa. Superior Ct. 258, 200 A. 143 (1938).\nWe recognize that since the arrest was made in New York the law of that state controls in evaluating the legality of the arrest.\nAppellant contends that, under \u00a7180 of the New York Criminal Code, notice of the authority of the officer and cause of the arrest are mandatory where a warrant is absent. While this is the general rule, there is some doubt that failure to obey the command of \u00a7180 voids an arrest to the extent of making seized evidence inadmissible. See, Squadrito v. Griebsch, 1 N.Y. 2d 471, 154 N.Y.S. 2d 37, 136 N.E. 2d 504 (1956). Further, \u00a7180 specifically states that notice is not mandatory where an arrest (without warrant) is made in pursuit of an escaped felon. Also, it has been ruled that if an accused is effectively informed of the cause of the arrest within a reasonable time thereafter, or if the attending circumstances manifestly suggest that the accused knows why he is taken into custody, the failure to give explicit notice at the time does not void the arrest. See, People v. Coffey, 12 N.Y. 2d 443, 240 N.Y.S. 2d 721, 191 N.E. 2d 263 (1963), and People v. Coffey, 36 Misc. 2d 67, 232 N.Y.S. 2d 545 (1962). In determining if the accused had sufficient notice or knowledge of the cause of his capture and arrest, \u201cthe whole picture\u201d must be considered. See cases cited above. In the present case, one would necessarily be quite naive to conclude that the defendant lacked knowledge of why he was taken into custody.\nComplaint is also made that several officers were in the hotel room when the arrest was made. Also that the defendant was handcuffed and stripped while his clothing was searched. This position certainly fails to face the facts. The police officers were not dealing with a boy scout or one who might be involved in crime due to unfortunate circumstances. As noted before, they were seeking to apprehend, without dire consequences, a seasoned and potentially highly dangerous criminal. Under the circumstances, the cautionary conduct employed was reasonable and dictated by plain common sense: Commonwealth v. Duerr, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 484, 45 A. 2d 235 (1946).\nLastly, it is argued that the trial court erred in permitting rebuttal, showing the prior criminal record (in the form of official records) of the defendant before the jury had deliberated and reached a verdict as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. This evidence of prior convictions of the defendant for breaking and entering, receiving stolen goods and bank robbery was offered and admitted solely for the purpose of impeachment. This was perfectly proper after the defendant had taken the stand in his own defense: Commonwealth v. Butler, 405 Pa. 36, 173 A. 2d 468 (1961) ; Commonwealth v. Snyder, 408 Pa. 253, 182 A. 2d 495 (1962).\nAfter a very careful examination of the record, we .are convinced that the assignments of error are devoid of merit and that the court below correctly dismissed the motion for a new trial. The defendant received a fair trial. The trial judge carefully protected his rights at all times and defined the issues for decision by the jury in a thorough and impartial manner. The evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the verdict. The ability and dedication of defendant\u2019s counsel, undoubtedly, saved him from the imposition of a more .severe penalty.\nJudgment affirmed.\nOne bullet entered the right side of the neck below the ear. The second entered the body below the right shoulder, went through vital organs and exited through the front of the body. Either-wound would have caused instantaneous death.\nThis is in conformity with the New York State standards authorizing an arrest when a felony has in fact been committed, and the arresting officer has reasonable cause for believing that the person to be arrested has committed it.
