        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn the front side of a commercial, printed will form, decedent, Clara Edna Miller, in her own handwriting, directed the payment of her debts and made several charitable bequests which apparently disposed of her entire estate. On the reverse side, an executor was appointed. Following these provisions, the will form contained a blank line for the signature of testatrix and the word \u201c(Seal).\u201d Clara Edna Miller did not write her signature on this line. Immediately below it, in the printed attestation clause, she signed her name and completed the form as follows:\n\u201cSigned, sealed, published and declared by the above named Clara Edna Miller as and for my1 last Will and Testament, in the presence of us, who have \u2022hereunto subscribed our names at-request as witnesses thereto in the presence of the said Testat\u2014 and of each other.\n(s) Harry W. Akins\n(s) Mary M. Akins\u201d\nDecedent died on September 17, 1962, and this writing was admitted to probate by the Register of Wills of Indiana County. Wilma Power, an intestate heir, appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Indiana County on the ground that decedent did not sign the instrument at the end thereof. The University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary of the United Presbyterian Church, beneficiaries under the writing, filed answers to the petition sur appeal.\nThe court below held: \u201cIt is the opinion of this Court . . . that this signature is written at the end of the will and that the document itself so indicates; that Clara Edna Miller meant it to be her signature and therefore we conclude that the Register of Wills acted properly when he admitted this document to probate.\u201d This appeal followed.\nSection 2 of the Wills Act of 1947, April 24, P. L. 89, 20 P.S. \u00a7180.2, mandates: \u201cEvery will . . . shall be in writing and shall be signed by the testator at the end thereof . . . .\u201d Recently, in Kretz Estate, 410 Pa. 590, 189 A. 2d 239 (1963), we again had occasion to construe this provision of the Act. \u201cThe end contemplated by the Act is not the point which is physically furthest from the beginning of the writing. As we said in Kehr Will, 373 Pa. 473, 479, 95 A. 2d 647 (1953) : \u2018 \u201cThe end contemplated by the statute is the logical end of the language used by decedent in expressing his testamentary purpose,\u201d \u2019 or, as was said in Coyne Will, 349 Pa. 331, 333, 37 A. 2d 509 (1944) : \u2018 \u201c. . . there must be a sequence of pages or paragraphs which relates to its logical and internal sense, and the signature must be placed at the sequential end.\u201d \u2019 \u201d: Kretz Estate, supra, at 595, 189 A. 2d at 242.\nBy these standards, the failure of decedent to sign her name on the line provided in the printed form does not, of itself, constitute a failure to comply with the requirements of the Act.\nAppellant relies upon Churchill's Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 Atl. 533 (1918). In that case, as here, the testator failed to sign on the printed line provided in the commercial form. Testator wrote his own name in the attestation clause and completed the blanks as follows :\n\u201cSigned, sealed, published, and declared by the above named P. Churchill, as and for his last Will and Testament, in the presence of us, who have hereunto subscribed our names at his request as witnesses thereto in the presence of said Testate and of each other.\n(s) J. D. Spieher\n(s) John Rankin\u201d\nThis Court concluded that P. Churchill was merely-acting as his own scrivener and did not intend the writing of his name as his testamentary signature. P. Churchill\u2019s reference to himself in the third person, \u201chis,\u201d lends added emphasis to that conclusion.\nA problem somewhat similar to that posed by the present case was before this Court only recently in Glace Will, 413 Pa. 91, 196 A. 2d 297 (1964). There, the testator wrote his own name in the testimonium clause of a printed form, but the signature which followed on the line provided for testator\u2019s signature was that of the alderman who had prepared the document. Unlike the case at bar, in that attestation clause, George Glace\u2019s name was written by this same alderman-scrivener, not by George Glace.\nThis Court held that \u201cChurchill\u2019s Estate is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument,\u201d and that, as in Churchill, no testamentary signature of the testator appeared at the end of the writing. However, Churchill is factually distinguished from the instant ease by Clara Edna Miller\u2019s use of the word \u201cmy\u201d in the attestation clause rather than the word \u201chis\u201d used in Churchill. Therefore, Churchill does not control our disposition here. Moreover, in Glace, we held that there was nothing to indicate that the inserted signature was to serve as more than mere identification.\nHere, decedent, in her own handwriting and words, recorded her testamentary desires and directions and then concluded the writing with her signature. The end contemplated by the Wills Act is not the point physically furthest from the beginning of the writing, Kretz Estate, supra, nor is it the particular point selected by the printer of the form. Rather, it is the place selected by the testator as the logical and sequential end of his dispositive act and at which he writes his testamentary signature. Examination of the entire instrument satisfies us that Clara Edna Miller\u2019s name in her own handwriting appears at the textual and factual end of her writing. The remaining inquiry is: Did she intend this as her testamentary signature or was she merely inserting her name for purposes of identification? On this record, we hold that the instrument, on its face, reveals that decedent did intend to affix and did affix her signature at the end of her testamentary disposition when she wrote her name into the attestation clause. Here, her use of the pronoun \u201cmy\u201d manifested a present intention that her signature serve as her testamentary signature to the document she obviously regarded as her last will and testament.\nDecree affirmed. Costs on the estate.\nIn Clara Edna Miller\u2019s handwriting.\n\u201cThe subscribing witnesses testified before the Register of -WiUs at the time the instrument was offered for probate to the fact they saw the testatrix sign her will and that they witnessed her signature in the presence of each other as well as in the presence of the testatrix.\u201d (From the opinion of the court below.)\nAppellant also cites Friese\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 241, 9 A. 2d 401 (1939). However, that ease is inapplicable. The case involved an appeal from audit of the administrator\u2019s account, not from an earlier decree which had denied probate. No appeal was ever taken from that decree.\nIn the instant case, everything inserted in the printed form, with the exception of the signatures of the witnesses, was in.the handwriting of Clara Edna Miller.",

There then followed the printed words \u201cto be Execut of this my last Will and Testament\u201d, in which decedent added the letters \u201cor\u201d after the word \u201cExecut\u201d.\nThis is followed by blank spaces, printed language and writings hereinbelow shown:\net___\nIn Witness Whereof, I, -, the Testat above named, have hereunto subscribed my name and affixed my seal, the-day of-in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred- - (Seal)\nSigned, sealed, published and declared by the above named Clara Edna Miller as and for my* last Will and Testament, in the presence of ns, who have hereunto subscribed our names at-request as witnesses thereto in the presence of the said Testat\u2014 and of each other.\nHarry W. Akins*\nMary M. Akins*\u201d\nThe majority declare that this will was signed by testatrix at the end thereof as required by Section 2 of the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, 20 PS \u00a7180.2. Section 2 mandates: \u201cEvery will . . . shall be in writing and shall be signed by the testator at the end thereof . . . .\u201d\nWe had thought (1) that this language was clear beyond even the peradventure of a doubt, and (2) that the decided cases had made this missile-proof, and (3) that nothing short of an Act of the Legislature could change it. Apparently we were mistaken, since the majority, under the guise of carrying out the testatrix\u2019s imagined or apparent intention, (a) has obliterated or made meaningless Section 2 of the Wills Act and, under the guise of a distinction where no difference exists, (b) has overruled Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533, and Glace Will, 413 Pa. 91, 196 A. 2d 297, and (c) repudiated the test of what constitutes \u201cthe end of a will\u201d as iterated and reiterated in many prior decisions of this Court which rule and unquestionably control this case.\nWe shall first note the striking similarity of language in the Churchill, Glace and Miller wills and then review the pertinent language of prior decisions which lay down the pertinent law.\nIn Glace Will, 413 Pa., supra, all the arguments here made were there vigorously made and were rejected by this Court. In Glace Will, tbe alleged will was written on a printed legal form of one sheet witb blank spaces exactly as was tbe Miller printed form. Tbe handwritten parts were all written in by an aider-man witb tbe exception of tbe signature of the decedent, \u201cGeorge Glace\u201d. George Glace wrote his own name on tbe front page after tbe word \u201cI,\u201d and again in the testimonium clause after the words \u201cIn Witness Whereof, I\u201d. George Glace, in tbe aforesaid printed instrument, left directions for payment of bis just debts and funeral expenses, and then disposed of bis residuary estate, dividing it between his daughter and bis lady friend whom be made one of bis executrices. There then followed this clause:\n\u201cIn Witness Whereof, I, George Glace [in bis own handwriting] . . . have to this, my will, written on one sheet of paper, set my band and seal, this 23rd day of June A.D., One Thousand, Nine Hundred and 1962.\n\u201cChas. E. Wray\n\u201cAlderman.\u201d\nThis Court reversed tbe lower Court and held that tbe Glace will was not signed at tbe end thereof. Tbe Court, after quoting Section 2 of tbe Wills Act, pertinently said (pages 94-97) :\n\u201cTbe language of tbe Statute could not be clearer; to constitute a valid will, tbe writing must be signed by the testator at the end thereof \u2014 any exceptions, modifications or \u2018ifs ands or buts\u2019 would not only erode but would soon make tbe statutory requirement meaningless.\n\u201cGlace\u2019s lady friend, Lillian F. Harvey, appeals, contending that (1) tbe writing was signed at tbe end because Glace\u2019s signature followed tbe dispositive clause, and (2) Glace\u2019s testamentary intention which is tbe pole star in tbe construction of every will, would be defeated if tbe instrument was not accepted as a valid will.\n\u201cThe law is well settled as to what is meant by the end of a will. In Kretz Estate, 410 Pa. 590, 189 A. 2d 239, the Court said: \u2018Since the adoption by the Legislature of the statutory requirement that a will be signed \u201cat the end thereof,\u201d \u201cThis Court has consistently resisted attempts to weaken or modify the rule. . . . Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice) said in Maginn\u2019s Estate, 278 Pa. 89, 91, 122 A. 264: \u2018In interpreting the legislature\u2019s thought, courts have rigidly opposed any exception tending to weaken the basic principle underlying the law, the chief purpose of which is to see that the testator\u2019s wishes are observed. It is possible, in some cases, a \u201cdecedent may have thought he had made a will, but the statute says he had not. The question is not one of his thought in that respect, but what he actually did, or . . . failed to do . . . : Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 440, 55 A. 2d 263, 267 (1947). As early as Wineland\u2019s Appeal, 118 Pa. 37, 41, 12 Atl. 301, 302 (1888), Mr. Justice Paxson rather appropriately remarked: \u201cIt says a will must be signed at the end thereof, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d The end contemplated by the Act is not the point which is physically furthest from the beginning of the writing. As we said in Kehr Will, 373 Pa. 473, 479, 95 A. 2d 647 (1953) : \u201c \u2018The end contemplated by the statute is the logical end of the language used by decedent in expressing his testamentary purpose,\u2019 \u201d or, as was said in Coyne Will, 349 Pa. 331, 333, 37 A. 2d 509 (1944) : \u201c \u2018. . . and the signature must be placed at the sequential end.\u2019 \u201d See, also, Baldwin Will, 357 Pa., supra.\u2019\n\u201c. . . Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533, controlled this case. . . . Churchill\u2019s Estate is factually on all fours with the Glace instrument; [and with the Miller alleged will;] indeed it is stronger for probate than the instant one. In Churchill\u2019s Estate, the alleged will was written \u2014 as was Glace\u2019s [and Miller\u2019s] \u2014by filling in blank spaces on a printed form. Churchill wrote Ms name in three blank spaces in the printed paper, first at the top, then in the testimonium clause, and then in the attestation clause. He did not sign his name at the end of the paper. The Court said, \u2018It is apparent that in writing his name in the three blank spaces in the form, decedent did not intend his name as a signature. A writing in of a name, in those circumstances, was not a signature and did not constitute an execution of a Will in conformity with the Wills Act. The place chosen by this decedent to affix his signature was at the point where the appointment of his executors was consummated\u2019. Churchill\u2019s Estate, we repeat, governs the instant case. Our conclusion is further supported by Griffith Will, 358 Pa. 474, 483, 57 A. 2d 893, and Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 436, 55 A. 2d 263, each of which reaffirmed Churchill\u2019s Estate.\n\u201cAppellant contends that we should consider and be governed by the intention of the testator in our determination of this matter. Applicable is the succinct maxim, \u2018Hard cases make bad law\u2019; .... Coyne Will, 349 Pa., supra, well answers appellant\u2019s plea (page 334) :\n\u201c \u2018It is perhaps unfortunate that decedent\u2019s testamentary intentions are frustrated. The strictness with which this section of the Wills Act must be enforced is a matter of legislative mandate. As we said in Brown Estate, supra [347 Pa.] (p. 246) : \u201cThe Wills Act requires signing at the end. The purpose of the Act was to remove all possibility of fraud .... Even if the testamentary intention of this particular testatrix is frustrated, it is much wiser to refrain from weakening the sound and well established mandate of the legislature. Were we to do so, we might in future cases facilitate fraudulent or unauthorized alterations or additions to wills.\u201d \u2019\n\u201cThe question in this case as to whether decedent signed the writing at the end thereof is not one of de cedent\u2019s intention but of what decedent actually did or failed to do.\u201d\nThe majority opinion admits, as it must, that Clara Edna Miller\u2019s name appears at the \u201ctextual and factual end of her writing.\u201d Nothing could be more inaccurate! Her signature is concededly not at the physical end; it is not at the logical end in the light of its internal sense; and most important of all, it is not at the sequential end; on the contrary, it appears in the middle of \u2014 not even at the end of the attestation clause. In the light of the crystal clear Section 2 of the Wills Act, and of the hereinabove cited and quoted decisions of this Court, it is impossible for me to understand how anyone could hold or even imagine that decedent had signed her name at the logical and sequential end of her (alleged) will.\nI very vigorously dissent.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien joins in this Dissenting Opinion.\n\u201cClara Edna Miller\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d are in the handwriting of decedent; \u201cHarry W. Akins\u201d and \u201cMary M. Akins\u201d are in their respective handwriting.\nItalics throughout, ours.",
