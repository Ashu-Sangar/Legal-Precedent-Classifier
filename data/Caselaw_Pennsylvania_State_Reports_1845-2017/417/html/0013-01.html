L. 342, No. 70, §1, 12 P.S. §1032, cited by the court below as authority for its action has no application. That statute merely preserves the power of the court for a period of thirty days to alter an order or judgment previously entered, notwithstanding the fact that the term of the court has expired in the meantime. It applies only to those instances wherein the court still has jurisdiction of the cause. In the present case, the court below lost all jurisdiction upon perfection of the appeal. The second order entered by the court below granting a new trial and reversing its previous order entering the arrest of judgment is, therefore, vacated.</p>

In passing upon such a motion, the sufficiency of the evidence must be evaluated upon the <em>entire trial record. </em>All of the evidence must be read in the light most favorable to. the Commonwealth and it is entitled to all reasonable inferences arising therefrom. The effect of such a motion is to admit all the facts which the Commonwealth’s evidence tends to prove. See, <em>Commonwealth v.

Also, in passing upon such a motion, all evidence actually received must be considered, whether the trial rulings thereon were, right or wrong. Cf. <em>Rosche v.

Reading the <em>entire </em>testimony in the present case in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it is unquestionably sufficient to sustain' the guilty verdict.
