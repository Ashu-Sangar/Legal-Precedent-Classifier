At the so-called “Boggs Stop” of the Railways— a usual stopping place for its street cars — Pedretti alighted from the street car. At that stop, — located upon the Railways’ private right-of-way- — -,there are two separate platforms, one of which is located along the outbound track and the other along the inbound track. Both platforms are connected by an asphalt crossing owned by the Railways, which crossing serves as a means of egress by way of leading to nearby Sylvania Avenue.</p>
