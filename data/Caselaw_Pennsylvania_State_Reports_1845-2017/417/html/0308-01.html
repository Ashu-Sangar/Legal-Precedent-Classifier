He made a confession at or about 11:00 a.m. of the next day.

In view of the minimum sentence fixed by the jury, no fundamental error could have resulted, even assuming both the truth of the allegations and the basic nature of such a claim.

Nor was evidence offered at trial by petitioner, or argument made, which suggested to the court that the voluntariness of the confession was being challenged.

The lower court stated: “The Relator does not expressly complain that he did not have counsel immediately after his arrest and prior to his confession, but in the interest of thoroughness of consideration this issue should be discussed. The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States does not require that a person suspected of having committed a crime be afforded counsel immediately after his arrest or before being questioned by the police: Commonwealth v.

      <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Negri, supra, was decided without benefit of <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a> (1964), where it was held that when the law enforcement process shifts from investigatory to accusatory and its purpose is to elicit a confession then the right to counsel arises. Petitioner makes allegations which, if true, would make the time when he confessed an accusatory stage. His confession was admitted in evidence at his trial so that there is no doubt about the confession stage being a “critical” one in the proceedings against petitioner. While this Court has held that <em>Escobedo </em>is limited to its precise facts and, therefore, no counsel need be afforded when none is requested, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Linde v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/416/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="416 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1892954" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0331-01">416 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20288" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="206 A.2d 288">206 A. 2d 288</a> (1965), I cannot agree with such a limitation on the right to counsel and such a narrow view of <em>Escobedo.</em>
