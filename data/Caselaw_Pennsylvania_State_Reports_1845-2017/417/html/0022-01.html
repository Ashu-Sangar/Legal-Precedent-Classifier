The basis for the county’s complaint is that it did not have an adequate remedy at law and that if the Milk Control Commission’s official general order were permitted to <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>go into effect as scheduled, immediate and irreparable harm would result.</p>

The main thrust of the complaint is that the manner in which the hearings were conducted denied the plaintiff the fundamental right of due process and equal protection of laws as guaranteed by the Constitutions of Pennsylvania and the United States for the reason that all interested persons were not given reasonable opportunity to be heard and, more specifically, the plaintiff was denied the right to conduct proper and intelligent cross-examination relative to an exhibit of relevant and vital importance to the issue under consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The plaintiff filed its complaint on July 28, 1964. The court made the following order: “And Now, to wit, at a conference duly held in Chambers this 30th day of July, 1964, upon due consideration of the matters set forth in the Bill in Equity filed in this case, the Court is unanimously of the opinion that the plaintiff in this case has an adequate remedy at law, and therefore, denies the prayer of the Complaint.”</p>
