Three of these physicians were of the view that he knew right from wrong. A fourth physician, the only psychiatrist, expressed the opinion that petitioner was not normal when born, that he suffered from organic deterioration of his faculties, and that he possessed the capacity of an eight year old child and less responsibility than such a child. The psychiatrist further concluded that while petitioner knew what other people said was right or wrong, he had no self feeling of what was right or wrong.</p>

The defendant’s act in killing his wife under such circumstances certainly substantiates the medical and psychiatric evidence before us. Mentally retarded and immature, an individual of constitutional psychopathic state and emotionally unstable, <em>with no understanding of the difference between right and wrong within </em>himself, choosing to rid himself of annoyance, real or imaginary, by killing his tormentor, <em>where a normal individual with the power of reason </em>would have found the reasonable solution to his problems.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Following a determination by the resident physician that petitioner was of unsound mind and unfit for penal discipline, the warden forwarded to the court an application for the appointment of a “commission in lunacy”. Shortly thereafter, the commission was appointed by the court and a commission report followed five days later.</p>

Its report found: “He was directed by a voice to kill his wife. ‘Something came into my mind.’ Prior to the act the patient was hunting in the house for someone hiding in house. Today [he] has visual hallucination — seeing members of his family.” The commission determined petitioner to be insane and of criminal tendency. On the same day the report was filed with the court (January 8, 1953), the court ordered petitioner committed to Farview State Hospital, a mental institution. He was admitted on January 13, 1953, and remained until September 9, 1958, at which time he escaped.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He contends that at the time of sentencing he was insane and that, therefore, the imposition of sentence was invalid. He urges that he was not able to assist his counsel at any stage of the proceedings because he was mentally ill, and, therefore, he was “forced” to plead guilty. Finally, he attacks the validity of his confession because it was procured while he was insane. Petitioner makes the additional contention that he was insane when he killed his wife and that, accordingly, he should not have been convicted.</p>
