On January 24, 1958, Salopek was regularly appointed by the borough council as chief of police of the Borough and, until January 1, 1962, did perform the duties of the chief of police of the Borough’s five man police force. Beginning January 1, 1962, Fred B. Alberts (Alberts), the mayor of the Borough, assigned Salopek to a patrolman’s duties, and, during January, February and March 1962, he was assigned to a beat which required him to walk from midnight to 8:00 a.m. in a sparsely settled rural area and from April 1962 until the date of hearing in the court below Salopek was assigned to patrol duty by motor vehicle from 4 p.m. to midnight. On January 15, 1962, the borough council appointed Salopek to perform, in addition to his duties as chief of police, the duties of street commissioner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Despite such ordinance Alberts continued to assign Salopek to duties consistent with those of a patrolman and not of a chief of police.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[160,1045,1151,531]]]'>Salopek instituted this mandamus action against Alberts in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. After a hearing, the court below entered an order directing Alberts (1) to cease and desist from suspending Salopek because of Salopelds refusal “to act as a patrolman”, or “to regularly work in a manner which deprives him of his administrative and supervisory role as chief of police” and (2) to assign Salopek to duties defined for the chief of police by borough ordinance.

(2) whether the borough council, by ordinance, can control the scheduling of working hours of the chief of police by the mayor? (3) was the mayor warranted in suspending the chief of police who had refused to work a midnight shift and who insisted <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>upon a daylight shift to correspond with his daylight shift as street commissioner? (4) whether the order of the court below should be reversed and a new trial granted because the trial judge in his adjudication departed from the record to castigate the mayor? Alberts’ first three questions, involving the same basic problem of borough police administration and control, will be disposed of as a unit.</p>

Salopek’s refusal to accept such directions constituted the ground which, in the eyes of the mayor, justified his suspension. Alberts’ contention fails to take into account that the legislature has empowered the council, not the mayor, to establish a police department creating various ranks of police officers and such authority necessarily carries with it the right to designate the “duties” to be performed by police officers of the several ranks. Council, acting under such authority, did, by the ordinance of December 17, 1962, create the various ranks and specifically set forth the <em>duties </em>assigned to the various ranks of officers. The legislature foresaw the likelihood of boroughs throughout the Commonwealth taking such action and provided that, in the event of the establishment of a police department, “the burgess [now mayor] shall continue to direct the <em>manner </em>in which the persons assigned to the office shall perform their duties.” (53 P.S. §46125).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

What Alberts did was to direct Salopek to perform the council-prescribed <em>duties </em>of a patrolman and not those of the chief of police; in so <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>doing, Alberts exceeded his authority and Salopek was justified in refusing to perform the <em>duties </em>of a rank to which he was not assigned. Were it otherwise, the mayor could direct a council-appointed patrolman to perform the duties of the chief of police and relegate the latter to the duties of the former, thus negating the councilmanic right to appoint a chief of police and patrolman. Alberts not only exceeded his authority under the law but this record reveals his actions were arbitrary and unreasonable. The duties to be performed by the several ranks of police officers are within the prerogative of the council to designate; the <em>manner </em>in which the <em>designated duties </em>are to be performed is the prerogative of the mayor.</p>
    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.4",635,[149,1149,1151,685]]]'>Moreover, the Borough Code (53 P.S.§46028) provides that: “It shall be the duty of the burgess [may- or] : I ...; to enforce the ordinances and regulations [of the borough].” After the passage of the ordinance of December 17, 1962, the legality <em>of which is not and cannot now be </em>questioned,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> it became Alberts’ duty to enforce this, as well as any other ordinance of the borough. Alberts’ refusal, evidenced by his conduct, to recognize the duties assigned to Salopek as chief of police by the council in this ordination constituted a dereliction in the performance of his official duties and furnishes additional reason for the issuance of mandamus.</p>
