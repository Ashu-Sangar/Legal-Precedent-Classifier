    <blockquote id="b445-7" data-blocks='[["BL_445.10",445,[113,1071,1156,1076]]]'>“Van Cor, Inc. [Van Cor], is successor to Daniel B. Van Campen Corporation, which contracted to perform the general construction work in the erection of a junior high school building for Marple-Newtown Joint School Authority. The authority awarded a separate contract to M. Zucker Co. [Zucker] for the electrical construction. . . . American Casualty Company of Beading, Pennsylvania [Casualty Company], was surety for [Zucker] in two bonds issued to the authority, one a ‘performance bond’ and the other a ‘labor and materialmen’s bond.’ [Zucker] encountered difficulty in the performance of its contract, and eventually went into bankruptcy and was declared in default. The uncompleted portion of the electrical work was performed by another contractor under contract with the authority, and the added expense to which the authority was thereby put over and above the original contract price for the electrical work was paid to the authority by [the Casualty Company] pursuant to the terms of its performance bond.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[205,646,1150,903]]]'>“There is no dispute of the fact that [Zucker] was in default or of the fact that the delay in completion of [Van Cor’s] contract, and the resultant loss to [Van Cor], were, in part at least, caused by [Zucker’s] faulty performance. Nor is it seriously disputed that [Van Cor] furnished to [Zucker] the labor and material forming the basis of [Van Cor’s] claim under the labor and materialmen’s bond. [The Casualty Company’s] position is, in respect of the first claim, that [its] undertaking in the performance bond does not render it answerable to other contractors for delays caused by its principal but runs only to the benefit of the school authority, the obligee; and, in respect of the second claim, that the suit is barred by the running of the one-year limitation contained in the bond and in the applicable statute, to which later reference will be made. . . .</blockquote>

I have never before heard it asserted that the surety in a performance bond is itself obligated to perform the contract of its principal. It may, of course, do so; but unless such a provision is contained in the bond the surety is not required to carry out the contract. . . .

[Yan Cor] contends, and quite rightly, that the terms of the contract and specifications between the authority and [Zueker] became part of the bond issued by the surety. [Van Cor] contends further that paragraph 20 of the general conditions spells out the cooperation which [Zueker] was required to give to other contractors on the project; that by that paragraph other contractors, including [Van Cor], became donee beneficiaries of the contract between the authority and [Zueker]; that [the Casualty Company], having assumed the obligation to answer to the authority for its principal’s default, became liable to [Yan Cor] for [Zucker’s] failure to carry on its work with the required measure of cooperation.</blockquote>
