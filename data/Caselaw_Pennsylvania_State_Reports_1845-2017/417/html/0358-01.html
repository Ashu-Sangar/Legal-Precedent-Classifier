This Court has exercised particular vigilance to see that, on both direct and collateral review, claims of federal, as well as state, constitutional rights are comprehensively and justly entertained and decided by our state courts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Federal rights concern us as much as any other rights which we are charged to enforce. This practice has frequently been maintained even where established post-trial procedures may have been negligently or inadvertently ignored. Indeed, the practice has been followed even where there has been some possibility of a conscious choice to forgo the usual direct review provided, but where the record nevertheless does not clearly support a finding of intelligent, understanding waiver of orderly review procedures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> We have no intention of departing from our purpose of solicitously insuring that rights constitutionally conferred are not unduly forfeited.

Justice can best be accomplished in an orderly framework, and when a defendant deliberately by-passes the adequate means provided for review of alleged errors he cannot insist that the state must now, at his discretion, provide an additional opportunity for review of his once abandoned contentions. There is every reason to hold such a defendant to his waiver instead of permitting him to reopen the case at whatever time the defendant chooses, at a juncture when witnesses may have disappeared, memories may have faded, and other evidence may no longer be available. The problems may be aggravated because a deliberate decision by a defendant to forgo established state remedial procedures induces and creates a justifiable belief and appearance that the ease has been finally concluded.</p>

I therefore request the court to permit me and Mr. Wire to withdraw on behalf of the defendant the motion for a new trial in this case and the motion for arrest of judgment filed in this case. Tate Court : Under these circumstances, the motions may be withdrawn. Me. Buch : And having been withdrawn, Your Honor, the defendant now presents himself for sentence in this ease. The Coitet: I have a letter from the defendant, apparently in his handwriting, dated June 11, 1962, in which he states substantially what his counsel has referred to, and I direct this letter be made a matter of record. Mr. Harbold, is there anything further you would like to say to me? Me. Habbold.: No.”</p>

Noia, </em><a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">supra, note 8</a>, were set forth for the federal courts, as we have noted. While we doubt that our standards for finding a deliberate avoidance of our established procedure would differ materially from those applicable in the granting of federal relief, we need not now decide whether there is any variance whatever. Even embracing a test comparable to the one used in the federal courts, we find that the instant case, as we test it against the standards set forth in <em>Noia, </em>is one in which there has been a deliberate by-passing.</p>
      <p id="b401-5" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[133,1230,1152,952]]]'>In <em>Noia, </em>as here, the defendant had been convicted of first degree murder. There, too, there was no timely, direct post-trial review. The Supreme Court of the United States held that Noia’s failure to follow normal state procedures did not constitute an intelligent and understanding waiver of his right to review. However, the Court noted: “This is not to say that in every case where a heavier penalty, even the death penalty, is a risk incurred by taking an appeal or otherwise foregoing a procedural right, waiver as we have defined it cannot be found. Each case must stand on its facts.” 372 U.S. at 440, 83 S. Ct. at 849. And the Supreme Court went on to observe that in that ease the trial judge had made the possibility of a death sentence upon any retrial a grisly, palpable, acute possibility. Ibid. There was no comparable external factor in the ease before us. It should also be observed that in this Commonwealth, the penalty for first degree murder is fixed, not recommended, by the jury. If the jury cannot agree, unless a retrial is ordered, the judge fixes the penalty at life imprisonment. Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, §701, as amended by Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, §1, 18 P.S. §4701. Therefore, if a defendant successfully presses a post-trial motion, on retrial he faces the exact possibilities he faced at his first trial.</p>
