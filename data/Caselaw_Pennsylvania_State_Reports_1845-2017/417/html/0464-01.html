Our Vehicle Code provides tbat tbe driver of any vehicle upon tbe highway, before starting, stopping and turning shall first see tbat such movement can be made in safety. Tbat is, members of tbe jury, our Vehicle Code provides for tbe giving of a band or a mechanical signal of an intention to start, stop or turn from a direct line of travel.

      <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>Originally, Article I, §102 of the Act of 1929, supra, 75 P.S. §102, defined the term “vehicle” to mean “every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported . . . upon a public highway, excepting . . . devices . . . used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks . . . .” In <em>Feldman v. Philadelphia R. T. Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/106/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="106 Pa. Super. 494" data-case-ids="703063" data-case-paths="/pa-super/106/0494-01">106 Pa. Superior Ct. 494</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.%2039" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="163 A. 39">163 A. 39</a> (1932), the Superior Court ruled that §1013 (a) of the Act of 1929, supra, 75 P.S. §1013 (a) (formerly 75 P.S. §572), dealing with the right-of-way where two “vehicles” approach an intersection at the same time, did not apply to street cars. Thereafter, the legislature amended said §1013 by the Act of June 29, 1937, P. L. 2329, to read “when two (2) vehicles, <em>or two </em>(2) <em>streetcars, </em>or two (2) trackless trolley omnibuses approach or enter ... an intersection . . . .” (Emphasis supplied). That the legislature deemed it necessary to add the term “streetcars” when it had already included “vehicles” is persuasive that the former is not included in the latter generally. Furthermore, at the same time, the Proviso to §102 of the Act of May 1, 1929, supra, defining “vehicles” was amended to read, “That, for the purpose of Article X of this act, . . . any other device moving upon wheels on a public highway, <em>except a device moving upon wheels upon stationary rails or trades on a public highway, </em>shall be deemed a vehicle.” (Emphasis supplied). Act of June 29, 1937, supra. Thus we see that the legislature fully intended that street cars were not to be regulated under the general provisions of Article X. They are only regulated by those sections (See, e.g., 75 P.S. §1013, supra), which include them specifically. Cf. <em>Dopler v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., </em><a href="/pa/307/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="307 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1138156" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0113-01">307 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20592" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="160 A. 592">160 A. 592</a> (1932), and <em>Feldman v. Philadelphia R. T. Co., </em>supra. Neither do we subscribe to the position that there is a common law duty requiring a street car to be equipped with a mechanical stop-light device.</p>
    <p id="b504-3" data-blocks='[["BL_504.3",504,[204,383,1150,644]]]'>
      <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>It is argued that, even if the court erred in that portion of the charge just discussed, it was harmless when the instructions are read and considered as a whole. So reading the charge, we find that in no other instance therein did the court specifically define the duty of the traction company. It is fundamental that the primary duty of a trial judge is clearly and correctly to define the issues to be resolved by the jury: Smith <em>v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/411/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="411 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1885972" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0142-01">411 Pa. 142</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="190 A.2d 441">190 A. 2d 441</a> (1963). How could the jury possibly understand the issues to be determined, when the duty of the defendant involved was defined only in an incorrect manner?</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[203,1038,1149,801]]]'>Further, under the charge of the court, the jury could find that, even if the street car came to a slow and gradual stop at the intersection, the traction company was still negligent because it violated its <em>statutory </em>duty in not having its mechanical stop-warning signal-lights functioning, and in failing to give such a signal of its intention to stop. What the jury found is, of course, problematical. In determining whether fundamentally erroneous instructions require the grant of a new trial, whether such instructions did or did not bring about the complained of verdict is not the question. If it appears that such instructions might have been responsible for the verdict, a new trial is mandatory: <em>Riesberg v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R., </em><a href="/pa/407/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="407 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1307364" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0434-01">407 Pa. 434</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20575" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="180 A.2d 575">180 A. 2d 575</a> (1962).</p>

This contention may have merit. However, the case was not tried on this theory, and the court failed to give any instructions in this regard. Such a responsibility, gra<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>tuitously undertaken, would entail substantially different obligations than those included in a duty imposed by statute. Further, there was no evidence offered to establish that the alleged failure of the stop-lights to function was due to the negligence of the traction company.</p>
    <p id="b505-2" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[131,714,1150,371]]]'>Finally, it is urged that because the traction company-defendant recorded only a general exception to the charge, that it now cannot complain of the error asserted.

For instance, §1012(a) states: “The driver of any vehicle upon a highway, before starting, stopping or turning from a direct line, shall first see that such movement can be made in safety, and, . . . whenever the operation of <em>any other vehicle </em>. . . <em>may be affected </em>by such movement, shall give a signal, as required in this section, <em>plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicle of the intention to make such </em>movement.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

This Court dismissed the contention with the statement: “This argument lacks merit.” Section 1002 of The Vehicle Code provides speed limits for vehicles passing school buildings “during recess.” It would be absurd to say that automobiles must abide by this restriction but that street cars may, with impunity, speed by school buildings and children at 60 miles per hour.</p>

If the judge had attributed what he said to the Justinian Code or the Napoleonic Code, his instruction would still be correct. Although he mentioned the phrase “Vehicle Code” twice and “Code” once, he did not make a violation of the Code an indispensable factor in the ascribing of negligence to the street car operator. Following his brief reference to the Code he said: “It must also be noted that the mere happening of a rear-end collision does not constitute negligence as a matter of law on the part of either driver.

It said by its verdict that the driver of the Vaughn automobile was also negligent. The verdict, therefore, obviously was based on common sense applied to a very simple set of facts. To order a new trial, in the face of so obviously patent a sensible verdict, because the judge pronounced something Tweedledee instead of Tweedledum, is to play ducks and drakes with the administration of justice.</p>

In this respect, the standard of conduct required of defendant was not a question for the jury. It was a question of law.
