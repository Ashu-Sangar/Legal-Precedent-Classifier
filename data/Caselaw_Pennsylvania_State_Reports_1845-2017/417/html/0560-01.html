In the complaint against the additional defendant, <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>Doyle, it is alleged that lie was the owner of premises on the corner of the intersection at or near where the accidental collision occurred; that a hedge, growing along the perimeter of the property and adjacent to the street, was permitted to remain in such an unkept and careless condition that it caused a visual obstruction to traffic on the highway; and that this contributed to the happening of the accident sued upon.</p>

Assuming arguendo, that the additional defendant was guilty of negligence, even per se, such negligence would not render him liable unless the negligence was the proximate and efficient cause of the accident: <em>DeLuca v. Manchester Laundry &amp; Dry Cleaning Co., Inc., </em><a href="/pa/380/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="380 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1255965" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0484-01">380 Pa. 484</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20372" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="112 A.2d 372">112 A. 2d 372</a> (1955). Further, an act of negligence which merely creates a passive background or circumstance of an accident is not the proximate cause thereof, where the accident is, in fact, caused by an intervening act of negligence which is a superseding cause: <em>Kite v. Jones, </em><a href="/pa/389/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="389 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1273988" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0339-01">389 Pa. 339</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.2d%20683" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="132 A.2d 683">132 A. 2d 683</a> (1957); <em>DeLuca v.

    <p id="b598-5" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[187,1902,1149,368]]]'>Under the facts pleaded, it is undeniably clear that the hedge in question was merely a passive background or circumstance of the accident involved. The carelessness of the automobile driver was an intervening, and hence the proximate and efficient, cause of the accident. The case of <em>Kite v.

    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[148,554,1152,751]]]'>Some may question the legal correctness of entering judgment on the pleadings in the situation presented, and may insist that the issue could more properly be determined after the evidence was completed at trial. The very purpose of permitting motions for judgment on the pleadings is to allow a litigant to raise another party’s “ ‘failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.’”: 1 Goodrich-Amram §1034(a)-2 (1959). The facts in this case clearly indicate that no claim is, or can be, set forth against the additional defendant upon which relief can be granted under the undisputed facts. Nothing would, therefore, be gained in compelling the additional defendant to go to trial where a nonsuit would inevitably result.</p>

Suppose the additional defendant had dug a hole in the highway in front of his property and, in attempting to avoid the excavation, the automobile driver had struck the plaintiff, could it be argued in such a situation that the excavation was merely a passive background and therefore impossible of contributing to the accident?</p>

How does it know what evidence would be presented by the defendant to show that the hedge so confused and misled him, so impeded his passage, so shut off his vision that the accident was the inevitable result of the obtruding, illegal hedge? I fear that the majority has grown a hedge of arbitrary assumptions which has shut off the view of simple cause and effect, and I, therefore, must dissent.</p>

The concept is applicable only in the following situation: “Where a second actor has become aware of the existence of a potential danger created by the negligence of an original tortfeaser, and thereafter, by an independent act of negligence, brings about an accident. . . .” <em>Kline v.

Thus, it is improper to allow the original actor (here, the additional defendant) to be relieved of his liability before it has been determined that the second actor (here, the original defendant) is, in fact, negligent. If it should turn out that plaintiff cannot establish the negligence of the original defendant then the only legally responsible cause is the conduct of the additional defendant, who would not be insulated by any superseding cause. Accordingly, I cannot see how the original actor (additional defendant) can be let out at the pleading stage of the case. Indeed, if the original actor’s negligence can be shown I cannot see how he can be relieved of liability or let out of the case until the second actor’s conduct actually has been found, after trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> to be negligent.</p>
