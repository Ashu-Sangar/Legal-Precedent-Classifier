Cf. 1 Goodrich-Amram §1017 (b) (9) ; <em>Tarner v. Chambersburg Borough School District, </em><a href="/pa/338/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="338 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1199902" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0417-01">338 Pa. 417</a>, 420-421, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%20106" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 A.2d 106">12 A. 2d 106</a>, 108 (1940). The Rule that “[ajverments of fraud . . . shall be averred with particularity,” Pa.

However, the motion for specificity cannot <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>be used to make a party plead purely evidentiary matters; and the requirements of precision and detail are more easily met where the matters involved are equally or more in the knowledge of the objecting party. Of course, the motion must be distinguished from a demurrer, under Pa. R.C.P. 1017(b)(4), which challenges the legal adequacy of the grounds rather than their specificity. <em>Bradly v.

See 1 Goodrich-Amram §§1017(b)-10, 1028 (b) -1. With the nature and purpose of defendants’ preliminary objection thus stated we may now test the propriety of the lower court’s ordering of plaintiff to file a more specific complaint.</p>

Plaintiff’s action is in assumpsit and it seeks judgments against and accountings by the defendants, individually and jointly, for specified and other unknown amounts of losses arising out of the alleged unlawful diversion and conversion of union funds while defendants were officers or agents of the Local.

The former was president of the Local from January 10, 1954, to December 31, 1955, and the latter was president from February 25, 1956, to August 22, 1960. Fairly summarizing, it is alleged, inter alia, that it was the duty of these defendant presidents to cosign all checks and vouchers covering expenditures authorized to be made by the Local and to make sure that the constitution and by-laws were strictly adhered to. It is further alleged that during their respective terms in office they <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>cosigned checks for less than the amounts authorized to be expended and allowed the members to be informed that payments were made which were not actually made, that the inflated payments were used to explain deficits reported to the members and to support requests for additional funds, and that they knew or should have known that more dues were being collected than were being reported to the members but never so informed the members. It is further alleged that, in the aforesaid manner, the defendant presidents, alone and. in concert with the other named defendant officers (whose conduct is described hereinafter), allowed specified and other unknown amounts of shortages to develop and continue or allowed such amounts to be converted by the. other defendant officers or converted such amounts to their own use.</p>

Fairly summarizing, it alleges that it was his duty to take custody of the Local’s receipts and personally make deposits of them, to cosign with the president all checks and vouchers for expenses authorized by the Local, and to make quarterly reports to the Local of receipts and disbursements. It further alleges that amounts were received by him from <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>the defendant financial secretary but never deposited, that he understated the receipts in his reports to the Local, that he thereby, alone and in concert with the other named defendant officers, allowed specified and other unknown shortages to develop and continue or that he thereby converted such amounts to his own use.</p>

Fairly summarizing, it alleges that, as financial secretary, Egroff’s duties were to collect dues, keep records of receipts, turn over the dues to the treasurer, and make quarterly reports to the Local of receipts and disbursements. It further alleges that he underreported receipts and acted in concert with the treasurer Pasternak (whose conduct is described above) as a result of which specified and other unknown amounts were received but never deposited to the Local’s credit and that he thereby, alone and in concert with the other named defendant officers, allowed specified and other unknown shortages to develop and continue or converted such amounts to his own use.</p>

While not a model of clarity, in our opinion, the complaint is sufficiently specific. From the complaint, <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>each defendant knows the nature of the improprieties with which he is charged. Each knows he is being charged with committing them while an agent or officer of the Local. Each knows in what respect these improprieties are alleged to be violations of duties. Each knows that the improprieties are alleged to be the bases for losses of Local funds, representing either wilfull neglect of duty or devices for conversion. Not only is plaintiff’s complaint specific in respect to such basic fact allegations but also there are two factors present which support the application of the rule, set forth at the outset, that where a defendant has more knowledge of the particulars than plaintiff the requirements of specificity are more easily met. First, if the specific improprieties were actually committed the details would naturally be secreted from plaintiff but known to defendants. Second, by virtue of their specified positions and duties in the Local the defendants had a fiduciary type relationship to plaintiff (more fully discussed below) giving them control and knowledge of the matters to which the complaint speaks and thus mitigating the necessity that plaintiff be more particular. Indeed, while the alleged improprieties were being committed the defendants represented the “mind” of the plaintiff Local. Applying the general rules set forth at the outset we are satisfied that the defendants’ right and ability to answer and defend have not been unduly impaired by plaintiff’s lack of further specificity.</p>

We note, in this respect, that federal labor law recently imposed a fiduciary type responsibility on the officials and agents of labor organizations. Section 501 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 provides: “(a) The officers, agents, shop stewards, and other representatives of a labor organization occupy positions of trust in relation to such organization and its members as a group. It is, therefore, the duty of each such person, taking into account the special problems and functions of a labor organization, to hold its money and property solely for the benefit of the organization and its members and to manage, invest, and expend the same in accordance with its constitution and bylaws and any resolutions of the governing bodies adopted thereunder, to refrain from dealing with such organization as an adverse party or in behalf of an adverse party in any matter connected with his duties and from holding or acquiring any pecuniary or personal interest which conflicts with the interests of such organization, and to account to the organization for any profit received by him in whatever capacity in connection with transactions conducted by him or under his direction on behalf of the organization. A general exculpatory provision in the constitution and bylaws of such a labor organization or a general exculpatory resolution of a governing body purporting to relieve any such person of liability for breach of the duties declared by this section shall be void as against public policy.” <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7501" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §501">29 U.S.C.A. §501</a>.</p>

But it must be remembered that to make this duty a part of federal law its imposition had to be statutory, because there is no <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>federal common law regarding such matters. However, we need not rely on the federal statute to support the imposition of such a duty. As a matter of the common law of this Commonwealth it would be anomalous if, in handling the funds of a labor organization, its officers and similar agents were not held to standards of good faith similar to those imposed upon the officers and directors of a corporation. See, e.g., <em>Rivoli Theater Company v. Allison, </em><a href="/pa/396/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="396 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1284859" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0343-01">396 Pa. 343</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.2d%20449" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="152 A.2d 449">152 A. 2d 449</a> (1959). We note the federal statute only to demonstrate that the imposition of such standards is not contrary, to the requirements of sound labor relations as conceived by Congress. By alleging the defendants’ positions in the Local, plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a fiduciary type relationship. And, as discussed above, plaintiff sufficiently alleged a breach of such relationship. Thus the request for an accounting was supported.</p>
