At 5:10 o’clock, E.D.S.T. on October 4, 1960, Albert Modany, the son of and agent of Gabriel Modany and the person responsible for the preparation of the bid, delivered the bid, together with a bid bond in the penal sum of $13,-000,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> to the architect for the job, at his office in Ell-wood City, with instructions to deliver the bid to the Authority’s office in Harrisburg. This the architect did, at 9:45 o’clock, E.D.S.T. on October 5, 1960. Sometime during the evening of October 4, after the bid had been delivered to the architect, Albert Modany discovered that he had omitted an approximate $120,000 item <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>from the bid. Albert Modany, then being unable to contact Mr. McCandless, the architect, by telephone, made no further effort to withdraw the bid until about three hours later, when he returned from visiting his wife in the hospital. He then sent a telegram to the authority at its main office in Harrisburg to the attention of the architect. This telegram was sent at 9:20 P.M., E.D.S.T. on October 4, 1960. The telegram stated that the bid was to be withdrawn, but did not mention a mistake had been made. At 10:05 A.M., E.D.S.T. on October 5, 1960, twenty five minutes prior to the opening of the bids, the contents of the telegram were made known to the counsel for the Authority, the executive director of the Authority, and an employee of the Authority authorized to receive bids. At 10:30 A.M., E.D.S.T. October 5, 1960, all of the bids were opened. The appellant’s bid was $211,700. The next lowest bids were $342,800 and $346,495. The appellant’s bid being then the lowest, his bid was accepted.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[183,1394,1147,520]]]'>The appellant then sought to enjoin the Authority from acting on his bid and to have the bid declared null and void, because it had been withdrawn. The lower court had before it for consideration the effectiveness of the withdrawal of Modany’s bid and whether rescission of the contract should be decreed if the bid withdrawal was not effective. The court denied relief and dismissed the complaint and that adjudication was affirmed by the court en banc. This appeal followed.</p>

There was no other effort made by Modany to withdraw his bid nor to contact the Authority or the architect in an effort to withdraw his bid. The telegram gave no indication that a mistake had been made in the bid. Although Mr. McCandless, the architect, upon receiving the telegram, attempted to contact Modany by telephone, he was unsuccessful, as no one answered the phone at the Modany office prior to the opening of the bids. When the bids were opened, the Authority had no knowledge at that time that the appellant, Modany, had made a mistake in his bid.</p>

This care extends to the procedure in withdrawal'of bids to prevent mischief. Reasonable regulations that protect these interests and are consonant with contract law will be upheld. An unverified telegram, and nothing more, as a means of withdrawing a bid is not conducive to the protection of bidders competing for public business. Reasonable and fair provisions surrounding competition for contracts for the performance of public works is necessary and, therefore, they must be established and maintained. . .</p>

There seems to have been no attempt (except the sending of the unverified telegram, without a reason stated therein) to comply in any manner with the withdrawal provision. The indifference, shown by the record, reveals an attitude of complete unconcern. It would be difficult to conceive: a more negligent disregard for the requirement of withdrawal of bid.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[182,2150,1147,210]],["BL_82.1",82,[190,360,1149,1712]]]'>As the chancellor said in his adjudication:- “Plaintiff knew, or certainly should have known, the- contents of paragraph 13 [the withdrawal provision’], of the- Instructions to Bidders. In his proposal he acknowledges <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>that he had examined them. Then, too, Albert Modany’s testimony that ‘We did not pay particular attention to that clause’, when asked if he knew or had personal knowledge of paragraph 13, leads the Chancellor to believe that plaintiff certainly knew how to properly withdraw his bid but negligently ignored the instructions. If he had made the mistake that he alleges he made he was certainly anything but diligent in following strictly the method established to withdraw his bid. Except for an attempted telephone call to McCandless, plaintiff did nothing toward withdrawing the bid until some three hours after he discovered his alleged mistake, and then he merely dispatched a telegram. Neither then nor at any time prior to the opening of the bids did he attempt to dispatch a written withdrawal by messenger, nor did the plaintiff or any member of his family attempt to reach Harrisburg by rail, auto, or air to be present at the bid opening. Neither did plaintiff attempt to contact, in Harrisburg, McCandless, his agent, who could have properly withdrawn the bid. And to climax his negligent conduct: on the morning of the bid opening when the Authority (which had no duty to do so) attempted to reach the plaintiff’s office by telephone apparently no one was present to receive the call. And later, when Albert Modany did talk with counsel for the Authority, he further weakened whatever force his attempted withdrawal had by his equivocal statement that he ‘would recheck [his] figures and advise [the Authority] as to whether or not [he] would take the bid, and [he] would let [the Authority] know at a later date if [he] could not take the bid.’ ”</p>

To so condone it would not only be placing a premium on negligence, but would be opening the door for fraudulent conduct between bidders or between a bidder and the public body inviting the bid.

In <em>Colellaf </em>supra, the plaintiff, a contractor, filed a complaint in equity against Allegheny County seeking a cancellation and return of its bid bond. Mr. Justice (now Mr. Chief Justice) Bell said: “If a person, from a firm or corporation submits a sealed bid on public works, the principle contended for by the contractor, namely, that after all the bids are opened he can withdraw his bid under the plea of a clerical mistake, would seriously undermine and make the requirement or system of sealed bids a mockery; it could likewise open wide the door to fraud and collusion between contractors and/or between contractors and the Public Authority. What is the use or purpose of a sealed bid if the bidder does not have to be bound by what he submits under seal? What is the use or purpose of requiring a surety bond as further protection for the public, i.e., the municipality, if a bidder can withdraw his bid under plea of clerical mistake, whenever he sees that his bid is so low that he must have made an error of judgment?”</p>
