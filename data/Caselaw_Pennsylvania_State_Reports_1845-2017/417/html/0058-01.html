From the Veterans Club he went to the Eagles Club about ten-thirty, to look for his brother and to pick up his own car, intending to drive home. At the Eagles Club, he had difficulty in “navigating,” experienced strange sensations in his feet and had great difficulty dancing. Two hours later he decided to go home, but when he went outside to the porch he collapsed. He spent the rest of the night on the porch, and about 7:30 a.m., a policeman saw him and took him to Franklin Hospital. He was examined there by Dr. Butters, who diagnosed his condition as polio and sent him to the Lakeside Hospital, a polio hospital at Erie, Pennsylvania. Several hours later he was taken by ambulance to the Hamot Hospital at Erie, where he remained for approximately two months. He was then taken by ambulance to the Veterans Hospital in Pittsburgh.</p>

The construction of curves on a highway for automobiles traveling from 40 to 75 miles an hour is, as Dr. Bomualdi testified, obviously and unquestionably different from the proper construction of a curve on a roller coaster track. It is clear that this was not an applicable analogy. Far more important, Bomualdi’s testimony was inadequate to sustain a finding of negligent construction. Bomualdi had had no experience in designing wooden structures like this, nor had he analyzed them or examined them before trial. He testified (a) that the lateral acceleration was excessive, but he did not “have knowledge of just how much lateral acceleration a person could take”; and (b) twice in his testimony <em>he refused to say that the design was </em>unsafe, but merely said that it was not the best possible engineering design. However, the evidence showed that from the time the track had been reconstructed several months prior to the accident and until the time of this trial, 1,297,802 “human bodies” (persons) (including all of plaintiffs family) had ridden this course and absorbed the abruptness of this curve without injury. In addition to all of this, (a) plaintiff was riding in a safely hand-railed car with seat belts, and (b) admittedly failed to protect himself by holding on (if necessary) to the front rail of the car, and (c) (we repeat) none of <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>plaintiffs party or any other person on this ride was injured at this curve or bend on this ride, and (d) plaintiff never told his first doctor (Dr. Butters) of this alleged accident on the roller coaster, and (e) plaintiff never commenced this suit or reported his accident to the defendant or presented a claim to the defendant until a few days before the expiration of the two year statute of limitations.</p>

He explained: “Before entering a straightaway, and. then into a portion of a curve of constant radius, it is necessary to have what we-call a transition or spiral curve, one which very gently goes from a straight line into a section of constant radius.” •</p>

The change, however, effected no cure since the defendant merely elevated the track, doing nothing to draw the fangs of the dragon — the abruptness of the curve which snapped collar bones.

That Dr. Eomualdi did not examine the track until six years after the accident was of no consequence if the track was in the same condition (and this was not questioned) as it was when the accident occurred. In addition, it is particularly to be noted that Eomualdi had motion pictures taken of the Blue Streak in action and he studied these films, which would undoubtedly give him a better appreciation of the forces involved in the movement of the roller coaster cars than a personal view would give him, because he could never get as close to the movement as a telescopic camera view.</p>

All the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>evidence points but in one direction — that tragic ride of August 19, 1956. The majority arbitrarily turns the weather vane against the wind and enters judgment n.o.v. No law supports this usurpative function.</p>
    <p id="b115-3" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[180,607,1148,308]]]'>The trial judge well stated it, as I have indicated, and it bears repetition: “The outstanding fact about this case was that plaintiff got on this Blue Streak a well man only 36 years of age and within a few hours after he got off, he was a helpless cripple for the rest of his life.”</p>
    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[180,935,1150,1024]]]'>There is no possible logical explanation for this appalling metamorphosis except the one clearly spelled out in the plaintiff’s case. The majority ignores this logical, easily understood explanation and seizes upon one which is sheerly arbitrary, one which is based on forced reasoning, assumed circumstances and inexplicable discarding of evidence. The majority in effect says that the accident could not have happened in the way described by the plaintiff and his witnesses, accepted by the jury and affirmed by the trial judge. But in adopting this arbitrary conclusion the majority offends against what perhaps is the most momentous rule this Court has laid down during the last half century as to the province of the jury in trespass cases, namely, “It is not necessary, under Pennsylvania law, that every fact, or circumstance point unerringly to liability; it is enough that there be sufficient facts for the jury to say reasonably that the preponderance favors liability.” <em>Smith v. Bell Telephone Co., </em><a href="/pa/397/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="397 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1286264" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0134-01">397 Pa. 134</a>.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.6",115,[184,1965,1162,153]]]'>In the case at bar the facts not only say that the' preponderance favors liability, but they <em>overwhelming-' ly favor liability!</em>

    <p id="b115-6" data-blocks='[["BL_115.7",115,[185,2129,1146,155]]]'>The entering of judgment n.o.v. in this ease is not only a sad day for George M. Wood, but for justice, and I vigorously register my opposition thereto.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b115-7" data-blocks='[["BL_115.8",115,[185,2292,1148,86]]]'>Mr. Justice O’Bkien joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>
