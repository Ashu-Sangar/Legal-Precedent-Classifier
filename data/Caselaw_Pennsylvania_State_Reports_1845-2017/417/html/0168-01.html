Pennsylvania Life Insurance Company [Pennsylvania Life], a domestic life insurance company organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, brought a bill in equity against the Pennsylvania National Life Insurance Company [Pennsylvania National], also a domestic life company organized under Pennsylvania law, and two other insurance companies (domestic fire and casualty companies), seeking to restrain and enjoin Pennsylvania National and its co-defendants from “engaging in the life insurance business under the name of Pennsylvania National Lips Insurance Company or any other <em>name </em>deceptively similar to that of [Pennsylvania Life].”</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.7",206,[202,1240,1149,1009]]]'>Pennsylvania Life has been engaged in the business of selling life, as well as health and accident, insurance in Pennsylvania since 1954 and has five offices in the State with approximately fifty salesmen and millions of dollars of coverage in force. Prior to the incorporation of Pennsylvania National in 1962, objections were filed with the Insurance Department of Pennsylvania by Pennsylvania Life and the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company claiming that the proposed name was deceptively similar to their own names. A formal hearing was held, on April 18, 1962, before a deputy insurance commissioner and testimony thereat was taken concerning the objections. Subsequently, on July 3, 1962, the insurance commissioner filed an adjudication declaring that the name did not closely resemble that of any existing company so as to confuse or mislead the public. Pennsylvania National was then incorporated and has been doing business ever since.</p>

L. 1388, as amended, 71 P.S. §1710.41). Pennsylvania Life filed exceptions and the court en banc, on March 2, 1964, found that there was evidence to support the allegation of confusion but affirmed the chancellor on the ground that the availability of a statutory remedy precluded the equity proceeding. It is from the decree dismissing the action that this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b207-3" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[170,1030,1150,1169]]]'>Our initial inquiry is whether a court of equity can exercise its jurisdiction in the instant factual situation. Section 204 of the Insurance Company Law of 1921 (Act of May 17, 1921, P. L. 682, §204, 40 P.S. §384), provides, inter alia: “The Insurance Commissioner may prohibit the use of any name, when, in his judgment, it too closely resembles that of any existing company or is likely to confuse or mislead the public.” Although not mandatory, a hearing was held in the case at bar, as we have stated, pursuant to the Administrative Agency Law (Act of June 4, 1945, P. L. 1388, as amended, 71 P.S. §1710.1-1710.51). Section 41 of the Administrative Agency Law, supra, provides, inter alia: “Appeals — Within thirty days after the service of an adjudication . . . any person aggrieved thereby who has a direct interest in such adjudication shall have the right to appeal therefrom. Such appeal shall be taken to the court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County.” The crucial question before us is whether Pennsylvania Life’s failure to pursue this statutory appeal precludes this subsequent equitable action. We hold that it does.</p>

The Water Company had filed an application with the Water and Power Resources Board (Board) to increase its water allocation from the creek. A hearing was held, the application approved and an appeal taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County pursuant to the Administrative Agency Law, supra. The appeals were terminated in the form of a consent decree by. the court allowing an amended permit. Some months later, a petition was filed asking the Board to reopen the proceeding, which petition was dismissed for failure to show any new matter or that new or changed conditions had arisen. No appeal was taken therefrom. Subsequently, the Water Company filed an application with the Board for permission to construct <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>a dam on Perkiomen Creek. After a hearing, the application was approved. No appeal was taken from this adjudication and order. It was this implementing application to construct the dam which triggered the suit in equity. The court en banc of Montgomery County dismissed the action, holding that equity could not exercise its jurisdiction, the parties having failed to exercise or exhaust statutory procedures and remedies available to them. In affirming, this Court stated (<a href="/pa/377/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="377 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="1249542" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0636-01">377 Pa. at 644</a>) : ■ “Some of them [the appellants.] did in fact appear, but none appealed from the final decision of the Board.

The facts of the case at bar are not such that justice would require departure from the previously noted rules of equitable jurisdiction.

This contention is rebutted by the statute itself (40 P.S. §384) which provides that the Commissioner may prohibit a name when “it too closely resembles that of any existing company <em>or </em>is likely to confuse . . . the public.” (Emphasis added). This clearly indicates that private as well as public rights are protected. Relying on <em>Consolidated Home Specialties Co. v.

In <em>Consolidated, </em>the names were authorized by the Department of State. The Business Corporation Law (Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, §202, as amended, 15 P.S. §2852-202) which governs the formation of most domestic corporations, specifically provides that a corporate name shall not imply that the corporation is “subject to the supervision ... of the Insurance Department.” The Department of State, in authorizing a corporate name, determines only whether the name is <em>identical </em>to that' of an existing corporation and the question of similarity is not considered by it. The Insurance Company Law, supra, specifically requires the question of <em>similarity </em>to be determined by the Commissioner. Therefore, while sound on its own facts, <em>Consolidated </em>is inapplicable here.</p>

While the word ‘National’ distinguishes the two names, nevertheless it is the placement of the words in the two corporate names that creates confusion. Each corporate name begins with the word ‘Pennsylvania’ and each corporate name includes the words ‘Life Insurance Company’. We do not feel that the insertion of the word ‘National’ between the words ‘Pennsylvania’ and ‘Life’ by the defendant sufficiently alerts the public to the distinction between the two corporations. It is the sequence of the words <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>in tlie' defendant’s corporate name that confuses it with the plaintiff’s corporate name. Had the defendant, for example, chosen the pame ‘National Life Insurance' Company of Pennsylvania’, it would have had the same words in its corporate name but in different sequence and in such case the first word of the plaintiff’s corporate name would be ‘Pennsylvania’ and the first word of the defendant’s corporate name would be ‘National’ and we are of the opinion that no cause for confusion on the part of the public would exist.”</p>
