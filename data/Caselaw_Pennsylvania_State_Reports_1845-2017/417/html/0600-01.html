On September 3, 1958, her lawyer-drawn will was probated. Thereafter, Margaret Bussell, the only child of testatrix, appealed the probate of the will. The will contest which developed eventually reached this Court and we upheld the validity of the will: <em>Sommerville Will, </em><a href="/pa/406/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="406 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="1304909" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0207-01">406 Pa. 207</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.2d%20496" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="177 A.2d 496">177 A. 2d 496</a>.</p>

The executor proposed to the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County that the bequest of $1000 be paid to testatrix’ grandson under the second Item of the will, that the in terrorem clause under the first Item of the will be enforced and that the bequest to testatrix’ daughter, who had contested the will, be revoked and the balance of the estate<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> be paid to the estate of Martha E.

Guy, deceased. After a re-audit, a rehearing, and various arguments, the court held that the third Item of the will provided for an unconditional and absolute gift of the residue to Martha E. Guy and awarded the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>balance to her estate and the court en banc upheld the auditing judge, with one judge dissenting.

    <p id="b639-5" data-blocks='[["BL_639.5",639,[162,889,1150,911]]]'>After a careful study of the language of this will, we conclude, as did the majority of the court below, that the residuary gift to Martha E. Guy was not a conditional gift. We agree thoroughly with and adopt as part of this opinion, the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Burke in the court below: “Adverting ... to the word ‘consideration’, the exceptant would restrict its meaning to its technical definition as used in contract law, which would imply a quid pro quo for the gift. This view she supports by the fact that the will was ‘lawyer-drawn’. In construing a will the language should be read in the <em>ordinary </em>and grammatical sense of the words employed. The presumption is that expressions are used in their <em>ordinary </em>and normal signification, unless there is some clear indication to the contrary: Lenhart’s Est., <a href="/pa/344/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="344 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1210962" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0358-01">344 Pa. 358</a> (1942).</p>

It is a lucid expression of her gratitude for Mrs. Guy’s kindness in <em>offering </em>testatrix the protection and comfort of her home and <em>offering </em>to arrange the necessary funeral ceremonies and no more. Since she was favoring Mrs. Guy over the exceptant, it was quite appropriate for testatrix to state her reason.</blockquote>

A recital in a will that the legacy given is <em>in consideration of </em>the legatee’s attention to testator or testatrix, and spouse, or <em>in consideration of </em>being taken care of and well treated by devisee during remainder of testator’s life, or in token of faithful services, or an expression of gratitude toward a legatee for his services to be rendered as executor, or <em>in consideration of </em>the services to be rendered in the probate of the testator’s will <em>was held to be an expression of the motive of testator in making the gift, and not a condition upon which he made it. </em>[emphasis supplied] ’</blockquote>
