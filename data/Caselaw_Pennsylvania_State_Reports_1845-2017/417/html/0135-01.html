Plaintiff began suit in Philadelphia County by a writ of summons, which was served on November 18, 1957. Defendant filed a “de bene esse” appearance on November 27, 1957, “for the purpose of raising questions of jurisdiction.” The summons was reissued on August 21, 1959, and, by deputized service, was served on defendant in Montgomery County on September 2, 1959. On October 6, 1959, defendant caused a rule to issue on plaintiff to file a complaint. In due course, the complaint was filed by plaintiff and preliminary objections were filed by defendant, challenging the propriety of venue in Philadelphia County. The lower court sustained the objection and dismissed the complaint.</p>

Pa. E. C. P. <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>2179(a). Here the action was begun by summons. The summons did not inform defendant where the cause of action arose. Therefore, defendant could not have intelligently decided whether it had an objection to venue before the facts surrounding the cause were alleged in the complaint. Nor could the court dispose of the objection before these facts came onto the record. Accordingly, instead of constituting a waiver, the action taken by defendant in causing a complaint to be filed was, in this case, a necessary prerequisite to an objection to venue. Accord, <em>Immitt v. Vacabet, </em><a href="/citations/?q=56%20Lanc.%20L.%20Rev.%20353" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="56 Lanc. L. Rev. 353">56 Lanc. L. Rev. 353</a> (1959).</p>

Under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure the exclusive method by Avhich a party may raise “jurisdictional” objections is by preliminary objections. <em>C. E. Williams Co. v. H. B. Pancoast Co., </em>supra at p. 170, Pa. R. C. P. 1017(b), 1028(b), 1032. But preliminary objections may not be filed until after the complaint is filed. This is true even though certain “jurisdictional” objections may become apparent immediately after service of a writ of summons and before the complaint is filed. The inclusion of preliminary objections in the list of allowable pleadings, Pa. R. C. P. 1017, indicates that it was intended to be a response to a prior pleading; a writ of summons is not a pleading. Also, the Note of Procedural Rules Committee to Rule 1017 states that “[a] preliminary objection may be filed to a complaint, answer, reply or counter-reply,” without mentioning a summons. Moreover, waiting until after the complaint is filed would accord with the policy of the Rules to reduce the pretrial stages of the action, and to telescope the various dilatory actions of the defendant, 1 Goodrich-Amram §1013 (b) 6, p. 54; <em>Vant v.

Defendant is a Pennsylvania Corporation. Pa. R. C.

We refer to that case here for only one purpose — for the light it sheds on the standard of “regularly conducts business” set forth in the corporations <em>venue </em>rule, Pa. R. C. P. 2179(a) (2). The problem of state court <em>jurisdiction </em>over foreign corporations, which <em>Shambe </em>also dealt with, is regulated by the Business Corporation Law. See Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, §10110, as amended, 15 P.S. §2852-10110. We said that, when venue in a particular county depends upon “doing business there,” “the business engaged in must be sufficient in quantity and quality .... The term ‘quality of acts’ means those directly, furthering or essential to, corporate objects; they do not include incidental acts. . . . By ‘quantity of acts’ is meant those which are so continuous and sufficient to be termed general or habitual. A single act is not enough.” <em>Shambe v. Delaware, </em>supra, at pp. 246-247. In our opinion, these standards are appropriate in determining where a corporation “regularly conducts business” within the .meaning of Rule 2179(a) (2), for the purpose of venue.</p>

In other words, five to ten percent of its fares are collected in Philadelphia County at the end of rides which involve driving a cab there.

Clearly, the acts of driving into Philadelphia County at the request of customers and collecting fares there were acts directly essential to and in furtherance of corporate objects and, therefore, were of sufficient quality. Just as clearly, the acts were performed habitually and, therefore, were of sufficient quantity. See <em>Iannetti v.

Under Buie 1012, in an assumpsit action, an appearance is purely voluntary. See Note of Procedural Buies Committee. Its sole purpose seems to be to provide a name and an address within the county at which papers may be served. Failing to file an appearance has no consequence. Under Pa. B. C. P. 1045, in a trespass action, the filing of an appearance, either after a writ of summons or after a complaint, prevents the entering of a default judgment under Pa. B. C.

In other words, a party should be deemed to have waived his “jurisdictional” objections only when an application of the Rules of Civil Procedure would lead to such a result. In most, if not in all cases, the result of such application will not differ from the result of a correct application of the old doctrine of waiver by “general appearance.” One instead of two sets of rules on waiver would considerably diminish the confusion in this area of the law, as exemplified in this case by the filing of a nonexistent form of appearance, i.e., “de bene esse.”</p>
