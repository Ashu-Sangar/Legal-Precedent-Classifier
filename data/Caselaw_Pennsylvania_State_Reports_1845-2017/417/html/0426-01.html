The property has a frontage of approximately 200 feet on the highway, and had a depth of 105 feet. ¡The Commonwealth took 23 feet in depth along the 200 foot frontage to widen the highway, thus reducing the usable depth to 82 feet. In addition to the area on the highway taken, an additional area of 980 square feet was taken for a 36-inch storm sewer right-of-way, which was 10 feet in width and 98 feet in length.</p>

One of the statutes regulating procedure is the Act of 1915, April 21, P. L. 159 (26 P.S. §101) entitled ‘An Act Relating To The Competency of witnesses and to the rule of evidence in proceedings arising from the exercise of the right of eminent domain.’ The Act has been repealed so far as it relates to townships, boroughs, cities (except those of the first class) and third class cities, but so far as our research has revealed is otherwise in effect and is all inclusive being applicable ‘In all proceedings arising from the exercise of the right of eminent domain . . .’ The provisions of Section 1 of the Act here applicable read as follows: ‘In all proceedings arising from the exercise of the right of eminent domain it shall be competent for all witnesses called, when duly qualified, to state their opinion as to the market value of the property before the exercise of the right of eminent domain and as unaffected by it, and its market value immediately after the exercise of the right of eminent domain and as affected thereby: — (a) To state in detail, <em>and costs, </em>all <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the elements of benefit or damage which they have taken into consideration in arriving at their opinion;’. Moreover, while there are decisions of our Supreme Court which seem to the contrary, viz., Brown v.

In this last mentioned case the Supreme Court, speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern after referring to the Act of 1915, stated the applicable rules of evidence to be followed in this language; <em>‘As far as “costs” are concerned, there is no doubt </em>— and <em>it always has been held </em>— that <em>actual outlays and estimates of necessary construction work may be given in evidence, </em>not as independent and distinct items of damage, but as elements bearing on the difference between values before and after the exercise of the right of eminent domain: . . . But as to “elements of benefit or damage” which are not susceptible of accurate mathematical determination, the rule must necessarily be otherwise, and, while the act gives the right “to state in detail” such elements, it manifestly was not intended thereby to permit their itemized reduction to dollars and cents, and thus to give a greater measure of plausibility to the estimate of total damage by making it appear to have been scientifically determined by the arithmetical addition of a number of specific items of damage, each of which in itself is necessarily only an expression of opinion and not factual evidence.’ We are of the opinion that under the rule above quoted in the Pittsburgh Terminal case as well as the applicable statute of 1915 that these cost figures, being estimates of necessary <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>construction work required to utilize the remaining land, were properly admitted for the jury’s consideration, not as distinct items of damage but as elements bearing on the before and after values of this particular exercise of the right of eminent domain.” (Emphasis in original.)</p>

Appellee, the property owner, testified to damages amounting to $50,000. The jury returned a verdict in the total amount of $27,500 and specifically denied any claim for detention damages. The charge of the court was proper and was a correct pronouncement of the law. The jury, however, rejected the claim for detention damages, and, in this respect, acted within the proper exercise of its right to deny detention damages if it believed the claim of the property owner to be exorbitant. It is true there was no evidence offered by the Commonwealth to prove that the property owner’s demands were excessive or unreasonable. Nor was any evidence offered to show that the property owner refused to negotiate a reasonable settlement. It was not necessary for the Commonwealth to specifically introduce evidence to show an excessive or unreasonable demand when the property owner testified as to the damages suffered. The jury could take the testimony submitted and determine from that evidence <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>that the demand was excessive and unreasonable and refuse to award detention damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The jury evidently did this very thing for its verdict specifically stated that no verdict would be given for this item by stating <em>“without </em>detentionThe court should not have granted an award for detention in the face of the finding of the jury.
