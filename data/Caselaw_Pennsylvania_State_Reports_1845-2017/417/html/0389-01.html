Nachman’s complaint averred: (1) the existence of a savings account (No. 7607) with the Association titled in the names “Pearl Nachman or Morris Nachman” the balance in which was $763.83; (2) the existence of a savings account (No. 12501) with the Association titled “Pearl Nachman, in trust for Morris Nachman” the balance in which was $2107.72; (3) the existence of a safe deposit box in the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company leased by both Nachman and his wife in which, on or about September 15, 1962, there was cash approximating $5000 and eight specifically identified life insurance policies wherein Nachman was named insured and his wife beneficiary; (4) that, after the separation of the parties, without Nachman’s consent, Pearl Nachman removed from the safe deposit box both the cash and insurance policies; (5) that, unless restrained, Pearl Nachman would likely withdraw' the money from both savings accounts and appropriate it to her own use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
