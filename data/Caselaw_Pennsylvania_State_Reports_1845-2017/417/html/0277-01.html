Thompson Street, between N. 26th Street and N. Taney Street, a public school known as the Robert Morris Public School. Because of an increase in population, the existing building is inadequate to meet the needs in the area. Therefore, the School District proposes to raze this structure and replace it with a new and larger plant to accommodate a greater number of pupils. <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>In order to accomplish this, the city vacated a public street immediately to the south of the present school property and, in addition, the School District acquired further property beyond this vacated street bed through its power of eminent domain.

In contravention of these requirements, the proposed structure is to be 50 feet in height, with no rear yard, and would provide no off-street parking area in spite of the fact that the gross floor area is 90,000 square feet.</p>

Thus, the sole area of dispute now is whether the Board is empowered to require the School District to comply with the zoning regulation concerning off-street parking. The restricted area of the present dispute does not change the nature of the basic question for decision. The issue still remains: does the City of Philadelphia have the power to enforce zoning regulations of any nature against the School District. If the power of the City to enact and enforce zoning regulations is statutorily limited in that school districts are exempt, or if the legislature has granted complete and plenary power to the School District over its physical plants, or even if it has reserved this power unto itself, then the City is without authority to enforce the regulation here involved.

Such a zoning regulation is of a distinctly different nature. As we view the term “Regulating public schools”, this deals more with the quality of public education than with the physical structures required to provide it. “The building of school buildings is but a necessary <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>incident to the fulfillment of the primary duty of educating the young”: <em>Port Arthur Independent School District v. City of Groves, </em><a href="/sw2d/376/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="376 S.W.2d 330" data-case-ids="10160009" data-case-paths="/sw2d/376/0330-01">376 S.W. 2d 330</a>, 334 (Tex. 1964). Moreover, zoning is peculiarly a local matter and the prohibition imposed on the City by the Act of 1949 against the exercise of powers contrary to, or in limitation of, other acts of the General Assembly applies only to substantive matters of state-wide concern. See, <em>Bartle v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/10/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 613" data-case-ids="1623344" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/10/0613-01">10 Pa.

We see no inherent state-wide interest in the fact that certain school buildings, because of local problems of congestion, should be so situated that space is available for off-street parking, or even that, because of overcrowded conditions, each building should be of only a certain height, or that it should have a back yard of a certain depth. These are areas which the legislature did not intend to protect when it denied to cities the power to regulate public schools. In requiring off-street parking facilities, the Oity here is not “Regulating public <em>schools”; </em>it is merely trying to enforce methods of combating the congestion of its public streets by means which it considers reasonably calculated to accomplish this result. That there is some additional cost to the educational system does not mean ipso facto that there is regulation of schools. Should the cost become so unreasonably oppressive as to prevent the fulfillment of the duty of providing public schools, then the remedy of variance is available. But, as yet, the record contains no indication that the requirement of such facilities would be in effect a prohibition of the building. The record shows <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>only that the area next appurtenant southerly cannot be acquired. There is no indication that other property could not be acquired for parking facilities which is within the School District’s financial ability. Until the City’s regulation of school building construction assumes the proportions of financial prohibition, then the City is not regulating public schools by this type of ordinance.'

However, there is no city requirement that the parking facility be contiguous to the school building, or even that it be on the same block.

However, we do not consider the imposition of a zoning regulation as here involved to amount to an interference with these vested responsibilities, nor do we interpret these specific provisions of the Code to preclude the City from imposing a duty to acquire additional land in connection with a proposed site when such is necessary for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the com<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>munity.

No system of regulation and inspection has been established; and we do not read legislative inaction in a field so intimately intertwined with the safety and health of the children of this Commonwealth as is the regulation of school building construction to be a declaration of policy to the effect that school directors (appointed officials) in districts of the first class shall be allowed a free hand to construct without regard to predetermined standards promulgated to protect the children over whom they have responsibility. This is especially true when we note that when the legislature desired to establish a fixed standard on its own initiative it did so by express terms.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>
