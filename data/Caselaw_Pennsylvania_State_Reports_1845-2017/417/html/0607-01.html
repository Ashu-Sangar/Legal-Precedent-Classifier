Exceptions to the decree were dismissed, and the defendant appealed.</p>

It reasoned that, since the insurance coverage was questioned, plaintiff’s ability to establish financial responsibility, as required by the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Responsibility Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> was seriously affected, which could result in suspension of his automobile operating <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>privileges, and that, therefore, plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief.</p>
    <p id="b645-3" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[169,498,1149,1349]]]'>We cannot agree that the plaintiff was faced with irreparable harm or that the legal remedies available were inadequate. The question of insurance coverage could be determined in the action of assumpsit. Moreover, while under the Act of 1959, supra note 1, a licensee involved in an accident can prove financial responsibility and avoid suspension of operating privileges by filing with the Secretary of Revenue a certificate of insurance coverage, this is only one of three alternate methods available to meet the requirements of the act. (See §1418, 75 P.S. §1418). Also, if a suspension is ordered, an appeal is provided for to the court of common pleas<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> of the county in which the licensee resides, and the filing of the appeal acts as a supersedeas. Any and all losses incurred in resisting the suspension are recoverable from the defaulting insurer in a proper legal action. While resisting the suspension would undoubtedly entail inconvenience and some hardship, it certainly cannot be classified as “irreparable harm”. Finally, in the instant action, it Avas admitted of record that the Secretary of Revenue had agreed to withhold any action concerning plaintiff’s operating privileges until the question of insurance coverage had been legally determined. Hence, any possible hardship in this regard was obviated.</p>
