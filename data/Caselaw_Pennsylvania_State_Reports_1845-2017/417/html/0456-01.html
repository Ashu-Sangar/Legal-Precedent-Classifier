      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> This pipe line has been used continuously since it was constructed by the Company’s predecessor in 1939, for the purpose of supplying gas to customers in and near the Village of Marienville, in Jenks Township, Forest County.</p>
    <p id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[123,647,1149,371]]]'>Plaintiff’s evidence showed that the gas pipe line had numerous leaks which needed repair or replacement by a new pipe. <em>The line was in such dangerous condition </em>that unless repaired or replaced it might imperil the lives and properties of every person in the entire community. After a hearing, the Court granted a preliminary injunction.</p>
    <p id="b493-4" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[123,1030,1149,413]]]'>Appellant contends that he is a bona fide purchaser of his land for value, and that he acquired title to his property free and clear of, and without any notice of, any easement for a gas pipe line. This alleged easement was created by an <em>unrecorded </em>deed from appellee’s predecessor in title. For this reason, appellant contends that the preliminary injunction should not have been entered.</p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[123,1464,1149,694]]]'>The law is well settled by a myriad of cases that “Appeals are expressly allowed by statute from the grant or refusal of a preliminary injunction . . . ‘Our uniform rule is that, on an appeal from a decree which refuses, grants or continues a preliminary injunction, we will look only to see if there were any apparently reasonable grounds for the action of the court below, and we will not further consider the merits of the case or pass upon the reasons for or against such action, unless it is plain that no such grounds existed or that the rules of law relied on are palpably wrong or clearly inapplicable.
