She had an estate of over $18,000, made up of (1) approximately $9,600 Series E bonds which had been purchased by her husband and registered in the name of herself or her husband, with right of survivorship, and (2) an insurance policy in the amount of approximately $2,500, which his employer had taken out on Demitz’ life and in which she was the named beneficiary, and (3) Social Security payments of over $4,000 arising out of her husband’s employment, and (4) income of approximately $1,161 paid by Demitz’ testamentary trustee to Jeannette’s guardian, and (5) a family exemption from her husband’s estate of $750.</p>

It was not until after Jeannette’s death in December of 1962 that the guardian of her estate and the administratrix of her estate presented their claim in the amount of $4,731.48 for payment of her hospital expenses out of principal.
