Flagiello was injured in the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia under circumstances which, considering the nature of the legal problem before us, do not at present call for expatiation. It is enough to say that she avers that, through the negligence of two employees of the hospital, she was caused to fall, sustaining in the fall a fracture to her right ankle, and, that this injury, entirely unrelated to the ailment which brought her into the hospital originally, necessitated further hospital and medical care which subjected her husband to great medical'expense and. inflicted upon her pain and suffering as well as impairment of earning power. She and her husband, Thomas Flagiello, brought an action in trespass against the hospital and the two employees alleged to have been immediately responsible for the accident. The defendant hospital answered that it was an eleemosynary in-, stitution engaged in charitable enterprise and, therefore, not responsible in damages to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs replied to the new matter, declaring that Mrs. Flagiello was not a charity patient but a paying patient in the hospital.

It thus urges a momentous exception to the generic proposition that in law there is no wrong without a remedy.

In the early days of public accommodation for the ill and the maimed, charity was exercised in its pure and pristine sense. Many good men and women, liberal in purse and generous in soul, set up houses to <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>heal the poor and homeless victims of disease and injury. They made no charge for this care. The benefactors felt themselves richly rewarded in the knowledge that they were befriending humanity. In that period of sociological history, the hospitals were havens mostly for the indigent. The wealthy and the so-called middle class were treated in their homes where usually there could be found better facilities than could be had in the hospitals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The hospital or infirmary was more often than not part of the village parish.

Charitable enterprises are no longer housed in ramshackly wooden structures. They are not mere storm shelters to succor the traveler and temporarily refuge those stricken in a common disaster. Hospitals today are growing into mighty edifices in brick, stone, glass and marble. Many of them maintain large staffs, they use the best equipment that science can devise, they utilize the most modern methods in devoting themselves to the noblest purpose of man, that of helping one’s stricken brother. But they do all this on a business basis, submitting invoices for services rendered — and properly so.</p>

If a hospital employee negligently leaves a sponge in the abdominal cavity of a paying patient, why should the hospital be freed from liability, any more than a restaurant owner should escape responsibility for the damage inflicted by a waitress who negligently overturns a tray of hot dishes on a guest?</p>

This is indeed the paradox of paradoxes. It has no logic, reason, and, least of all, justice, to support it. And still more paradoxical is the argument that, by refusing recovery to the victim of a hospital’s own negligence, one somehow is serving charity!</p>

Boyd </em>it still was of no authoritative weight at that time because Lord Cottenham’s pronouncement had been repudiated in 1866 in <em>Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs, </em>L.R. 1 H.L. 93, and what was said in 1861 in <em>Holiday v. St. Leonard, </em>11 C.B. N.S. 192, on the same subject was overruled in 1871 by the case of <em>Foreman v. Mayor of Canterbury, </em>L.R. 6 Q.B. 214. Thus, the doctrine expounded in <em>Fire Insurance Patrol v.

Then, three years later, Pennsylvania brought its blocks of stone with mortar in the <em>Boyd </em>case for still another higher addition to this pile which now was starting skyward. So sure was Justice Paxson of the solidity of the foundation in the <em>Boyd </em>case that he spoke sardonically of a decision of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, a state, which, with a wisdom and courage in inverse proportion to its geographical size, declared that a maltreated hospital patient was entitled to recover for damage done him. Justice Paxson derided the Rhode Island case: “I will not consume time by discussing the case of Glavin v.

Moreover, the court should not perpetrate error solely for the reason that a previous decision, although erroneous, has been rendered on a given question.

Surely, the orderly development of the law must be responsive to new conditions and to the persuasion of superior reasoning. ‘[W]hen a rule, after it has been duly tested by experience, has been found to be inconsistent with the sense of justice or with the social welfare, there should be less hesitation in frank avowal and full abandonment. . . .

    <p id="b552-5" data-blocks='[["BL_552.6",552,[198,645,1149,805]]]'>I concur in what the Court does today for the fundamental reason that, no matter how viewed, the doctrine of charitable immunity cannot withstand unimpassioned analysis. Briefly put, there is really no supportable rationale upon which this judicially-created exception to the ordinary rules of liability can be predicated. The various theories advanced in favor of the doctrine seem to me, at root, as ethereal as the nonexistent English precedent upon which the doctrine was first founded. It would serve little purpose to parade in this opinion the vast number of cases or authorities or to discuss in any detail the weaknesses of the theories which have sustained the doctrine long beyond its day. The abundance of judicial authority and scholarly writings make that a needless exercise.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

In recent' years, where the issue of charitable immunity has come before a court as a matter of first impression, the doctrine has been consistently rejected.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Moreover, while the unquestioned trend has been to abandon charitable <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>immunity,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> not a single jurisdiction that recognizes full liability has overruled prior authority and adopted charitable immunity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> In other words, judicial opinion has tended to go from immunity to liability, but in no instance has it gone from liability to immunity.</p>

What I do believe is that, in the proven absence of persuasiveness in any of the arguments advanced for maintaining a rule of law which makes negligent injury suffered at the hands of <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>charitable institutions noncompensable, such institutions should be held to the same responsibility as any other entity. Charities are, of course, to be encouraged, not penalized. But that is not to say that they should be relieved of the responsibility of compensating those injured through the charities’ fault. Under the immunity doctrine, in the rush to somehow “safeguard” charitable assets, the injured individual and his loss seem to have been regrettably forgotten. Personal injury is no less painful, disabling, costly or damage-producing simply because negligent harm is inflicted in! or by a charitable institution rather than a non-charitable one. It should be no more protected by law.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[199,1084,1148,800]]]'>One of the most vigorously advanced arguments for adhering to charitable immunity is predicated on stare decisis. But “judicial consistency loses its virtue when it is degraded by the vice of injustice.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> The principle of stare decisis is more a stabilizing anchor than a permanent deadweight. Unwise rules need not be perpetuated forever. Mr. Justice Brandéis was fond of saying that no case was ever settled until it was settled correctly. There is no more arrogance involved in rectifying a mistake than in making it in the original instance. I cannot believe that the common law tradition, which has served us so well because of its illuminating ability to adapt and re-examine itself, demands a policy of unyielding adherence to a thoroughly discredited principle.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

Most hospitals in metropolitan areas operate in the red<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">*</a> when their costs and expenses include depreciation, amortization and interest. For the benefit of a few really injured and many imaginatively-injured people and their avaricious lawyers, the lame, the halt and the blind, the poor, the sick, the ill, the needy, and the general public will be deprived of the best services which a hospital can and should provide. Moreover, new buildings, modern equipment, more and better qualified personnel and increased wages will become more and more difficult if not impossible for most charities.</p>

The majority first assert that in good morals, in law and impliedly under the Constitution, there is and must be a remedy for <em>every </em>wrong. <em>This is both factually and legally incorrect. </em>For example, an injured person has no remedy and no recovery for damages is permitted when the injury resulted from the negligence of an agent or servant of a municipality while engaged in the performance of a governmental function. Moreover, a person injured by false and defamatory statements is not entitled to any recovery or any remedy if such statements were made or published by a high public official if such official was acting in the course of his official duties and within the scope of his authority or within <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>his jurisdiction even if the statements were made with actual malice and for an improper motive and without reasonable or probable cause. <em>Montgomery v.

Furthermore, it is well established that where a trial Judge in a criminal case makes a clearly erroneous, outrageous and unconstitutional ruling or decision against the Commonwealth— in such a case if the defendant is acquitted, the Commonwealth has no right of appeal and no remedy.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[205,935,1148,415]]]'>Moreover, the majority distort their contention that “for every wrong or injury there must be a remedy,” into meaning that there must be a remedy against those who are insured or in any event against an employer who is best able to pay. In order to support their theory, they rely upon and invoke the doctrine of respondeat superior, which is neither ordained nor even mentioned in the Constitution.</p>
    <p id="b558-5" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[207,1369,1150,856]]]'>The next reason given by the majority is that most hospitals have insurance and therefore can afford to adequately pay, where the actual wrongdoer cannot. Even if this were a fact, which it is not, there is no legal reason or justification for differentiation in legal liability between persons or charities which have insurance and those which have none. Moreover, what will happen to churches and to very small hospitals and small benevolent charitable homes, institutions and agencies, and to every little charity when they become liable for trespass injuries with their accompanying colossal verdicts? All of these eke out a bare existence while rendering many worthwhile and wonderful services to the public. Doesn’t their protection and preservation <em>pro bono publico </em>require a continuation of charitable immunity?</p>

    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[159,595,1150,861]]]'>(9) If charitable immunity is abolished, it will aid the very few at the expense of the very many. Trespass litigation is already clogging and swamping our Courts (especially in large cities) and this Court load will undoubtedly be tremendously increased by suits against hospitals not only for real injuries but also for imaginary ailments, and for ailments and illnesses which were not cured by hospital care, and will be thought and alleged by the patient to be caused by negligence in the care or cure. Such suits will be limited only by the imagination of the discharged'patients and the ingenuity of astute lawyers specializing in the field of Tort, with the added result that Justice for thousands of injured persons who need speedier relief in their negligence suits, will be further unfairly postponed and jeopardized.</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[162,1467,1149,427]]]'>(10) If charitable immunity is to be abolished it should be abolished prospectively instead of retroactively. Retroactive application will raise difficult Constitutional questions and questions of statutory limitation, and will likely subject all charities to suits for injuries and real or imaginary ailments which allegedly occurred in the last two or more years and for which the charities are not and could not be prepared.</p>

In the Gable case, supra, it was said (p. 258, A. p. 1088), ‘It is a doctrine too well established to be shaken, and as unequivocally declared in our own state as in any other, that a public charity cannot be made liable for the tort of its servants.’ Surely a doctrine so deeply embedded in the structure of our common law should not lightly be overturned in violation of the rule of stare decisis. Principles of the common law are not established or developed arbitrarily; they congeal during the course of the years from the fluidity of recurrent judicial decisions which presumably reflect the sentiments and social values of the community. Measured by that standard there is no class of institutions more favored and encouraged by our people as a whole than those devoted to religious or charitable causes. Public-minded benefactors are not likely to have their generous impulses encouraged if advised that some janitor, watchman or other employe of a charitable organization who carelessly fails to note the displacement of a brick or stone <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>in a pavement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_3" id="ref_footnote_4_3">*</a> may thereby bring about the loss of all the property and funds which the donors had sought to devote to the common good. If and when there is to be any change in the doctrine of the immunity of charitable institutions from tort liability, it ought to be effected, not by the courts, but by the legislature, which is, of course, the ultimate tribunal to determine public policy. Incidentally, it will be remembered that this is not the only class of cases in which the victim of an accident may not recover damages from other than the individual who actually committed the tort; for instance, no such recovery is permitted where the accident results from the negligence of the agent or servant of a municipality while engaged in the performance of a governmental function.”</p>
