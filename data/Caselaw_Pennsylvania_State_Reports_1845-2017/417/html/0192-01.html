For this reason, we cannot say that the hearing Judge clearly abused his discretion.</p>

To support this proposition they rely upon: <em>Hammermill Paper Co. v. Erie, </em>372 Pa., supra; <em>North Park Village, Inc. v. Bd. of Prop. A., A. &amp; R., </em>408 Pa., supra; <em>Gilleland v. N. Y. State Natural Gas Corp., </em>399 Pa., supra. These cases establish the <em>general rule </em>that an assessor or councils (as the case may be) may (and in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia must) separately value and assess the component parts of a single subject of taxation, but unless otherwise required by Statute or Ordinance, it is the valuation and assessment of the property as a whole which is controlling. Moreover, that valuation may be the sum total of its component parts, i.e., land and building, which is the customary <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>standard in real estate assessment cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_14" id="ref_footnote_2_14">*</a>, and was the practice which the Board itself and the Court below followed in this case. Cf. <em>North Park Village, Inc. v. Bd. of Prop. A., A. &amp; R., </em>408 Pa., supra; <em>Spiwak v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/366/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="366 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="8845219" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0145-01">366 Pa. 145</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%2097" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="77 A.2d 97">77 A. 2d 97</a>; <em>Elgart v.

However, this general rule of fixing a valuation for and an assessment of a taxpayer’s property <em>as a whole </em>has no application to the City of Pittsburgh, where a distinction between (a) the buildings on the land, and (b) the land exclusive of the buildings, <em>and a different tax thereon, </em>is statutorily mandated. See Act of June 15, 1939, supra. In the instant case the Board itself (valued and) assessed the land and the building separately, and all parties and the Court below tried the case on that theory, plus the belief that the sum total of the assessed value (a) of the land and (b) of the building would be the assessed value of the entire property. Furthermore, the Board never raised this issue in its statement of the questions involved. “It is fundamental that questions not raised below will not be heard on appeal”: <em>Capozzi v. Antonoplos, </em><a href="/pa/414/0565-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="414 Pa. 565" data-case-ids="1890404" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0565-01">414 Pa. 565</a>, 569, <a href="/citations/?q=201%20A.2d%20420" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="201 A.2d 420">201 A. 2d 420</a>. Even if the Board could now raise this technical objection, it would be (at best for the Board) only a harmless error, in view of its position that the just assessment of this property in its entirety, was the total of the separate assessment of the land and of the building.</p>
