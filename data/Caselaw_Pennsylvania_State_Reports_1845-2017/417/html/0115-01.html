They and the Authority recognize that contamination of the Authority’s water would probably result. We find it unnecessary to reach the question of whether the release has freed plaintiffs from liability for the supposed contamination.

      <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>Plaintiffs have not cited any authority for the proposition that a letter containing veiled threats of interference could constitute a trespass upon the type of property rights plaintiffs are asserting in this case. Even if such authority were found, it would not be applicable here; in our opinion, this letter is nothing more than a refusal by the Authority to acquiesce in the proposed contamination of its waters. As such, it does not prevent the plaintiffs from mining and, therefore, is not actionable. See <em>Downing v. Baldwin, </em>1 S. &amp; R. 298, 303-304 (1815). Actually, the Authority has maintained all along that, if plaintiffs begin mining, the enforcement by the Commonwealth of its statutory laws, to which the letter alludes, will make it unnecessary for the Authority itself to take any action against plaintiffs to protect its waters from contamination. See especially §§310-313 of the Act of June 22, 1937, P. L. 1987, added by Act of May 8, 1945, P. L. 435, §§6-7, 35 P.S. §§691.310-691.313.

Even if plaintiffs had so east their action, which they did not, we cannot find an unexecuted contractual duty on the part of defendants to give their permission to plaintiffs, upon request, to allow them to mine. The absence of such an undertaking is not surprising, because, as plaintiffs have consistently contended, their claim, if any, is based upon interference with a vested property right in the coal. An undertaking by one party to allow another to exercise what he could exercise without such undertaking is rarely encountered.</p>
