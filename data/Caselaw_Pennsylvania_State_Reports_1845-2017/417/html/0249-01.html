It was notified by tbe Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County (Board) that for this period the assessed valuation on the property would be $717,555. This represented an increase from the preceding triennium of $191,670, all of which reflected, as specifically shown in the assessment notice, an increase in the assessed value of the main building on the premises. Rieek appealed to the Board for revision, but was refused any relief; and it thereafter appealed to the court below.</p>
    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[163,934,1150,800]]]'>At the hearing before the lower court, the Board introduced the assessment and rested. Rieck then produced testimony by an engineer and two real estate appraisers regarding the nature and value of the building<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which was revalued in the assessment. The gist of their testimony, in toto, was that the building was a special purpose one for the manufacture of ice cream, that no physical changes had taken place from the preceding triennium in the structure, that the market value of the building was between $950,000 and $1,-000,000 as compared to the assessed value of $562,350 and that the market value of the only comparable property (another ice cream plant) was between $3,000,000 and $3,300,000 as compared to an assessed value of $988,835.</p>

We agree. The lower court improperly held that appellant met the burden of proof to overcome the presumption of the validity of the assessment of the main building by testimony of a highly competent engineer that there had been no change made in the building from the time of the preceding triennial assessment in the amount of $370,680. This error undoubtedly resulted from its belief that the prior assessment of the building was res judicata on the question of fair market value in the current assessment. While a prior assessment may be admissible for some purposes, we have clearly held it cannot be considered to be res judicata of the current fair market value.</p>

Each annual proceeding is separate and distinct from every other. Year by year an assessor must use his own judgment and must verify the roll. . . . From these considerations it results that a prior judicial determination of value does not legally bind successor assessors.’ The opinion concluded with the statement that ‘the doctrine of res judicata can have no true application to the issues of value in recurring assessment proceedings.’ The Fahrenkopf case, supra, has since been cited and followed a number of times.

Evidence presented by appraisers must be directed to the market value of the property as a whole. The direction of a statute which requires the assessors to show a separate valuation for the land and for the building is not a directive to a court reviewing an assessment on appeal. Our courts do not act in the capacity of an assessor. The thing from which the property owner appeals and, therefore, the concern before the court is the total assessment of the property as a unit. The itemization of an assessment required of an assessor separately for the land and for the building is but an intermediate step of the ascertainment of the taxable value of the property as a whole.
