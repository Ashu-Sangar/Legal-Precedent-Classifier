The return took the form of 15,000 tons of magnesite to be delivered annually by Oemag to General; and although the initial agreement between the parties indicated that such tonnage was to be paid as “royalty and compensation” for General’s grant to Oemag of the use of certain patents and know-how, the “Supplemental Agreement” required and approved by the Austrian Government indicates rather clearly that the purpose of the magnesite payments was to provide a satisfactory return on its investment to General. The “Supplemental Agreement” stated that the magnesite was to be accepted “in lieu of dividends” and that Oemag shall pay no “additional dividends” in any year in which it pays magnesite to General. It also states that General may terminate the arrangement if it ceased to be the sole stockholder of Oemag or if the Austrian Government thereafter permitted Oemag to pay dividends in currency. Both of these latter conditions confirm the connection between the magnesite payments and General’s stock ownership in contrast to any sale or licensing of patents and know-how.</p>

Therefore, the Corporate Net Income Tax Act was amended, Act of August 7, 1936, P. L. 127, to provide for an additional deduction from net income “on account of any dividends received from any other corporation”. Obviously, this amendment not only permitted the elimination from Pennsylvania net income of 100% of dividends received from U. S. corporations, as before; it also contained no restriction on the source of the dividends to such United States corporations. As amended, the deduction applied to dividends received from foreign corporations, as well, and was thus more extensive than it had been prior to the federal changes.</p>

See Corporate Net Income Tax Act, §2(1) (b), 72 P.S. §3420b. While the federal tax provisions, as now contained in §§243 to 245 of the Code, once again provide for a deduction from federal gross income in arriving at federal taxable income rather than a credit against the latter, the only effect of this 1954 Code change was to require Pennsylvania to limit its deduction for dividends received to the extent such dividends are still included in federally ascertained taxable income. Thus, today (and in 1954), 85% of dividends received are eliminated from Pennsylvania net income because they are deducted from federal gross income in determining federal taxable income; while the remaining 15% of dividends received are subsequently deducted in computing Pennsylvania net income.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In this way Pennsylvania has retained a 100% <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>dividends received deduction policy in tbe determination of corporate net income.</p>

On the other hand, the language of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act, supra, does permit a 100% deduction for such dividends; and the parties here have stipulated that <em>cash </em>dividends so received have been recognized, at least during 1954 and subsequently, as deductible dividends received from “any other corporation”.

In fact, the value of the magnesite received by General in 1953, while reported by it as a dividend on its Federal income tax return, was ultimately determined by the Federal Government to be taxable as a royalty. In enacting the Code in 1954, however, Congress added Code §902(d) to the federal tax laws. Under this special provision the magnesite payments from Oemag to General are treated as a distribution and, hence, as a dividend if out of earnings and profits. On the other hand, the shares of stock received by General from Oemag in 1954 were includi<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>ble in income as a dividend in any event; and General received a federal administrative ruling to this effect.</p>

The Commonwealth, argues (1) that Pennsylvania “net income” (i.e., federal “taxable income”) is a figure ascertained prior to the Pennsylvania deduction for dividends received and, thus, that the status and characterization of the deduction for such dividends is governed by the Corporate Net Income Tax Act and not by the Code; (2) that under the Pennsylvania statute the distribution to General by Oemag was not a dividend; and (3) in any case only dividends received from other corporations doing business in Pennsylvania are deductible.</p>
    <p id="b196-5" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[202,1203,1148,476]]]'>General, on the other hand, contends that the dividends received deduction is one resorted to in determining Pennsylvania net income so that the federal definitions of its elements control; (2) the distribution in question was a dividend as that term is used both for tax and corporate purposes; and (3) nothing in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act restricts the deduction to devidends received from corporations doing business in Pennsylvania.</p>

Taxable income is defined for federal income tax purposes as “. . . gross income, minus the deductions allowed by this chapter. . . .” Code, §63. “This chapter” refers to all of the Code’s provisions regarding normal taxes and surtaxes on income as contained in § §1 through <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>1400 of the Code. In these hundreds of sections exist several groups of corporate deductions: (1) the itemized deductions allowed both individuals and corporations (Code, §§161-175); (2) the special deductions (including the dividends received deduction) allowed corporations (Code, §§241-248); and (3) various particular deductions allowed certain corporations and scattered throughout these sections such as the deduction for depletion (Code, §611), the deduction for exploration and development expenditures (Code, §§615, 616); the deduction for dividends paid by a regulated investment company (Code, §§852, 561); and the deduction allowed a Western Hemisphere Trade Corporation (Code, §922). The deduction of all these items from gross income leaves a particular taxpayer with its federal “taxable income”.</p>

One of these permits a deduction for dividends received from any other corporation to the extent such dividends are still included in federal taxable income. Only after these adjustments are made does the Act provide for the various allocations and apportionments applicable when a corporation transacts part of its business outside of Pennsylvania.</p>

The dividends received deduction stated in the Act is primarily an extension of the already permitted 85% deduction allowed by the Code; and it would be illogical to hold that while the latter 85% is determined by reference to the federal concept of dividends, the former 15% is computed only by reference to some differing state standard. That the state <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>deduction also encompasses a 100% deduction when the dividends received are from certain foreign corporations does not alter our conclusion. It is not the quantum or source of the dividend that governs; it is the nature of the receipt. Pennsylvania has chosen to treat all dividends alike, no matter what their source, as long as they are included in federal taxable income. If they are, they are deductible exactly as are those dividends federally allowed as a deduction in determining taxable income in the first instance.</p>
    <p id="b198-4" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[195,920,1147,801]]]'>Viewed in this light the initial question before us is not really, as suggested by the parties, whether the deduction in question is one made prior or subsequent to the determination of Pennsylvania net income. Rather, it is whether or not the Corporate Net Income Tax Act requires that the deduction be taken by reference to federal standards or state concepts (if, in fact, there is a difference between them). Since we have concluded that the Act inextricably ties the deduction to the Federal Code, the deduction is clearly subject to the federal definition. This conclusion follows from the language of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act and from the history of the deduction and is confirmed by the past administrative practices of the Commonwealth as stipulated by the parties.</p>

If a particular receipt is includible in federal gross income as a dividend, then its characterization as such must follow through to the full state deduction for dividends received, whether this be for the remaining 15% of dividends received from United States corporations or the entire 100% received from certain foreign corporations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Under <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>the particular wording of §§902(d), 301 and 316 of tbe Code, the distribution of tbe magnesite constituted a dividend to General; while its acquisition of the stock from Oemag was so characterized without resort to the special language of §902(d).
