      <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense to be pleaded under new matter rather than by preliminary objection, and that they must be given an opportunity to overcome the pleading of such a defense. It is true that we have held that ordinarily the statute of limitations must be pleaded as new matter pursuant to Pa. R. C. P. 1030. See <em>Quaker City Chocolate and Confectionery Company v. Delhi-Warnock Building </em>Association, <a href="/pa/357/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="357 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="472111" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0307-01">357 Pa. 307</a>, 314, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20597" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 A.2d 597">53 A. 2d 597</a>, 601 (1947). But plaintiffs did not raise any question in the court below of whether defendant’s pleading might be defective. Plaintiffs could easily have filed a preliminary objection to defendant’s preliminary objection in the nature of a motion to strike because of lack of conformity to law or rule of court under Pa. R. C. P. 1017(b)(2). 2 Anderson Pennsylvania Civil Practice §1017.14. Having failed to do so they may be deemed to have waived any objection to defendant’s form of pleading. Pa. R. C.

In effect, they treated defendant’s objection as new matter and answered it. In so doing they did not raise any issues of fact that might have to be tried; they simply asserted that the original action was timely. We fail to see what more they could have derived from a more strict course of pleading — a course which they did not insist upon themselves. Accordingly, there is no prejudice involved in our affirmance of the sustaining of a preliminary objection based upon the statute of limitations.

The rule was made returnable on October 30, 1961 and all proceedings were stayed in the meanwhile. A hearing was held on that date and apparently leave was granted to order the hearing for a later date. No further action was taken on the rule. Both parties raised a question below as to the propriety of entertaining further proceedings while the stay and resolution of the issues involved were outstanding.
