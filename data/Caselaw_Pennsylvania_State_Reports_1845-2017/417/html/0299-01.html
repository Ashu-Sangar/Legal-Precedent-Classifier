The word <em>shall </em>is, however, generally regarded as imperative. <em>National Transit Co. v. Boardman, </em><a href="/pa/328/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="328 Pa. 450" data-case-ids="1179724" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0450-01">328 Pa. 450</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.%20239" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="197 A. 239">197 Atl. 239</a> (1938); <em>Kuzmen v.

We look to the intention and purpose of the statute in determining whether the word <em>shall </em>is to be given a permissive or imperative meaning. <em>National Transit Co. v. Boardman, </em>supra, and we see no evidence in Section 13.2 of any legislative intention to give this word a permissive meaning only. In fact, a study of the statute indicates that an imperative meaning was clearly intended.</p>

The next sentence of the same section provides that where collective bargaining does not result in agreement with respect to any labor dispute the Authority <em>“shall </em>offer to submit such dispute to arbitration.” (Emphasis supplied.) There follows a detailed procedure for the selection <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>of arbitrators, a procedure carefully designed to insure that such selection will be handled expeditiously.

As a further expression of legislative reliance on arbitration to resolve disputes, Section 13.2 provides that the “determination of the majority of the board of arbitration thus established shall be final and binding on all matters in dispute.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

We must agree with the court below that “in such a context. . . the word ‘shall’ is meant to be used in its true grammatical imperative form . . . and that the section requires the Authority to submit the issue <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>to mandatory binding arbitration upon the failure of negotiations.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[196,815,1150,748]]]'>As an alternative argument, appellant contends that if Section 13.2 is construed to require compulsory arbitration by a private board of arbitrators, it is contrary to Article III, §20 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. That section provides that “the General Assembly shall not delegate to any special commission, private corporation or association, any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects, whether held in trust or otherwise, or to levy taxes or perform any municipal function whatever.” This contention ignores the construction given this constitutional provision in <em>Tranter v.

There the Legislature conferred upon the authority, as a public corporation, essential governmental functions. The authority was empowered to construct, maintain and operate bridges, tunnels, streets, highways, traffic distribution centers, and traffic circles. The authority was also authorized to collect fees, tolls, rentals and charges in connection with the authority’s property and projects. Here the Port Authority is also a public body performing essential governmental functions. The Port Authority is en<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>trusted with power to plan, acquire, hold, construct, improve, maintain and operate port facilities and a transportation system in Allegheny County and outside the County to the extent necessary for an integrated system. It has the additional power to fix and collect fares and rentals for its facilities and operations.</p>
    <p id="b341-3" data-blocks='[["BL_341.4",341,[173,749,1150,693]]]'>The statute involved in <em>Tranter </em>authorized Allegheny County and the City of Pittsburgh to grant and convey to the authority involved in that case certain real property which the county and city were already devoting to public use, including a tunnel owned by the county and a wharf owned by the city for which the city was receiving tolls. In the present case, any municipality or owner is authorized to grant or convey to the Port Authority any facility or any interest in real or personal property which may be used by the Authority. There, as here, the authority was given no power to levy taxes and no power to pledge the credit of the Commonwealth or of any political subdivision.</p>
    <p id="b341-4" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[171,1453,1151,803]]]'>After discussing the powers and limitations of the authority, this Court held in <em>Tranter </em>that any possible interference by private trustees with the operation of the authority was immaterial since it did not deal with municipal property, improvements, money or effects in the sense contemplated by the constitutional provision. Following <em>Tranter, </em>we here conclude that any interference by the board of arbitrators is constitutionally immaterial in the case before us. Nor could any action by the board of arbitrators contravene the policy underlying Article III, §20 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. The section was designed to prevent the separation of the power to incur debts from the duty of providing for their payment by taxation. <em>Tranter v.

In rejecting that contention, this Court said: “The State Authority cannot make laws, nor can it levy or collect taxes, and it is specifically denied the power to create any indebtedness in the name of the State. Its broad functions are to arrange for the construction of designated types of public improvements, for their financing and for the retirement of the obligations thus incurred.

      <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[151,1707,1149,447]]]'> The Port Authority Act provides that the Authority “shall offer to submit” labor disputes to arbitration by a board composed of three persons. Acceptance of this offer would constitute an agreement to arbitrate between the union and the Authority. Since the previous paragraph of the section provides that “the authority through its boards shall . . . enter into written contracts” with representatives of the employees, an agreement to arbitrate would appear to come within the ambit of §16 of the Arbitration Act of April 25, 1927, P. L. 381, §16, 5 P.S. §176, to whatever degree necessary to supplement the provisions of the Port Authority Act.</p>
