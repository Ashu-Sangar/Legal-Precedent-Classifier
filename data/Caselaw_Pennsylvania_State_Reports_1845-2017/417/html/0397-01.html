On September 8, 1959, the Township adopted an ordinance (No. 394) known as the “Sign Regulations” Ordinance<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (Sign Ordinance). This Sign Ordinance regulates signs, billboards, marquees and street clocks and makes it unlawful “to erect, repair, alter, relocate or maintain” any “sign or other advertising structure”, as defined in the ordinance, <em>anywhere in the Township, </em>without first securing an “erection permit” and paying a stipulated fee. Exempt from this ordinance are “on-site” real estate signs, professional name plates of a certain size, public, charitable or religious institutions’ “on-site” bulletin boards of a limited size, temporary construction signs of a limited size, occupational signs, memorial signs or tablets, traffic and municipal signs.</p>

By special exception of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, motels shall be permitted two signs on properties other than the motel site, such signs are restricted to the industrial area along the Pennsylvania Turnpike.”</p>

After passage of the amendment to §3(b), Norate applied thereunder for a special exception to install two metal signs, — 10' high, 24' wide and illuminated by floodlights — , advertising the motel. One sign was to be installed on the property of one Piunti, facing the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Turnpike), — five-eighths of a mile from the point at which the Turnpike intersects Easton Road — and the other sign was to be installed on the property of one Goodman, facing the Turnpike, — at the point where the Turnpike intersects Easton Road.</p>

An appeal was taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County.

The court below did have the power to pass upon the validity of this amendatory ordinance. The record reveals the validity of the ordinance was raised before and passed upon by the Board. However, regardless of whether such issue was raised, the court below, even without taking additional testimony, had the power to consider and decide this question: <em>Eller v.

It is surprising, to say the least, to find in an ordinance adopted as late as 1959 such an unlimited and unfettered delegation of power to a quasi-judicial body.
