This assessment consisted of a land valuation in the amount of $108,680 and a building and machinery valuation in the amount of $76,740.

The Board offered into evidence a certified transcript of the assessment of the property involved. Appellant then called a real estate expert who testified that the fair market value of the land was $20,200, and who further testified concerning the fair market values of several other properties. In arriving at these valuations, the expert witness indicated that he considered, among other things, sale and holding prices in the area, physical factors, location, and access to and from the properties involved. He also testified as to the assessed valuations of each of the properties and constructed ratios based on a comparison of assessed values to market values.

L. 853, §402, as amended, 72 P.S. §5020-402, real estate in Allegheny County is to be assessed at its actual value. The term actual value means the market value and market value has been defined as a price which a purchaser, willing but not obliged to buy, would pay an owner willing, but not obliged to sell, taking into consideration all uses to which the property is adapted and might in reason be applied. <em>Buhl Foundation v.

However, we, too, recognize what the Legislature has recognized — that, as a practical matter, in Allegheny County, as in many other counties, real estate is frequently assessed at a percentage which is less than market value. Thus, the Act just cited further provides that the assessors should accomplish equalization of the subject property in accordance with other assessments in the taxing district. And more importantly, Article IX, §1, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania provides that all taxes must be uniform on the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.</p>

In reversing that ruling, this Court concluded that “if an assessor, without actual fraud, negligently, foolishly, or capriciously assessed some properties at 10% of actual value, other similar properties at 20%, other similar properties at 50%, others at 75% and plaintiff’s at 90%, it would be unjust and ridiculous to hold that since there was no <em>fixed </em>ratio of assessed value <em>generally </em>throughout the district, plaintiff failed to prove a lack or violation of uniformity, which the Constitution requires.” Id. at 98, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20273" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="137 A.2d 273">137 A. 2d at 275</a>.

Although in <em>Rich </em>the taxpayer showed that his property had been assessed at 67.2% of its full value, while 76 newly-constructed houses were assessed at only 35%, we denied relief.

The thesis is that the taxpayer is injured by so much of the tax bill as exceeds his <em>pro rata </em>share of the burden of local government. True, there may remain some residual harm in that the dollar value of the reduction may be recaptured in another year from all properties including that of the successful appellant. But perfect relief is inherently impossible. If the taxpayer pays no more than his fair share for the year in question, practical justice is achieved. Surely, if the taxpayer who appeals is permitted to pay less than his fair share, the injustice to those who were overassessed but did not complain would be compounded. Hence, we held in Kents that an excessive assessment should be reduced to what it would have been if all taxable real property had been assessed equally.” <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.2d%2021" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="183 A.2d 21">Id. at 61</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.2d%2021" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="183 A.2d 21">183 A. 2d at 23</a>.</p>

Why, therefore, should the appellant be required to appeal from the total assessment with which he agrees, instead of from that part of the assessment with which he disagrees? The majority do not and cannot explain or justify their decision in this respect. Moreover, doesn’t it violate the majority’s theory of constitutional uniformity, i.e., that real estate is one indivisible class? Furthermore, if uniformity can be established only by considering the entire property as a unit, is it not unconstitutional to permit the imposition of a tax on land at a specified millage and one-half of said tax on a building which everyone knows is an integral part of the <em>entire </em>property?</p>
