    <p id="b480-8" data-blocks='[["BL_480.10",480,[192,1492,1149,529]]]'>Two separate taxes are involved, the first being the General Business Tax Act, Act of May 23, 1949, P. L. 1669, as amended, 24 P.S. §584.1 et seq., imposing a tax on the privilege of engaging in business within the School District of Philadelphia; and the second being the Philadelphia Mercantile License Tax imposed on the privilege of engaging in business in Philadelphia by |19-1001 et seq. of the Philadelphia Code, under authority granted by the Sterling Act, Act of August 5, 1932, P. L. 45, 53 P.S. §15971.</p>
    <p id="b480-9" data-blocks='[["BL_480.11",480,[192,2032,1148,307]]]'>The taxes levied in the two cases are, to all practical intents and purposes, the same, and if the disputed items of income are taxable, they are taxable in both cases. Sun’s position, simply stated, is that the income sought to be taxed was derived from “passive investments” and therefore not taxable.</p>

    <p id="b481-3" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[141,1357,1148,304]]]'>While we reiterate what we stated in <em>Brine, </em>namely, that all income of a business corporation need not necessarily be business income, a study of the instant record indicates that the items of income here disputed were derived, in fact, from business activities and, thus, are taxable.</p>

(hereafter referred to as ‘Halliburton’), East Texas Salt Water Disposal Company (hereafter referred to as ‘East Texas’), Sea-train Lines, Inc., (hereafter referred to as ‘Seatrain’), Compagnie Francaise Houdry (hereafter referred to as ‘Compagnie Francaise’) and General Crude Oil Company (hereafter referred to as ‘General Crude’).</p>

In 1924, appellant, by <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>purchase, acquired 100 shares at a price of $100 per share, representing 3.05% of the total stock outstanding. Between 1924 and 1955, various successive splits occurred, so that by August, 1955, appellant’s original 100 shares had been converted to 100,000 shares without any additional investment. In September 1957, appellant sold 70,000 shares of Halliburton in order to obtain capital for an expansion program of its rental facilities. The sale price was $63 per share which yielded to appellant a capital gain of $4,403,000. From 1924 to 1957, appellant was represented on Halliburton’s Board of Directors by one of its employees who was one of thirteen directors. Appellant, through the years of its ownership of the stock, made use of the services of Halliburton, and paid fees for such services. No preferential treatment was given to appellant with respect to terms, price or service. Through the years, appellant received dividends on its stock holdings.</p>

It was organized at the beginning of the Second World War. During the years here in question, appellant owned 4.53% of the stock of East Texas, and was represented by one director on a board of twenty-one, who was also a member of the Executive Committee of seven. Appellant benefited from the services of East Texas, but received no preferential treatment. If East Texas had not been organized and performed its services, appellant and other companies owning wells in the area would have suffered serious losses from contamination by salt water.</p>

However, it was conceded that appellant benefited from the availability of this means of freight transport. During the years in question appellant owned 18.83% of the outstanding stock of Seatrain, which represents the largest single bloc of voting stock.</p>

Appellant is also the owner of stock of American Houdry corporation and has included on its returns, for the years in question, in its tax bases, dividends received from American Houdry. Appellant is not represented on the Board of Directors of Compagnie Francaise.</p>
    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[136,1261,1153,529]]]'>“General Crude is engaged in production of crude oil. For a period of five months in 1957, appellant owned 1.8% of the stock. This stock was sold because (a) according to Texas law appellant was precluded from holding stock of another operating oil company and (b) capital was needed for expansion purposes. From 1954 through 1960, appellant was represented on the Board of Directors of General Crude by one of its employees. For many years appellant has purchased almost the entire production of General Crude.”</p>
