On January 29, 1964, a writ of execution issued directing the sheriff to levy upon and sell the property of Empire and to attach property of Empire in the possession of appellee, Insurance Company of North America, as garnishee of debts that it may owe to Empire and to notify garnishee that it “is ... enjoined from paying any debt to or for the account of the defendant(s) and from delivering any property of the defendant(s) or otherwise disposing thereof . . . .” On March 24, 1964 plaintiffs filed interrogatories to garnishee-appellee.</p>

In their answers to the Commissioner’s petition and garnishee’s preliminary objections plaintiffs admitted the Commonwealth Court’s order dissolving <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>Empire but denied that said order prevented them from prosecuting their attachment or execution against garnishee.</p>

By supplemental order the Commissioner was given leave to become a successor defendant to Empire by filing of record the material facts on which the right to substitution was based, in compliance with Pa. R. C. P. 2352(a). Further, the lower court overruled garnishee-appellee’s preliminary objections “(a)” and “(b)”, sustained objection “(c)”, and stayed execution until further order. Appeals were taken by. the Insurance Commissioner and by plaintiffs but the former was discontinued. Accordingly, the only matter before us is an appeal from the order sustaining the garnishee’s preliminary objection and staying execution.</p>

There defendant moved to open judgment and stay execution. The lower court did not open judgment but did stay execution. We said: “It is sufficient to say in regard to the appeal that the court did not open the judgment as a preliminary step; it merely stayed the execution and directed an issue to inform the conscience of the court whether an order opening the judgment should be made. ... An order which merely stays proceedings while such an investigation is being made, is not such an order from which an appeal can be taken under the Act of 1876. [This reference was intended to be to the statute making an order opening judgment appealable. Act of 1877, April 4, P. L. 53, §1, 12 P.S. §1099], When the court has made an order, based upon either depositions or the finding of the jury upon the issue, and the effect of such order is to refuse to open it, the case is ripe for an appeal under the Act of 1877.”</p>
