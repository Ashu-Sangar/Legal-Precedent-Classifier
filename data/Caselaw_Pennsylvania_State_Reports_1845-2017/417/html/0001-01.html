    <p id="b39-5" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[169,428,1147,584]]]'>This is an appeal from a judgment on the pleadings for defendant in a trespass action. Plaintiffs, husband and wife, alleged injuries as a result of the negligence of defendant doctor in connection with an operation to terminate wife-plaintiff’s pregnancy. In his responsive pleading, defendant, under <em>new </em>matter, averred that plaintiffs had told him and two psychiatrists deliberate falsehoods regarding wife-plaintiff’s emotional stability in order to procure the operation. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed the following pleading: “Reply to New Matter</p>
    <blockquote id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.7",39,[170,1024,1148,420]]]'>“Denied. Plaintiffs have been advised, believe and, therefore, aver that averments set forth in paragraph 6 through 17, inclusive, of defendant’s new matter does not set forth facts material to the above captioned cause of action in trespass, and that such averments are in fact irrelevant and immaterial to the above-captioned cause of action and need not be replied to under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b39-7" data-blocks='[["BL_39.8",39,[170,1457,1149,312]]]'>Defendant then moved for judgment on the pleadings. At oral argument on the motion plaintiffs requested leave to amend their reply in the event that the trial court found the new matter relevant. The trial court did not give leave to amend and entered judgment on the pleadings for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b39-8" data-blocks='[["BL_39.9",39,[170,1781,1150,586]],["BL_40.1",40,[208,377,1145,256]]]'>If plaintiffs had filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a motion to strike the new matter for impertinence, Pa. R. C. P. 1017 (b) (2), it would have been incumbent upon the lower court to determine whether the facts averred in the new matter were legally relevant to plaintiffs’ cause or whether they could have any influence in leading to the result. See 2 Anderson Pennsylvania Civil Practice, §1017.30, p. 480 (1960 ed.), <em>Lyme v. Olewine, Sr., </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/3/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Pa.

R. C. P. 1028(d). The court could not have entered judgment on the pleadings because the pleadings would not have been closed. Pa. R. C. P. 1084.</p>
    <p id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[206,648,1148,857]]]'>A motion to strike the new matter as not pertinent is like a demurrer to the new matter. Cf. <em>Cramer v.

D. &amp; C. 2d 624</a>, 638-639 (1963). “All that a demurrer does is to admit the facts for the <em>sole purpose </em>of testing the legal sufficiency of the challenged pleading; what it says in effect is that even if the facts set forth be true they do not constitute a legal claim, or defense to the claim, as the case may be. ‘A “demurrer” is not an absolute admission of any fact, but simply admits those facts that are well pleaded for the sole purpose of having their legal sufficiency determined by the court.’ . . . .” <em>Dippel v.

Defendant asserts this is merely a general denial and, therefore, an absolute admission under Pa. R. C. P. 1045(b) and 1029(b). But considering the entire response and the request to amend, in the event the court found the new matter relevant, it is clear that plaintiffs’ admission was intended only for the purpose of testing the legal relevancy of the new matter. Therefore, it was not a mere general denial.</p>

Defendant would not be unduly prejudiced by allowing plaintiffs’ claim to turn upon its justice rather than the skill of its pleader. <em>Rhodes v.
