An action for injuries on behalf of herself and her husband against the municipality and the Philadelphia Transportation Company followed. A jury returned a verdict against both defendants and awarded the husband $25,000 and the wife $15,000. Motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial were denied, although the court below did reduce the husband’s award, through an order of remittitur, to $10,000. Both defendants appealed.</p>

The wife-plaintiff, accompanied by her sister, was going from her home in Philadelphia to that of her sister, also in the same city. Alighting from a public conveyance at the corner of Germantown Avenue and Oxford Street, the two women proceeded, with Mrs. <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>Cuthbert on the curb-side of her sister, east along the north sidewalk of Oxford Street (a one way street with traffic allowed only from a west to east direction) until, after “some distance,” they arrived at the “T”type intersection of Oxford Street and 3d Street (also a one-way street with traffic allowed only from south to north), an uncontrolled intersection.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[202,768,1148,904]]]'>In the middle of each of these two streets are trolley rails which, by means of curved sections, swing from Oxford Street onto 3d Street. Along the inner side of the easternmost rail of part of this curved section was a depression in the street 3 to <em>á </em>inches in depth and 6 1/2 feet in length, characterized by witnesses for the city as a “tripping defect,” which defect had existed for a period of at least two years prior to the time of the present incident. Of the length of this depression, 18 inches lay south of the north line of the crosswalk (i.e., within the area of the crosswalk) across 3d Street, an area delimited by extensions of the north building line and north curb line of Oxford Street, and 5 feet lay north of the north line of the crosswalk. The evidence also indicated that there was a metal manhole cover lying between the said trolley rails some 3 feet north of the north line of the crosswalk.</p>

Seeing no moving traffic, the two women proceeded to cross the intersection. At this point the traffic control lights at the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Oxford Street changed, and Mrs. Cuthbert, hearing the screech of auto tires, became frightened. One car swung in an arc in front of her and then another swung behind her. Hurrying to complete crossing the street, Mrs. Cuthbert tripped and fell, causing the injuries for which this <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>suit was instituted. Mrs. Cuthbert testified that before she fell her foot “got caught in the hole by the rail.” She also stated she “knew” she had tripped over the depression, described hereinbefore, and identifed this depression on a photographic exhibit. Admittedly, however, she did not see the depression before she tripped, nor immediately thereafter. The first time she saw the depression was at a point of time after she had gone to the hospital for medical attention and returned to <em>“see what it was” </em>that had caused her to fall. (Emphasis added.) She could not, or at least did not, identify the exact portion of the crosswalk (shown by other uncontradicted testimony to be 144 inches wide), upon which she was walking at or before the time of the accident. However, she did state that she and her sister were walking upon the crosswalk together in a straight line, with her sister on the house or north side thereof, and her on the curb-line side. In this connection, it should be noted that the depression extended into the crosswalk for a distance of only 18 inches on the north side thereof.</p>

Considering the particular character of the defect and the testimony of the parties in regard thereto, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that allowing this defect to exist for a two-year period did not constitute actionable negligence.

In response, she said that she had not seen the defect when she stood on the northwest corner of the intersection, while she was crossing the intersection, nor after she had tripped. She testified that the first time she saw the defect was upon her return, obviously some time later, from the hospital after having received medical attention for her injuries. The only eyewitness other than Mrs. Cuthbert, her sister, was not called upon to testify as to whether or not she had seen the defect. While, during this direct examination, Mrs. Cuthbert testified that at the time she fell and thereafter, she “knew” that it was into this defect which she fell and identified it on an exhibit, there was absolutely no evidentiary fact upon which this conjecture could have been based, nor upon which the jury could have weighed it.

In doing so it has, as I view it, accomplished a palpable injustice to Mrs. Cuth<a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>bert and has inflicted serious damage to the body of the law of torts in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[206,497,1147,472]]]'>Mrs. Cuthbert is the only person who testified as to how she was injured. Her testimony, therefore, stands uncontradicted. The jury believed her and so indicated by its verdict. Mrs. Cuthbert starts across a street, exercising maximum caution, traffic conditions compel her to hurry, she stumbles against a two-year-existing defect in the street and falls. No one, I repeat, no one, contests that the accident happened the way Mrs. Cuthbert described it.</p>
    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[207,989,1149,857]]]'>But the majority says that there were other possibilities for her injuries. And one has to admit that there were. A thunderbolt may have fallen from the skies and struck her. An enemy may have thrown a hand grenade at her as she was crossing the street. Her bones may have been as brittle as match sticks and they all snapped at the crucial moment. Anything is possible in this possible world, but the world moves not on possibilities but on probabilities, on likelihoods, and on conclusions built on facts. Every fact in this case, every inference, every application of logic, every rule of cause and effect establish, not only by a preponderance of evidence, but by irrefuted and irrefutable evidence that Mrs. Cuthbert was hurt because of falling into the defect which the City and the Traction Company inexcusably allowed to exist for two years.</p>
    <p id="b654-6" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[207,1854,1148,476]]]'>The decision of the majority not only bespeaks a palpable injustice, it not only introduces a chaotic influence into the law of evidence and torts, but it also is that kind of a decision that will dishearten young lawyers who will go to the trouble of reading the record. Older practitioners will merely sigh and go on, because they realize the world is an imperfect world, and that, with all its virtues, the legal world has many “tripping defects.”</p>

Obviously had she seen this defect and still ran into it, she would have been guilty of contributory negligence. She knew very well, however, where she had fallen and she took a rapid survey of the environment at the time she fell. She could not study it minutely because she was bleeding and in great pain. She went to the hospital for treatment and then she returned to examine thoroughly the scene which had brought her to grief.</p>
    <p id="b655-3" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[183,889,1149,371]]]'>The majority apparently was more impressed by the statement made by the City attorney at the trial than by the entire record as to when Mrs. Cuthbert returned to the place of the accident. At the trial, counsel for the City objected to Mrs. Cuthbert’s testifying to street conditions and said: “It is too remote. The conditions within several months could vary.”</p>

She testified: “When my sister helped me up and we went to the hospital, <em>I knew what I tripped over </em>but all I was thinking about was to get some help for my legs. And then she helped me to the hospital, then after I was treated and the doctor told me to come back the next day I came back to my sister’s and we went around and looked, to see what it was, and then we saw the depression in the street. Q. And what did you see? A. I saw this, this hole under the rail, that my foot had went into, my toes. Q. Where was this? A. <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>In Oxford — Q. Where was this depression? A.

    <p id="b656-4" data-blocks='[["BL_656.4",656,[208,555,1148,695]]]'>The majority opinion says Mrs. Outhbert could not identify the exact portion of the crosswalk “upon which she was walking at or before the time of the accident.” That was never an issue in the case, nor was there any questioning about it. But she did testify, with mathematical precision, the exact spot where she fell. It would not matter where she was prior to the accident if she was at the defectively maintained ■ part of the street when she fell. And in this respect she testified with an engineer’s exactness. She drew on the photograph of the street a circle around the spot where she fell. How more specific does a witness need to be? How more specific can a witness be?</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[210,1263,1147,258]]]'>And then, out of the infinite nowhere, out of a conjectural nebulosity, out of the opalescent clouds of fanciful theory, the majority opinion says that: “Under her [Mrs. Cuthbert’s] own testimony, the depression was not in her path as she traversed the crosswalk.”</p>

The sister did not testify and Mrs. Cuthbert specifically stated that she walked in a straight line, and that that straight line lead directly to the spot where she fell, and which is the same exact spot where the' defect lurked. How, then, aside from appellate infallibility, may the Majority say that her testimony declares the depression was not in her path as she traversed the crosswalk?</p>
    <p id="b656-7" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[213,2075,1148,366]]]'>The jury confirmed Mrs. Cuthbert’s testimony as to how and where the accident occurred. The trial court confirmed the precise point of the tripping: “The photograph introduced yesterday shows the depression in the street under the rail, two or three inches and that is the place where she tripped. <em>No question about that at all. That evidence is absolute clear.</em>

    <p id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[168,1039,1148,370]]]'>The majority opinion states that: “While, during this direct examination Mrs. Cuthbert testified that at the time she fell and thereafter, she ‘knew’ that it was into this defect which she fell and identified it on an exhibit, there was absolutely no evidentiary fact upon which this conjecture could have been based, nor upon which the jury could have weighed it.”</p>

A troop of angels could not have testified with more specificity. What is an evidentiary fact? It is testimony in court, it is reliable testimony, and there is not a suggestion, not a zephyr of inference that Mrs. Cuthbert was other than a wholly reliable, credible witness.

But such an opinion can be predicated only on an uninhibited guess.

Why not guess that Mrs. Miller pushed her sister Mrs. Cuthbert into the hole or defect?
