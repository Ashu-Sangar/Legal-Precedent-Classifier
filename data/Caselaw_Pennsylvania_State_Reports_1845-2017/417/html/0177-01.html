      <em>v.

That case, provides no authority for the proposition that a vast area unrelated to the reasonable protection of the employer is capable of restriction.</p>
    <p id="b221-3" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[159,859,1166,1224]]]'>In the first instance, restrictive covenants which form part of a contract of employment, and are not ancillary to a buy-sell agreement, are subject to a more stringent test of reasonableness: <em>Alabama Binder &amp; Chemical Corp. v. Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical. Corp., </em>supra, and <em>Morgan’s Home Equipment Corp. v. Martucci, </em>supra. Although the <em>Alabama Binder </em>case upheld a restrictive covenant of 5 years duration covering the territorial United States, it is markedly distinguishable from the instant case. The covenant there was, in fact, ancillary to a buy-sell agreement, executed on the same day, whereby the covenantor sold his 50% of a business for a percentage of future profits, not to exceed $500,000 (which sum was earned and paid).Furthermore, the nature of the business (production of binder-material for floor tile) was such that there were only six customers for the product in the United States, ■■ and covenantor, having personally controlled customer relations for covenantee, was familiar with and known to all of the potential customers for the product within the United States. In such a situation, the covenant was clearly directly related to the protection of the business which covenantor left.</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[161,2104,1149,262]],["BL_222.1",222,[196,374,1150,1236]]]'>In the present ease, the covenant is excessive in total effect. The nature of Albee’s business is such that the convenantor is in a position to know only a very few customers in a limited area. The testimony shows that the identity of customers was gained by personal con<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>tacts between them and tbe salesman at the model home location. That these contacts, gained for instance in Cleveland, Ohio, could be of no use to a salesman moving to Trenton, New Jersey, is clear beyond question. No doubt the covenant is enforceable as to an area within 50 miles of the place of employment by the covenantee, for we can see a direct and reasonable connection to the protection of business in such a restriction, especially where, as here, the restriction is limited in time to a period of one year after termination of employment. But to allow the covenant to extend its tentacles throughout an area so vast as here envisioned would be to allow an unreasonable restraint on trade. It would prevent the covenantor from seeking employment in the field for which he is trained without any regard to reasonable protection for the employer. In its present form,|the covenant is more of a penalty for termination of employment than it is an employer-protection device!^ The provision is {¿especially burdensome when we consider 1) that the contract is terminable at the will of the employ errand 2) that Albee’s business is ever expanding to encompass greater areas of competition.</p>
    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[195,1622,1149,750]],["BL_223.1",223,[178,381,1148,150]]]'>Consequently, we conclude that the wide-spread prohibition envisioned by this restrictive covenant is (unrelated to the protection of the employer, and that, therefore, as written)] the covenant is unenforceable to the full extent claimed by Albee. Cf., <em>Samuel Stores, Inc. v. Abrams, </em><a href="/conn/94/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="94 Conn. 248" data-case-ids="389409" data-case-paths="/conn/94/0248-01">94 Conn. 248</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.%20541" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="108 A. 541">108 A. 541</a> (1919). On the other hand, it is also clear that inducing Albee’s employees to terminate and violate their employment contracts and then to work for Caddie within 50 miles of their actual former employment was wrongful and conduct from which Albee should be protected. We also consider the covenant divisible and enforceable when restricted to reasonable geographical limits. See <em>Barb-Lee Mobile Frame Co. v. Hoot, </em><a href="/pa/416/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="416 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1893058" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0222-01">416 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%2059" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="206 A.2d 59">206 </a><a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a><a href="/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%2059" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="206 A.2d 59">A. 2d 59</a> (1965).
