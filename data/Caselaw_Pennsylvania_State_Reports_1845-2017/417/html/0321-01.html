    <p id="b359-6" data-blocks='[["BL_359.10",359,[166,1417,1150,802]]]'>On the evening of August 8, 1960, E. Newbold Smith, a graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, married and a father of three children, was driving his car northwardly on Eoute 202 in Thornbury Township, Chester County, when he stopped at a Dairy Queen stand to purchase the telltale cone. Munching on this confection he drove his car on to the adjacent property of a Sunoco gasoline station and then crossed over the medial strip of Eoute 202 to the northbound lane to resume his journey. The Chief of Police of Thornbury Township, Frank H. Elliott, who was in the gasoline station at the time, stated later that when Smith reentered Eoute 202, he emerged in front of another car, forcing it over the center line. No collision occurred nor did any damage result from this traffic incident.</p>

It is not clear whether Smith knew that Elliott was following him, but when they both reached a point where <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>Route 202 intersects with Route 926, Elliott ordered Smith to pull over to the side of the road, which he did. What happened from then on depends upon whose story is to be accredited. Smith testified later that Elliott approached him angrily, demanding cards. Smith dropped his ice cream cone and reached into his inside pocket for his driver’s card when Elliott struck him over the head with a blackjack. Stunned by astonishment as well as by the physical impact, Smith recoiled, but when he received “another crack on the head,” he struck back at Elliott and they both fell to the ground, now striking at one another furiously, employing both feet and hands and interspersing their fistic and pedal fusillade with attempted chokings on one another.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[193,1189,1149,856]]]'>Elliott, on his side, testified later that after he and Smith had parked their cars at the side of the road, he approached Smith, who was standing behind his car, and asked him for his driver’s license and owner’s card, holding in his own hand at the time a pad and pencil. Elliott said he saw Smith make a motion with his left hand “as though going toward the back of his trousers,” and the next thing he knew he was on the ground, having been struck in the face over the left eye. While they were on the ground with Smith on top, Elliott reached up to seize Smith’s necktie and attempted to twist it to shut off Smith’s breath. He then kicked him in the stomach. At the height of the fistic, wrestling, kicking and strangling duel, two men from a nearby gasoline station ran up and separated the bleeding antagonists.</p>

    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[159,815,1149,315]]]'>Smith complained to the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania of the mistreatment he states he received at the West Chester Police Station.

At the trial which followed in Chester County, Smith was convicted of assault and battery but acquitted on all other indictments. He was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment and a $1000 fine. During the trial each side strove to prove that it was the opposing adversary who had precipitated the sanguinary bout. The stories told by the principals, Smith and Elliott, were irreconcilable.</p>

Mrs. Yvonne Corcoran, who was driving the car, said she saw Smith strike Elliott. Miss Elizabeth Sweet, who was a passenger in the car, testified she saw Smith strike Elliott to the ground and repeatedly punch him. Their testimony generally seemed to favor the position that Smith had been the aggressor in the pitched battle at the crossroads, al<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>though some question could arise as to whether their view and their period of view encompassed all that occurred.</p>

Elliott of Thornbury Township and police officers Harry Saltzman and Gordon W. Smith together with certain other West Chester Borough officers willfully subjected E.

At this point, it appeared that the subpoena had issued without the approval of the court of quarter <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>sessions, in violation of a Chester County rule of court.

After Miss Sweet had testified in full and Mrs. Corcoran had testified on direct, but not in cross-examination, defendant’s counsel renewed his application for a subpoena duces tecum requiring the production of the F.B.I.’s file in the matter, “particularly with reference to the statements given by these ladies.” The court denied the motion, stating it would not consider its previous ruling.</p>
    <p id="b363-5" data-blocks='[["BL_363.6",363,[127,1896,1149,257]]]'>Smith was convicted and he appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the conviction.

The only demand with which the federal government has been confronted has been, as noted, the original blanket demand for practically the entire contents of a voluminous file relating to an ongoing investigation — a demand as to which the Department properly asserted privilege in the motion to quash the defense’s subpoena.

Certainly there would have been no point in the Solicitor General’s having made this observation if the facts did not warrant a release of the Sweet-Corcoran statements for the defendant’s use at a trial involving his name, reputation and liberty.</p>

    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[128,1303,1152,847]]]'>To the contrary, Smith had the right to, and great need for, the statements he requested.

Since the process sought to be here invoked had to do with documents in possession of the Federal government, the 6th Amendment would apply, and a refusal to comply with the mandate would amount to denial of due process guaranteed under the 14th Amendment.</p>

The preamble of the United States Constitution reads: “We the people,” and not, “We, the States.” The United States Supreme Court has been giving increasing expression to these basic rights of citizenship.

If the case at bar were being tried in a federal court, there can be no question that the FBI statements here under focal attention would be supplied to the defendant and they would be used at the trial. Nor can there be any surmise that if the Sweet and Corcoran statements had been collected by the Pennsylvania State Police, this Court would order the State Police to surrender the statements to the defendant for his trial in the State court. With this irrefutable premise, it can only be a paradox beyond compare to say that, because this case adds up the guarantees of both Federal and State governments, that the total is less than the individual parts; that while Smith would be allowed federal documents in a federal court and state documents in a state court, he cannot, with both the Federal and State governments looking on, obtain a federal document to use in a state court, where his basic constitutional rights, both Federal and State, are involved.

The Commonwealth argued that since, in a robbery-murder, every participant in the robbery would be guilty of murder, it did not matter whether or not Almeida’s finger pulled the revolver trigger which caused the victim’s death. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals, with Chief Judge Biggs speaking, held that it was a denial of due process for Almeida not to have had access to the statement in question: “We are of the opinion that the suppression of it [the statement] uncorrectable on appeal since it was not in the record, did cause the Commonwealth to overreach Almeida and to deprive him of due process of law.”</p>

It is also drastically different from concluding that our courts may and must obtain such disclosure, at the risk of unconstitutionally denying a fair trial, when the pertinent statements are in the hands of federal officials. Weighty consequences would attach to imparting the concept of constitutional imperatives presented in the other opinion which an<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>nounces our result. For example, the federal government, for valid reasons of privilege, can always refuse to disclose statements in its possession. I also have little doubt that, even beyond questions of privilege, the federal government could refuse to reveal, in state court proceedings, material in its possession. Out of comity, no doubt, these instances may be seldom, but the fact— legitimate power to refuse — remains. If I understand the other view expressed in support of the grant of a new trial, its effect is that if the federal government refused to comply with a request for statements, a fair trial in a state court cannot be constitutionally had, and the defendant must go untried. I think such a holding would go beyond what is necessary and, more importantly, beyond what is wise and sound. If Mr. Justice Brennan is correct in his belief that the <em>Jenchs </em>case also has a constitutional premise,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> then, in my view, the state, at the most, would be compelled to do its best to obtain the documents in question.

I agree. It would be manifestly inappropriate to hold that a state trial court erred when it quashed a subpoena for F.B.I. records after the U. S. Attorney has stated to the court that it would not be obeyed and when no citation for contempt may issue because of such disobedience. See <em>United States ex rel. Touhy v.

In so defining the issue I am guided, at the United States Supreme Court’s suggestion, by the Memorandum of the Solicitor General of the United States. He says: “The only demand with which the federal government has been confronted has been, as noted, the original blanket demand for practically the entire contents of a voluminous file relating to an ongoing investigation — a demand as to which the Department properly asserted privilege in the motion to quash the defense’s subpoena. The Department has never been requested to consider whether, in the interests of justice, the information contained in either Miss Sweet’s or Mrs. Cochrane’s statement to the F.B.I. should be made available to the court and counsel in the Pennsylvania prosecution.</p>

Since no question of federal privilege or of the consequences of the assertion of a federal privilege is involved, the United States has no official interest in the case.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[190,822,1149,805]]]'>The second suggested issue, namely, whether counsel distinguished his subsequent requests for a subpoena from his initial catch-all demand <em>with sufficient clarity to present the question </em>to the trial court of whether it should issue a subpoena for specific documents which would have called upon the federal government to decide whether to furnish only the statements by witnesses Corcoran and Sweet, is clearly the pivotal issue. If counsel did not so distinguish then the Commonwealth cannot be considered to have denied defendant any right. Rather, the trial court merely refused to issue a subpoena of a type which had properly been quashed before when the U. S. Attorney indicated that the federal government did not intend to comply.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[192,1638,1148,752]],["BL_389.1",389,[122,393,1151,799]]]'>The crucial determination can be made only by reading the record, pertinent parts of which are set forth in the first part of this opinion. First, the original catch-all subpoena duces tecum which was issued, and which was properly quashed by the trial court, commanded the production of F.B.I. reports showing “[statements of all witnesses, diagrams, sketches and photographs taken in connection with investigation of incidents on Monday, August 8, 1960 . . . .” Second, the subsequent petition for a subpoena, while it indicates in paragraph 4 that the F.B.I. reports contain statements of the two witnesses, does not distinguish, in its request, between the materials sought by it and the materials sought by the subpoena previously is<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>sued and properly quashed. The petition prays for the “issuance of a subpoena duces tecum in the form now in the records of this case/’ i.e., the catch-all subpoena quoted above. Third, the final request for a subpoena, made orally at trial, was “to renew the application that we made ... to produce the Federal Bureau of Investigation file of an examination of this matter particularly with reference to the statement given by these ladies.” Nowhere in this record do I see a clear, unequivocal request for the statements given by Miss Sweet and Mrs. Corcoran alone. In fact, each of the subsequent requests demands the entire records and files of the F.B.I. in the matter — a demand with which the U. S. Attorney had already indicated noncompliance.</p>
    <p id="b389-3" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[123,1214,1151,1179]],["BL_390.1",390,[188,378,1150,801]]]'>In light of the Solicitor General’s Memorandum, I do not comprehend how a majority of this Court failed to perceive the pivotal issue. If the issue had been perceived and the record studied a majority surely would have concluded that it was unnecessary to decide any other question; no right having been asserted by defendant, none could have been denied. Assuming, however, that a majority had addressed itself to the pivotal question and concluded, differently than I have, that the second or third requests for a subpoena was sufficiently limited, the next question logically would seem to be whether the trial court’s refusal was reversible error. This would depend upon whether or not the error was “harmless”, a question which we have confronted on numerous occasions. While the answer may not always be easy we have never had so much difficulty, as we have had here, in perceiving the question. More specifically, the matter involves a question of exclusion of evidence. If the defendant had actually had possession of the statements made to the F.B.I. by witnesses Corcoran and Sweet and had attempted to introduce them into evidence at the trial <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>would the exclusion by the trial court have been “harmless” error under the circumstances? If we would hold that it was not “harmless” error we would also have to hold that a refusal to subpoena such evidence was not “harmless” error. Accordingly, we would order a new trial. (Of course, if the trial court knew for a fact that the F.B.I. would not obey a <em>properly limited request </em>it would not even be error to refuse to issue the subpoena because it could not compel the F.B.I. to obey. See <em>Touhy, </em><a href="/us/340/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="340 U.S. 462" data-case-ids="6931590" data-case-paths="/us/340/0462-01">supra.</a> It need not take a useless action which can produce nothing but embarrassment.) I shall not discuss my opinion on whether the assumed error was “harmless” or not because the answer is not relevant to my view of the case.</p>
    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[192,1196,1148,1177]],["BL_391.1",391,[136,376,1150,744]]]'>While I am surprised at the failure of a majority to perceive and dispose one way or the other of the pivotal question, I am completely bewildered by the undue and confusing consideration given to <em>Jencks v. U. S., </em><a href="/us/353/0657-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="353 U.S. 657" data-case-ids="6161923" data-case-paths="/us/353/0657-01">353 U. S. 657</a> (1957) and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. The import of the former, even if we assume it had due process overtones, was the United States Supreme Court’s holding that, in the interest of fair play, if the federal prosecutor refused to supply properly requested evidence in a federal prosecution it would be required to drop the prosecution. Here, the prosecution, i.e., the Commonwealth, is not refusing to supply anything. True, in <em>Jenelcs </em>it was also held that the federal trial judge <em>must issue </em>the properly requested subpoena but we do not need <em>Jenelcs </em>to gauge the propriety of the trial judge’s refusal here. The standard to be applied is that of “harmless” or “harmful” error. As to the Sixth Amendment, I am not aware that it contains a right and duty which is both applicable to the trial of the issue before us and imposed upon the states by virtue of its inclusion in the Fourteenth Amendment. At <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>least, the late Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in an article published immediately before his death, did not indicate that any such part of the Sixth Amendment has been carried over to the due process clause. See Frankfurter, Memorandum on ‘Incorporation’ of the Bill of Rights Into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20746" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="78 Harv. L. Rev. 746">78 Harv. L. Rev. 746</a>, 760-764 (1965). Moreover, why should this Court address itself to the commands of the federal constitution before it directs its attention to its own constitutional mandates? Article I, §9 thereof provides: “In all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard . . . [and] to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b391-3" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[138,1141,1148,196]]]'>Again, I will not discuss whether in a case which properly presents the issue this clause would require the issuance of a subpoena under present circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[140,1358,1148,637]]]'>Unfortunately, this Court has not produced an opinion which authoritatively informs the losing litigant why it lost or which authoritatively sets forth legal principles to be resorted to as precedent in future litigation. Only the result commands a majority. It would have been far better if a majority had decided that defense counsel’s second or third request for a subpoena was properly limited and that, in the circumstances, the trial judge’s refusal to issue such subpoena was “harmful” error. Instead we have an unauthoritative variety of unclear expressions on important issues which we need not have reached.</p>
    <p id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[141,2009,1148,198]]]'>In my view defense counsel’s failure — whether knowing or simply inept — to request a subpoena properly limited in scope is dispositive. Accordingly, I would affirm.</p>
