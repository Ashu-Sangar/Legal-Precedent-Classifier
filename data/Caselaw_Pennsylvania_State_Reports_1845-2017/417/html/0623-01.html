By the employment of the words “public hearings”, the “first of such hearings” and “hearings” in §4112, the legislature clearly indicated its intent that, <em>before </em>council could <em>consider </em>proposed zoning legislation, council must have granted and concluded “hearings”, i.e., meetings at which members of the public were given the right to air their views before the council and that of such right to be heard the public had been notified. In the case at bar, the published notice simply stated that at a fixed time and place the city council would <em>consider </em>the adoption of a zoning ordinance; no notice was given to the public that, at such fixed time and place, a “hearing” would be held at which members of the public could express their views.

A “hearing” contemplates more than mere <em>attendance </em>by the public; it connotes a meeting which the public has the right to attend <em>and </em>the right to be <em>heard. </em>As stated in <em>People v.

The provisions of §4112 are mandatory, the city council, in the enactment of this zoning ordinance, failed to follow the provisions of the enabling statute and the resulting legislation must fall. The omission to include in the notice the fact that a “hearing” would be held on the fixed date is not an unimportant or slight omission nor is our construction of §4112 technical. The right to be heard and to express one’s views on proposed zoning legislation is a valuable right mandated by the legislature and a failure on the part of the councilmanic body to <em>inform </em>the public that such right was available for exercise at a fixed time and place is fatal to any ensuing legislation.</p>
