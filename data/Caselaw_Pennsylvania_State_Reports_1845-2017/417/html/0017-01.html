    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.8",55,[181,741,1148,197]]]'>This appeal questions the correctness of the lower court’s entry of a judgment of compulsory nonsuit in a personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident.</p>
    <p id="b55-7" data-blocks='[["BL_55.9",55,[179,959,1150,520]]]'>This is the factual background: Seventh Street is a two-way, paved public street, 27 feet in width, running east and west in the City of Chester. At the point involved herein, North Street runs into Seventh Street from the southerly side, forming a “T” intersection. About 8 feet to the east, North Street continues at a jog as an unimproved, dirt alley on the northerly side of Seventh Street. Buildings abut the alley on both sides, and the building line nearest Seventh Street is 12 feet from the curb thereof.</p>
    <p id="b55-9" data-blocks='[["BL_55.10",55,[180,1499,1148,801]]]'>On a clear, dry afternoon, the defendant was operating an automobile in a westerly direction on Seventh Street (in the middle thereof), approaching the intersection before described. He was traveling at a speed of 25 miles per hour. At the time, the minor plaintiff, Marlin Zernell, aged seven years, was playing in the North Street alley with a young companion. The latter kicked a ball over Zernell’s head and it traveled from the alley into Seventh Street. Zernell gave chase to retrieve it and ran from the alley into the roadway. As he was picking up the ball, he was hit by the right fender of the defendant’s automobile. The impact drove Zernell a distance of from 10 to 15 feet, causing serious injuries. Defendant’s automobile came to a stop 10 feet from the point of impact.</p>

However, for <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>negligence to exist, the evidence must establish that the child was on the highway and visible to the driver for a sufficient period of time to give the latter a reasonable opportunity to see him and avoid the accident: <em>Flagiello v.

If the child suddenly comes into the pathway of an automobile and immediately in front of it, and the driver, in the exercise of due care, does not have a reasonable opportunity to avoid the accident, then he cannot be held responsible. See, <em>Martin v.

    <p id="b57-4" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[174,976,1148,584]]]'>The crucial question, therefore, is whether or not the minor plaintiff was in the roadway for a sufficient period of time before the accident that the defendant, in the exercise of due care, should have seen him and avoided the accident. There is a conflict in the testimony on this vital point and it is fundamental that all conflicts must be resolved in plaintiffs’ favor, and also that the plaintiffs must be given the benefit' of all favorable testimony and every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom: <em>Penn v. Isaly Dairy Co., </em><a href="/pa/413/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="413 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1888635" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0548-01">413 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.2d%20322" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="198 A.2d 322">198 A. 2d 322</a> (1964).</p>

He testified that the minor plaintiff ran between two parked automobiles on the northerly side of Seventh Street right in front of his automobile immediately before the impact, without giving him time to see him and to come to a stop. If this testimony were unrebutted, it would be conclusive and determinative: <em>Rogan Estate, </em><a href="/pa/404/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="404 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1301477" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0205-01">404 Pa. 205</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.2d%20177" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="171 A.2d 177">171 A. 2d 177</a> (1961), and <em>Kline v.

However, other testimony established that there were no parked cars in the area on Seventh Street. Also, other witnesses testified that on the night of the accident the defendant, in offering an explanation of the occurrence, stated that he first saw the ball come into the street and then saw the boy <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>crawling on his hands and knees in the roadway. This testimony, coupled with the fact that the minor plaintiff had traversed several feet across the roadway before being hit (which necessarily follows from the defendant’s own testimony that his automobile was in the middle of the roadway at the time), could lead reasonable minds to the conclusion that the boy was visible in the roadway for sufficient time to give the defendant, in the exercise of due care, a reasonable opportunity to see him and avoid the accident.</p>
