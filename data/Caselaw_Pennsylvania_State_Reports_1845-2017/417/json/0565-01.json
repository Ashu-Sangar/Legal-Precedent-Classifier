Defendant maintains that since the plaintiffs breached the sales agreement the equity action cannot be pursued.\nThe chancellor determined that plaintiffs were entitled to a decree directing partition, which decree was affirmed by the court en banc. We agree with the determination of the chancellor that the agreement to purchase was not fully performed by the defendant and that the plaintiffs properly rescinded the agreement, thus permitting them to pursue the partition action. The order of partition was properly decreed.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
