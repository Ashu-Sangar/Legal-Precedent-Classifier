The defendants filed preliminary objections which were overruled. The trial Court subsequently certified the case to the law side of the Court. From this \u201ccertification\u201d Order, Ridge appealed to this Court.\nThis appeal must be quashed. As we said in McFarland v. Weiland Packing Co., Inc., 416 Pa. 277, 206 A. 2d 18 (at p. 279) : \u201cAn order certifying an equity action to the law side of the court is an interlocutory order which has not been made appealable by statute: Nachod v. Nachod, 402 Pa. 60, 166 A. 2d 18 (1960), and White v. Young, 402 Pa. 61, 166 A. 2d 663 (1960). . . .\u201d\nAppeal quashed. Costs to be paid by appellant.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nHereinafter called \u201cRidge.\u201d",
