    "head_matter": "Goss, Appellant, v. Spencer.\nEquity \u2014 Equity jurisdiction \u2014 Equity practice \u2014 Pleading\u2014Answer \u2014 Decision in limine \u2014 Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. khO \u2014 Ejectment hill \u2014 Certification to law side.\n1. Where an answer to a bill in equity avers \u201cthat the said bill of complaint is a mere ejectment bill, raising only the question of the naked title to the right of possession of the land described in said bill, that it does not set forth any equitable jurisdiction of thig case, and this court has not jurisdiction,\u201d the provision of the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, that \u201cif a demurrer or answer be filed averring that tbe suit should have been brought at law, that issue shall be decided in limine,\u201d is sufficiently complied with and the court has jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the bill in limine.\n2. Equity has no jurisdiction of a bill filed by a plaintiff out of possession of certain real property and claiming legal title to the same based upon the alleged nullity of a certain deed, where defendant claims upon the alleged validity of the same deed, and where the bill prays that defendant, who is in possession, be restrained from asserting such possession. Such a case is a plain dispute concerning legal title and possession, in which an action of ejectment affords a complete remedy at law, to be first invoked before going into equity for incidental relief. It is not error for the court to certify such a case to the law side of the court as an action of ejectment.\nArgued March 16, 1914\nAppeal, No. 340, Jan. T., 1913, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. Bradford Co., Sept. T., 1912, No. 5, in equity, certifying case to law side of the court in case of Helen L. Goss v. Nelson D. Spencer.\nBefore Fell, C, J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity to remove cloud from title to land.\nFuller, P. J., specially presiding, filed the following opinion:\nThe answer is prefaced by the averment \u201cthat the said bill' of complaint is a mere ejectment bill, raising only the question of the naked title to the right of possession of the land described in said bill, that it does not set forth any equitable jurisdiction of this case, and this court has not jurisdiction.\u201d\nThis does not explicitly aver \u201cthat the suit should have been brought at law,\u201d as provided in the in limine Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 440, but it does so aver in substance, and the plaintiff interposes no objection on this point.\nIf the bill were based entirely upon the proposition that the deed from husband and wife to the husband was a nullity with, recognition, however, of defendant\u2019s right to have present possession as tenant by the curtesy, and with a prayer only for cancellation, we would be inclined to find jurisdiction as in case of an ordinary bill quia timet.\nBut the bill goes farther, by averring in the fifth paragraph \u201cthat by the defendant\u2019s acts and perverse and unlawful conduct he should justly forfeit and be es-topped from claiming even his life use of said lands by the curtesy of England, and your orator contends all the defendant\u2019s rights have been so defeated,\u201d and by including the prayer, \u201c(c) that the said Nelson D. Spencer be decreed by his acts and conduct to have forfeited his rights as tenant by the curtesy of England in the said premises, and that he be estopped from asserting any title or ownership not only in the title of said lands but to all use and possession of the same.\u201d\nThe situation then is this:\nPlaintiff claims legal title to the property, basing the claim upon the alleged nullity of a certain deed; defendant also claims legal title, basing the claim upon the alleged validity of the said deed; plaintiff is out of possession, asserting right to have possession, and praying that defendant, who is in possession be restrained from asserting such possession.\nThe case resolves itself, therefore, into a plain dispute concerning the legal title and possession, in which an action of ejectment affords a complete remedy at law, to be first invoked before coming into equity for incidental relief.\n(b) Deciding, therefore, that the suit should have been brought at law, we certify the cause to the law side of the court as an action of ejectment, at the cost of the plaintiff.\nThe court certified the case to the law side of the court as an action of ejectment. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in certifying the case to the law side of the court.\nJ. Boy Lilley, of Lilley & Wilson, for appellant.\nCharles M. Culver, with him J. C. Ingham, for appellee.\nMarch 30, 1914:"
