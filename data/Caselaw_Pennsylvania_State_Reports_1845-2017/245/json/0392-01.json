        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe question for determination in this case is: Did the plaintiff, Charles M. Lea, take an estate tail enlarged to a fee, or but a life estate?\nThe testator gave the residue of his estate to his wife for life, and directed that at her death the property should he divided into shares. The devise to the plaintiff was as follows: \u201cTo my son Charles I devise a life estate in his share, if he shall then be living. Upon his decease his share of said realty shall pass to his descendants who shall then be living, who shall take the same in remainder, in such proportions, with like force and effect as they would have taken said real estate had he then died actually seized and possessed thereof.\u201d\nThe issue arose in a case stated wherein it was agreed that if it should be decided that Charles M. Lea took a fee, judgment should be entered for him, otherwise for the defendant. The plaintiff secured the judgment and the defendant has appealed.\nThe court below sustained the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the terms of the devise gave him an estate tail which, under the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, and the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, was enlarged to a fee. We cannot agree in this conclusion; for it is apparent that the testator did not intend to use the word \u201cdescendants\u201d in the sense of \u201cheirs of the body\u201d of the first taker, but simply to designate a certain set of persons to take directly from him, the testator, at a given time.\nThe words of the will are not sufficient in themselves to create an estate in fee-simple, for \u201cdescendants\u201d does not comprehend \u201cheirs\u201d at law generally (Bates v. Gillette, 132 Ill. 287, 298); and the phrase \u201cwho shall be then living\u201d restricts the word \u201cdescendants\u201d to those alive at the time of the death of the first-taker, thereby negativing the idea of a devise to \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d or descendants to the remotest degree, which is the essential attribute of an estate tail. It is quite true that the phrase \u201cshall pass to his descendants\u201d strongly suggests an intent to make the first-taker the source of inheritable succession, and had the devise ended at that point, it could well be held to create an estate tail; but it did not, and this is the pinch of the case.\nA clear statement of the principle which controls under circumstances such as presented here, is to be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Sharswood, in Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 481, 484, where he said: \u201cIt is a position not open to dispute that if it appear, either by expression or clear implication, that by the word \u2018issue\u2019 (in this case, \u201cdescendants\u201d) the testator meant......issue living at a particular period, as at the death of the first taker, and not the whole line of succession, which would be included under \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 it must necessarily be construed to be a word of purchase, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case can have no application\u201d; and again, in Robins v. Quinlivin, 79 Pa. 333, 335, where it is stated, \u201cIf there be on the face of the will sufficient to show that the word was intended......to be applied only to...... descendants of a particular class at a particular time, it is to be construed as a word of purchase, and not of limitation\u201d ; and in Jones v. Jones, 201 Pa. 548, 550, where Mr. Justice Brown said, \u201cWhen a testator annexes words of explanation to heirs or heirs of the body, as to heirs now living, etc., using the term as a mere descriptio personarum, or for the specific description of individuals, a new inheritance is thereby engrafted upon the heirs to whom the estate is given (4 Kent Com. 221), and they will be assumed to take as purchasers: Kuntzleman\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 142.\u201d Also see, McCann v. McCann, 197 Pa. 452, 459; Hill v. Giles, 201 Pa. 215, 217; Findlay v. Riddle, 3 Binney 139, 166. The principle is different, however, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case applies whenever technical words of limitation, like \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs of the body,\u201d appear without more; and this is so even when superadded words of limitation are present, if they do not actually demonstrate that the technical words which precede them are intended merely to designate specific individuals, and, generally speaking, a phrase, such as \u201cmay be then living,\u201d is not sufficient in itself to reduce these technical terms to words of purchase (Harrison v. Harris, 245 Pa. 397; Crisswell\u2019s App., 41 Pa. 288; Cockins\u2019 App., 111 Pa. 26, and Heister v. Yerger, 166 Pa. 445). But this last principle has no application in the present case; for here \u201cheirs\u201d is not used, and the word which is employed, \u201cdescendants,\u201d is not of like force, \u201cat most, it is only the equivalent of issue\u201d (Wains\u2019 Est., 189 Pa. 631, 632-3), which is a word that \u201cyields readily to a context indicating its use as a word of purchase\u201d (Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383) and which, prima facie, \u201chas not the same significance as \u2018heirs of the body\u2019......\u201d (Anderson Law Dictionary). \u201cDescendants\u201d is not a technical word of limitation; and whenever in a devise a word appears which is not strictly one of limitation, if the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is sought to be applied by analogy, the burden rests upon him who claims such word to be the equivalent of \u201cheirs\u201d or \u201cheirs of his body\u201d to demonstrate from the language of the will that it was so intended (Stout v. Good, supra).\nThe testator uses the word \u201cdescendants\u201d several times; he first provides that, at the death of his widow, his property shall be divided \u201cinto as many parts and shares as at that time there shall be children of mine then living and children of mine then dead represented by \u2018descendants\u2019 then living,\u201d next, he states, \u201cto each of my children, Arthur and Nina, who shall then be living, and to the \u2018descendants\u2019 who shall then be entitled of any of my children then deceased, I devise its share, in fee-simple,\u201d then follows the particular provision with which we are dealing. It seems clear that the testator first employed \u201cdescendants\u201d as a mere descriptio personarum, hence, it is but reasonable to assume that he meant the word in that sense in the devise in question; and there is nothing called to our attention from the other parts of the will sufficient to overcome this assumption, or to show that he intended it as a synonym for the technical phrase, \u201cheirs of the body.\u201d The last words of the devise, which states that the descendants of Charles, living at the time of his death, shall take \u201cin remainder in such proportions, with like force and effect as they would have taken said real estate had he then died actually seized and possessed thereof,\u201d as a distributive direction, accord with the inheritance laws, and, since estates tail, after they have been determined to be such, now descend as fee-simple estates (Stout v. Good, supra), if it were not for the presence of the superadded words of limitation which this direction con tains within itself, and those that follow the word \u201cdescendants,\u201d i. e., \u201cthen living,\u201d these words of distribution would not, in themselves, be sufficient to overcome what might appear to be an intent to create an estate-tail. As it is, however, we have an instance of super-added words of limitation joined with a special direction for distribution; which combination, in a case like this, is usually held to be conclusive evidence of an intent that the remaindermen shall take as purchasers (Grimes v. Shirk, 169 Pa. 74, 77; Stout v. Good, supra).\nAfter considering all the relevant parts of the will (Kemp v. Reinhard, 228 Pa. 143), we are convinced that the learned court below erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff. The assignments of error are sustained; the judgment is reversed and is here entered for the defendant.",
