T., 1914, by David D. Johnson, from decree of O. C. Fayette Co., Jan. T., 1913, No. 39, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in estate of Caroline A. Downer, deceased.\nBefore Brown, Mbstbbzat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before Work, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that Caroline A. Downer died, leaving the following will:\n\u201cI, Caroline A. Downer,, of Uniontown, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, hereby make my last will and testament: First: I direct my executor, hereinafter named, securely to invest the sum of Fifteen hundred ($1500.00) Dollars out of my Estate, the interest thereof to be used to keep in repair the Family Cemetery Lot in Oak Grove Cemetery, Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and to keep in proper repair the tomb stones thereon. Second: I appoint David D. Johnson of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Executor hereof, without bond, and with power to sell as he may think best any realty of which I may die seized, to execute deeds therefor, and to make distribution of the proceeds thereof as personalty, and of all personalty of which I may die possessed, to those legally entitled thereto according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal, this 15th day of January, 1910.\n\u201cCaroline A. Downer (Seal).\u201d\nTestatrix left surviving her nine first cousins of the blood of her father and fifteen other first cousins of the blood of her mother. The controversy in this case arose over the distribution of the net proceeds of the sale of certain real estate, title to which testatrix held by descent from her father and from certain of her brothers and sisters in such manner that it retained its character as ancestral property which in case of intestacy would have descended to the heirs who were of the blood of testatrix\u2019s father. The auditing judge held that the will worked a conversion into personalty of the entire real estate and awarded the fund to the twenty-four first cousins in equal shares. The nine first cousins ex parte paterna, of whom the appellant, David D. Johnson, was one, filed exceptions to the adjudication, claiming the whole fund as real estate. The court dismissed the exceptions. David D. Johnson appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was in dismissing the exceptions.\nW. J. Sturgis, of Reppert, Sturgis & Morrow, with him Charles A. Tuit and Lee Smith, for appellant.\nD. M. Rertsog, for appellees.\nMay 22, 1914:"
