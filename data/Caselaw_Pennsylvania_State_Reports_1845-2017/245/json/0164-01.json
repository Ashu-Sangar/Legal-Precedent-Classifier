    "head_matter": "Chambers v. Foley, Appellant.\njReal property \u2014 Deeds\u2014Building restrictions \u2014 Construction \u2014 Equity \u2014 Injunction.\nIn. a suit in equity to enjoin defendant from erecting a theatre on his land, in alleged violation of a restriction in defendant\u2019s deed providing \u201cthat no building shall be erected thereon fronting on said Chester or Springfield avenues, or in Eifty-second street other than dwelling houses,\u201d where defendant claimed that the building came within an exception providing that \u201cthis restriction shall not apply to so much of the ground as fronts on Chester avenue from Fifty-second street to Paxon street,\u201d and where it appeared that defendant\u2019s land was situated on Chester avenue between Paxon street and Fifty-second street, but that it fronted on Fifty-second street, the court made no error in granting the relief prayed for.\nArgued March 27,1914.\nAppeal, No. 90, Jan. T., 1914, by defendant, from decree of C. P. No. 5, Philadelphia Co., Sept. T., 1913, No. 2534, awarding injunction in case of William W. Chambers v. Walter C. Foley.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Mestbezat, Potteb, Elkin and Mosesziskeb, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for an injunction to enforce a building restriction.\nOn final hearing, Balston, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe restriction in the deed for defendant\u2019s lot provides \u201cthat no building shall be erected thereon fronting on said Chester or Springfield Avenues or on 52nd Street other than dwelling houses.\u201d It appears from the bill and answer and the evidence, that the defendant proposes to erect on his lot a theatre, fronting on Fifty-second street, covering the entire Fifty-second street front of the lot. This is in direct violation of the terms of the restrictions that no buildings shall be erected fronting on Fifty-second street other than dwelling houses. The proposed building of the defendant is to extend along Chester avenue as far as Paxon street. The defendant claims that the building comes within the exception to the restriction which is in the following words: \u201cThis restriction shall not apply to so much of the ground as fronts on Chester avenue from Fifty-second street to Paxon street, where other buildings of at least the same height and similar architecture to said dwelling houses may be erected.\u201d\nIt is not necessary to consider whether the theatre proposed to be built would be contrary to this restriction as not being of similar architecture in the dwelling houses.\nThe theatre is on the ground fronting on Fifty-second street and, therefore, within the words of the restriction,\n. and its building would be a violation of the restriction in the defendant\u2019s deed.\nThe court awarded the relief prayed for. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned, among others, was the decree of the court.\nE. Clinton Rhoads, with him Samuel R. Lazot\u00faick, for appellant.\nJohn G. Johnson, with him Sidney E. Smith, for appellee.\nApril 27, 1914:"
