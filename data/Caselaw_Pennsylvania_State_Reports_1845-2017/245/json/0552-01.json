P. \u2014 Motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense \u2014 Waiver of right.\nThe right of a plaintiff to move for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is not waived by the entry of a rule on the defendant to file an affidavit of defense and to plead under a rule of court requiring said rules to be taken simultaneously when a statement of claim is filed and the filing of a plea in pursuance thereof.\nArgued April 22, 1914.\nAppeal, No. 265, Jan. T., 1913, by defendant, from judgment of C. P., No. 2, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1912, No. 2992, for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Stephens-Adamson Manufacturing Co., a corporation, v. N. Bruce Armstrong.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Brown, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit against endorser of a bill of exchange. Before Sulzberger, P. J.\nFrom the record it appeared that the plaintiff in its statement of claim alleged that the defendant was liable as endorser on a bill of exchange accepted by the Armstrong Engineering Company. The defendant filed an affidavit of defense. Subsequently, by leave of court, the plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim alleging that the defendant was liable as surety for the Armstrong Engineering Company, and in obedience to a rule of court ruled the defendant to file an affidavit of defense and a plea. The defendant filed an affidavit of defense and a plea. The plaintiff then took a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense which was made absolute by the court below, and judgment was accordingly entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of $1,563.29. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was in making absolute the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nDaniel R. Rothermel, for appellant.\nAlfred T. Steinmetz, with him George Wentworth Carr and Robert A. Beggs, Jr., for appellee.\nMay 22, 1914:"
