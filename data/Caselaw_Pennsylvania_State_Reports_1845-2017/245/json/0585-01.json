It does not deprive the appellant of his right to have his execution satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of the personal property of the Majestic Apartment House Company if he has such right. The bond given by the Fidelity Title and Trust Company insures the payment for said property of a sum largely in excess of what will be required to pay the appellant if he has the preference which he claims. Whether he has such preference can be determined by the court after due consideration upon final hearing or on distribution of the proceeds of sale made by the receiver. We have not been persuaded that we should depart from the rule as to non-interference with preliminary injunctions, and the appeal is dismissed without prejudice to any rights of the appellant, the costs to be disposed of on final hearing.",

Majestic Apartment House Company.\nEquity \u2014 Equity practice \u2014 Conflicting lien claims \u2014 Execution\u2014 Preliminary injunction \u2014 Appeals\u2014Supreme Court.\n\u2022 A bill in equity to foreclose a corporation mortgage on a hotel property was filed by the mortgagee trustee. On motion for a preliminary injunction to restrain a judgment creditor from proceeding with executions levied against the personal property, it appeared that the judgments were subsequent to the mortgage, but it was claimed by the holders thereof that the mortgage did not cover the furniture and fixtures. The court granted a preliminary injunction restraining further proceedings under the judgments mentioned, the decree preserving the creditor\u2019s right to have his execution satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of the personal property of the hotel, if he had such a right. The bond given insured the payment for said property of' a sum largely in excess of what would be required to pay the judgment creditor if he had the preference which he claimed.

It was contended by the execution creditors that the mortgage did not coyer the personal property and fixtures of the company.\nOn January 14, 1914, on application of a stockholder of the company, the court appointed receivers who were operating the apartment house and hotel.

The trustee filed the foreclosure bill on March 10, 1914, and averred, inter alia, that the execution judgment creditors above mentioned claimed that the furniture and fixtures in said hotel property were not covered by the mortgages, and prayed that an injunction be granted restraining such creditors from proceeding further with their execution.
