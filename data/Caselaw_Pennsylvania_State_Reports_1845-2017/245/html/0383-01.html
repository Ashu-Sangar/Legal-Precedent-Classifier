When the technical words suggested in the rule, “heirs,” for a fee-simple, and “heirs of his body,” for a fee-tail, appear without more, then no further inquiry is permitted, and the rule applies; but <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>where other words are used, such as children, or the like, and the rule is sought to be applied by analogy, then the burden rests upon him who claims them to be the equivalent of “heirs” or “heirs of his body” to show they were so intended; and this must be demonstrated from their context or other relevant language in the will, judged according to proper and appropriate rules of construction (See, Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>, 14, 15; Criswell’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="480073" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0288-01">41 Pa. 288</a>, 291). The rule governs whenever the will shows a clear intent to vest a fee-simple or a fee-tail in the heirs of the first-taker, qua such heirs; even though the interest of such first-taker is expressly stated to be but a life estate, and even though the technical word “heirs” or the phrase “heirs of his body” is not used (Lauer v. Hoffman, <a href="/pa/241/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="241 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="976078" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0315-01">241 Pa. 315</a>). But when neither the word nor the phrase in question is present, then, before the life estate can be enlarged to a fee, it must clearly appear from the language employed that the remaindermen are to inherit from the original devisee, and not to take as devisees directly from the testator: particularly, when, as is so often the case, the application of the rule will have the effect of defeating the testator’s express declaration that the first-taker shall have but a life estate (Kemp v.

Therefore, in the absence of technical words of limitation, the rule should never be applied, unless a paramount intent to make the first devisee a source of inheritable succession plainly appears; but where the language used brings the case within the rule, the fact that the testator desired that it should not operate, is of no importance: Grimes v.

All authorities agree that <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>“children” is prima facie a word of purchase, and that it cannot be construed otherwise unless the context plainly shows that the testator did not employ the word in its ordinary sense (Affolter v.

The general rule is that neither superadded words of limitation nor of distributive modification, standing alone, will be accepted as enough to overcome precedent words sufficient to give a fee; but the combination of the two will usually be taken as sufficient proof of an intent .to create a new line of descent in the remaindermen and to make them purchasers from the testator. This is not always so, however, for sometimes, even the combination of the two will not be given that effect, where the words used are general in form and do not show an intent to change the course of descent or the general scheme of distribution fixed by the inheritance laws (Grimes v.

Under the Act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, words that would have created an estate in fee-tail now make a fee-simple, and the statute expressly provides that estates thus created “shall be inheritable” as such, i. e., as fee-simple estates.</p>

On the other hand, if we do not accept “issue” as a word of limitation, then it must be taken as on a par with “children,” and in that case, technically, the express terms of the devise would be inconsistent with an estate-tail; for in such an estate lineal heirs in two different generations cannot come into their inheritance at one and the same time, as directed by the present will (Nice’s App., <a href="/pa/50/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="50 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="425177" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0143-01">50 Pa. 143</a>, 148-9). <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>Then, again, there is nothing in the will to suggest that the testator had in mind that essential attribute of an estate-tail, an indefinite failure of issue. This is not the ease of a simple devise to one and his issue; nor is it an instance where an estate-tail can be implied from a devise over in default of issue, for the provision that, “in the event of my said daughter......leaving no issue at the time of her death, she shall have the right to will,” etc., indicates that the testator contemplated a definite failure of issue, —the words, “leaving no issue,” simply meaning, no such issue as above named, i. e., the children of the devisee for life living at the time of her decease and the living issue of those who might then be dead. Finally, the provision that the issue living at the death of the first-taker shall “only” take the share which their deceased parent would have taken if living “at that time,” is a distributive modification which may lead to this result; should all the children of the first-taker be deceased at the time of her demise, leaving descendants standing in the same degree of consanguinity to her, they would not take per capita, as directed by the inheritance laws (Sec. 14, Act of April 6, 1833, P. L. 207; section 1, Act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 251), but would have to take per stirpes, as directed by the will; for example, should the daughter leave no children, but issue consisting of five grandchildren, two born of one deceased child and three of another, under the law the first set of grandchildren would inherit between them a two-fifths interest in the property, whereas under the scheme of distribution expressly ordered by the testator they would take a one-half interest. All of these incongruities taken together tend to prove that the testator never designed an estate of inheritance for his daughter, but intended the remaindermen to take by purchase directly from him; and this being so, the rule in Shelley’s Case can have no application.</p>

These decisions were prior to the year 1855, and, no doubt, in many instances, they may be attributed to a then prevalent judicial desire to get away from the technical rules relating to estates-tail; but they are somewhat confusing at the present time, unless it is constantly kept in mind that prior to the Act of 1855, supra, such estates were subject to their own peculiar common law rules of inheritance (Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>; Findlay v. Riddle, 3 Riddley 139, 164), whereas, all entails created since the Act of 1855, after they are ascertained to be such, come under the general laws of inheritance, as though fee-simple estates (See the words of the act and Simpson v. Reed, <a href="/pa/205/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="205 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="930043" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0053-01">205 Pa. 53</a>, 55; Pifer v. Locke, <a href="/pa/205/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="205 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="930056" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0616-01">205 Pa. 616</a>). While it is still the rule that a distributive direction not at variance with the law of inhertance, when standing alone, is of no importance (Lea v. Sanson, <a href="/pa/245/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="245 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="326198" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0392-01">245 Pa. 392</a>), yet, we have found no case where an actual modification of the scheme of inhertance appropriate to a fee-simple estate, as in the present will, has not been treated as significhnt.</p>

Therefore, in this opinion, we have simply cited authorities in support of the general principles or canons of construction which seem helpful to a proper determination of the actual questions involved. We conclude that Mrs. Stout took but a life estate, that the rule in question does not apply, <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>and that the learned court below erred in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>
