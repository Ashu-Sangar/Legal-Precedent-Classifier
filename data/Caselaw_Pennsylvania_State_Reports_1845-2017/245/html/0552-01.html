    <p class="summary" id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[152,453,1152,865]]]'>From the record it appeared that the plaintiff in its statement of claim alleged that the defendant was liable as endorser on a bill of exchange accepted by the Armstrong Engineering Company. The defendant filed an affidavit of defense. Subsequently, by leave of court, the plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim alleging that the defendant was liable as surety for the Armstrong Engineering Company, and in obedience to a rule of court ruled the defendant to file an affidavit of defense and a plea. The defendant filed an affidavit of defense and a plea. The plaintiff then took a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense which was made absolute by the court below, and judgment was accordingly entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of $1,563.29. Defendant appealed.</p>
