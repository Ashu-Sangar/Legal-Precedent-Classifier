This must be refused, because the <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>inconvenience and injury that the plaintiff alleges he has sustained and still sustains are not of such a pressing character as to warrant a preliminary injunction, the result of which would be to stop the mining operations of the defendant and throw a large number of employees out of employment, and also result in large loss of business to the defendant company. The injuries complained of have been endured for some time, and various other efforts to relieve the situation have been resorted to by the plaintiff, so that it seems clear that this is not a case for a preliminary injunction.</p>

This relief, of course, could not be granted by preliminary injunction, especially under the pleadings in this case.</p>

As one complaint in the bill is that the breaker of defendant company emits larger quantities of dust than it would if equipped with approved appliances for controlling dust, and that the dust thus produced enters the dwelling house of the plaintiff in large quantities, and that the said breaker on this account is a nuisance from which the plaintiff suffers peculiar damage; and also, that the smoke stacks through which the smoke from the fires under the boilers is carried throws out dust of different colors which enters the plaintiff’s residence, causing peculiar damage to the plaintiff, we feel dis<a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>posed to grant this prayer of the bill, provided that the examination is made in such a way as not to interfere with the defendant company in the operation of its colliery, and therefore order and decree that the defendant, the Wilkes-Barre Anthracite Coal Company permit the plaintiff, by his engineer, to inspect its breaker and other outside structures at such time as may be convenient and reasonable, and accompanied by a representative of defendant company, if it so chooses, to ascertain whether the defendant company has in. use such apparatus for the prevention of dust as is ordinarily in use in like collieries in these regions.</p>
