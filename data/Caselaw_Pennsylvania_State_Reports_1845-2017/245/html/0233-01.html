The prices fixed by the contract were for items of work completed and in place, with no additional allowance to the contractor for labor, dredging, pumping, or any work incidental to the building of the sewer. At the request of the contractor, the city assented to a- change in- the method of building a portion of the sewer. By the original contract, a section of the sewer was to be built under water, by lowering blocks of concrete upon pile heads. The contractor preferred to build a bulkhead between the two piers, pump out the water and build the sewer above water, or “in the dry.” This was accordingly done, and the contractor was paid the prices fixed in the contract for all material used in the construction of the sewer. The contractor brought suit against the city for the amount it cost him to build the bulkhead between the piers, for flumes and other incidental work necessary to build the sewer “in the dry,” and was nonsuited on the ground that the prices fixed in the original contract included all labor, machinery, materials, etc., necessary to the completion of the work, and that the contractor was not entitled to recover for work and material not entering into the construction of the sewer, but expended in incidental work in order to build the sewer “in the dry.” No appeal was taken from this decision, but thereafter councils passed an ordinance authorizing the appointment of a referee to determine whether anything was morally due the contractor, and upon the referee’s report that the amount of the claim was morally due, councils by ordinance made an appropriation for its payment. A taxpayer’s bill was filed to restrain the payment on the ground that the city was under no moral obligation to make it, and that the ordinance was invalid. <em>Held, </em>the court did not err in granting the relief prayed for.</p>

The prices fixed by the contract were for items of work completed and in place, with no additional allowance to the contractor for labor, dredging, pumping or any work incidental to the building of the sewer. At the request of the contractor, the city assented to a change in the method of building a part of the sewer. By the original contract a section of the sewer was to be built under water by lowering blocks of concrete upon pile heads. The contractor preferred to build a bulkhead between two piers, pump out the water and build the sewer above water or “in the dry.” This was accordingly done, and the contractor was paid the prices fixed in the contract for all material used in the construction of the sewer. The total amount to be expended under the contract was not to exceed $200,-000. The total amount paid to the contractor for the work done under the contract, according to the prices fixed in the contract, amounted to $161,096.30. The contractor thereupon brought suit against the city and claimed to recover the amount it cost him. to build the bulkhead between the piers, flumes, and so forth, which <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>were necessary in order to build tbe sewer “in tbe dry,” namely $46,720. As this amount added to wbat he had already received would exceed the sum of $200,000, the extreme price limited in the contract, the claim was reduced to $38,903,70; that is, the difference between the amount paid him, $161,096.30, and the price limited in the contract, $200,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-3" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[190,721,1153,483]]]'>This case was tried before a judge without a jury and decided in favor of the city, on the ground that the prices fixed in the original contract included all labor, machinery, material, and so forth, necessary to the completion of the work and that the contractor was not entitled to recover for work and material not entering into the construction of the sewer but expended in incidental work in order to build the sewer “in the dry.” No appeal was taken from this decision.</p>

This claim was not the same as that upon which the.suit was brought, namely,' for the extra expense of building the bulkhead, flumes, and so forth, in order to construct the sewer “in the dry,” but the contractor claimed that if the work had been done under water, or “in the wet,” as originally contemplated by the city engineers, he would have received,, according to the prices fixed by the contract, $191,818.50, whereas, by the method adopted by him less labor and materia! were required, so that, although he was paid according to the terms of the contract for all the work done, he receiyed only $161,096.30, or $30,722.20 less than he would have received had the original plans been followed. A statement showing the difference between the work actually done and what would have been necessary under the <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>original plans will be found at page 190, et seq., of the referee’s report.

    <p class="summary" id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[298,613,1154,1572]]]'>There can be no doubt as to the character of the claim, because It is fully set out in the testimony taken before the referee, and the referee awards to the contractor $30,722.20, which is the difference between what the contractor said the work would have cost if the original plans had been followed ($191,818.50), and what it cost actually, ($161,096.30). The claim of the contractor is therefore for money to which he claims he would have been entitled if he had done the work and furnished the materials as originally planned. It is impossible to determine how much the contractor would have received had the work been done as originally contemplated, because the calculation is based entirely upon the estimate of the engineers, which was merely an approximate calculation. However, whether or not the contractor would have been entitled to more money if he had done the additional work, the fact remains that he did not do the work. His claim is for work which was not done but which might have been done if the change of plan had not been made. He does not claim, nor has any attempt been made to show, that he has not been paid according to the contract for all the work that he did, and his contention may be thus stated: he might have got more money if he had done more work; he did not do the work, hence the money was saved to the city, therefore he should receive the amount saved; in other words, the city should pay him for work he did not do, in order that he should receive as much as he had expected to get.</p>

It is true that in the case tried before the court the cost of erecting the cofferdam, flumes, and so forth, was stated, but, on the other hand, the expense to which the contractor would have been put had he followed the original plan is not given. Chief Engineer Webster enumerated some of the expenses incidental to the building of the sewer under water, such as floating pile drivers, platforms, extra heavy derricks to lower blocks of concrete weighing seventy tons, the building of tramways, &amp;c. Until the cost of these appliances is determined, it is impossible to say whether or not the method pursued by the contractor was more or less expensive than that contemplated in the original plans.</p>
