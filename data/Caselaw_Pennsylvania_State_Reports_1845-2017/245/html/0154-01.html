The executive officers of the City of Philadelphia, being ready to enter into a contract with architects for the erection of a building constituting one of a series which together would constitute a municipal hospital, requested the city solicitor to prepare a contract for executon with said architects to whom the contract had been awarded. The city solicitor refused to prepare the contract, in view of the fact that there was a previously existing contract which appeared to be inconsistent with the new contract, and which might render the city responsible for more than one architect’s fee. The architects filed a petition for mandamus to compel the city solicitor to prepare a contract in writing for execution by the parties. Held, the court did not err in quashing the writ, on motion of the city solicitor.</p>

Its efficiency would be seriously hampered if the executive, or any subdivision thereof, were liable to be restrained in action at the instance of an outsider who disagreed with the views of this or that department.

On March 21, 1903, councils authorized the then mayor to enter into a contract with an architect to draw the plans and supervise the construction of a series <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>of buildings which were to constitute a great municipal hospital plant. Ten days later the mayor, in pursuance of the ordinance, executed a contract with Philip H. Johnson, an architect. The latter prepared the necessary plans and specifications, and bids were received for the work on May 1, 1905. The bids were alternative, one for the whole plant for the sum of $2,030,158, and the other for the twenty or more separate buildings contemplated by the plan. The sum of the separate bids equalled the amount asked for the whole plant. From the testimony of the director of public health and charities it appeared that up to the present time from sixty to sixty-five per cent, of the whole contemplated work had been finished under the supervision of Johnson and that his service has been satisfactory. The only qualification of this statement is that for one of the buildings a contract had been entered into with another architect and that the question of Johnson’s right in the matter was amicably adjusted by a division of the fees between the rival architects.</p>
