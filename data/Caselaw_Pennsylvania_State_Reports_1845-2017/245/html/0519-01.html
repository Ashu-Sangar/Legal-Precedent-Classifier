But no county nor city was excluded from its operation. In time every county seat in the State may be within the limits of a city, for no distinction is made between cities. It is a fact, of which we take notice, that the act does apply to many counties and cities. Harrisburg in Dauphin County, Scranton in Lackawanna County, New Castle in Lawrence County, Philadelphia in Philadelphia County, and Pittsburgh in Allegheny County, are some that may be mentioned. But it does not nojv apply to all counties. Therefore the act is one of classification. It authorizes the erection of joint county and municipal buildings, where the county seat is within the limits of a city, and it necessarily excludes from its present operation those counties in which such conditions do not exist. Is this a genuine classification, founded upon “natural, reasonable and necessary conditions”?</p>

In the former case, cities have grown up from natural causes. They have necessarily become the centers of great populations with all that is implied thereby. The counties have in consequence, and likewise from natural causes, also become of great importance. In a county, where such a condition exists, the two municipalities must have buildings for the transaction of the business of the public. A more commodious and convenient building can be erected jointly than can two or more be erected separately, and necessarily the expense to the taxpayers of both will be far less. Many difficulties in securing a suitable and proper site will be avoided by a joint building. ' But the great consideration is the convenience of <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the public. The convenience of the people in transacting their business with the county and city will be much more efficiently subserved by having the courts and the public offices of both municipalities in substantially the same place. Especially is this true here, where the population of Pittsburgh is almost half of the entire population óf the County of Allegheny. It is therefore apparent that there is a real, not a fanciful, distinction between counties in which the county seats are located within the limits of cities, and those in which they are not. The former do possess “natural, reasonable and necessary conditions,” which do not belong to the latter.

These condition^ limited the operation of the act to but few places and necessarily made it local in effect. But the court held that, since the conditions were genuine and called for legislation peculiar thereto, the mere fact that it applied to but few places did not make the law local and special within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition. In this Act of 1913, there are no conditions which will necessarily restrict its operation to particular counties. In due time, and from purely natural causes, the act may extend to all the counties of the State, for none can be excluded. And we discover no prohibition in the Constitution against making cities, which are county seats, a distinct class for necessary legislative purposes. Other circumstances than mere differences in population justify classification. In the Act of February 7, 1906, P. L. 7, authorizing the annexation of cities and providing for a temporary government and the payment of the indebtedness of each and the enforcement of claims, such cities had to be “contiguous or in close proximity” and no borough must intervene. Thus the act did not apply to all cities, and it was therefore a classification founded upon the conditions stated. This was sustained in: Pittsburgh’s Petition, <a href="/pa/217/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="217 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="953639" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0227-01">217 Pa. 227</a>, supra.</p>

It is not local, <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>because it does not pertain to a definite place and is not restricted to one portion of the State.

Even if this paragraph could be held to extend beyond the object of said Section 7, which is an enumeration of subjects concerning which local or special legislation is prohibited, we are unable to perceive how it has any application to the situation disclosed by this record. It is true, both counties and cities had the power to acquire land and to erect buildings for their respective public purposes, but they did' not, prior to this act, have power to join in the erection of a building, which could be utilized in the manner prescribed, and to sell or exchange their lands as designated. These are powers which had not been previously provided for by general law.

Clearly, this Act of 1913 does not pretend to “delegate to any special commission” any powers whatever. It authorizes the lawfully constituted authorities of counties and of cities to do certain things. The purjjose of the said section was to thereafter prohibit the legislature from naming a commission, composed of members who were in no way connected With the constituted authorities of municipalities, which was to perform some duty of a municipal character. But it was not thereby intended to prohibit the legislature from authorizing counties and cities, jointly or severally, to perform any lawful and necessary municipal function, which can only be done by the governing bodies thereof, whose membership will change from timé to time as their terms expire.</p>

It could empower them to erect joint buildings, to convey lands to each other, in exchange or otherwise, and to sell lands no longer needed for public purposes. There is no provision in the Constitution, to which our attention has been called, which prohibits the legislature from granting by general law the powers enumerated in the Act of 1913. If the Constitution does not forbid the enactment of such legislation, the authority to do so is presumed to have been conferred, because the act is “in its character and essence a law.” The power of the Pennsylvania Legislature to pass any statute of such kind is unlimited, except where restrained by express or necessarily implied constitutional prohibition.

Hence in the making of the contract, and in choosing an architect, the said representatives of the county and city are presumed to have acted in good faith. It does not appear that they passed the- bounds of the authority vested in them by the statute. It was their duty to choose, an architect. It was their duty to provide for his compensation. They were not obliged to adopt a program of competition. They might have chosen an architect without any competition. Therefore their judgment cannot be reviewed by the court, in the absence of an allegation of fraud, or unmistakable proof of an abuse of discretion. While there may be honest <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>differences of opinion as to what has been done by the authorities, yet the evidence submitted is clearly insufficient to warrant a finding that there was any abuse of discretion by them. It is true, that in cities of the second class “All contracts relating to city affairs shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder after reasonable notice.......” A similar provision also governs the letting of contracts by the county. It has never been held, so far as we have been able to ascertain, that the above provisions apply in the making of contracts for the employment of attorneys, physicians, engineers, or others, involving professional skill. Certainly an architect’s services do involve professional skill, knowledge and judgment.</p>

Testimony was introduced at the trial, showing that the constitutional limit of indebtedness, had been exceeded by the City of Pittsburgh. But it does not appear that the City of Pittsburgh will incur any indebtedness by reason of the contract, mentioned in Findings of Fact 7. No appraisement of the real estate of either the county or the city has yet been made. Therefore it is impossible now to determine whether the city will or will not incur any indebtedness whatever by reason of the proposed exchange. The City of Pittsburgh now has <em>in </em>its possession the sum. of <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>$1,500,000, being the proceeds of bonds authorized for the construction of a municipal building. There was no condition that this building was to be erected in any particular place. Consequently it was within the discretion of the city authorities to determine where the building should be located. This statute now provides that the building may be located alongside of the county building, the two to be erected jointly. In our judgment, the said fund of $1,500,000 will be applicable for the erection of that joint building So far as appears, we are unable to say, and it cannot be now shown, that the cost of the city’s portion of the joint building will exceed the amount of money which is at present available therefor. In view of the foregoing, it cannot be determined that the city will incur any indebtedness by reason of the project under consideration. Therefore, the question whether or not the indebtedness of the city now exceeds the constitutional limit is immaterial.</p>
