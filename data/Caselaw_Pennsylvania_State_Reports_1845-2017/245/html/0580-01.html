The auditing judge held that the will worked a conversion into personalty of the entire real estate and awarded the fund to the twenty-four first cousins in equal shares. The nine first cousins ex parte paterna, of whom the appellant, David D. Johnson, was one, filed exceptions to the adjudication, claiming the whole fund as real estate. The court dismissed the exceptions. David D. Johnson appealed.</p>
