This view is based on a misconception of the reasons for reversals on appeals by defendants in cases where the plaintiff’s counsel or the court has directed the attention of the jury to the amount of damages claimed in the declaration and in which it has been said that such claims do not furnish a proper measure of damages and the statement of them tends to mislead the jury by suggesting an amount not supported by the evidence. These decisions have no application to this case.</p>
