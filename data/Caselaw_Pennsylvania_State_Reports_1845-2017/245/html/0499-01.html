It does not appear that he ever asked to have it opened or stricken off; but, aside from this, the vague allegation of the damage sustained was utterly insufficient to prevent the entry of judgment on the mortgage. “Affidavits of defense should aver the facts depended upon with reasonable <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>precision and distinctness: Markley v.
