    <p class="summary" id="b220-8" data-blocks='[["BL_220.14",220,[282,1390,1151,744]]]'>The plaintiff was driving his automobile on First avenue, a public highway in the suburbs of Philadelphia. This avenue connects with Tyson avenue at right angles and there ends. On the east side of Tyson avenue there is located, and in public use an open roadway with a width of sixteen feet. In the center of Tyson avenue, the defendant owns a private right of way on which it operates a double line of trolley tracks. This construction is similar to that of steam railroads; heavy rails are fastened to wooden ties which are imbedded in stone ballast, and the whole right of way is inclosed by a heavy curb, for protecting the ballasted track, and is from four to twelve inches higher than the roadway on its eastern side.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-9" data-blocks='[["BL_220.15",220,[280,2155,1149,261]],["BL_221.1",221,[140,354,1156,1564]]]'>The plaintiff approached Tyson avenue with the intention of turning north, but when he arrived at the intersection of the avenues, as he states: “when we got within one block of where we turned, we discovered that the tracks were a little elevated, and rather than risk an <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>upset, I turned across the track and there I stalled the engine.” When asked, “Why, if this was a bright moonlight night, as you say, you were driving west on First avenue, and desired to turn north on Tyson avenue — why did you run your car on the road, track when there was plenty of room to the right?” — he answered — “For fear in making the turn when I discovered it — for fear of turning the machine over. If running at a moderate speed — which I was — I could turn my car in twelve feet.” The speed at which he entered upon Tyson avenue is fairly shown by the fact that the loaded five-passenger car mounted the curb and stopped when the front wheels had crossed both rails of the northbound track. He was traveling on an unfamiliar road in uncertain moonlight, on a down grade, and about to make a right-angled turn. He had before him an abrupt barrier of from four to twelve inches in height, and between it and him there was the sixteen-foot roadway. His surroundings required that special care should be exercised. After the car stalled, the passengers got out and one went back along the track of the defendant company to signal an approaching car, but failed to attract the attention of the motorman, and it crashed into the automobile and wrecked it. This action was brought to recover for the damages, and the trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff. A motion for a nonsuit was overruled, binding instructions for the defendant were refused, and the court declined on motion to enter a judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto.</p>

If it was the carelessness of Mr. Taylor, of course he cannot get a verdict.

The plaintiff’s negligent management of his car placed it in the hazardous place, and without his carelessness the accident would not have happened. As said by Judge Strong in Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v. Hummell, <a href="/pa/44/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="44 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="484265" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0375-01">44 Pa. 375</a>, “If the use of a railroad is exclusively for its owners; or those acting under them; if others have no right to be upon it; if they are wrongdoers whenever they intrude, the parties lawfully using it are under no obligations to take precautions against possible injuries to intruders upon it. Ordinary care they must be held to, but they have a right to presume and act on the presumption, that those in the vicinity will not violate the laws; will not trespass upon the right of a clear track. Precaution is a duty only so far as there is reason for apprehension. No one can complain of want of care in another where care is only ren<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>dered necessary by bis own wrongful act. If the law declares, as it does, that there is no duty resting upon any person to anticipate wrongful acts in others, and to take precautions against such acts, then the jury cannot say that a failure to take such is a failure in duty and negligence. The law does not require anyone to presume that another may be negligent, much less to presume that another may be an active wrongdoer. There is as perfect a duty to guard against accidental injury to a night intruder into one’s bed-chamber as there is to look out for trespassers upon a railroad where the public has no right to be.” This declaration has been frequently restated and approved. In Bailey v. L. Y. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/220/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="220 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1005869" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0516-01">220 Pa. 516</a>, it is held, “Where the public have the right to cross a railroad, the company in operation of its trains must exercise ordinary care to prevent accidents. This necessarily follows from the right of the public to cross the tracks. But at all other points, upon a rail: road where the company has the exclusive right to the use of its tracks, the person who enters upon the tracks becomes a trespasser, and the only duty imposed upon the company is to refrain from wantonly injuring the trespasser. In operating trains on its road at all other places than at crossings, the company’s employees in charge of the traiu have the right to assume that no person will enter upon the tracks, or if upon the tracks will immediately leave them upon the approach of the train. The train men may act on this presumption, and if a person trespassing on the tracks is killed, the company is not liable unless his death is caused by the wanton or willful conduct of those in charge of the train.”</p>
