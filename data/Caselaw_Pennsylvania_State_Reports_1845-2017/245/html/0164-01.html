    <p class="summary" id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[172,461,1152,89]]]'>On final hearing, Balston, J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[171,571,1154,1031]]]'>The restriction in the deed for defendant’s lot provides “that no building shall be erected thereon fronting on said Chester or Springfield Avenues or on 52nd Street other than dwelling houses.” It appears from the bill and answer and the evidence, that the defendant proposes to erect on his lot a theatre, fronting on Fifty-second street, covering the entire Fifty-second street front of the lot. This is in direct violation of the terms of the restrictions that no buildings shall be erected fronting on Fifty-second street other than dwelling houses. The proposed building of the defendant is to extend along Chester avenue as far as Paxon street. The defendant claims that the building comes within the exception to the restriction which is in the following words: “This restriction shall not apply to so much of the ground as fronts on Chester avenue from Fifty-second street to Paxon street, where other buildings of at least the same height and similar architecture to said dwelling houses may be erected.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.6",195,[171,1613,1152,197]]]'>It is not necessary to consider whether the theatre proposed to be built would be contrary to this restriction as not being of similar architecture in the dwelling houses.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b195-7" data-blocks='[["BL_195.7",195,[172,1830,1150,100]]]'>The theatre is on the ground fronting on Fifty-second street and, therefore, within the words of the restriction,</p>
