The plaintiff, however, is entitled to recover the damages that he has suffered by the defendant’s failure to perform his contract. The measure of his damages is the expense which he has incurred. So far as appears, the only expense is that incidental to the placing of the $10,000 mortgage on Thirty-fifth and Spring Garden-streets, amounting to $378.25. This he would be entitled to recover from the defendant; but it appears further that at the time the contract was signed, the defendant paid $1,000 down money to Van Cleave. The plaintiff purchased from VanCleave subject to the contract of sale, and consequently must give credit to the defendant for the money paid by him to VanCleavé. It therefore appears that the plaintiff has already received from the defendant. more than the amount of the expense to which he has been put in carry<a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>ing out the contract.
