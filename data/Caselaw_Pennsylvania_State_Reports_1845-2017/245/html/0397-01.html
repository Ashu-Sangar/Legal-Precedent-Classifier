The strong presumption arising from the use of technical words of limitation is not easily overcome; it may be rebutted, but it can be by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt. If in a devise the word “heirs” has other words of inheritance engrafted upon it, unless the latter are entirely inconsistent with the nature of the descent pointed out by the former, they will not convert it into a word of purchase; for the word <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>“heirs” retains its significance, even though the effect be to make unmeaning other words in the will.</p>

The first is, that technical words shall be taken to have been used according to their proper technical sense, unless the other parts of the will imperatively require a different one......The second is, that a particular intent shall always give way to a general one if the two cannot consist together.” (Doebler’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1021310" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0009-01">64 Pa. 9</a>,15.)</p>

Good, <a href="/pa/245/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="245 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="326013" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0383-01">245 Pa. 383</a>, and other authorities there cited). “The strong presumption arising from the use of technical words of limitation is not easily overcome; it may be rebutted, but it can be by nothing short of affirmative evidence of a contrary intent, so clear as to leave no reasonable doubt”; Little’s App., <a href="/pa/117/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="117 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="555786" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0014-01">117 Pa. 14</a>, 29. If in a devise the word “heirs” has other words of inheritance engrafted upon it, unless the latter are entirely inconsistent with the nature of the descent pointed out by the former, they will not convert it into a word of purchase (George v. Morgan, <a href="/pa/16/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="410189" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0095-01">16 Pa. 95</a>, 108); for the word “heirs” retains its significance, even though the effect be to make unmeaning other words in the will, thus, “words of superadded limitation alone are insufficient, as in the case of a gift to A for life remainder to the heirs of his body, and to their heirs forever.” (Criswell’s App., <a href="/pa/41/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="41 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="480073" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0288-01">41 Pa. 288</a>, 291; also see cases cited in Grimes v.

Here, the devise' is to Mathew Harrison with remainder to his heirs, and “the round about way which the testator takes to say ‘heirs’ does not affect the substance” (McKee v. McKinley, <a href="/pa/33/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="33 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="988373" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0092-01">33 Pa. 92</a>, 93).</p>

Hoffman, <a href="/pa/241/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="241 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="976078" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0315-01">241 Pa. 315</a>, 317; Shapley v.

We say that the intent to make the life tenant a source of inheritable succession is clear, because the technical words used demonstrate that design, and there is nothing within the four corners of the will sufficient to rebut it. There are no words of distributive modification ; and under these circumstances “superadded words of limitation which import the same course of descent are inoperative.” (Hileman v. Bouslaugh, <a href="/pa/13/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="964948" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0344-01">13 Pa. 344</a>, 353). Finally, the fact that the testator uses the words “I give, bequeath and devise......to the heirs......of Mathew Harrison,” instead of using an expression such as, “to pass to,” or “to descend to” the heirs, etc., has no controlling effect; this is illustrated by Grimes v. Shirk, <a href="/pa/169/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="169 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="870643" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0074-01">169 Pa. 74</a>, and many other cases which might be cited,</p>

The case which, on its facts, most nearly approaches this one is Grimes v. Shirk, <a href="/pa/169/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="169 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="870643" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0074-01">supra,</a> where the language employed in respect to the superadded words of limitation is strikingly similar to that used in the present devise; and it was there held that the first devisee took an estate in fee.</p>
