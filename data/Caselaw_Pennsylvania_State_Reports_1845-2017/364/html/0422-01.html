Fisher, the present defendant; the title of Jacob S. Young et al., grantees, to the surface of the land descended through mesne conveyances to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the present plaintiff. The tract in question was purchased by the Commonwealth with moneys of the Game Commission License Fund. It is mountain land which has been timbered over; it is held by the Commonwealth as a game habitat; it contains no buildings, railroad lines, public highways, or improvements of any kind. It is largely underlain with bituminous coal which, for the past fifteen years, defendant has been deep mining, but which he has now started to strip mine in order to excavate coal which can be removed in no other manner. <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>The area of coal thus far uncovered is approximately 2800 feet long and from 38 to 70 feet wide; the vein is about 42 inches thick; the overburden removed averages in depth from 12 to 20 feet. In compliance with the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act of 1945 defendant has filed a bond and has contracted for the back filling of the stripping operation.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[349,660,1149,592]]]'>Plaintiff filed the present bill in equity to restrain defendant from further strip mining on the tract. It contends that defendant has no right to practice that method of digging because the use of power machinery to remove the overburden was not a customary method of mining bituminous coal in 1855 when the mineral rights were separated from the title to the surface, and also because plaintiff is entitled by law to surface support. Defendant filed an answer to the bill, but there is no dispute as to the facts. The court below granted the injunction prayed for, and defendant appeals.</p>

Defendant, as assignee of the grantors under the deed of 1855, acquired the “full, entire, complete and exclusive ownership” of the coal “in or upon any part of” the land with the right to “dig, excavate or penetrate <em>any part </em>of the said premises”. There is no restriction limiting that right nor any provision as to the method of severing the coal. What was said in <em>Richardson v. Clements, </em><a href="/pa/89/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="89 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1063236" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0503-01">89 Pa. 503</a>, 506, is applicable here, viz.: “The language used indicates no intention to deny the use of such improved process as science may discover or mechanical ingenuity invent. . . .” Plaintiff admits that the coal which defendant seeks to obtain by stripping operations cannot be recovered by any other process. True it is that strip mining was not used in 1855 in the case of bituminous deposits although it was the earliest known method in Pennsylvania of mining anthracite coal and was originally performed by hand; the invention and use of power shovels for the re<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>moyal of the overburden was, of course, a later development, but there is no rule of law which would preclude defendant, having the right to mine the coal, from using methods for that purpose made possible by modern machinery and inventions. It was said in <em>Oberly v. H. C. Frick Coke Co., </em><a href="/pa/262/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="262 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1044476" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0083-01">262 Pa. 83</a>, 87, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20864" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="104 A. 864">104 A. 864</a>, 865: “The right to work the mine involves the right to penetrate the surface of the soil for the minerals, to remove them in the manner most advantageous to the mine owner, and to use such means and processes in mining and removing them as may be necessary in the light of modern improvements in the arts and sciences.” We said in <em>Taylor v. Heffner </em><a href="/pa/359/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="359 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="473148" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0157-01">359 Pa. 157</a>, 163, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.2d%20450" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="58 A.2d 450">58 A. 2d 450</a>, 453: “It cannot be said that because motor vehicles were rarely used at the creation of the right of way that it was within the contemplation of the parties not to permit the dominant estate to use improved means of travel. Where, as here, the grant of the easement is unrestricted, the grantee is given such rights as are necessary for the reasonable and proper enjoyment of the thing granted.” In <em>Dowgiel v. Reid, </em><a href="/pa/359/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="359 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="473175" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0448-01">359 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20115" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="59 A.2d 115">59 A. 2d 115</a>, an easement of a “private road or cartway” was created in 1835; the present owners of the easement proposed to erect poles and to string copper wire along the road for the purpose of providing their farm with electrical facilities. We held that they had the right so to do even though, when the easement was granted, the only need for the road was as a pathway over which pedestrians, horses and vehicles could travel, and telephones, electric lights and other electrical devices were, of course, totally unknown. The opinion (p. 453, A. p. 118) contained a quotation from 19 C. J. 975, 976 [§219] b. to the effect that “Where a way is granted or reserved without any limitation as to its use, it will not necessarily be confined to the purposes for which the land was used at the time the way was created, but may be used for any purpose to which the land aceommo<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>dated by tbe way may naturally and reasonably be deself of modern inventions if by so doing he can more fully exercise and enjoy or carry out the object for which the way was granted.” The application of the principle illustrated by these authorities clearly establishes defendant’s right to excavate the coal of which he is the owner by a method presently in use for that purpose even though not anticipated, perhaps, by the parties to the deed of 1855.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[360,773,1151,755]],["BL_471.1",471,[115,282,1153,983]],["BL_472.1",472,[342,275,1153,866]]]'>As to defendant’s alleged legal duty to support the surface of the land it must be conceded that, if such a duty exists, he cannot dig away and destroy the surface down to the subjacent vein of coal, for the physical injury to plaintiff in that event would obviously be the same as if the surface were allowed to subside due to lack of support from beneath. No principle of law is more firmly established in this Commonwealth than that, where there is a severance of the mineral rights from the title to the surface, the owner of such rights is obligated to support the superincumbent estate; the owner of the surface is entitled to that support, not as an easement or right depending on a supposed grant, but as a proprietary right at common law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The owner of the <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>surface may, however, by contract or by waiver, relinquish the right,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> although such relinquishment should not be implied in the absence of language clearly indicating the intention of the parties to that effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In this case the deed of 1855 did, in our opinion, impliedly release to the grantors the obligation of surface support. It reserved to them the “ownership and right” of the coal “as though the present conveyance had not been made”, and irrespective of whether the coal was “in or upon any part of” the land. It further reserved to them “the full, free, absolute and exclusive right and authority ... to excavate” the coal and <em>“to dig, excavate or penetrate any part of the said </em>premises” for that purpose. It provided that “such digging . . . shall be conducted with as little injury or damage” to the grantees “as shall be practicable <em>consistently with the success of the same </em>in other words, the success of the digging and removal of the coal was to be the <em>paramount objective, </em>and the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>grantors were to have the right to conduct their enterprise successfully and to the fullest extent no matter what the injury or damage to the surface provided it be as little as practicable. The grantees of the surface agreed that they would not “in any manner hinder, impede, delay, or in anywise obstruct the full and free exercise of all, any and every, the rights and privileges . . . reserved” by the grantors. Whether a deed impliedly releases the right of surface support must depend in each instance upon its terms; here the cumulative effect of its provisions would seem fairly to give to the grantors, and their assigns, who reserved the ownership and authority to excavate the coal, the right to remove <em>all </em>of it whether upon the land, or near the surface, or lying deep within it, and by any method, old or new, appropriate and necessary for the purpose.</p>

The tract in question is unimproved mountain land; any damage caused to its surface would be merely of a temporary nature in view of the provisions of the Bituminous Coal Open Pit Mining Conservation Act of May 31, 1945, P. L. 1198, as amended by the Act of May 23,1949, P. L. 1730, which provides that before any operator shall engage in open pit mining of bituminous coal he must file a bond conditioned for the faithful performance of all the requirements of the Act, one of which is that he must, within one year after the operation is completed, place sufficient overburden or earth in the open cut to cover the exposed face of the unmined coal, and, within three years after the operation is completed or abandoned, plant trees, shrubs or grasses upon the land affected thereby.

This is an absolute proprietary right, necessarily arising out of the ownership of the surface, and not an easement depending upon a grant. The mine owner in taking-out his minerals must leave sufficient support for the superincumbent land. This he may do by leaving ribs or pillars, or by constructing artificial supports. If he fails to do this, and the land sinks he is liable for the damage that occurs to the surface owner by reason thereof, and he may be enjoined from the further removal of minerals. Whether the mine owner has worked his mine skillfully or negligently does not affect the existence of the right to surface support. . . .’ ‘The owner of the minerals has a right to so much only as he can take out without injury to the surface. . . .’ ‘Though the right of surface support is absolute, yet the subjacent owner may be relieved of the corresponding obligation by a release from the surface owner, or by the terms of the instrument creating his estate. But upon him who <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>thus attempts to control the rule of law, lies the burden of proof. To destroy or injure the surface, there must exist some statutory or contract authority. The intention to part with the right of surface support must appear by plain and explicit language in the grant of the minerals, or by an express exception from a reservation of them. It may not be taken away by mere implication from language not necessarily importing such a result.’ These general principles are fully supported by the cases in Pennsylvania: Lowry v.

In separating the two estates and making the reservation of the coal, the deed states that the ownership of the coal is to remain: “as though the present conveyance had not been made”. I agree with what the Chancellor said: “There is a distinction between ownership of minerals and mining rights. Carlin v. Chappel, <a href="/pa/101/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="101 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="500877" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0348-01">101 Pa. 348</a>. Parties may own all of the minerals as though the conveyance had not been made and still not be able to remove all of them due to a limitation on the mining rights. The remaining parts of the reservation which are relied upon by the defendant have to do with the right of the defendant in entering upon the land, and excavating and digging coal.” The remaining words are: “to enter into and upon and pass over [the surface]”, and “to explore, search for and excavate”; “to dig excavate or penetrate any part of the said premises” and “at all times to have free ingress and egress” and “to dig mine raise and take remove and carry away any and every kind of ore mineral, metal or coal . . . [and] that such digging explorations or searches shall be conducted with as little injury or damage ... as shall be practicable”. Certainly such words and phrases do not <em>expressly </em>release or waive surface rights. Neither do they <em>unequivocally </em>disclose the intent of the parties that the owner of the coal is to be permitted to destroy the entire surface of the land in order that he might mine the underlying coal. Unless the right has been released or waived, the owner of the surface is entitled to the unrestricted enjoyment of it except for the necessary means of egress and ingress, exploration, and reasonable facilities for mining and hauling the coal. Under the surrounding circumstances, the equivocal words of this <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>deed seem more applicable to deep mining than to strip mining.</p>

    <p id="b478-5" data-blocks='[["BL_478.6",478,[350,714,1151,744]]]'>It is unreasonable to suppose that this language would have been used if the parties had already agreed that grantees released or waived their rights in the surface. It is difficult to comprehend what possible use an owner of the surface could make of this land if the owners of the coal could freely enter upon and tear apart any portion or all of the surface in order to remove the overburden and take out the coal. Strip miners are required by statute to fill in excavations. But unsightly scars from such operations, nevertheless, remain visible for many years. The damage to the land, including trees and foliage, is irreparable. Furthermore, strip mining operations would obviously defeat the very purpose of the Commonwealth’s use.</p>

The cases cited by the majority in their facts have no application to this case. Defendant’s virtual seizure of plaintiff’s property was not an unintentional encroachment. It amounts to a seizure of plaintiff’s property without its consent. Under the facts there is no adequate remedy at law. See Restatement, Torts, §933; <em>Quinn v.
