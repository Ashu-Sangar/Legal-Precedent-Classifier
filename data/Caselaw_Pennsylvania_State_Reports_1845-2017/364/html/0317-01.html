    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.8",360,[331,480,1148,1188]]]'>This appeal is from an order awarding a new trial in a trespass action instituted by the plaintiff, as administratrix of the estate of Fern II. Held, deceased, against the defendants, Van Tigellen and Mervine, for the death of the plaintiff’s decedent from injuries received in a collision between Mervine’s automobile and one driven by Van Tiggelen in whose car the deceased was a passenger. The plaintiff based her action on the alleged negligence of both defendants and sought to recover damages on two counts, viz., under the wrongful death Acts and the survival statute. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff against Van Tiggelen alone on the wrongful death count for the amount of the expenses incurred incident to the decedent’s injury and death. On the survival count, the verdict was for both defendants. The learned court below granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial as to both defendants. Mervine appealed and contends that, in view of his exculpation by the jury, the action of the court below in granting a new trial as to him amounted to a palpable abuse of discretion. Van Tiggelen did not appeal from the new trial order and has filed a brief as an appellee in Mervine’s appeal.</p>

The controlling principle has long been settled and has often been reiterated. One of the more recent utterances is contained in <em>Marko v.

Giacobello, </em><a href="/pa/277/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="277 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1079570" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0530-01">277 Pa. 530</a>, 538, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%20333" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="121 A. 333">121 A. 333</a>, where Chief Justice Moschziskeb concluded his collation of germane cases by observing “Thus it will be seen the scope of an appeal from the grant of a new trial is very limited, so far as the considerations which may prevail are concerned, and that, in this class of appeals, we seldom reverse.”</p>

Only after a careful scrutiny of the evidence did the court below conclude from the weight of the evidence “that both defendants were negligent and that the negligence of each concurred in bringing about the collision” and that “In the interest of justice a new trial must be awarded as to both defendants.” See <em>Samuels v.

In that case, the plaintiff had obtained a verdict against the original defendant, the jury exonerating the additional defendant. The plaintiff there appealed from the order granting a new trial and complained that the court took away her verdict solely because it thought both defendants should have been found liable. In reversing, Ave held that, in so acting, the court was but arrogating to itself the juiy’s fact-finding province. See also <em>Felo v. Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Company, </em><a href="/pa/347/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="347 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1217418" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0142-01">347 Pa. 142</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20A.2d%20552" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="31 A.2d 552">31 A. 2d 552</a>. In the present instance, the plaintiff Avas dissatisfied with her verdict and moved for a new trial Avhich, in the circumstances, had to be granted. The opinion for the court en banc clearly indicates that, had the verdict against the one defendant been adequate to the proofs, the court would not have interfered with it merely because the other defendant was not also held liable. Nor Avas the neAV trial granted as to Mervine because a new trial as to Yan Tiggelen was' necessary. The court did not act from any such mistaken view of the law; its positive recognition and reference to <em>Fitzpatrick v. Sheppard, </em><a href="/pa/346/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="346 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="1216482" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0240-01">346 Pa. 240</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20475" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="29 A.2d 475">29 A. 2d 475</a>, clearly so confirms.
