A bus of the Valley Motor Transit Company was being operated on the southerly side of the same highway from west to east, followed at a short distance by a truck driven by one Osterling and it in turn by a truck driven by one Angretti. The bus stopped momentarily to take on a passenger; Osterling, behind it, likewise stopped; Angretti claims that he also attempted to stop, but for some reason (he says that when he put on his brakes he pulled — or “it pulled” him — “a little bit” to the left) he came over to the north side of the highway directly into the path of the westbound truck-trailer which had then already passed the standing bus. The two vehicles collided and Johnson was killed. The administrator of his estate brought an action for damages under the Wrongful Death and the Survival Statutes against Angretti and against Stanley Hull individually and trading as Hull Resurfacing Company, the alleged em<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>ployer of Angretti ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> Brown Brothers also brought, an action against the same defendants to recover for the damage to their tractor-trailer; in both actions Hull brought Yalley Motor Transit Company on, the record as an additional defendant. The jury found verdicts aggregating .$18,000 in favor of the administrator of Jerome Johnson’s estate, and a verdict of $5,000 in favor of Brown. Brothers, all the verdicts being against Angretti, Hull, and Yalley Motor Transit Company. The court granted motions of Hull and Yalley Motor Transit Company for judgments n. o. v., and plaintiffs now appeal from that action of the court.</p>

L. 905, as amended. Section 1012(a) provides .that the driver of any vehicle on a highway, before starting, stopping or turning from a direct line, shall first see that such movement can be made in safety, and whenever the operation of any other vehicle approaching or following, may be affected by such movement shall give a signal of his intention plainly visible to the driver of such other vehicle. Plaintiffs cannot rely upon this section as a basis for imputing negligence to the operator of the bus for the uncontradicted testimony is that the bus came to a very gradual stop and the flashing stop lights, on its rear furnished an adequate signal to the vehicle that was following, so that Osterling, seeing the lights/ had no difficulty in bringing his truck to a stop at a safe distance behind <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>the bus. As to section 1019 of the Code, which provides that no vehicle shall be parked or left standing upon any highway unless a clear and unobstructed width of not less than fifteen feet upon the main traveled portion of the highway opposite such standing vehicle shall be left for free passage of other vehicles thereon, plaintiffs’ contention is that this provision was violated because, when the bus stopped, its right-hand wheels went only about 2 to 2% feet off the concrete, and, as the bus was 8 feet in width and the highway 18 feet, this left but 12 or 12% feet of the paved portion of the road clear for traffic in both directions. The fact is, however, that, while the gravel berm had an <em>average </em>width of 10 feet, its width at the place where the bus stopped, which Avas a regular marked bus stop, Avas only 3% feet, the liighAvay there being bordered at that distance by a hedge fence. Apart from the fact that apparently, therefore, it Avould have been physically impossible for the bus to have gone any further off the concrete the decisions are numerous to the effect that section 1019 of the Code Avas not intended to prohibit the momentary stopping of a vehicle or a temporary obstruction of the highAvay if for a proper purpose and under proper circumstances: <em>Henry v.

Originally he was a truck driver but some time previously he had purchased a dump truck of his own and thereafter was engaged in the business of hauling materials of the type usually transported in such trucks; he hauled for any one who engaged his services, not limiting his business to any one customer; while engaged in the work for Hull he was entirely free to take on hauling jobs for others; he bought and paid for his own oil and gasoline and for all the expenses of operation and repairs of his truck. Hull was in the business of constructing, improving and repairing roads; Angretti was in the totally separate and independent business of hauling. There is nothing in the testimony to suggest that Hull had any right to direct the speed, route, operation or management of Angretti’s truck in the performance of the work in which it was engaged; on the contraiy, it was under Angretti’s exclusive care, supervision and control. Ordinarily, draymen, truckmen, carters, etc., are regarded as independent contractors: <em>Tyler v.

It appears that Hull had engaged one Sechan to haul the slag needed for the road building and which was obtained from places some dis-stance from the site of the operation; Sechan in turn <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>had engaged Angretti to work with his truck in hauling the slag; there were other trucks similarly employed; Sechan was paid by Hull $1.75 per ton of material hauled and Sechan paid Angretti $1.65 per ton. Hull’s arrangement with Sechan was carried on for several weeks until Hull terminated it. When Sechan was no longer on the job, Angretti, apparently concerned as to his status, called at the .office maintained on the job by Hull and had a conversation with the foreman and the timekeeper; the latter asked him: “Who are you working for?” to which Angretti answered: “As far as I know, I am working for Bobert Sechan.” The timekeeper said to the foreman: “Here is a fellow don’t know who he is working for, Sechan or us.” Whereupon the foreman said: “He is working for us.” The timekeeper said, “That is all I want.” It is the remark: “He is working for us” which forms the basis of plaintiff’s claim that Angretti was an employe of Hull and not an independent contractor. In view, however, of all the facts previously recited as to the relationship between the parties, that statement of the foreman — even assuming that he had authority to make it — does not have the significance which plaintiffs would attribute to it; it was evidently intended to inform the timekeeper that thereafter Angretti was to receive the payments previously made to Sechan, but it throws no light at all on the question whether Angretti was “working for us” as an independent contractor or as an employe. After giving due weight to all the testimony and conceding to plaintiffs the benefit of all inferences reasonably deducible from it the court properly concluded that they had not, as a matter of law, sustained their burden of proving that Hull was Angretti’s employer and therefore responsible for the damage caused by the negligent operation of his truck.</p>
