L. 905, 75 PS §192(b) Pkt. Part), cited the defendant and, following a hearing, suspended his operator’s license for a period of ninety days because of his above-mentioned violation of Sec. 1002(b) 6 of The Vehicle Code, as amended (75 PS §501 Pkt. Part). The defendant appealed the suspension to the Court of Common Pleas of his county and the court entered upon a hearing of the matter as provided by Sec. 616 of The Vehicle Code, as amended (75 PS §193 Pkt. Part). Subsequently, the court filed an opinion and entered an order sustaining the appeal, the effect whereof was to revoke the suspension and reinstate the operator’s license. The Commonwealth has appealed.</p>

Unfortunately for that contention, it was ruled by this court a number of years ago that the original requirement of Sec. 616 of The Vehicle Code of 1929 that the hearing court “. . . determine whether the petitioner <em>is subject to Suspension of operator’s license </em>. . . under the provisions of this act [emphasis supplied]” meant that “. . . the court [was] to hear de novo the witnesses of the Commonwealth and the witnesses of the licensee, and, from the testimony taken, . . . determine <em>anew whether the operator’s license should be suspended” </em>(Emphasis supplied) : <em>Commonwealth v. Funk, </em><a href="/pa/323/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="323 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1169626" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0390-01">323 Pa. 390</a>, 399, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%2065" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="186 A. 65">186 A. 65</a> (1936). Thus, the merit of the suspension was early recognized by this court as being a matter for the hearing court’s independent determination.

In 1939, three years after the decision in the <em>Funk </em>case, supra, the legislature amended the very portion of Sec. 616 now relied on by the Commonwealth, viz., “whether the petitioner is subject to suspension of operator’s license or learner’s permit under the provisions of this act” by inserting, in presently material re<a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>gard, the words “by the secretary” between the word “permit” and the word “under” in the clause just quoted. But the words “whether the petitioner is subject to suspension” were left unchanged; and, although other sections of the Code have been amended since then down to and including the latest legislative session (1949), the clause in question still remains the same as it was left by the amendment of 1939, supra. Sec. 52 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS §552, provides that “In ascertaining the intention of the Legislature in the enactment of a law, the courts may be guided by the following presumptions among others: ... (4) That when a court of last resort has construed the language used in a law, the Legislature in subsequent laws on the same subject matter intend the same construction to be placed upon such language.”</p>

In the <em>Herzog </em>case where the lower court did not consider the evidence de novo but determined merely that “. . . the action of the Secretary of Revenue was justified by the available evidence in the case”, we said that “Such an approach to the problem <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>was, of course, contrary to the intention of The Vehicle Code.”</p>

The one sanction is penal and the other civil: <em>Commonwealth v. Funk, </em>supra, at p. 400. Moreover, the <em>Wright </em>case, supra, is clearly distinguishable from the present. There, the hearing judge found the petitioner to have been guilty of reckless driving, — an offense which ordinarily connotes danger to life and limb. Indeed, the circumstances were such as to cause the hearing judge to comment that, “. . . the officer making the arrest would have been derelict in his duty had he not made the arrest.” And, we further pointed out that there was <em>not </em>“a suggestion of a single word in mitigation of the offense ... to be found in the record.”</p>

Wherein, then, was it an abuse of discretion? The <em>Handwerk, Hardwick </em>and <em>Schwartz </em>cases, supra, all involved license suspensions for speed violations where the common pleas court sustained the appeals and this court affirmed. In fact, the findings by the lower court from the evidence adduced in the instant case are quite analogous to the findings made in the <em>Schwartz </em>case, supra. Our approval of those cases does not mean that a speed violation alone is insufficient to justify suspension of an operator’s license. It is indeed sufficient if, in the opinion of the court from all the evidence taken on the hearing, the suspension is merited: <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Herzog, supra. Nor does a court automatically abuse its discretion by discriminating between the circumstances in which speed violations are committed. On an appeal from the action of the Secretary, the matter of license suspension must necessarily rest in the sound discretion of the court. Not otherwise can justice in such matters be judicially administered. There is nothing in the record now before us whereby we could say that the learned court below manifestly abused its discretion.</p>
