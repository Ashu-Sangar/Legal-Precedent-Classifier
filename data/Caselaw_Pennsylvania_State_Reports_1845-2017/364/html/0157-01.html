The plaintiffs denied the power of the City to levy and collect taxes such as the plaintiffs averred the defendants were threatening to collect. The defendants filed answers admitting the averments of fact and pleading that the legislature had granted the asserted power. Whether the power asserted by the city was conferred by the legislature is the principal question now presented.</p>

The present suits result from the amendment of December 9, 1949, which, for present purposes, may be said to have attempted to do two things: first, to increase the rate of taxation from <em>1% </em>to 1 and second, to include among the subjects of taxation many subjects that were not taxed by the ordinance before it was amended. The plaintiffs do not challenge the increase in the rate of 1%% for taxes which the city has power to impose, but they deny the power of the city to impose the general income tax imposed by the amendment. The purpose of amending the ordinance was to tax many not taxed before.</p>

Whether these are paid by the holders of the stock for their respective interest, or by the corporation itself as the agent and representative of all its shareholders, is of no possible consequence to the owners of the property. It is more convenient for the state to keep its accounts witli the corporations, and to collect its taxes on corporate property from the officers of the corporation and in a lump, than to collect it in small sums from many shareholders.” As early as 1868,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> legislation relieved stockholders from the personal property tax on shares of stock of corporations liable to tax on their capital stock, and it was said: “The policy arose out of the recognized identity of the capital stock and the shares composing it as one and the same subject, so that the taxation of the one is the taxation of the other and that to tax both would amount to double taxation”: <em>Commonwealth v.

When the corporation pays to its stockholders income out of the property on which the capital stock tax has been paid, the city may not again tax the income in the hands of the stockholder; and the reason is that the Sterling Act did not confer the power- to tax the “subject” that the state had taxed; on the contrary, tax was prohibited.' The dividend was income created by the state-taxed property; it was paid because of, and in proportion to, the stockholders’ interest in the corporate property. In <em>Kelley v.

It is immaterial, in construing the Sterling Act, that the income has been transferred from the corporation to its beneficially interested stockholders. Chief Justice Frazer said, in <em>Kelley v. Kalodner, </em>at pp. 186-187, “. . . we are inevitably impelled to the conclusion that an income tax is a property tax. This result seems particularly clear in so far as a tax upon the income from real and personal property is concerned. The act in question [the graduated income tax Act of July 12, 1935, P. L. 970] places a tax upon all income derived from any source whatever, subject, of course, to stated exemptions and deductions. The income from real estate, for example, is not exempt. A tax upon the income from such property necessarily diminishes its value in the hands of the owner and to that extent is a tax upon the land itself. In like manner a tax upon the income from bonds and stocks is a tax upon the securities themselves (citing authorities).”</p>

The real question is, is there any basis upon which to rest the contention that real estate belongs to one of the two great classes of taxes, and the rent or income which is the incident of its ownership belongs to the other? We are unable to perceive any ground for the alleged distinction. An annual tax upon the annual value or annual user of real estate appears to us the same in substance as an annual tax on the real estate, which would be paid out of the rent or income.

It denies the power of the city to tax the income of corporations which are liable to taxation by Pennsylvania under the provisions of the foreign corporation franchise tax Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, as amended, 72 PS 1871 (b) and the corporate net income tax Act of May 16, 1935, P. L. 208, as re-enacted and amended, 72 PS 3420 et seq. With respect to this plaintiff, the city says: “The question directly involved is whether the said foreign corporation Franchise Tax is a tax on income, for it is quite obvious that if it is not a tax on income, then the amendatory ordinance of December 9, 1949, taxing net income derived from business in Philadelphia by foreign corporations is not a duplication of the foreign corporation Franchise Tax.” Earlier in this opinion, it was noted that the franchise tax was regarded as an equivalent of the capital stock tax and that, while considered an excise tax in some contexts, in others it was regarded as a tax on property. As the capital stock tax and the franchise tax are paid out of the corporate property, the income is not taxable by the city.</p>

The vagueness is criticized in one of the briefs as follows: “The Ordinance is devoid of any provisions for determining profit or net income. The Ordinance includes two sentences defining net profits and net income. The definition of net profits is confined to gain from the operation of a business. Consequently, the only definition of net income is the single sentence, which provides: ‘Net Income. The gain derived from capital, labor, or from both combined, after deducting the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the production of such income either paid or accrued in accordance with the accounting system used and without deduction of taxes based on income.’ There are four specific provisions dealing with the exclusion of certain types of income. These deal with services performed, or goods sold, outside of the City; premiums on insurance upon risks outside the City; exclusions of certain portions of the net income and net profits of estates and trusts, etc., and the exclusion of the gain of non-resident renters of safe deposit boxes from securities deposited therein, merely because such boxes are located within the City. None of these provisions aid in determination of what is net income, or how it shall be determined. . . . the Ordinance makes no provision as to the basis to be used in determining gain in any of the various circumstances by which property may be acquired. No method is set forth to determine the basis of property received by gift or inheritance. No provision is made with respect to depreciation. No list of deductible or non-deductible items to be used in determining net income are specified. The Ordinance does not prescribe what adjustments to the basis of property are required or permitted for cap<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>ital expenditures or for receipts. The Ordinance does not state whether exchanges of property are equivalent to taxable sales. The Ordinance does not state whether capital losses are deductible in determining capital gains or net income.”</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[341,551,1153,798]]]'>In another brief, the following pertinent criticism is made: “The language of this Ordinance, as it concerns the taxation of trusts and estates and their beneficiaries, is so vague, indefinite, uncertain and contradictory that it is impossible to determine what City Council really intended. The sections relating to this matter are subject to the following four possible but inconsistent interpretations: (a) City Council intended to tax <em>both </em>the fiduciaries and the beneficiaries; (b) City Council intended to tax the <em>fiduciaries only </em>on the net income received by them; (c) City Council intended to tax the <em>beneficiaries only </em>on the net income received by them; or (d) City Council intended the trustees to <em>deduct the tax payable by the beneficiaries </em>on the income payable to them.”</p>
