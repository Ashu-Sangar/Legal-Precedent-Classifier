They brought a bill in equity against the officers and directors, naming the corporation also as a party defendant. The bill alleged fraudulent withdrawals of corporate property for which plaintiffs demanded an accounting and restitution; it complained also of allegedly improper sales and transfers of stock. Defendants filed preliminary objections all of which were sus<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>tained by tbe court below with leave to plaintiffs to file an amended bill. Plaintiffs thereupon filed such a bill and again defendants filed preliminary objections; this time the court sustained some of these and dismissed others. Plaintiffs have taken an appeal (No. 114) on the ground that the court improperly limited the period for which defendants should account. Defendants have likewise taken an appeal (No. 101) on the ground that they are not liable to account at all.</p>

L. 243, as amended by the Act of March 30, 1921, P. L. 60, allows an appeal to the defendant in all cases where the plaintiff prays for an account and the defendant denies his liability to account and the decree of the court, upon this preliminary question of liability, is in favor of the plaintiff. It is not the province of the appellate court under this Act to determine preliminarily what period the account should cover; any objections on that score must await an appeal from the final decree: <em>Beatty v.

As far as a plaintiff’s wow-statutory right of appeal from the sustaining of preliminary objections is concerned, it would lie only if he were denied an accounting and his bill were dismissed, which is not the case. here. Plaintiffs’ appeal in the present case must therefore be quashed. It may be added, however, that, in the light of what is hereinafter shown to be the fatal inadequacy of their bill, the question raised by plaintiffs’ appeal as to the proper period of accounting, is, in any event, wholly academic.</p>

      <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>One of defendants’ preliminary objections was to the multifarionsness of plaintiffs’ bill in that it sets forth two distinct causes of action, one, a stockholders’ derivative suit seeking restitution of corporate property which the corporation itself had refused to reclaim, the other an action seeking relief for the individual plaintiffs from alleged improper sales and transfers of stock. Joining these two unconnected causes of action in one bill undoubtedly made it vulnerable to defendants’ attack on the ground stated: <em>Kelly v.

Lohmeyer, President of the corporation, has been receiving 15%, and William E. Grafe, Secretary and General Manager, 10%, of the net profits of the business, as well as bonuses, the amounts of which are not stated in the bill;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> that these allowances were in addition to the regular salaries of those officers, the amounts of which salaries, however, are not set forth; that Lohmeyer has also received certain commissions, amounting to approximately $3000 a year over a period of three years, in connection with sales to customers whom he personally handled. A later paragraph of the bill alleges that Lohmeyer and Grafe unanthorizedly and improperly ivithdrew and distributed profits of the company to themselves totalling approximately $37,000 and $28,000 respectively in the years from 1927 to 1947 inclusive; these sums, however, apparently represent the percentages of the net profits <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>already referred to. The bill itself discloses that all these payments were authorized by the Board of Directors, — the percentages of the net profits by a resolution in 1919, the bonuses by resolutions in 1920 and 1929, and the commissions by a resolution in 1946; moreover they have all been approved, ratified and confirmed at a meeting of the shareholders. It is true, of course, that majority stockholders occupy a quasi-fiduciary relation toward the minority which prevents them from using their power in such a way as to exclude the minority from their proper share of the benefits accruing from the enterprise: <em>Weisbecker v. Hosiery Patents, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/356/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="356 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="470732" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0244-01">356 Pa. 244</a>, 250, <a href="/citations/?q=51%20A.2d%20811" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="51 A.2d 811">51 A. 2d 811</a>, 813, 814. It is also true that directors may not vote to themselves or to the officers of the corporation compensation which is excessive, unreasonable and out of proportion to the value of the services rendered, and, if any such payments are made, the court, upon protest of a minority shareholder, may examine into their propriety and reduce them if found to be exorbitant. These principles, however, have no application to the present case for the reason that the bill not only fails to allege that the compensation paid to any of the directors or officers was in fact excessive or unreasonable, but it also fails to set forth any facts from which such an inference could be drawn; it does not state what the salaries were nor the amount of the sales and profits nor even the nature of the business conducted by the corporation. Certainly the payment of bonuses to the officers of a corporation is not in itself irregular or illegal; on the contrary it is quite usual in the case of profitable business operations the success of which is attributable at least in part to the industry and ability of the management, and a court is not ordinarily warranted in substituting its own judgment as to the proper compensation of the officers for that of the directors whom the stockholders have chosen to manage the af<a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>fairs of the corporation. Nor, in the absence of averments of facts indicating that such compensation is improper, does plaintiffs’ bill gain additional weight by its occasional employment of the adjective “fraudulent”.

Lohmeyer, Jr., (who is not a party to the bill) sums totalling approximately $14,000 over a period of 2% years for commissions on sales, a Christmas bonus, and a certain percentage of the company’s profits.

Specific objection is made to transfers of 20 shares in 1936 by Arthur Lohmeyer to Lloyd O. Lohmeyer, 37 shares in 1946 by Josephine E. Fling to Lloyd O. Lohmeyer, 10 shares in 1940 by Lloyd O. Lohmeyer to Ruth C. Lohmeyer and 13 to Ruth W. Lohmeyer, and 10 shares in 1941 by Lloyd O. Lohmeyer to Ruth C. Lohmeyer. There are several reasons why plaintiffs’ objections to these transfers cannot be sustained. One is that Arthur Lohmeyer, Josephine E. Fling and Ruth C. Lohmeyer are not parties to the bill. Another is that there is no averment that if these shares had been offered to them plaintiffs would have desired to exercise their option to negotiate for their purchase. A third reason is that a by-law is a contract among the shareholders <em>(Elliott v. Lindquist, </em><a href="/pa/356/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="356 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="470715" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0385-01">356 Pa. 385</a>, 388, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%20180" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="52 A.2d 180">52 A. 2d 180</a>, 182) and therefore, upon well-established authority, the six year limitation of the statute would be applicable in equity and would bar all these transactions that occurred beyond that period: <em>Ebbert v.

There is nothing to indicate that there was any affirmative, independent act of concealment on the part of defendants which would have prevented plaintiffs from examining the stock transfer books since the year 1930 from which time plaintiffs have been stockholders. Moreover, even apart from the statute of limitations, plaintiffs are clearly guilty of laches, which, appearing upon the face of the bill, can be taken advantage of by the filing of preliminary objections: <em>Leseman-</em>

The remaining transaction was one in 1946 whereby 20 shares were transferred to Ruth W. Lohmeyer, but in that case there was a simultaneous double transfer from the holdings of one Ethel F.
