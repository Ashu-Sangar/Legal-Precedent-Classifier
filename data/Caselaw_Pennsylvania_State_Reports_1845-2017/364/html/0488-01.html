Many of them, including decedent, were persons of limited education. She possessed an estate of approximately $7,000. Decedent’s son was her sole heir. The son had three children. The questioned paper was. purported to have been signed April 10,1946. Decedent died July 15, 1946. For some months prior to the death decedent was bedridden and was extremely ill. According to the attending physician she suffered from heart trouble, high blood pressure, edema (i. e. tumor or dropsy), sweating of the legs, enlargement of the liver and other complications. While there is testimony that decedent possessed testamentary capacity, there is also testimony that at times she was delirious, had lapses of memory, was not always clear and coherent, and did not possess testamentary capacity.</p>

(Proponent had always resided in Florida; his <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>farm was close to Jacksonville and he had never before been beyond that city.) Proponent contends that because the son neglected his mother and proponent cared for decedent, she properly disinherited the son and grandchildren and devised and bequeathed her estate to proponent who therefore became, in the circumstances, the natural object of decedent’s bounty. Contestant, the son, and his witnesses, on the contrary, present a different situation. They concede that from March 2, 1946, until April 10, 1946 ( the-date of the questioned will) and thereafter until decedent’s death, proponent nursed and cared for his sister. It is also admitted that the son was an alcoholic. It was testified by some witnesses for both proponent and contestant that despite the son’s Aveakness, the mother retained a deep affection for the son and his children. Four other Avills had been drawn and executed by decedent previous to the questioned document. In the first three Avills active trusts Avere created for the son and the grandchildren. From the date of proponent’s arrival in Philadelphia on March 2, 1946, he promptly assumed the management and control of decedent’s financial affairs. On April 2, 1946, at <em>proponent’s </em>direction to the scrivener, a avíII Avas draAvn and was executed by decedent in which she left proponent the bulk of her estate. (The beneficiaries in the three previous Avills had been decedent’s son and grandchildren). This Avill disinherited the son. On April 10,1946, again, at <em>proponent’s </em>direction, decedent’s laAvyer, the scrivener, drew the questioned document Avherein the son Avas bequeathed a bedroom suite and proponent’s interest in decedent’s estate was increased.</p>

      <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>At the inception there is considerable donbt whether the questioned writing was adequately proven under section 2 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS 191. The Act provides that a will “. . . shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses. . . .” The writing contains the purported signature of Sealie Wilson the decedent. The attestation clause is signed by two witnesses Thomas Brown and Juanita Best.. These subscribing witnesses certify in the paper that it was: “Signed, sealed, published and declared by the testatrix above named, as and for her last Will and Testament in the presence of us, who have hereunto, at her request subscribed our names in her presence and the presence of each other, as witnesses hereto.”</p>
    <p id="b533-4" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[107,1111,1153,1199]],["BL_534.1",534,[346,284,1150,1034]]]'>This statement is conceded to be false. Neither subscribing witness saw decedent sign her name nor did the subscribing witnesses sign at the request of decedent and in the presence of each other. Subscribing witness Thomas Brown testified that he did not see decedent sign; that he came in the decedent’s room at the request of proponent; that the scrivener Livingston was there and <em>he </em>requested the witness to sign; that decedent was lying down in her bed; that decedent was not clear and coherent. Subscribing witness Juanita Best, while at first uncertain, finally declared that it was the <em>scrivener </em>who requested her to sign as a witness ; the will was read by the <em>witness </em>but it was not read to decedent; that as far as the witness knew decedent was of “sound and disposing mind”. While both subscribing witnesses testified that they did not sign in the presence of each other, neither could remember whether proponent was in the room when they did sign. Mr. Livingston, the lawyer-scrivener, testified that the <em>proponent </em>came to him and gave him directions to prepare the will; that in accordance with such directions he prepared the will and took it to the decedent at her <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>home and read it to her and that she signed it; that at times decedent had “lapses of memory”; that at the signing, in his opinion, decedent possessed testamentary capacity. The situation, therefore, is: one subscribing witness repudiates while the other subscribing witness affirms, but both certifying in the attestation clause to an untruth. Under these facts, the testimony of the subscribing witness and the attesting witness as to the valid execution of the paper was for the jury. There is real doubt whether or not decedent, though physically in the room, could see, hear, comprehend and approve of what was happening, so that her assent might be inferred. One witness said she was lying down; the other said that decedent was sometimes lying down and at other times sitting on the side of the bed. There is an absence of testimony as to <em>where </em>in the room the witnesses signed and whether the decedent did or could have seen them sign, so that her direction might be implied.</p>

We observe, however, that no witness testified that decedent possessed a full knowledge of the property she possessed, an intelligent perception and understanding of the disposition she desired to make of it and of the persons and objects she desired to be the recipients of her bounty: <em>Olshefski’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/337/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="337 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1197321" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0420-01">337 Pa. 420</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20A.2d%20487" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 A.2d 487">11 A. 2d 487</a>; <em>Ash Will, </em><a href="/pa/351/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="351 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="462704" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0317-01">351 Pa. 317</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="41 A.2d 620">41 A. 2d 620</a>.</p>

Proponent also caused his name to be added to decedent’s bank account. He became the designated beneficiary in decedent’s life insurance policy and those of the son.

Significantly the scrivener testified: “Q. When you explained that to [decedent] she signed the document? A. Yes.”</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[327,712,1150,1086]]]'>Thus the lawyer testified, in effect, that he explained to his ill and illiterate client that while the form was an absolute bequest to proponent, yet in substance it constituted a trust for her son and her grandchildren. The proponent himself testified that he wanted the will changed to pass to him absolutely because he did not “want the property so complicated” (i. e. in trust for the son and grandchildren). He testified: “Q. Didn’t you so testify that you did not want the property so complicated to leave it in trust with you for her son and grandchildren? You did not want it that way? A. I didn’t tell Mr. Livingston I didn’t want it that way. Q. You did not want it that way? A. I didn’t want it that way. Q. You wanted it left to you directly, and you would carry out the trust; is that right? A. That’s right.” We neither decide nor infer that a trust may be established <em>by parol </em>where the devise or bequest is absolute in written terms.
