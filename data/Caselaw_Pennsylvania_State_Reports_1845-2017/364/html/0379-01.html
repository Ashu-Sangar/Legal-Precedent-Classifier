The parties entered into an agreement of lease on December 3, 1943, which lease provided for the mining of coal underlying cértain tracts of land in Huntingdon and Bedford Counties. It also contained an arbitration clause under the Act of April 25, 1927, P. L. 381, No. 248 (5 P. S. 161, et seq.). The agreement was executed by the appellees, as lessors, and by the Pennsylvania <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>Edison Company (now Pennsylvania Electric Company, the appellant), as lessee. The coal lease contained provision for the inclusion under its. terms of the so-called “Gould” tract, under certain, conditions. On July 15, 1949, the appellees caused judgment to he entered under warrant of attorney contained in the coal lease, in the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County, in the amount of $5,156.74.</p>

All proceedings for the enforcement of said judgment were ordered stayed pending disposition of that rule. On the same date the court upon the petition of the appellant granted a rule on the appellees to show cause why they should not proceed with arbitration in the manner provided for in a written agreement with the Pennsylvania Edison Company and to show cause why the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County should not appoint an arbitrator for them as provided by the arbitration provisions of said agreement. Later both rules were discharged and this appeal followed.</p>

The appellees contend that where the dispute is one of <em>law </em>it is not the subject of arbitration. Their reasoning in support of this is that since the court has the statutory right “to correct an award that is against the law” and had the right under the agreement to correct the arbitrator’s “conclusions of law,” a question of law is, therefore, not a subject of arbitration. This is the view of the court below. It is not our view and the contention made is ovei*ruled.</p>
