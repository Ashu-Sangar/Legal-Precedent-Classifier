On the return day the court received evidence concerning the parties’ negotiations for settlement to which the plaintiffs had referred in their motion. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to state these negotiations in detail, though apparently both parties understood on November 6, 1948, that the lessee would have (in the words of the judge) “. . . until November 22, 1948, to file whatever papers he desired or was advised to file for his protection . . .” Instead of getting his petition to open filed by November 22nd, it was not filed until November 29th. This period of one week, the judge held, constituted fatal delay, saying, “We do not find that the application was made with reasonable promptness, nor <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>was the failure to do so explained.” We must reject that conclusion. If the lessor’s motion to discharge defendant’s rule could be regarded as a demurrer (compare <em>Bekelja v. James E. Strates Shows, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/349/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="349 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="458956" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0442-01">349 Pa. 442</a>, 443, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20502" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="37 A.2d 502">37 A. 2d 502</a> [1944]) it would have been bad as a “speaking” demurrer <em>(Caskie v.

The proceeding gained nothing by the evidence then received.</p>
    <p id="b71-3" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[131,721,1154,1239]]]'>Counsel for the appellee considers Rule 209 inapplicable for the following reasons stated in his brief: “It is sufficient to say that this rule applies only when a party has a right to file a petition. But in this case, appellant waived his right. Certainly appellees had a right to challenge the filing of the petition to open the judgment. They exercised it by filing a motion to discharge the rule, which the Court, after full hearing, properly discharged.” We find no evidence of the waiver. As the facts are not in dispute this Court makes its own inferences of fact and may reject the inferences made below: <em>Fidelity Trust Co. v. Union Nat. Bank of Pitts, et al., </em><a href="/pa/313/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="313 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1152658" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0467-01">313 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20209" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="169 A. 209">169 A. 209</a> (1934); <em>Gribben v.

It appears in the evidence taken on the return day that negotiations for settlement had been in process until November 6th; the defendant had paid the rent to the end of the term; November 22nd had been specified by plaintiffs’ counsel as the last day on which negotiations could be considered. It does not appear that the record now shows what would have appeared if the lessors had answered the lessee’s petition to open and the procedure of Rule 209 had been followed.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[138,1981,1149,313]],["BL_72.1",72,[330,285,1149,958]]]'>The record shows that there has been an altogether unsatisfactory trial. Unless there was default, the challenged judgment was unauthorized. Defendant denied substantial averments of fact made by lessors in the amicable action. Not only has there been no trial to determine whether the alleged default existed, but such <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>a trial was made impossible by premature, and so far as appears, erroneous discharge of defendant’s rule. With respect to this subject, the court said, in part, “It is true he [lessee] alleges he has a defense to the judgment in ejectment. Assuming this to be correct, we are not required to open a judgment entered by confession merely because the defendant produces evidence, which, if true, would constitute a defense. Berkowitz v. Kass, <a href="/pa/351/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="351 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="462752" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0263-01">351 Pa. 263</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.2d%20691" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="40 A.2d 691">40 A. 2d 691</a> (1945)]. An application to open a judgment is addressed to the court’s sound discretion. Berkowitz v. Kass, supra; Stoner v. Sley System Garages, <a href="/pa/353/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="353 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="465725" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0532-01">353 Pa. 532</a> at 534 [<a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20172" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="46 A.2d 172">46 A. 2d 172</a> (1946) ].” That principle is important but it must also be remembered that the judicial discretion exercisable in disposing of rules to open judgment does not include the power to substitute inappropriate and inadequate procedure for the Rules of Civil Procedure established pursuant to statute.</p>

In this case we must conclude that there was reversible abuse of discretion.' Among the elements to be dealt with are the facts that a defense on the merits has been averred and has not been answered (compare <em>Quaker City Chocolate and Confectionery Co. v.
