Porter, the defendant, to partnership with him in an instrument-manufacturing business owned and conducted by Fischer who furnished all of the capital of the partnership. For some time prior, Porter had been an employee of Fischer. The partnership endured until May 1942 when the partners incorporated the business, Porter’s share of the capital stock of the corporation being paid for out of the accumulated profits then standing to his credit on the books of the partnership. The corporation (Fischer &amp; Porter Company), whereof <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>Fischer became president and Porter secretary, is the present plaintiff. At the end of 1942, Fischer and Porter had a disagreement and, in consequence, Porter’s employment by the company was terminated on December 30,1942. He promptly retained counsel to represent him and from then until early March 1943, the contract, here in suit, was negotiated; it was signed by the parties on March 11, 1943, each of them having acted throughout on the advice of respective counsel.</p>
    <p id="b539-3" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[132,768,1150,971]]]'>By the terms of the contract Porter sold to the company, for a specified sum, all of his stock in the company. It so happened that he had received from the business for the year 1942 a large taxable income whereon his Federal tax would be $40,723.71. He asked that he be relieved of this tax liability by the agreement. To that, Fischer assented. Accordingly, the company undertook in the contract to pay whatever income taxes should be owing by Porter for the year 1942<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and, also, any deficiency of income taxes as might later be found owing by him for the years of the partnership prior to 1942. A correlative provision of the contract provided that any moneys which might come to Porter “by reason of any claims for refund of income taxes” should belong to the company; and Porter expressly agreed to pay over any such refunds to the company forthwith upon his receipt of them. The presently relevant provisions of the written contract are as follows:</p>

S. C. A. §122), which had become effective October 21, 1942. Under that enactment, a taxpayer whose tax return for any year thereafter shows a loss in net income has a right to carry back such loss to his return of income for the earlier of the two years immediately preceding the year of such loss (not prior to the year 1941, however) and offset the loss against the net income shown by his return for the earlier of the two years. On the basis of the net taxable income for that year, as thus adjusted, the taxpayer is entitled to a <em>pro tanto </em>refund on account of that year’s taxes. If the loss is sufficient to offset <em>in toto </em>the net taxable income for the earlier of the two “carry-back” years, then the taxpayer receives a refund for the whole of the income tax paid by him for the earlier year, and, any residue of the “carry-back” loss, still remaining, is applicable to the net taxable income returned for the succeeding or second year of the “carry-back” period for similar adjustment of the net income for that year and a refund of taxes accordingly. As is already apparent, the amendment of 1942, supra, <em>was on the statute hooks and in full force and effect when the contract here in suit was negotiated and executed.</em>

By carrying back this loss and offsetting it against his net income of $43,378.61 for 1941, as shown by his return for that year, Porter had an adjusted net income, subject to tax, for the year 1941 of $26,644.75 and a right to a corresponding refund for that year of $8,777.32. It is that sum, together with interest thereon of $1,187.82, for a total of $9,965.14, which Porter received as a tax refund for 1941 and which he refused to turn over to the company.</p>

    <p id="b543-3" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[95,388,1160,1915]]]'>The presently pertinent Internal Revenue Code specifically recognizes that an “overpayment” results from an application of the “carry-back” provision of the Act of 1942, supra: see 26 U. S. C. A. §3771, Pkt. Part. That section treats with “'Interest on Overpayments”, and subdivision (e) thereof is expressly applicable to <em>“claims </em>[for refund] based on <em>carry-back of loss </em>or credit” (Emphasis supplied). In general, payments of income taxes in excess of the amount ultimately determined to be due are overpayments within the contemplation of the Internal Revenue Code regardless of whether the excessive payment resulted from carelessness or mistake on the part of the taxpayer or from operation of law. Supplement O of the Internal Revenue Code, entitled “Over-payments” since 1924, deals with the right to refunds of overpaid income taxes and, since 1928, Section 321 of Supplement O has defined as an overpayment the payment of more tax than the amount determined to be due. Throxxghout the Internal Revenue Code, the term “overpayment” is used as basic to all types of refunds including refunds for taxes correctly assessed in amount, <em>token paid, </em>bxxt later remitted or redxxced because of subsequent events. See Supplement O. Here, as already indicated, the “carry-back” provision, which was responsible for the defendant’s refund on account of his 1941 income taxes, was a part of the law when the contract was execxxted. In <em>Beaver County Building and Loan Association v. Winowich, </em><a href="/pa/323/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="323 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="1169549" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0483-01">323 Pa. 483</a>, 489, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20481" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="187 A. 481">187 A. 481</a>, Mr. Justice Stern, speaking for this court, declared that, — “In determining what constitutes the obligation of a contract, no principle is more firmly established than that the laws which were in force at the time and place of the making of the contract enter into its obligation with the same effect as if expressly incorporated in its terms: [citing cases].”</p>

      <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>Tt was incumbent upon tbe court below to construe the word “overpayment” as a matter of law in strict accordance with its well-known intendment as used in the Internal Revenue Code and as affected by the “carry-back” provision of the Act of 1942, supra. The only suggestion of obscurity in the contract was that which the learned trial judge mistakenly imputed to it because of his. misunderstanding the technical significance of the word “overpayment” in the premises. As the present Chief Justice aptly quoted in <em>Moore v. Stevens Coal Company, </em><a href="/pa/315/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="315 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1156632" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0564-01">315 Pa. 564</a>, 568, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20661" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="173 A. 661">173 A. 661</a>, — “It is not the province of the court to alter a contract by construction or to make a new contract for the parties; its duty is confined to the interpretation of the one which they have made for themselves, without regard to its wisdom or folly.”</p>

What the defendant sought to do was “. . . to create an ambiguity in the contract by parol testimony when no ambiguity exist[ed] in the writing”: <em>Dahath Electric Company v. Suburban Electric Development </em>Company, <a href="/pa/332/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="332 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1186582" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0129-01">332 Pa. 129</a>, 133, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 A.2d 765">2 A. 2d 765</a>. It is only where there is doubt, uncertainty or ambiguity as to the meaning of the words of a contract that parol evidence may be admitted to explain the sense in which the parties presumably used them and which then becomes a question for the jury. The cases and text authorities cited and relied upon by the learned court below in this connection are not presently pertinent. There w.as lio issue which the jury could competently determine. And, the conclusion reached by it was necessarily the veriest guess. Nor was anything more than that to be expected. The learned trial judge, himself, observed to counsel at a side-bar conference that he doubted whether the jury knew “what it was all about.” Not only were the defendant’s unexpressed <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>thoughts at the time of the execution of the contract legally incompetent to vary its meaning (see <em>National Realty Appraisal Company v.

As is well known, the Ruml Plan was designed to make income taxes payable currently with the taxpayer’s receipts of income and was effectuated in part by statutory provision for partial forgiveness in certain circumstances of the taxpayer’s liability for tax on his income for the preceding year. As matters transpired, the defendant did not become entitled to any tax “forgiveness” by virtue of the Ruml Plan in the form in'which it was finally enacted into law. He professes, however, that, had he obtained a refund under the provisions of the Ruml Plan, he would have been required under the terms of the contract to assign it to the plaintiff forthwith. For what reason could he be liable to the company under the contract for a possible refund under a law (viz., the Ruml Plan), which was,not enacted until approximately three months after the contract had been executed, and, yet, not be liable for an actual refund of income taxes for one of the specified years under the “carry-back” provision that was already on the statute books when the contract was signed? The answer is obvious. Indeed, the defendant’s peculiar concession impugns the <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>integrity of Ms professed understanding. The terms of the contract, as written, are too plain and meaningful to permit of the injection of doubt on the basis of defendant’s later self-serving statements as to what he thought the contract was intended to mean. While not important, it is not unnoteworthy that the defendant did not call, as a corroborating witness to his alleged understanding of the provisions respecting refunds, the counsel who had advised him throughout the negotiation and execution of the contract. In any event, its clearly expressed intent admits of no legal doubt that the defendant is liable to tlie company for the amount of the refund which he actually received on account of his 1941 income taxes.</p>
