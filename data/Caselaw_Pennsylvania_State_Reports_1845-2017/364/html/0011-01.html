ITe received a fair trial which was reviewed by a court in banc composed of three judges who refused his motion for a new trial. He now presents but two contentions: first, that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that he should not have been “convicted of a higher crime than his principal” who had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter : his second contention is that the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to have a copy of the indictment instead of the original which had written on it that the principal in the first degree was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.</p>

McGrogan, were fellow prisoners in the penitentiary on June 1, 1948, when they killed Richard Rafter, Jr., another prisoner. President Judge Oliver, in the opinion written for the court in banc, refusing appellant’s motion for a new trial, described the murder as follows: “In the morning of that day, defendant and McGrogan were seated on the steps in the exercise yard. Defendant had a small knife with a sharp, well-pointed blade about <em>2y2" </em>long, concealed in his pocket. McGrogan had a knife with a 6" blade and also a small knife similar to the one belonging to defendant. They had been seated for some minutes when Rafter entered the yard. Either as he approached, or as he was passing the steps, McGrogan and defendant jumped up and attacked him. Rafter did not have any knife or other weapon in his possession. McGrogan struck Rafter and also stabbed him twice in the chest with his knife, leaving one wound 4 to 5" deep and another 6" deep, the latter wound, causing a fatal hemorrhage. McGrogan backed Rafter against the wall while the knife was still sticking in his chest and pummelled him with blows upon the face and head. Meanwhile, defendant was yelling to McGrogan such phrases as ‘get him, get him,’ and ‘Go get him, keep after him.’ Defendant was also skirting around the two struggling men getting in such blows upon Rafter as he could. He had a small knife in his hand and in his own words, ‘kept swinging up and down from the shoulder to the leg.’ After the fight was over, defendant’s knife was <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>covered Avith blood and there Avas blood on his hands Aidiich he acknoAvledged came from Rafter.”</p>

The appellant and McGrogan Avere indicted together for murder but, on appellant’s application, he Avas tried separately.

L. 306, 309, 38 PS 5105, now provides: “Principals in the Second Degree and Accessories, Aiders and Abettors. — Every principal in the second degree or accessory before the fact, to any felony at the common laAV or under any act of Assembly may be indicted, tried, convicted, and if no punishment is provided, may be punished in all respects as if he Avere the principal felon . .

L. 382, carried into the Code of 1939. Walling, J., said, “A defendant may be both an accessory before the fact and also a principal (Bishop’s New Criminal Law, vol. 1, section 664), and the indictment under the statute above quoted, is the same Avhether he is one or the other or both.

The indictment Avould doubtless have gone out Avith the jury if it had not had endorsed on it that McGrogan Avas convicted of voluntary manslaughter.
