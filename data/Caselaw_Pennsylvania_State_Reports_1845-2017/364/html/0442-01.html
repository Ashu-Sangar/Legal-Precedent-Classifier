The able argument of his appointed counsel understandably assumes such to have been the case. The fact is, however, as the record affirmatively shows, the defendant <em>was </em>present in court at the time in question. Thus, the minute book of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Allegheny County, October Sessions 1918, contains the following pertinent entry: “And now October 21, 1918, defendant present in open court pleads non cul et de hoc. District Attorney similiter. Issue joined. EODIE a jury being called and came . . . [names of jurors], . . . impaneled and sworn. ...”</p>

When collaterally attacked, the judgment of a court carries with it a presumption of regularity’.” In the present instance, we have not only a presumption of the regularity of the judgment of conviction but also direct proof that the factual basis of the alleged irregularity did not actually exist. There is nothing in the case to justify a departure from the stated record. Until the contrary affirmatively and competently appears, the relator is bound by the record: see <em>Prine v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/18/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="18 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="969119" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0103-01">18 Pa. 103</a>.</p>

The record facts show that, on the evening of the crime involved, a police officer, a few minutes after he had been told by the victim that he had been robbed and assaulted, went with the victim in the latter’s automobile to. the place where the crime had been committed and, in that <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>vicinity, saw the. relator walking through a field. The officer overtook him and placed him under arrest. He broke away and pulled a large knife from his pocket; but, when the officer drew his revolver and threatened to shoot, the relator surrendered. The officer then searched him and found on his person a wallet .which the victim at once identified as his. It has long been the settled law in this State that a police officer, or even a private citizen, may arrest for felony without a warrant: <em>Wakely v. </em>Hart, 6 Binney 315, 318; <em>Brooks v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/61/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="61 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="428616" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0352-01">61 Pa. 352</a>, 358-360; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Grether, <a href="/pa/204/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="204 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="927435" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0203-01">204 Pa. 203</a>, 205, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.%20753" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="53 A. 753">53 A. 753</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

As to the search of the thus lawfully apprehended criminal, what was said in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>O’Malley, <a href="/pa-super/81/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="81 Pa.

McClinn v. Smith, </em>supra, at p. 47, approved the decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Seechrist, </em><a href="/pa-super/27/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="27 Pa.

Although represented by competent private counsel, he did not even move for a severance. But, <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>beyond that, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether a number of indictments against the same person should be tried together: <em>Commonwealth v.

And, an exercise of discretion in such regard will not be reversed unless it clearly appears that the rights of the defendant were thereby prejudiced: <em>Commonwealth v. Mulroy, </em><a href="/pa-super/154/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="154 Pa. Super. 410" data-case-ids="1053730" data-case-paths="/pa-super/154/0410-01">154 Pa.

The present relator suffered no harm from a consolidation of the indictments for trial. All of them grew out of the same circumstances and, respectively, charged the relator with robbery, burglary, felonious, assault and battery and carrying concealed weapons. The jury found him guilty on each indictment except on the one for burglary. No enlargement of the period of his restraint resulted. The learned trial judge sentenced him on the robbery indictment to not less than five nor more than ten years in the Western State Penitentiary; the sentence for the felonious assault and battery indictment, which was for a lesser term (two and a half to five years), was made to run concurrently with the sentence on the robbery indictment; and the sentence on the indictment for carrying concealed weapons was suspended in view of the sentence on the robbery indictment. Nor was the issue of the relator’s guilt influenced in the slightest degree by the fact that he was tried at the same time on the four indictments. No new or extraneous element was introduced into the case because of the multiple indictments. The same facts applied to all of them. Here, also, the relator’s complaint, even if it had merit, which it does not, relates to a matter of defense in respect whereof the trial court’s action could be raised only on appeal a,nd not by a petition for habeas corpus.</p>

      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>The relator’s remaining contention rests upon an erroneous statement of fact. He asserts that he was denied due process of law because he was made to stand trial without the jury or himself, as defendant, having heard the indictments read in open court. The notes of testimony show that the learned trial judge separately read in his charge to the jury, in the presence of the defendant, the crime laid in each of the indictments submitted and each time correctly defined the particular crime. Again, the relator’s complaint concerns a matter of defense reviewable only on appeal; the time for which long since expired.</p>
