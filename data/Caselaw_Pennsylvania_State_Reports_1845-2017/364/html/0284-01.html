Defendant then attempted, in mitigation of damages, to prove that after defendant’s breach of contract plaintiffs substituted an alloy called <em>Zenium </em>and what profits plaintiffs made thereafter. The court erroneously excluded evidence of the amount of such profit. The measure of damages for breach of contract is <em>compensation </em>for the loss sustained.
