    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.9",600,[331,484,1149,1137]]]'>Plaintiff and defendant are adjoining property OAvners. 902 South 8th Street, Philadelphia, is OAvned by plaintiff, Avhile the adjoining premises, 900 South 8th Street, are OAvned by defendant. Defendant’s premises are L-shaped, Avith the rear lot or yard abutting plaintiff’s premises. The west brick wall of plaintiff’s kitchen is built on the rear property line. The Avail has windows overlooking defendant’s lot. Plaintiff’s building, occupying the entire lot, consists of two rooms on the first floor. The front room is used as a barber shop. The rear room, Avith its windoAvs overlooking defendant’s yard, constitutes the kitchen. Defendant erected a ten foot high concrete wall, <em>entirely upon her own </em>land, three inches from the party line and defendant’s kitchen. The effect is to obstruct and block off plaintiff’s kitchen AvindoAVS and prevent the free passage of light and air into same. Plaintiff instituted the present action in equity to restrain defendant from obstructing such light and air. The learned Chancellor decreed that the height of the wall be reduced from ten feet to six feet. This appeal followed.</p>

It was decided that when a wall is on the property line, Avindows in the wall give no easement of light and air.</p>

    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[118,1277,1149,426]]]'>This Court early stated that an easement to light and air may be implied because of necessity: <em>Rennyson’s Appeal, </em>supra. However, no case has been cited, and our research has revealed none, wherein such an implied easement has been decreed. Chief Justice Lowrie, in <em>Haverstick v.

Where both dominant and servient tenements were at one time held in common ownership, it becomes necessary to ascertain the <em>time </em>of the severance of the titles. In order that the defendant’s lot should become servient to plaintiff’s, the plaintiff must have acquired the servitude <em>before the defendant bought. </em>Then and only then would the defendant take title to his lot charged with the servitude. Where, however, both lots were conveyed by the vendor at thé same <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>time, it would be impossible to imply that the vendor was making one servient to the other. In <em>Maynard v. Esher, </em><a href="/pa/17/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="17 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="967587" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0222-01">17 Pa. 222</a>, Justice Lowrie said, p. 226: “The principle assumed is, that the vendor grants an easement by implication, because the house, as it exists, demands the easement, and he has power to grant it. On the principle, therefore, the easement cannot be implied, unless, at the time of the sale, the vendor owned the adjoining-lot. Hence the importance of the time in these two <em>sales; . . </em>and p. 227: “To imply such a grant, the plaintiff’s purchase must have been prior to, and not simultaneous with the defendant’s. In order that the defendant’s lot should become servient to the plaintiff’s, the plaintiff must have acquired the servitude before the defendant bought, and then only would the defendant take his lot charged with the servitude. Where both lots are passing out of the vendor at the same instant, it is impossible to imply that he is making one servient to the other; ...”</p>

There is nothing to reveal in what manner, if at all, the vacant lot became the servient tenement.</p>

This would constitute but a <em>partial </em>obstruction of light and air. But it was testified that a skylight can be placed in the ceiling of the kitchen, which would supply an ample amount <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>of light and air.
