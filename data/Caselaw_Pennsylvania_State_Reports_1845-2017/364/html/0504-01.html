The plaintiff brought an action of trespass for libel as a result of an article published by the defendant in its newspaper during a political campaign in Lackawanna County in 1946, reporting a political meeting which occurred in Mayfield Borough, Lackawanna County, on a certain Sunday afternoon. At that meeting Captain Fraser P. Donlan, who was Republican nominee for State Senator, made an address. He appeared in uniform, as he was still an officer.

A. communication is defamatory if it tends to harm the reputation of another so as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing Avith him.” He then said: “. . . the question arises as to Avhether the printed report of McAndrew’s actions or sayings at the political meeting Avould tend to lower him in the estimation of the community in Avhich he lives, or to deter persons from associating or dealing AAÚth him.” He also said: “. . . initially it is the function of the Court to determine Avhether the communication is capable of a defamatory meaning, and if the Court finds that such a meaning is not capable of being derived from the communication, the judge Avould have to grant a nonsuit, give binding <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>instructions or judgment n. o. v. as appropriate.” Pie then said: “The trial judge decided that such a [defamatory] meaning could be derived from the publication and that it was his duty to submit the question, as to whether such a meaning actually was derived by the recipients, to the jury.” Judge Hoban then said: “The writer of this opinion, if he were one of the original recipients, would probably not have taken a defamatory meaning from it, but he can see how easily sentimental people at the time and place would have received the remarks and imputations attributed in the article to McAndrew. . . . So also with that part of the communication which attributes to McAndrew a statement that we all have to have a little Communism. Such a statement as indicating association or sympathy with a group or political organization which a substantial part of our citizens regard as a discreditable one, is capable of a defamatory meaning.”</p>

One who falsely and without a privilege to do so publishes matter defamatory to another in such a manner as to make the publication a libel is liable to the other, although no special harm or loss of reputation results therefrom. ... In other words, if the publication of defamatory matter is done in such a way as to constitute libel, it is actionable per se without either the allegation or proof of special damages, unless excused by the defense of truth or privilege, and as to these defenses the burden is clearly upon the defendant to prove.” Judge Hoban then said: “. . . the trial judge correctly considered that the occasion for the publication, to wit, the report of a political meeting of interest to the public, was 'a privileged occasion and that the publication was made from a proper motive and in <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>a proper maimer.

Statements cannot be adjudged defamatory merely because they are annoying and embarrassing to the person to whom they are attributed. We have never found in any law report a case of a libel suit being successfully maintained against any person because of the latter’s erroneous report that another person said that a candidate for public office was seeking the election on the basis of his military exploits, though such comments in a campaign are not unusual.</p>

This report might be very annoying and embarrassing to B but he would not be defamed by it. Not every lie is a libel. A might falsely report that B had said that C was seeking votes because of his race or had said that D, who happened to be a fine tenor singer, was trying to “sing his way” into public office. While such reports might be very annoying and embarrassing to B, they would not justify an action for libel against A. Many men in public life and in private life have been greatly annoyed by being misquoted. But annoyance does not constitute defamation.</p>

In overruling plaintiff’s appeal from judgment against him on a question of law, the appellate court said: “Does the article reflect upon his character in such a manner as to bring him into ridicule, hatred or contempt?” This question was answered in the negative.

Throughout all our history, many men avIio have achieved distinction in Avar, have sought the suffrages of their felloAv citizens solely because of their Avar record. At least tuvo military chieftains, Taylor and Grant, Avere named by their respective parties as candidates for president of the United States because of their war records.

Many of us can think of eases where men who have been blinded or disfigured by Avar, have been elected to office because of that fact and it Avould not be defamatory for anyone to declare that another had said, that these candidates were seeking “sympathy votes.” Nor is there any justification for the innuendo alleging that the statement attributed to McAndrew meant that McAndreAV said that Donlan Avas making an improper use of the United States flag. The phrase “using his uniform and the flag” was very much like the oft-used phrase “Avaving the flag.” It does not imply that there is any desecration of the flag.</p>

In the same opinion we quoted Comment f of the Restatement, Section 613, reading as follows: “. . . If he [the defendant] relies upon the defense that the communication was published upon a conditionally privileged occasion, he likewise has the burden of proving it. If he sustains this burden by evidence of the requisite quantity and quality, he will prevail unless the plaintiff takes up and sustains the burden of proving that the occasion was abused. The occasion may be abused because of the publisher’s lack of belief or reasonable grounds for belief in the truth of the defamatory matter; because the defamatory matter was published for some purpose other than that for which the particular privilege is given; because the publication was made to some person not reasonably believed to be necessary for the <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>accomplishment of the purpose of the particular privilege; or because the pub] ¡.cation included defamatory matter not reasonably believed to be necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the privilege is given.”</p>

Pittsburgh </em>Times, <a href="/pa/139/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="139 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="11251605" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0334-01">139 Pa. 334</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20154" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="21 A. 154">21 A. 154</a>, Justice Mitchell said: ‘The natural and logical order of proof is for defendant to show the information on which he relied for probable cause, and for the plaintiff then to meet it in rebuttal. And this is the order that seems to be indicated by Brackenridge, J., in Gray v. Pentland, 2 S. &amp; R. 23. . . .’ ” Again, at pages 265-266, the opinion in the <em>Dennison </em>case continues as follows: “The anonymous information Dennison acted on clearly did not constitute probable cause for the action he took. What Judge Orlady speaking for the Superior Court in <em>Collins v. News Co., </em><a href="/citations/?q=6%20Pa.%20Super.%20335" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="6 Pa. Super. 335">6 Pa. Superior Ct. 335</a>, 336, said is particularly applicable here: ‘It was not a privileged communication. The authorities on which the appellant relies to sustain the argument that it was such, are considered in Coates v. Wallace, <a href="/pa-super/4/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="4 Pa. Super. 253" data-case-ids="276303" data-case-paths="/pa-super/4/0253-01">4 Pa. Superior Ct. 253</a>, and cannot relieve the defendant in this case. It is not sufficient that the defendant believed the facts to be true at the time of publication; <em>the belief must have rested on reasonable cmd probable </em>cause: Winebiddle v. Porterfield, <a href="/pa/9/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="9 Pa. 137" data-case-ids="960779" data-case-paths="/pa/9/0137-01">9 Pa. 137</a>; Chapman v. Calder, <a href="/pa/14/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="14 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="405901" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0365-01">14 Pa. 365</a>; Smith v. Ege, <a href="/pa/52/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="52 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1002276" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0419-01">52 Pa. 419</a>’ (Italics supplied).”</p>

As Mr. Justice Mitchell further said in <em>Conroy v. Pittsburgh </em>Times, supra, “Actual or special malice can rarely be proved; in fact, it rarely exists. Libelous articles in newspapers seldom spring from any hostility to the individual, but usually from a ruthless disregard of personal feelings and private rights, in the mad hunt for news and sensations. The only chance of redress for <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>the plaintiff, therefore, is, ordinarily, the want of probable cause; and how is he to prove this? It was held in Flitcraft v. Jenks, <a href="/whart/3/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="3 Whart. 158" data-case-ids="1833441" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0157-01">3 Wh. 158</a>, that he could not do it by evidence of good character and the consequent improbability of his doing the act charged; and hoAV is he to prove specific facts in the dark, before the facts relied on as probable cause are shoAvn by defendant?” Then follows the presently pertinent statement already quoted in the <em>Dennison </em>case, supra. See also footnote 2, page 263, of <em>Montgomery v. Dennison, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[317,819,1153,1399]]]'>Finally, this seems to me to be an appropriate occasion to register a protest against the alloAvance of <em>allocaturs </em>in cases such as the present. The appeal from the judgment of the court beloAV Avas properly to the Superior Court. In the very first year of that court’s existence, Mr. Justice Mitchell, speaking for this court in <em>Kraemer v. Guarantee Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co., </em><a href="/pa/173/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="173 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="875932" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0416-01">173 Pa. 416</a>, 418, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.%201047" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="33 A. 1047">33 A. 1047</a>, said “The authority of the Justices of the Supreme Court to alloAv special appeals [from the Superior Court] is not limited, but it is apparent from the general scheme of the act that it is intended to be exceptional and based on considerations other than the mere desire or interest of the particular parties. The most obvious of such considerations are the bearing of the question on public interests or rights, the importance of the decision as a precedent in frequently occurring litigation, diversity of opinions in other courts and consequent desirability of a final determination, and generally the preservation of uniformity in the application of legal principles. Unless these or similar considerations suggest a revieAV by this court, the final and conclusive character of the judgments of the Superior Court ought not to be questioned or in any Avay trenched upon.” As none of the <em>specified </em>considerations was present, there was no legal justification for the <em>allocatur.</em>
