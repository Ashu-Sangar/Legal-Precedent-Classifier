The appellant-plaintiff, beginning in 1943, annually issued to defendant its policy insuring certain buildings, identified as numbers 18, 19 and 20, on defendant’s land devoted to industrial uses. The policy specified the amount of insurance on building number 20 as $100,000. In August, 1946, a fire damaged part of a building on this land; defendant contended that the building damaged was part of number 20 and claimed a loss of $66,627.45. Plaintiff rejected the claim, contending that the damaged property was not part of building number 20 but was part of buildings numbered 21 and 22.</p>

[plaintiff] ... by its policy of insurance in effect at the time the building [number 20] hereinbefore described was destroyed by fire, did insure and protect said building by its policy of insurance which was in full <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>force and effect at the time thereof.” Defendant stated, in paragraph 4 of his answer, that “defendant joins in the petitioner’s request to have this Honorable Court determine the rights under the policy of fire insurance attached to the petition as Exhibit ‘A’. It is admitted that this policy was an annual policy effective March 1, 1946. Defendant further admits and joins in the averment in the plaintiff’s petition that ‘The policy being in writing, its construction is for your Honorable Court, as a matter of law’. In fact it is the defendant’s position that this — a question of law — is the only issue before tiiis Court because the policy by its terms clearly covered and protected the building which was destroyed by fire. . . .”</p>

No one familiar with the history<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> of the amendment should be in any doubt of the meaning intended and stated by the legislature. The amendment provides, “Section 6. Discretionary. — -Relief by declaratory judgment or decree may be granted in all civil cases where an actual controversy exists between contending parties, or where the court is satisfied that antagonistic claims are present between the parties involved which indicate imminent and inevitable litigation, or where in any sucb case the court is satisfied that a party asserts a legal relation, status, right, or privilege in which he has a concrete interest and that there is a challenge or denial of such asserted relation, status, right, or privilege by an adversary party who also has or asserts a concrete interest therein, and the court is satisfied also that a declaratory judgment or decree will serve to terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding. Where, however, a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy must be followed; but the mere fact that an actual or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy, or an equitable <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>remedy, or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether snch remedy is recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment or decree in any case where the other essentials to such relief are present: . . .”</p>

The next provision to be noticed is that “the mere fact that an actual or threatened controversy is susceptible of relief through a general common law remedy, or an equitable remedy, or an extraordinary legal remedy, whether such remedy is recognized or regulated by statute or not, shall not debar a party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment or decree in any case where the other essentials to such relief <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>are present.” It should be apparent from these provisions in the amendment, that the court in banc erred in setting aside the proceeding on the ground that “the parties have an adequate remedy in the action of assumpsit. ...”</p>
