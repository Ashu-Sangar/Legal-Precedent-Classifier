Passing by a preliminary procedural <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>skirmish and an intervening motion for judgment on the pleadings (refused without prejudice with leave to the defendant to answer over), we come at once to the lower court’s entry of judgment for the school district on the plaintiff’s subsequent like motion.</p>

In addition thereto, the facts averred by the complaint as to the amount of the taxes so assessed, the defendant’s failure to pay the same and the amount of such taxes remaining unpaid were not categorically denied.

L. 1368 (72 PS §5860.312, Pkt.

Under Sec. 102 of the Act of 1947, supra (72 PS §5860.102 Pkt. Part), that Act did not become operative in Schuylkill County until February 1, 1948, when it did become effective there through the failure of the County Commissioners by that date to elect, by formal resolution, not to accept the Act. The instant action was instituted on February 3, 1948, just two days after Sec. 312 had thus become effective in Schuylkill County, — obviously not an unreasonable delay. Construed otherwise, the Act would have had the effect of arbitrarily cutting off without remedy the school district’s tax claims which, for the first three years in question, were already more than six years old when the Act became operative in Schuylkill County on February 1, 1948. Such a construction would work a deprivation of the plaintiff’s property without due process of law in violation of both the Federal and State Constitutions, — an interpretation which a familiar and fundamental rule of statutory construction would forbid (Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Sec. 52(3), 46 PS §552(3)) even if the language legislatively employed were reasonably susceptible of any such meaning.</p>

However, that right <em>is </em>conferred upon the plaintiff school <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>district by the School Code of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, Sec. 503, 24 PS §384, and by the Local Tax Collection Law of May 25, 1945, P. L. 1050, Sec. 21(b), 72 PS §5511.21 (b), Pkt. Part. The appellant apparently con-i'uses an action <em>in rem </em>to preserve a tax lien (e.g., under the Municipal Lien Act of May 16, 1923, P. L. 207, 53 PS.§2021 et seq.) and an action <em>in personam </em>under the School Code of 1911, supra, and the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945, supra, to enforce the taxable’s personal liability for delinquent taxes. The powers of the Tax Claim Bureau under the Act of 1947 are limited to the enforcement of the lien of the taxes (levied against lands) by sequestration or sale thereof. As the learned judge of the court below aptly observed, — “If the personal liability of the taxable may still be enforced by action in assumpsit, where the taxes have been returned under the Act of 1947, <em>only the taxing district </em>has statutory authority to bring the action” (Emphasis supplied). With that conclusion, we fully agree. Nor are we able to see wherein such statutory authority has been minimized or impaired in any way by the Act of 1947.</p>
    <p id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[130,1412,1151,813]],["BL_640.1",640,[339,270,1148,534]]]'>The appellant insists, however, that, inasmuch as Sec. 312 of the Act of 1947 allows for a suit in assumpsit by the taxing district for the recovery of unpaid taxes where the lien thereof <em>has been lost </em>through failure to return or transfer- such taxes timely to the Tax Claim Bureau, there is no such right of action in the taxing district for the recovery of unpaid taxes which <em>were </em>returned or transferred as required by the Act. That contention is a patent <em>non sequitur. </em>The provision in Sec. 312 concerning a suit in assumpsit by the taxing district to recover taxes due and owing where the lien thereof was lost by failure to return or transfer them as required by the Act was inserted in order to. insure that, even though the lien of such taxes was gone, the taxing district’s right to sue therefor in assumpsit still <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>remained unimpaired except as the six-year period of limitation is imposed by Sec. 312 on an action in such circumstances. In reality, the provision confirms the continued right of the taxing district to sue the taxable in assumpsit for unpaid taxes. Sec. 312 does not purport to confer such a right. It merely recognizes that a taxing district <em>may nevertheless proceed, </em>under its power otherwise existing, to recover the amount of such taxes by an action in assumpsit even though the lien of the taxes no longer endures.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[327,817,1158,1292]]]'>The appellant’s contention that the Act of 1947 impliedly repealed Sec. 21(b) of the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945, supra, is untenable. Admittedly, there was no express repeal of the 1945 Act. But, the appellant argues that, as the Act of 1947 is a local option law in that it became operative only in those counties of the specified classes which failed to reject it, the Act of 1945, supra, which is applicable to all counties in general, could not be repealed specifically without depriving, of its benefits, those counties which rejected the Act of 1947. Consequently, the appellant asserts that the only effective way to deal with the Act of 1945 was by a general repealer in the Act of 1947 of any acts or parts of acts inconsistent therewith. Wherefore, the appellant contends that an inconsistency exists between Sec. 312 of the Act of 1947 and Sec. 21(b) of the Act of 1945. However, no such inconsistency is apparent when Sec. 312 is given its proper intent and construction. Moreover, to say that the general Act of 1945, supra, which contains no local option provision, can be nullified as to certain counties of the State by their local exercise of an option conferred by an entirely different •statute would be to carry repeal by implication to an unheard-of extent.</p>

We predicate nothing on the fact that the petition to open was filed after the term at which the judgment was entered even though it is at least questionable whether the stay granted on the rule for re-argument operated to relieve the defendant of the duty to act timely if it wished to move to reopen. In the situation here present, it is unnecessary to go into that.</p>
    <p id="b641-3" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[123,924,1152,1351]]]'>The petition to open the judgment is devoid of any merit. The defendant recites the fact that on <em>March 21, 1949, </em>this court handed down its decision in <em>Frailey Township School District v. Schuylkill Mining Company, </em>supra, holding that no personal liability can be asserted for real estate taxes assessed after the property had been sold for nonpayment of taxes, and then assigns as its reasons for opening the judgment that, although such a factual situation existed with respect to <em>some </em>of the causes of action in suit (without specifying any), that fact was not set forth in the defendant’s amended answer for the reason that, when that pleading was prepared, the defendant did not have the benefit of the decision in the <em>Frailey Township </em>case, supra; and that the failure of the parties to consider the doctrine enunciated in that case “. . . constituted a mutual mistake of law.” In short, the defendant relies on its alleged ignorance of the law in failing to aver material facts in its amended answer. Such an excuse is manifestly unavailing.

In the opinion for the court below in the instant case, filed on <em>January 3, 1949, </em>upon refusing the plaintiff’s first motion for judgment on the pleadings, it was specifically pointed out that “. . . there are underlying questions in this case which are, or may be, involved in an appeal now pending in the Supreme Court . . . in the case of Frailey Township School District v. Schuylkill Mining Company.” That opinion then went on to caution that <em>“. . . </em>this case should not be decided until the Supreme Court hands down its opinion in the Frailey 'Township School District case.” And, that is exactly what happened. The case was not decided until the entry of the judgment on <em>June 20, 1949, </em>— three months after this court’s decision in the <em>Frailey Township </em>case. Yet, three weeks after the lower court’s timely notice and caution to counsel as to the possible pertinency of the <em>Frailey Township </em>case, viz., on <em>January 24, 1949, </em>the defendant filed its amended answer without the slightest suggestion therein that it was not the owner of' the seated lands in question at the time of any or all pf the tax assessments involved.</p>

Nor was there any impelling conseionable ground for the court’s so doing. As the pleadings stood, the appellant was the owner of the various properties at the time of the assessments of the taxes in suit. The complaint averred that the defendant became the owner thereof on December 20,1938, and there is not a single word to suggest a change of that status at any material time thereafter. Even now, the appellant concedes that it was the owner of the property down to June 6, 1944. What changed the defendant’s status as owner, the pleadings do not reveal; nor are the depositions, taken on the rules issued subsequent to the entry of the adversary judgment, competent to vary the pleadings which the judgment rendered conclusive. As the learned court below pointed out in its opinion upon discharging the rule to show cause why the judgment should not be opened, — “. . . neither plaintiff’s complaint nor the amended answer thereto, to which [the defendant’s petition to open] refers, contained any allegation or intimation that the lands involved had been sold for nonpayment of taxes prior to the assessment and levy of any of the taxes sued for in this action.” And, of course, the legal presumption is that the established status of the defendant’s ownership continued in the absence of any averment or proof to the contrary: <em>Hartman v.
