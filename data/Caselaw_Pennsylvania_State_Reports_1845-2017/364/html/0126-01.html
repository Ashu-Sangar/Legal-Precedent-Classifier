The mass that fell contained lumps of snow and ice three or four inches wide and four or five inches long, and was described as having “a <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>dark color”, as “blackish”, “sort of blackish”, and “dirty”. A witness, without objection, said, “it wasn’t fresh; it had been colored with soot”, and another witness testified, “It was just like snow and ice that has accumulated at some place and later thaw[ed] out and where a smoke had colored it.” The building has a frontage of 100 feet on Main Street and is over 40 feet high, with a mansard type roof, constructed on a grade of about 60 degrees and measuring twelve feet, eight inches from ledge to ridge pole. The ledge is thirteen inches in width and contains a gutter six inches wide and eight inches deep.

Clearly there was no actual notice of any negligent condition existing upon the roof . . . Taking into consideration that there is no evidence of any previous falling of snoAV and ice from the roof; that the heavy snowfall had been reduced to one-fourth of its original size; and that a proper and standard constructed gutter and coping existed immediately adjacent <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>to the street; we do not believe that under such circumstances the [appellee] could be visited with any constructive notice of a negligent condition existing upon the roof.

The evidence does not support the contention that it was a mass of ice and snow permitted by appellee to collect in the gutter or on the ledge of the building which fell and injured appellant. On the contrary, her own evidence establishes that it was a part of the normal accumulation on the roof itself that fell, covering an area of about two square feet. Any hazard created by the extraordinary snowfall on December 24 had been eliminated by melting. The depth of the snow had been reduced to three inches and there was an additional inch of snowfall on December 27, making a total of only four inches of snow on the roof on December 29, the date of the accident. The building was of a common and approved type of construction and was in good repair. It was equipped with metal snow-guards or ice-breakers, spaced eighteen inches apart, and with a thirteen-inch wide ledge at the lower edge of the roof containing a box-type gutter six inches wide and eight inches deep, as precautions against falling ice and snow. There is no testimony that snow or ice had fallen from this roof on any prior occasion and no evidence that the accumulation on the roof was of an <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>unusual nature, differing in any way from that existing on other roofs throughout the community in general, or that the prevailing weather conditions were abnormal, considering the season of the year, to indicate a necessity for additional precautions on this particular occasion.</p>

No Pennsylvania case has been cited, however, to support such a proposition. Our law imposes no absolute duty on an owner or occupier of property to keep his premises free from ice and snow at all times: <em>Whitton v. H. A.

This is inherent in the nature of eaves and gutters, just as it is in roofs without them, and their maintenance could not ordinarily be held negligent.” To charge the owner or occupier with culpability in such a case it must not only appear that the condition existed for so long a time as to visit him with knowledge of it, but must also appear that the danger was sufficiently obvious that he should have realized that someone might be injured because of it: Restatement, Torts, section 364. Clearly the mere fact that snow or ice fell from the roof is not of itself sufficient proof of negligence. It was incumbent on appellant to show some unusual condition existing before the accident that would lead appellee, through its employees, in the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care, to believe that additional precautions were required.

Is it the duty of a possessor of a building in a latitude in which such heavy snows are experienced, to immediately clean the roof after every snow-fall? If snow falling from roofs frequently causes serious injury to persons nearby, the answer must be “yes”. If it is unusual for snow falling from roofs to injure anybody, the answer must be “no”. Individuals are not required to alter conditions which in the normal course of events injure nobody. If, for example, a man has in his yard, near the sidewalk, a large tree which is obviously in such a decayed condition that its fall is likely, it is his duty to remove that menace without delay. On the other hand, if he has a large sound tree whose limbs extend over the sidewalk, he does not have to remove these limbs lest by some rare chance they become detached and fall on some passer-by.

To clear all the roofs in any municipality from snow in a normal winter would require the help for weeks of an army of laborers and it would be difficult to secure them.

The effect of not applying the rule will appear in comparing an extract from the opinion with the evidence. The opinion states, “The evidence does not support the contention that it was a mass of ice and snow permitted by appellee to collect in the gutter or on the ledge of the building which fell and injured appellant. On the contrary, her own evidence establishes that it was a part of the normal accumulation on the roof itself that fell, covering an area of about two square feet. Any hazard created by the extraordinary snowfall on December 24 had been eliminated by melting. The depth of the snow had been reduced to three inches and there was an additional inch of snowfall on December 27, making a total of only four inches of snow on the roof on December 29, the date of the accident.” Comparing that with the evidence, and beginning with the statement that “the evidence does not support the contention that it was a mass of ice and snow permitted by appellee to collect in the gutter or on the ledge ...” I call attention to testimony which should make it impossible for this Court to reach that conclusion. It is agreed that a mass of snow and ice fell on plaintiff during a thawing temperature ranging from 36 to 42 degrees the afternoon of December 29; the opinion describes it as “perhaps a bushel in quantity.” It is not disputed that it fell from the ledge where the appellee had permitted it to accumulate; though it could easily have been cleared off before as it was cleared after the accident, as defendant’s witnesses testified. Some idea of the accumulation and the location from which it came, may be derived from the fact that what fell on the plaintiff exposed a space on the slope of the mansard roof of “about two square feet,” as described by witnesses who saw it while standing on the sidewalk below. Defendant’s witnesses testified that, after the accident, <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>inspection revealed an accumulation of 3 to 4 inches of snow on the lower part of the roof near the edge (N. T. 80, 81, 102). Therefore, since there was only-one inch of snowfall between December 24th and December 29th, much of the snow must have been on the ledge four or five days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> I must also disagree with part of the next statement in the opinion, that “Any hazard created by the extraordinary snowfall of December 24 had been eliminated by melting. The depth of the snow had been reduced to three inches and there was an additional inch of snowfall on December 27, making a total of only four inches of snow on the roof on December 29, the date of the accident.” This Court cannot, with due regard to the rule, properly make such a finding of fact. Whether melting had eliminated the hazard would ordinarily be for the jury if nothing else were involved, but here there is additional evidence on the subject for the jury’s consideration. The jury could find from the evidence (and such a finding is implied in the verdict) that the foreseeable danger continued and was increased by the alternate freezing and thawing of the accumulation of snow and ice on the ledge and in the gutter and alongside the slope of the mansard roof on which the patch two feet square was exposed by the mass which fell on plaintiff. Indeed it was the melting over a period of days which changed otherwise harmless snow into a mass containing chunks of ice as large as an apple and icicles 3 to 4 inches in width and 4 or 5 inches long (N. T. 14, 28). Even after part fell on plaintiff, there still remained a dangerous accumulation of it on the ledge which defendant promptly removed. Mr. Holliday, <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>defendant’s assistant manager, testified that the building is in “the most active business portion of the city,” which is also a fact of importance in considering the measure of care required of defendant to persons using the sidewalk in front of the building.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Mr. Holliday also testified: “There was snow on the roof; there was snow on the sloping roof up there. There was a patch there that had broken loose and come down. I would say a patch possibly two feet square. ... It was between the two dormers on the left hand side of the building as you start in.” Referring to the precise location of the patch, in order to describe the place on the mansard slope from which the mass fell, he said it was “right up from the edge of the slate. It started up the roof a little ways but it started in front.” Mr. Patterson, an eye witness and disinterested bystander, testified, “I don’t think a bushel basket would have held what was in this bunch of snow and ice”; he saw the “chunks of ice.” There were corroborative eye witnesses. Reading the evidence which supports the verdict, this court should reject the inferences made in the majority opinion; they should be rejected because they are opposed to the facts which the jury had the right to find and doubtless did find as the basis of its verdict.</p>

The decision creates an undesirable exception to the general rules of liability of the possessor of land. The rules are stated in sections 364 and 368 of the Restatement, Torts: Section 364 states, “A possessor of land is subject to liability for bodily harm caused to others outside the land by a structure or other artificial condition thereon, which the possessor realizes or should realize as involving an unreasonable risk of such harm, if (a) the possessor has created the condition, . . .” Section 368 states, “A possessor of land who creates or maintains thereon an excavation or other artificial condition so near an existing highway that he realizes or should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk to others accidentally brought into contact therewith while traveling with reasonable care upon the highway, is subject to liability for bodily harm thereby caused to them.” Comment a states, “a. Danger due to natural causes. In order that the rule stated in this Section shall apply, the condition must not only be one which <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>a reasonable man would recognize as involving an unreasonable risk to properly conducted traffic upon an adjacent highway, but also it must have been created by the possessor or his predecessor in possession or by someone acting on their behalf or by their permission after the highway has been dedicated. If the condition is so created, it is not necessary that it involves unreasonable risk when created. It is enough to subject the possessor to liability that he knows or should know that it has become unreasonably dangerous.” Defendant should be held responsible for the artificial condition on the land resulting from the construction of the projecting ledge of the mansard roof in such manner as in the winter season to catch and accumulate snow and ice which, if not removed, may fall upon users of the sidewalk. It is no defense to say that the roof is constructed in the usual way; it is foreseeable that an artificial condition, though normally harmless, may in winter time become dangerous to sidewalk users. It therefore becomes the duty of the occupier to exercise reasonable care to avoid harm to them, and where, as here, the structure is “in the most active business portion of the city,” the measure of care is correspondingly greater than it would be in some remote or less frequented place.</p>

    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[124,556,1148,759]]]'>If we apply the rule that the evidence must be read in the sense most favorably supporting the verdict, the evidence leaves no doubt that the heavy snowfall took place five days before the injury; what should have been foreseen was that, in the intervening five days of alternately thawing and freezing weather, the accumulation of snow and ice on the ledge, plainly visible from the sidewalk, might slip down and do harm.

The majority opinion refers to the rule of absolute liability. The verdict of the jury was not based on any theory of absolute liability, but on a simple allegation of negligence amply supported by the evidence.</p>
