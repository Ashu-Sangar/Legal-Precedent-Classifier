His residuary estate was left in trust to pay one-third of the net income to his mother for life and two-thirds to his wife for life; upon the death of both of them the principal was to go in equal shares to those of his brothers and sisters who survived him.</p>

Pratt and Morris A. Bitting. In 1937 it was converted into a partnership of the same three persons; this partnership was reorganized in 1939, and in 1943 Bitting’s interest was purchased by Gerlach who continued the partnership thereafter with Pratt. Gerlach executed his will on August 1,1945. On November 16, 1946 the business was again changed to a corporation under the name of Allentown Supply Corporation, 15,000 shares of which, valued at $120,000, <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>were held by Gerlach, and 33 shares at $264, by Pratt; the stock certificates, however, were never actually issued. Gerlach died on May 1, 1947. His widow filed an election to take against the will.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[356,501,1149,1536]]]'>The present appeal is by the testator’s mother who claims that because the bequest to the appellees was of the testator’s interest in the “business, known as the Allentown Supply Company”, and because that business was subsequently and before his death incorporated under the name of “Allentown Supply Corporation”, the bequest was adeemed and nothing passed thereunder to the named legatees. As the court below properly held, however, the change from partnership to corporation was one of form rather than of substance, as <em>had </em>likewise been the change from corporation to partnership in 1937. Whether as a partnership or as a corporation it was always Gerlach’s business; the interest originally of Bitting and Pratt, and subsequently of Pratt alone, was practically negligible; there was never any change in the identity of the enterprise, which, to Gerlach, was always <em>“my </em>business”. The mere fact that his capital investment increased considerably between the time he executed his will and the time of the formation of the corporation is of no legal significance in the determination of the question of ademption, and the same is true of the fact that a few days before his death he offered to sell stock in the corporation to his employes; this might have meant merely that he wanted them to have an interest in the business thenceforth and not only after his death, there being nothing in the record to indicate that he had- any presentiment at that time of his approaching end.</p>

It was held that an ademption had resulted, but the test to be applied was stated by Mr. Justice Linn (p. 52) as follows: .“The question now is: Does the thing given exist? — are the shares in the third and fourth corporations <em>substantially the same thing as the Fuel Corporation stock, though in different forms and with different names? </em>— or <em>is the property claimed a different thing?” </em>Prom the opinion of <em>Cozens-Haedy, </em>M.

If you cannot find it at the testator’s death, it is no use trying to trace it <em>unless you can trace it in this sense, that you find something which has been changed in name and form only, but which is substantially the same thing.” </em>The change in the subject of the bequest in the present case was obviously not like the one where <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>real estate devised in a will was sold by the testator and what he owned at his death was a purchase money mortgage on the property <em>(Gibson’s Estate, </em><a href="/citations/?q=22%20Pa.%20D.%20482" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="22 Pa.

It is obvious that in all those cases the property bequeathed or devised was either wholly extinguished or changed into property of a distinctly different nature. On the other hand, where a testator bequeathed a certain number of shares which he then held in a trust company, and the company doubled the par value of its stock whereby he received in exchange one-half the number of shares previously held by him but of the new par value, no ademption was thereby effected <em>(Appeal of The Fidelity Insurance Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company, </em><a href="/pa/108/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="108 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="539282" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0492-01">108 Pa. 492</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20A.%20233" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 A. 233">1 A. 233</a>).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> In <em>Maynard v.

Subsequently Gerlach acquired in his own name the title to this building and to two adjoining lots. Appellant contends that this real estate became testator’s individual property and was not an asset of the business. Of the amounts paid for these properties part was paid directly out of the funds of the Allentown Supply Company and part out of the testator’s personal funds; as to the latter payments, however, he was credited in the capital account of the partnership with the amounts which he thus contributed. The evidence seems clear that he intended that these properties should belong to the business; the entries on the company’s books, obviously made with his approval, indicated that they did so belong; in written statements given to one of the creditors of the business he included this real estate in his enumeration of the partnership assets and excluded it from a statement which he made as to his personal resources; confirmation appears also in an income tax return filed by the partnership and in the fact that the taxes and insurance premiums on the properties were paid by the partnership and subsequently by the corporation, and that no rent was ever paid to the testator; it is to be noted also that the properties were specifically included in the partnership assets which the corporation was to receive in exchange for the issuance of its stock. Since the real estate was originally acquired with partnership funds, or — which is equivalent — by the crediting of the testator’s capital <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>account with the moneys he laid out, it thereby became partnership property: Act of March 26, 1915, P.

Moreover, appellees’ principal witness, Mr. Pratt, having been examined merely as to then existing facts was thereupon cross-examined by counsel for appellant and interrogated as to transactions that occurred during testator’s lifetime; this made him a competent witness as to all relevant matters: <em>Clad’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/214/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="214 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="946109" data-case-paths="/pa/214/0141-01">214 Pa. 141</a>, 144, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.%20542" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="63 A. 542">63 A. 542</a>, 543; <em>Mack’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/278/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="278 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="1080531" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0426-01">278 Pa. 426</a>, 431, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20462" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="123 A. 462">123 A. </a><a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a><a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20462" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="123 A. 462">462</a>, 464. Finally, it may be pointed out that the testimony objected to by appellant added little if anything to the facts otherwise established in the record, and the factual and legal conclusions of the court below would be amply justified even if no consideration had been given to such testimony.</p>
    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[341,613,1148,376]]]'>Appellant asserts that there is an obligation on the part of the corporation to pay the estate for large amounts which she claims it owed to the testator. But any such obligation does not extend to sums which were contributed by him as capital; a distinction is clearly drawn on the books between the testator’s capital account and the amount payable to him as a creditor.</p>
