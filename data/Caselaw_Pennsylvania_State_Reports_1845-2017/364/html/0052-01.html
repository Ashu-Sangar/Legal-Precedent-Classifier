    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.8",96,[336,399,1149,264]]]'>The issue here involved may appear superficially to be one merely of procedure but in reality the question is whether an insurance company must account for the performance of its obligations under a policy of fire insurance to anyone other than the named insured.</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.9",96,[335,677,1150,715]]]'>Plaintiffs in September, 1944 leased a tract of land owned by them to one Mary E. 'Kaehler for a term of one year, which was later extended for a term of two additional years. The land contained an aeroplane hangar and was laid out as an airport. The lease provided that if the lessee built additional hangars on the premises they should remain her property and be removable by her on the termination of the lease. The lessee agreed to “keep the buildings now erected or to be erected upon said premises insured against loss by fire, at her own cost and expense”, and also to “keep all runways and hangars in good condition and proper repair at her own proper cost and expense.”</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.10",96,[333,1406,1152,823]],["BL_97.1",97,[120,267,1150,213]]]'>Some time after the execution of this lease the lessee took one Louis A. Raub as a partner in the operation of the airport. In November,- 1946 they — the partners— obtained from the Hanover Fire Insurance Company a policy which provided that the company, for the term of three years, “to an amount not exceeding Fifteen Thousand Dollars, does insure Louis A. Raub and Mary Eileen Kaehler ... to the extent of the actual cash value of the property at the time of loss, . . . .” The properly insured was described as including the one story building known as Hangar No. 1 (which was the hangar on the premises when the lease was executed), the personal property contained therein, the one story building known as Hangar No. 2, and the one story building known as Hangar No. 3. The personal property <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>in Hangar No. 1 belonged to Kaebler and Raub, and Hangars Nos. 2 and 3, which had been erected by them after the execution of the lease, also belonged to them. Kaehler and Raub paid all the premiums on the policy.</p>
    <p id="b97-4" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[117,492,1154,940]]]'>A fire occurred in March, 1947 which resulted in a total loss of Hangar No. 1 and other property on the leased premises. Kaehler and Raub settled with the Insurance Company for the loss occasioned by the fire but in an amount which did not include the value of Hangar No. 1. They refused to file a proof of loss in regard to that hangar and they refused also to institute any action against the Insurance Company for the loss sustained by its destruction. Thereupon plaintiffs themselves filed a proof of loss and brought the present action against the Insurance Company to recover for that loss, averring in their complaint all the facts above stated. Defendant demurred on the ground that the complaint did not show any right of action against it on the part of plaintiffs. The court below below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint, from which order plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.6",97,[120,1445,1151,653]]]'>The sole question is whether plaintiffs can recover on a fire insurance policy in which they are not named as a party and in which they are not referred to in any manner whatsoever. That the policy was entered into by Kaehler and Raub as plaintiffs’ <em>agents </em>— which would give plaintiffs the status of undisclosed principals — -is not supported by the facts of the transaction, and indeed plaintiffs make no such claim. Apparently the only ground upon which they assert a right of action is their contention that the insurance, was taken out for their benefit in pursuance of the provision to that effect in the lease.</p>

The first is that their contention that the insurance was carried primarily for their benefit is unwarranted. The <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>lease provided that the lessee was to keep the hangars in good condition and repair at her own cost and expense ; she thereby obligated herself to restore plaintiffs’ hangar at the time of the termination of the lease even though it were meanwhile destroyed by fire or other accident: <em>Hoy v.

To be a third party beneficiary entitled to recover on a contract it is not enough that it be intended by <em>one </em>of the parties to the contract and the <em>third person </em>that the latter should be a beneficiary, but <em>both parties to the contract </em>must so intend and must indicate <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>that intention in the contract; in other words, a promisor cannot be held liable to an alleged beneficiary of a contract unless the latter was within his contemplation at the time the contract was entered into and such liability was intentionally assumed by him in his undertaking; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> the obligation to the third party must be created, and must affirmatively appear, in the contract itself: <em>Klinger v.

The fact, therefore, that plaintiffs would be incidentally benefited would not give them a right to recover on the' policy by virtue of any arrangement between them and Kaeliler where the Insurance Company assumed no obligation to them in the policy but believed itself to be insuring only the interest of the persons named therein.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[140,1198,1150,718]],["BL_100.1",100,[329,292,1149,709]]]'>Plaintiffs suggest that they are entitled to bring suit on the policy because of Pa. R. C. P. 2002, which provides that all actions shall be prosecuted by and in the name of the real party in interest. This, however, overlooks the fact that Rule 2002 is merely procedural in scope and does not work any change in the substantive law; it does not go into operation until after it has been determined that a given person <em>is </em>the real party in interest: Goodrich-Amram, §2002(a)-2; §2002(a)-14. Prom what has heretofore been said it is clear that plaintiffs are <em>not </em>the real party in interest, for the real party in interest in any given contract or chose in action is the person who can discharge the duties created and <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>control an action brought to enforce rights, — not necessarily the person who may be ultimately entitled to the benefit of any recovery obtained nor the person beneficially interested therein: Goodrich-Amram, §2002(a)-3; <em>Kusmaul v.

To be the real party in interest one must not merely have <em>an interest in the result of the action </em>but must be <em>in such command of the action </em>as to be legally entitled to give a complete acquittance or discharge to the other party upon performance. It is obvious that plaintiffs did not have the right to discharge defendant’s obligations under this policy; only a release by the named insured could effect such a discharge.</p>

The real question is whether plaintiffs have a <em>substantive </em>cause of action against defendant. If it were to be held that such a cause of action existed the Insurance Company would be deprived thereby of two fundamental rights. One such right is its privilege to choose the person to whom it is willing to issue an insurance policy. “The safety of the insurer is dependent much upon the character of the assured, not alone upon his integrity and good faith, but upon his habits of carefulness, of prudence, and vigilance. It is obvious that the danger of fire may be much less when the assured is a man watchful and provident than where he is heedless and negligent, as well as dishonest”: <em>State Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Roberts, </em><a href="/pa/31/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="31 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="985006" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0438-01">31 Pa. 438</a>, 440. ‘A man who contracts with one person may well refuse to permit another to become a party to the agreement.

No man has any cause of action against another unless that other is obligated to him. An obligation must be imposed either by law or by contract. The law imposes no obligation on anyone to insure another in the absence of an agreement to do so. The question is: Did the Hanover Fire Insurance Company obligate itself by an insurance contract with the plaintiffs? If such a relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendant it must have had its origin in an insurance contract. The policy <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>of insurance which is pleaded says nothing about defendant being obligated to plaintiffs in any way. The complaint avers that “M. E. Kaehler and Louis A. Raub [lessees] agreed that they would keep the buildings belonging to the plaintiffs herein on the premises described in Paragraph 3 above insured against loss by fire, . . .” and that “The said M. E. Kaehler and Louis A. Raub carried a policy of fire insurance with the defendant on the hangar and offices located on the land of the plaintiffs herein.” It was averred (Par. 12) that “The insurance carried with the defendant herein was carried for the benefit of . . . the plaintiffs herein.” This is stating a mere conclusion of law and no facts are pleaded in support of it. Nothing is pleaded which shows any legal relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant. Even <em>if </em>when Kaehler and Raub executed the insurance policy with the defendant they regarded themselves as agents of Spires and his wife, but that fact had not been disclosed to the insurance company, the company would not be obligated to those undisclosed principals. If A and X entered into an agreement to marry and later A informed X that in entering into the contract he, A, was merely acting for B, a theretofore undisclosed principal, X would certainly be under no obligation to marry B.</p>

Every insurance company has freedom of choice as to the persons to whom it will be obligated. If, for example, A wished to borrow $10,000 from X and X said, “I will loan you the money provided you take out a policy of life insurance,” and A did so, making his estate- the beneficiary, and then died, X the creditor would have no right of action against the insurance company. He would have a right of- action only against A’s estate, of which the insurance proceeds constituted a part.

The insurance carried with the defendant herein on Hangar No. One and the offices therein was carried by the said M. E. Kaehler and Louis A. Raub for the benefit of the land owner, H. J. 0. Spires and Alta Spires, his wife, the plaintiffs herein.” The allegation is that the tenants were under á contractual duty to insure for the lessor’s benefit; and that they did insure the premises.

The pleaded facts therefore support the conclusion that the insurance was for the account of plaintiffs as fully as if the policy had said, “for the account of whom it may concern.” On proof of the facts averred, the jury would be justified in finding that, in obtaining this insurance on the Hangar, the tenants acted as agents for their lessors as undisclosed principals.
