On June 8, 1939, appellant adopted a resolution appropriating plaintiff’s land “for the purpose of erecting and constructing [a] dam, lay pipe lines, and constructing and erecting other buildings for the operation of a water system . . .” and filed a condemnation bond which was approved by the court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The area taken contained 40 acres and 42 perches, part of plaintiff’s larger tract of 47 acres.

The Authority excepted on the ground that the viewers “did not file a report within three months of December 5, 1945, as required by Section 2828 of The Third Class City Law of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932 [53 PS 12198-2828].”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court sustained the exception and set aside the report on November 8,1946.</p>

This jury reported on December 16, 1947, and awarded $26,500. Both parties appealed from this award. After issue framed, the case was tried in October, 1948, resulting in a verdict of $42,500 in favor of plaintiffs. The Authority now appeals from judgment on the verdict and contends that (1) the statute of limitations prevents recovery; (2) there was error in rulings during the examination of expert witnesses. No objection is made to the charge of the court except to the refusal to charge as requested in appellant’s 25th point for charge, a matter not now requiring discussion.</p>
    <p id="b452-7" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[337,1484,1148,484]]]'>1. The defense of the statute of limitations is based on failure of the first viewers to report in the term of court during which they were ordered to report or the omission to obtain an order extending the time for the report. When that report was set aside, six years had elapsed since the Authority entered on the land; because of the expiration of that period, appellant now contends that the petition for the viewers appointed on April 15, 1947, was filed too late.</p>

The plaintiffs had appealed to the common pleas from the report of the viewers and to this Court from the order sustaining the exceptions. The appeal to this Court was premature and failed because the order was interlocutory. When the record was returned from this Court to the court below, plaintiffs filed the petition for viewers who made the second report.</p>

Appellant contends that it was harmfully prejudiced by the court’s refusal to strike out the evidence of three expert witnesses called by the plaintiffs, William L. Lance, Frank R. Diehl and Robert Getz. The court justified its action by noting that the motions to strike out did not distinguish the evidence said to be objectionable from the evidence which was clearly admissible. This was of course an adequate reason for refusing to grant appellant’s motion: <em>Miller v.

We think this evidence should have been' excluded but, in the circumstances, we do not now regard the error as reversible. The question, as we have said, arose during the preliminary examination for qualification. Whether in such examination a witness has shown himself apparently qualified to testify, is, in the first instance, a question for the discretion of the trial judge. In <em>Stevenson v.

The objection made at the time, and which was overruled, was as follows: “We object to the competency of the witness to form an opinion as to this property unless it is based entirely on the selling prices or asking prices of similar land in the vicinity of the property in question.” That objection was properly overruled because it ignored familiar elements proper for consideration apart from “the selling prices or asking prices of similar land in the vicinity. . . .”</p>

While he had neither bought nor sold any land in the county, he had informed himself of values by inquiry of individuals and of areas that had been sold, by examination of records. He testified that he made an examination of the watershed in the vicinity of the Wild Creek<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> area (which included plaintiffs’ farm) containing about 22.4 square miles.

He testified that he was familiar with the general selling prices of land in Towamensing Township (where plaintiffs’ land was situated); that he knew plaintiffs’ property and the improvements on it; that he was familiar with the water situation in that watershed. He stated that in his opinion the market value of the property before the appropriation was $45,000 and afterward $3,000. In considering his evidence we note the court’s reference to this witness in the opinion refusing the new trial. In part, the court said, “While the Defendant seeks a new trial on the refusal of the Court to strike out the testimony of Robert Getz, the Court is of the opinion that Mr. Getz was one of the best qualified witnesses presented in this case to testify as to values. Mr. Getz is a farmer residing in the vicinity of the Plaintiff’s property. He is a substantial citizen of the highest integrity and standing in this County whose reputation for veracity and sound judgment is widely known throughout the County, and is a person whom prospective purchasers would probably consult concerning values of premises in Lower Towamensing Township. He was aware of the adaptability of the premises for recreational purposes, farming purposes, poultry raising, turkey raising, the development of water power and for the raising of asparagus.” It would of course have been error to grant appellant’s motion to strike out the evidence of this witness.</p>

While the verdict seems high if considered only with the evidence of the experts produced by the defendant, it does not seem so clearly excessive when the evidence given by defendant’s witnesses and their qualifications are considered alongside the evidence and qualifications of plaintiff’s witnesses, who exhibited more comprehensive knowledge of the property and its relations to the surrounding properties in the watershed.
