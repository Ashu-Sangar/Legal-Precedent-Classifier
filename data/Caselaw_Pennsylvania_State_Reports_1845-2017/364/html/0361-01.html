L. 15, as amended, to restrain the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board from enforcing a regulation, known as Bulletin A-62, issued March 31, 1917, pursuant to Section 602 (11) of the Act (17 PS 711-602 (11) ), requiring liquor licensees to obtain an amusement permit as a prerequisite to the use of television devices in licensed establishments.</p>

Following that decision, the present plaintiffs filed their bill in equity attacking the regulation on constitutional grounds. Defendants, members of the Liquor Control Board, filed an answer raising preliminary objections, which were sustained after argument, and the bill dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b404-7" data-blocks='[["BL_404.10",404,[330,1968,1148,317]],["BL_405.1",405,[148,283,1153,1200]]]'>In their bill, plaintiffs averred, inter alia, that the Board has no power or authority to supervise television broadcasts; that the cost of issuance of an amusement permit and any inspection and supervision as respects plaintiffs, or any other licensee in the Commonwealth, will not exceed a purely nominal sum; and that pay<a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>ment of the required annual amusement fee for television reception by licensees throughout the Commonwealth would yield annually a sum in excess of that expended by the Board for all licensing purposes and ,for enforcement of all liquor' laws, both as respects the Board’s licensees and the general public. Accepting these averments as true, as the procedural situation requires, appellants contend that Section 602 (14) of the Act, to the extent that it requires them to pay an annual amusement permit fee in excess of the actual cost of issuance of a license, is unreasonable and confiscatory and in violation of Article I, section 1, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. It is also alleged and argued that Section 602 (14) is discriminatory and therefore invalid in that it provides for a permit fee equivalent to one-fifth of the annual liquor license fee prescribed in Section 407 (a) of the Act, with the result that the permit fee payable in a given case may vary from $25 to $120, depending upon the population of the municipality in which the particular licensee is located.</p>

J. S. Intoxicating Liquors, Section 38. In <em>Spankard’s Liquor License Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/138/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="138 Pa. Super. 251" data-case-ids="1022226" data-case-paths="/pa-super/138/0251-01">138 Pa. Superior Ct. 251</a>, the Court said, page 259: ‘A liquor license, even when granted, is not a property right; it is only a.privilege: (citing cases). It may be taken away by the governing authorities without compensation to the holder. It was done throughout this entire country by the Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and the Twenty-First Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth, expressly reserved to the states the right to prohibit the manufacture, possession, sale and importation of intoxicating liquors within their respective borders: (Citing cases). . . . The regulation of the sale of intoxicating liquors is a matter peculiarly within the police power of the several states, because of the evils which result from the uncontrolled traffic in them.’ Again in <em>Boyle’s License, </em><a href="/pa-super/8/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Pa. Super. 521" data-case-ids="286880" data-case-paths="/pa-super/8/0521-01">8 Pa.

Jur. Intoxicating Liquors, Section 131-133. . . . For these reasons the amount to be paid as a liquor license fee is not limited to the cost of regulation but rests, in the absence of constitutional restriction, in the discretion of the legislature and it may be made so high as to operate as an effective restriction on the business or even so as to be practically prohibitive. Also, it is competent for the legislature to classify the municipal corporations of the state according to population and to fix different license fees for the several classes so that the fees will be higher in cities than in villages or will vary with the size of the population: 48 C. J. S. Intoxicating Liquors, Section 38. See also Annotation in <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.L.R.%20327" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="103 A.L.R. 327">103 A. L. R. 327</a>.</p>
