The core of the petition is that Smith was permitted to plead guilty without having the question of his sanity formally adjudicated and that psychiatrists were not supplied him by the State as witnesses. The petition contends.that due process of law required this because in June 1945 Smith had been committed as “insane” to a mental institution in Brooklyn, N. Y., even though on October 11, 1945, he was officially discharged from that institution as “recovered, sane, and capable of understanding”.</p>

Without expert testimony, Relator [claims that he] could not have overcome the presumption of sanity and capacity to stand trial and could not have sustained his plea of ‘not guilty’, if such a plea had been based on his insanity at.the time of the offense”. It is further stated that the relator’s counsel in a conference with Judge Guerin and with Assistant District Attorney McClain agreed that the plea of “not guilty” be changed to “guilty”, that the Commonwealth would present its testimony before the court en banc, and that the ease be then postponed.sufficiently to allow counsel to subpoena the New York records of Smith’s mental condition and that if these records raised doubt of relator’s sanity, the court would consider the withdrawal of the plea of “guilty”.</p>

Judge Guerin then agreed to permit the “case to be called and not follow <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>the usual custom, but continue its trial until its termination and . . .

Dr. Drayton’s diagnosis was that the relator “is of average intelligence; no psychosis, psychotically and neurologically negative” and he “was not only sane at the time of the commission of the crime charged in the indictment, but was then, on November 5, 1948, sane.” The relator’s counsel extensively examined Dr. Drayton.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

In the order made by County Judge Nathan R. Sobel on October 10, 1945, official notice was taken of Smith’s recovery from his mental illness. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

There the defendant was convicted of murder, sentenced to death, and imprisoned pending execution. In compliance with a California statute forbidding the execution of an insane person and prescribing the procedure for obtaining a judicial determination of a prisoner’s sanity (to be initiated by the warden if “there is good reason to believe” that he has become insane), the defendant was adjudged insane and taken to a state hos<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>pital. Thereafter, without notice or hearing, the medical superintendent of the hospital certified that the defendant’s reason had been restored; and he was returned to prison and a new date was set for his execution. He petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the State Supreme Court but the petition was denied. The United States Supreme Court ruled that “being unable to say that the judgment denying habeas corpus may not rest on an adequate non-federal ground, the writ of certiorari is dismissed”. Justice Black said: “. . . it would be somewhat anomalous, to say the least, if California courts were wholly without power to correct an executive agent’s abuse of authority in a matter of such great significance as the execution of insane persons.”</p>

We cannot say at this time that California’s remedy by mandamus will be less than a substantial equivalent of one which authorized him to apply directly to a court for a full hearing. For this Court held in Nobles v. Georgia, [<a href="/us/168/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="168 U.S. 398" data-case-ids="6140210" data-case-paths="/us/168/0398-01">168 U.

Applications for inquiries into- sanity made by a defendant sentenced to death, unsupported by facts, and buttressed by no good reasons for believing that the defendant has lost his sanity, cannot, with any appropriate regard for society and for the judicial process, call for the delays in execution incident to full judicial inquiry. And a court can just as satisfactorily determine by mandamus as by direct application whether there are good reasons to have a full-fledged judicial inquiry into a defendant’s sanity.”</p>

This contention is fully answered by the State Supreme Court’s opinion in this case, holding that,neither habeas corpus nor any other remedy is available to test sanity of a condemned defendant, except that remedy under §3701<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> which only the warden can insti<a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>tute. Hence, so far as it here appears, mandamus to compel action by the warden is the only available remedy. Petitioner contends that this remedy is inadequate because under California law no relief could be hoped for in a mandamus proceeding without a showing that the warden’s non-action was arbitrary and capricious. We cannot know, of course, just what precise standards the State Supreme Court may hold must be met by petitioner in order to obtain the judicial inquiry provided in §3701. We are persuaded by the attorney general’s statements and brief, and by the state constitution, state statutes, and state decisions to which he referred, that mandamus is probably available, and that in a mandamus proceeding some issues of fact concerning petitioner’s sanity can be drawn by the parties, resolved by the courts, and provide support for relief.”</p>

This was refused and appeal was taken to the Supreme Court.
