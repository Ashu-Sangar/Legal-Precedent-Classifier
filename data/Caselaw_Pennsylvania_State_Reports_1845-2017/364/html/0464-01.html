The defendant, Alex Agoston, Jr., aged 41 years, was convicted of murder in the first degree and the death penalty Avas imposed.</p>
    <p id="b507-9" data-blocks='[["BL_507.13",507,[137,1585,1147,587]]]'>On December 17, 1947, defendant was taken into custody by the Pennsylvania State police for questioning in regard to the disappearance of Bussell Balliet on December 9, 1947. On December 14th, Balliet’s disappearance was reported to the police of Berwick by his brother. An investigation by the police revealed that Balliet had last been seen alive at about 11:30 P.M. on December 9, 1947, at which time he had left tlie Salem Inn Avith Agoston. Numerous witnesses testified that they had seen Balliet with Agoston from about 6:30 P.M. until 11:30 P.M., on December 9th.</p>

On December 8th, McElrath <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>went out of town on a business trip leaving Balliet in charge of his business with authority to buy and sell cars. When McElrath returned from his trip on December 13th, he discovered that Balliet had withdrawn $1525 from McElrath’s account at the bank, stating that he was buying a car for his employer. McElrath had agreed in the latter part of 1947 to purchase the defendant’s ear for $1525 but the sale was never consummated because the defendant did not have title to his car. Mc-Elrath then called on defendant to inquire whether or not Balliet had purchased his car. Defendant said that he had not sold his car to Balliet and denied any knowledge of the latter’s whereabouts.</p>
    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[330,986,1149,1192]]]'>The foregoing and other circumstances caused the local and State police to suspect that the defendant could explain Balliet’s disappearance. At 2:30 P. M. on Demember 17th, defendant was taken to the Council Room of the Berwick City Hall where he was questioned as to his whereabouts on the night of December 9th. This questioning continued for about three hours. Defendant denied any knowledge of Balliet’s disappearance and also denied having been with him at any time on December 9th. Defendant was then taken to a restaurant for his evening meal. After the meal, the police drove him to his home where he picked up his car and drove it to the police station. He was again taken to the Council room where he Avas again interrogated until approximately 11:30 P. M., Avhen he Avas placed in the detention room for the night. The next morning the officers made an examination of the defendant’s automobile and they found that the front seat covers Avere new. These covers were removed and the police found bloodstains on the seat and a bullet hole on the back of the front seat on the side where the driver sits. It was apparent that the right windshield had been recently replaced.</p>

The police showed him the new windshield, the bloodstains and the bullet holes in the upholstery. About 5 P. M. Agoston was brought to the Council Room, after stating that he was “willing to talk.”</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[126,559,1151,582]]]'>The defendant’s bloodstained clothing, which had been found by the officers in the bedroom closet of the defendant’s home, had been placed on the table of the Council Room before he was brought up from the cellar. As soon as he noticed the clothing he became “white, hysterical and started to shake violently.” Doctor Buckingham was summoned to examine him and he found Agoston’s pulse “regular and normal.” The physician administered no drugs or medicines but told the officers to give Agoston a drink of coffee. The doctor left after ten minutes.</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.6",509,[125,1163,1150,474]]]'>Shortly thereafter Agoston told the officers that his brother Floyd was responsible for Balliet’s disappearance. The brother was sent for and when the two brothers confronted each other the defendant said to his brother: “Go ahead, Floydie, tell them what you did with Russell Balliet.” Thereupon the brother became infuriated and had to be restrained from attacking the defendant. The brother was released between 8 and 9 P. M.</p>
    <p id="b509-6" data-blocks='[["BL_509.7",509,[124,1659,1150,427]]]'>The defendant was then shown the German automatic P 38 pistol, two cartridge clips and an arm-holster which the police had found in the defendant’s bedroom clothes closet. One cartridge clip was filled, containing seven loaded cartridges, the other contained only five loaded cartridges. The defendant then admitted the gun was his, stating that he had a permit from the Sheriff of Columbia County to carry the weapon for protection.</p>

Both of these obligations were in default and the bank had threatened execution. He was indebted to two finance companies in the sum of $600. He owed money on a stove, which he had purchased and he owed a further amount of $1500 on his car which he. held under a bailment lease.</p>
    <p id="b510-4" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[333,708,1151,973]]]'>On December 10th, defendant paid arrearages on his car, amounting to $375 with two $100 bills, three $50 bills, a $20 bill and a $5 bill. These denominations corresponded with the denominations of the currency which Balliet secured from the bank on December 9th. Agoston also paid $10 to another creditor, who testified that Agoston exhibited “quite a roll” but in it there was no $10 bill. There was no bill of that denomination in the money which Balliet obtained from the bank. On this same date,- Agoston bought a pair of seat covers for $13.40 and a new windshield for $10. He explained the broken windshield by saying that when he was “driving into his garage, a pole was sticking out.” On December 11th, Agoston purchased an overcoat for $80 and on December 12th, he went to a Finance company and discharged an obligation of $30. On December 12th, he paid another creditor $18.04 and on December 13th, he purchased a pair of shoes for $12.80.</p>

M., December 18th, Agoston, after declaring that he would “tell the truth,” gave the officers a detailed account of his movements on the night of Balliet’s disappearance, stating that he had hit Balliet over the head with the gun and had shot him once in the stomach while they were parked in front of defendant’s home, and had shot him once in the back of the head while parked at the northern end of the American Car and Foundry plant, at about 2:30 A. M., on December 10th. He admitted robbing Balliet of $1520. At about 4 A. M. Agoston threw the body into <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>the Susquehanna River from the Mifflinville Bridge. The autopsy disclosed wounds on Balliet’s head and body corresponding with Agoston’s account of the assault. About 9:30 A. M., December 19th, Agoston and the police went to Agoston’s home, where under his guidance, the officers found two empty P38 cartridge cases and one expended P38 lead pellet in the defendant’s garage. He explained that he had found these on the floor of his car as he was cleaning it on the morning of December 10th. At the defendant’s home he and his parents talked with one another “in a foreign language,” and then his father ivent down to the cellar and brought up a package of bills made up of five $100 bills, five $50 bills and a $20 bill. These were the same denominations of money which Balliet had obtained from the bank on December 9th. In the attic there was a set of seat covers for the rear seat of a 1946 Dodge Sedan. Agoston informed the police that the matching seat covers for the front seat had been burned in an incinerator.</p>
    <p id="b511-3" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[111,1390,1151,425]],["BL_512.1",512,[339,281,1149,146]]]'>Agoston then guided the police to the place where he had cast Balliet’s. body into the river. The police then took him to lunch and later to the police station. Shortly thereafter in the presence of witnesses, the District Attorney, after informing Agoston that whatever he said would be used against him and asking him if he wished counsel, interrogated him and the questions were answered freely.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The questions and answers <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>were taken down stenographieally and later transcribed.

    <p id="b512-4" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[340,445,1148,865]]]'>As to his treatment by the officers, Agoston stated to the District Attorney that he “had a wonderful bed and was well-fed.” He said they gave him coffee and were “swell fellows.” Agoston said he “confessed everything,” and told them “how the murder went on.” In his statement, he said: “I was intending all right to shoot him, but I had the gun out half-way and I froze on the gun. I just stopped and hesitated. I wanted to but I didn’t want to, and finally we kept on talking and I pulled it out again and then I really released the safety on it. Then again I couldn’t shoot. I just couldn’t. Then we talked a little more again and by that time I had the gun on my lap and my coat under it, covered it, and I picked the gun up and I hit him over the head. . . . Then I gave him a shot in the chest, either chest or belly, I don’t know which.”</p>
    <p id="b512-5" data-blocks='[["BL_512.7",512,[339,1329,1149,419]]]'>After this interrogation, the police went to the defendant’s home and there found on the ground along the driveway, a pair of eyeglasses with broken lenses. The opthamologist, who prescribed for Balliet testified that the lenses corresponded with the “very unusual” prescription for glasses that he had issued for Balliet. He said: “This is the only prescription I have of this kind.”</p>

Since the winter of 1947-48 had been a cold one and the river had been frozen over, the <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>body was in a fair state of preservation. Upon examination tbe doctors found bullet wounds in tbe head and abdomen corresponding Avith Agoston’s statements as to the bullet wounds he had inflicted on Balliet. Balliet’s brother and brother-in-law and McElrath (Balliet’s employer) identified thé body as that of Balliet, basing their identification upon size and build, facial features, a scar belOAv the right knee cap and a broken front tooth in the upper plate found in the mouth. The cloth of the suit removed from the body Avas also identified as Bussell Balliet’s and perfectly matched a vest in the clothes closet used by Balliet at the home of his brother.</p>

M., on December 9,1947, in the McElrath Used Car Lot in Bemvick. He said: “We made a date, and Ave went out for the evening.” They visited tAvo restaurants and at 10 P. M. they Avent to the Cobblestone Inn and from there to the Salem Inn “through Berwick.” He continued: “We drove on back to Benvick, and Ave drove down Market Street, up around the Christmas lights, and I left him off on the corner of Front and Market Streets. . . . that Avas the last I seen him.” That Avas about 11 P. M. He denied that he had killed Balliet. He explained the holes in his car by saying that during the last day of the rabbit season he “was fishing and a turtle . . . was robbing my bait all the time ... so I Avent to the car and I got my revolver out, and shoved the chamber, I shoved the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>magazine np in the chamber and cocked the gun, and it went off.” He found the bullet when he changed the seat covers. When asked why he bought new seat covers he said that the old ones were “pretty well worn” and soiled. He explained the broken windshield by intimating that boys had thrown stones at it. When asked when the windshield was broken he said: “. . . it must have been around the twelfth anyhow, eleventh or twelfth” of December. He testified that during the Avar he had worked for the the American Car and Foundry Company but at the end of the Avar he “Avas partly laid off,” and that on “V-J” day he had $1400 in the bank and about $2000 in bonds. He procured a permit to carry a pistol “because [as he said] there Avas a feAV felloAVS after me at one time.” He explained that after the night of December 9th, he “got a little blood on my hands when I was fixing the tire.” On December 10th, he took the old seat covers off and replaced them Avith new ones. He burned up the old front seat covers and took the back ones to the garret. When asked about the confession he signed, he said: “It Avas under duress. I kneAV it was false. I knew Balliet Avas alive, very much alive.” When asked if he had been threatened, he said: “. . . they threatened me. They swore at me, but I didn’t pay much attention to it.” He testified that Sergeant Green had said: “Goddam you. We Avasted enough time Avith you. . .'. If you ever make me mad, I Avill knock your goddam brains out.” He claimed that Detective Jones said to him: “I Avill tell you, Ave got to have that money.

We Avill tear yours down, too.” He claimed that he ansAvered: “There ain’t much money to get doAvn there.” When asked if any other statements were made to him by any of the officers he said: “No, that is all.” When he was asked if he was afraid after the statements made by Sergeant Green, he ansAvered: “No.” He was asked by his oavu attorney: <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>“Were there any inducements held out to you, or promises to make any stories now of any sort?” He answered: “Nothing whatsoever.”</p>
    <p id="b515-3" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[113,448,1152,596]]]'>To rebut Agoston’s testimony, as to threats the Commonwealth called Sergeant Green, who said: “They [Agoston’s statements] are not true. I made no threats of any kind to this Defendant, and there were no threats of any kind made to him in my presence at any time.” He said that no one swore at Agoston. Also in rebuttal, Detective Jones testified that he did not tell the accused that, “We ivill have to tear your house down. . . . They tore Hauptmann’s house down to get that money.” He said that he did not hear anyone else make those statements, or statements similar to those, to the accused.</p>

Stout, who appeared as a character witness for the defendant, later testified in rebuttal for the Commonwealth, that he was present during the entire evening of December 18th, when the defendant made his admissions of guilt. The witness was asked whether any officer had made threatening statements as alleged by Agoston, he replied: “No sir.” When asked about the manner in which the accused made his self-incriminating statements, Stout said: “He just talked them off like he talked any other time. He was not excited, didn’t seem nervous, he just talked right along the way he talked up here on the witness stand, just 1old the story right along.” Stout also testified that Agoston had shown himself and another officer his right hand on which there was “a black and blue mark.” He said Agoston said: “This is what I got for tussling with Bussell for the gun.”</p>

I walked <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>in and said, ‘Well, Alex, it is time for me to go home. I want to say goodbye. I might not see you for a while.’ He got up and shook hands with me. I said, ‘Alex, were you treated all right while you were in custody here at the City Hall?’ He said, ‘I was never treated no better. . . . They gave me a good place to sleep in; they got me something to eat whenever I asked for it..., No one ever laid a hand one me. ... I was treated swell, treated like a king.’ ”</p>

Agoston’s trial began on May 3, 1948 and eight days later the jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed death as the penalty. The court later refused a new trial and this appeal followed.</p>

There is no just ground for criticism of the interrogation of Agoston by the police officers. Karl G-uers, a Private First Class in the Pennsylvania State Police, who had been assigned to this case by his superiors, testified that Agoston was <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>taken into custody at about 2:30 P. M., on December 17th and taken to the Berwick police station. He was questioned until 4:30 P. M. He was then taken to a restaurant for his evening meal. At about 6:00 P. M., he was taken to his home so that the police could examine his Dodge car but it was too dark to do so. The defendant drove it back to the police station so that it could be examined in the morning. The car was examined at about 10:45 A. M., on December 18th, when the stains on the front seat and the hole in the upholstery were discovered and Agoston was confronted with these discoveries. The officers then questioned Agoston on December 18th, from 2:30 P. M., until about 5:15 P. M. Guers said that Agoston was given, “rest periods” during the interrogation. He was asked if he wanted an attorney and he said that he did not. He had several cups of coffee during this time. After dinner that evening, the police resumed the questioning and Agoston said that he was “willing to tell the police what happened.” He then accused his brother of committing the crime. His brother was brought to the police station where he indignantly denied the accusation. The brother was released and the accused ivas given another rest and he then stated that he “ivas willing to talk.”</p>

He was intelligent enough to be a drill press operator during the war and to earn approximately $90 to $118 a week. He entered into a contract to buy a car and he claimed to be the owner of “four diamonds worth about $500 eaeh.” He claimed that during the war he accumulated $1400 in cash and about $2000 in war bonds. While he was told that whatever he said would be used against him and was asked if he wanted an attorney, it was really unnecessary to do this for Agoston must have known that what he had told the police officers <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>about Balliet’s disappearance would be used against him and that he was not obligated to talk. His brother was with him before he made any confession. The District Attorney asked him: “Did they [police officers] make any threats to you, try to coerce you in any way.” He said: “No.” Q. “Did they threaten you in any way?” A. “No.” Q. “Did they coerce or try to force you to say anything?” A. “They never laid a hand on me, that I dare swear to.” Q. “And they didn’t threaten you with anything?” A. “Never. No, sir. They never laid a hand on me and they were very nice. They were A#1 princes all the way through.”</p>

If the police had not interrogated him, they would have been derelict in their duty. Experienced and qualified police officers know, as do psychologists and theologians, that when a man possesses a guilty secret, he will, if given proper encouragement, disclose it. When a murder has been committed and circumstances point to the one who is responsible for it, it is the duty of the police to encourage and not to discourage that person to tell the truth.

It will protect him against the use of a confession drawn from him by holding out inducements to make it; but, when a criminal wants to ease his mind by a voluntary confession, it would be a weak sentimentalism to interfere with his doing so.”</p>

S. 97</a>, in an opinion by Justice Cardozo, declared that the test is whether or not the thing complained of “is so flagrantly unjust that the Constitution of the United States steps in to forbid it.” Justice Cardozo said: “Due process of law requires that the proceedings shall be fair, but fairness is a relative, not an absolute concept. It is fairness with reference to particular conditions or particular results. ‘The due process clause does not impose upon the States a duty to establish ideal systems for the administration of justice, with every modern improvement and with provision against every possible hardship that may befall.’ Ownbey v. Morgan, <a href="/us/256/0094-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="256 U.S. 94" data-case-ids="3679988" data-case-paths="/us/256/0094-01">256 U. S. 94</a>. . . . The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a filament. We are to keep the balance true. The constitution and statutes and judicial decisions of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are the authentic forms through Avhich the sense of justice of the People of that Commonwealth expresses itself in laAv. We are not to supersede them on the ground that they deny the essentials of a trial because opinions may differ as to their policy or fairness. . . . There is danger that the criminal law.
