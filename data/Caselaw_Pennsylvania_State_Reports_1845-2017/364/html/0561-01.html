He purchased the property Avith the intent to install and operate therein boAvling alleys. At the time appellee purchased the building it Avas being used as an automobile sales agency, repair and body and <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>paint shop. It had previously been used as a knitting mill, packaging plant and auto agency but was vacant for extended periods. The building is a large, well-built brick and hollow tile and cement structure containing approximately seven thousand square feet of usable floor space. Appellants applied to the board for a variance, which was refused.</p>
    <p id="b605-4" data-blocks='[["BL_605.5",605,[110,654,1149,583]]]'>The township zoning ordinance establishes Business I and Business II districts and outlines permitted uses in each district. The building in question is located in a Business I district. A bowling alley is not expressly authorized therein by way of special exception or otherwise. The use of a bowling alley is specifically authorized by the ordinance in a Business II district if an exception is granted by the Board. Section 1306 (2) of the ordinance prohibits the board from authorizing a use not expressly permitted in the district in which the property is located.</p>

The pertinent provisions of the Act of June 24, 1931 P. L. 1206, Article XXXI, Section 3107, as amended, 53 PS 19092-3107, are as follows: “The board of adjustment shall have the following powers: ... (2) To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance upon which such board is required to pass under such ordinance; (3) To authorize, upon appeal, in specific cases, such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance <a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.” Appellants seek to nullify the board’s power to grant a <em>variancé </em>under subparagraph (3) and would confine it to power to grant special <em>exceptions </em>provided for in subparagraph (2). Such an interpretation would place the ordinance in direct conflict with the Act of Assembly. The board, established pursuant to statute, cannot refuse to perform the functions prescribed therein.

President Judge Knight correctly analyzed these cases as follows: “What they (the cases) . . . decide is that the board of adjustment has no power to grant a variance unless the conditions specified by the enabling Act and the ordinance, exist, namely; special conditions, unnecessary hardship and etc., and when these conditions do not exist, the only remedy of an applicant for a variance is through legislative action. All of the above cases were decided on the theory that the special conditions did not exist.” See also <em>Elkins Park Improvement Association Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/361/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="361 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="476407" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0322-01">361 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20783" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="64 A.2d 783">64 A. 2d 783</a>.</p>

They should have made from the evidence a statement of facts sufficient to show that a judicially exercised discretion, applied to the facts, justified the action taken; a property owner’s constitutional right to the use of his property is not satisfied by arbitrary refusal. Nor is it sufficient merely to say the refusal resulted ‘after due consideration.’ Enough must be stated to enable the court to see that there was due consideration and a weighing of evidence in its legal relations. It is not sufficient to say, as the board did in its return to common pleas, that the change is prohibited . . ., or that appellant is not entitled to a variance . . ., or that the variance ‘would be contrary to the public interest’. . ., or that the board reached ‘a correct and just decision’. . ., without something to show on what those legal conclusions are based. It must appear that the constitutional right to the use of property has not been infringed by the zoning regulation : Compare White’s Appeal, <a href="/pa-super/85/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="85 Pa.
