On August 22, 1946, defendant instituted a divorce action in Dade County, Florida. On September 9, 1946, plaintiff filed a bill in equity in Cumberland County to enjoin the Florida action and on that bill a preliminary injunction was granted the same day. Defendant then moved the Florida court to dismiss the divorce action on November 9, 1946, and ten days later sought to have the preliminary injunction dissolved and that bill dismissed. The learned court below dissolved the injunction but retained jurisdiction of the bill. Thereafter, on May 2,1947, defendant sought a Florida declaratory judgment that he was a resident of and domiciled in Florida. Plaintiff in turn filed a supplemental bill in Cumberland County to enjoin that proceeding and a preliminary injunction to that effect was granted on <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>June 24, 1947.

As early as May 24,1945, defendant stated that he intended to spend less and less time at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Thereafter, he went to Florida and declared that he would make his home there. In June 1946, he rented a house in the Village of North Bay Island where he lived until July, 1947, at which time he purchased a large home for $82,500 in Miami Beach. Since 1947 he has been listed on the tax rolls in Camp Hill as a non-resident taxpayer and has paid Florida personal and real property taxes as a resident of that State. Since 1946 defendant has filed his federal income tax return with the Collector of Internal Kevenue in Florida in compliance with 26 U. S. C. A., Section 53(b) which requires that those returns be filed at the <em>legal </em>residence of the taxpayer. Defendant also had his name removed from the voting registry in Camp Hill in January of 1947, and a short time later registered as a voter in Dade County, Florida. His automobile driver’s license, passport and student pilot certificate have all shown his Florida address to be his home.</p>

He is contacted by business associates and entertains all his guests, both personal and business, in Miami. He has acquired numerous business interests there but still maintains business interests in seven other states, including Pennsylvania. He spends about one-half of his time on business trips to those, states. The balance of his time is spent at his Florida home.

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Plaintiff relies heavily on <em>Dorrance’s Estate, </em>supra, to show that the acts and declarations of defendant were not sufficient, in view of his motive, to establish his intent. In that case, Dorrance sought to maintain a New Jersey residence to avoid taxes. There, it was shown and not seriously disputed that Dorrance spent most of his time in his Pennsylvania home and did almost, all of his entertaining there. He paid only occasional visits to his New Jersey residence and then only for a day or two at a time. In addition the New Jersey house was small in comparison with the size of his Pennsylvania estate. Certainly in those circumstances and considering his motive, it could not be said that Dorrance was a bona fide domiciliary of New Jersey. Here, on the other hand, defendant spends all of his time in Florida except for time spent on necessary business trips and in fact conducts much of his business there. His Florida residence is a large one costing $82,500 and while the size and value of his Camp Hill house is not in evidence, he has shown his abandonment of that property by tendering a deed to it to plaintiff. The <em>Dorrance </em>case is readily distinguishable from the facts of this case and accordingly is not here controlling.</p>

To so hold, Avould require us to overlook the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, As Ave stated above, the two <em>Williams </em>cases limit our inquiry to the issue of domicile. By no stretch of the imagination can defendant’s domicile be said to depend on any equities which may exist in favor of plaintiff. Furthermore, plaintiff’s oavu witness testified that defendant offered plaintiff a settlement of $400,000 to be paid over a period of twenty years. That sum represented one-lialf of their accumulated wealth. It was <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>also shown, as previously stated, that defendant has tendered to plaintiff a deed to their Camp Hill residence. When those factors are considered, the hardships of which plaintiff complains are completely negatived.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[308,500,1150,1515]]]'>A further contention made by plaintiff is that the court en banc violated Equity Rule 71<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> by failing to make certain requested findings which plaintiff avers were not substantially disposed of by the chancellor in his adjudication. Equity Rule 71 is unambiguous and must be complied with <em>(B. &amp; I. Co. v. Johnston &amp; Harder, Inc., et al., </em><a href="/pa/340/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="340 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1203343" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0253-01">340 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.2d%20444" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="16 A.2d 444">16 A. 2d 444</a>) but a study of the adjudication makes it clear that there is here no reason to invoke that rule. Many of the requests, dealing with defendant’s business interests, were disposed of by findings made by the chancellor. That these findings were not as favorable to plaintiff as she desired is certainly no grounds for complaining that the chancellor did not make “substantial disposition” of her requests. The remaining requests, concerning defendant’s motive, were discussed in the adjudication and the reasons for refusing the requests fully set forth there. Her requests were all substantially disposed of and Rule 71 is, therefore, not here involved. Moreover, plaintiff’s exceptions were to the chancellor’s <em>failure to find </em>the requested facts and <em>not to his failure to make substantial disposition </em>of those requests. As we said in <em>Morris v. Featro, </em><a href="/pa/340/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="340 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1203379" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0354-01">340 Pa. 354</a>, 361 <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20403" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="17 A.2d 403">17 A. 2d 403</a>: “An examination of the exceptions discloses that there is no complaint in any of them that the chancellor’s adjudication . . . failed to make substantial disposition of requests for findings and conclusions; consequently specific answers to these exceptions were not required.”</p>

Statements tending to show intent are admissible in evidence although self-serving: <em>Ickes v. </em>Ickes, <a href="/pa/237/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="237 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="988972" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0582-01">237 Pa. 582</a>, 591, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.%20885" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="85 A. 885">85 A. 885</a>. See also Wigmore on Evidence (3rd Ed.), Vol. VI, Section 1727. But such oral declarations are of little probative value Avithout corroboration. For that reason evidence of a person’s acts and Avritings are given greater Aveight than his declarations: <em>Pusey’s Estate, </em>supra. In the present case defendant’s acts as Avell as his Avritten statements on official and semi-official documents,, such as tax returns, driver’s license and voting registries, afford ample corroboration of his oral declarations.</p>

The log to which the pilot referred was not an official flight log but merely his OAvn personal memorandum and as such, could only have been used to refresh his recollection (See Henry on Pennsylvania Trial Evidence, Section 491).

Voting, paying taxes, joining clubs, etc., were all matters within defendant’s exclusive control. I think we should give vital effect to the majority’s observation that “. . . since motive may reflect on a person’s intent to change domicile . . . evidence of that intent must be subjected to close and careful scrutiny”. In truth and in fact the testimony adduced by the defendant discloses that his chief interest in trying to obtain a new domicile in a foreign jurisdiction was that he might be able thereby to secure a divorce for which he had no grounds in the marital domicile. The question of domicile was but incidental to his main purpose. In my opinion, defendant’s pretended change of domicile from Pennsylvania to Florida, in the circumstances of this case, constitutes a fraud and a sham.
