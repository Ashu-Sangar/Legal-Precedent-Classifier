They <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>were tried jointly by a jury, Judge Boyer, of Bucks County, presiding. The jury rendered a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree, fixing the penalty of death. Appellant has appealed assigning trial errors.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[324,478,1148,587]]]'>The homicide resulted in the course of a “holdup” or armed robbery of a tap room or tavern located in Feasterville, Bucks County. No question is raised concerning the identity of appellant or his participation in the robbery. A confession which has not been repudiated was offered in evidence. A recital of the details of this crime may be found in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Darcy, <a href="/pa/362/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="362 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="477313" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0259-01">362 Pa. 259</a>, 261, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20663" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 A.2d 663">66 A. 2d 663</a>, et seq., and need not be again repeated. The conviction and sentence of David Darcy, a co-defendant, was affirmed by this Court. A certiorari to the United States Supreme Court was refused.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[322,1077,1148,586]]]'>Appellant assigns four trial errors: (1) The learned trial judge failed to define second degree murder and manslaughter (2) That it was error for the trial judge to say that the patrons of the barroom “would have had the right to kill the defendants” (3) Admission in evidence of other crimes to “determine what kind of men the defendants are”, and (4) in charging the jury that if they found defendant guilty of murder in the first degree “the death penalty would be the just and proper-punishment for the crime.” We will consider these objections <em>seriatim.</em>

After a careful charge reciting the principal testimony, the judge read to the jury the provisions of the Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382 (as re-enacted in The Penal Code 1939, June 24, P. L. 872, 18 PS 4701), as follows: “ ‘All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, all murder which shall be committed in <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>the perpetration or attempt to perpetuate any arson’— arson, as you know, means the burning of buildings— ‘rape, robbery, burglary or kidnapping, shall be deemed murder in the first degree, and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder in the second degree; and the jury before whom any person indicted for murder shall be tried shall, if they find such person guilty thereof,’— that is, guilty of murder- — ‘ascertain in their verdict whether it be murder in the first degree or second degree.’ ”</p>

    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[141,1256,1148,591]]]'>The learned trial judge further instructed the jury: “. . . it will be your duty to determine from the evidence whether or not these defendants, either personally or through the agency of one of their accomplices, killed Mr. Kelly, and whether or not it was murder. If he killed him under such circumstances that it was murder, if you find that it was murder, your verdict will so state, and <em>also state murder of which degree. </em>If you find that it was a murder committed in the perpetration of a robbery, then your verdict should be murder in the first degree.</p>

On the contrary, the jury in terms was directed to fix the degree. As a felonious homicide is presumed to be murder and not manslaughter, and as there was nothing shown to reduce it to the latter offense, the trial judge properly defined the two degrees of murder and ignored manslaughter, and instructed the jury, in case of conviction, to fix the degree of such crime: <em>Commonwealth v. Lessner, </em><a href="/pa/274/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="274 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1072990" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0108-01">274 Pa. 108</a>, 113, <a href="/citations/?q=118%20A.%2024" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="118 A. 24">118 A. 24</a>.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[331,762,1151,696]]]'>Appellant also contends that it was error for the court to have said in his charge: “We say to you that any person in that barroom, whether they were personally attacked or not, would have had a right to have killed any or all of these three men who entered there for that purpose. We say to you also that the persons perpetrating the robbery had no rights under the law, had no right to defend themselves, no right to injure anyone in self-defense. If they staged a robbery, they lost the legal right which law-abiding citizens have to defend themselves. They had no legal right to injure anybody and much less to kill anybody or to attempt to kill anybody.”</p>
    <p id="b334-5" data-blocks='[["BL_334.6",334,[328,1471,1149,261]]]'>This was an instruction, in effect, that under all the evidence, the appellant could not contend that he acted in self-defense. By the uncontradicted testimony and the confession it appeared that appellant was engaged in perpetrating a robbery.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.7",334,[327,1744,1148,536]]]'>It is also contended that it was error to admit in evidence the statement in the confession that immediately following the present “holdup” and homicide appellant participated in a similar “holdup”. This is without merit. As was held in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Brooks, <a href="/pa/355/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="355 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="468890" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0551-01">355 Pa. 551</a>, 553, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20325" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="50 A.2d 325">50 A. 2d 325</a>, such fact was admissible on two grounds (1) because it constituted a link in a chain of closely connected crimes and (2) in order to show the character of the appellant in the determination of the penalty.
