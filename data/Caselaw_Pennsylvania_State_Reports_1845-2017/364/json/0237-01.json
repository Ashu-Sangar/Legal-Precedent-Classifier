        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThese appeals were presented together and will be disposed of in one opinion. Between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock on an October evening the three women plaintiffs in a car driven westward on Somerset Street by appellant, Miss Bignell, collided in the intersection of Eleventh and Somerset Streets, with defendant\u2019s street car northbound on Eleventh Street. The three occupants of the automobile were injured and brought these suits, Mrs. Walker\u2019s husband also becoming a plaintiff. The cases were tried together and the jury rendered verdicts for the defendant. The plaintiffs\u2019 motions for new trials were refused. They now present a single question for our consideration: that the learned trial judge erred in not sustaining their objections to certain questions asked of them during cross-examination. No other point is presented.\nThe questions to which plaintiffs objected are quoted pursuant to Buie 22 in appellants\u2019 brief as follows: \u201cQ. Are you an ordained minister? Q. You were ordained when and where? Q. Did you attend any seminar? Q. As an ordained minister did you officiate in any church? Q. In other words, in your occupation you visit homes, don\u2019t you, and endeavor to interest people in the beliefs and teachings of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. That is what you mean when you say you are a Minister?\u201d Each question was followed by objection which the trial judge overruled.\nAppellants contend that the questions were prohibited by section 3 of the Act of April 23, 1909, P. L. 140, sec. 3, 28 PS 313. The title to the Act is: \u201cAn Act Providing that opinions on religious matters shall not affect the competency or credibility of witnesses, and that the affirmation may be taken or administered instead of the oath.\u201d The statute dealt with both privilege and relevance but was not intended to exclude cross-examination in the circumstances presented in this record. Section 1 contains definitions. Section 2 provides, \u201cHereafter the capacity of any person to testify, in any judicial proceeding shall be in no wise affected by his opinions on matters of religion.\u201d Section 3 provides: \u201cNo witness shall be questioned, in any judicial proceeding, concerning his religious belief; nor shall any evidence be heard upon the subject, for the purpose of affecting either his competency or credibility.\u201d Section 4 provides for affirmation instead of the oath.\nIn the 9th paragraph of the complaint filed by Mr. and Mrs. Walker they averred: \u201c9. As a result of the aforesaid injuries, the plaintiff, Elizabeth Roberts Walker, has been and will be unable to attend to her daily duties, which include her occupation as a Minister, to her financial loss and damage.\u201d Similar averments were contained in the complaints of the other two plaintiffs. Mrs. Walker testified in direct examination that \u201cbefore the accident\u201d her occupation was \u201cMinister, Ordained Minister\u201d; after the accident she was \u201cstill an ordained minister,\u201d saying, however, \u201cI can\u2019t do my regular door to door preaching because I can\u2019t get around.\u201d A plaintiff, Miss Bignell, appellant in No. 164, testified in direct examination that sometime after the accident she \u201cdid a little of [her] Bible educational work\u201d; that it was necessary to do \u201c175 hours a month\u201d work to \u201cqualify\u201d for \u201can expense allowance\u201d of \u201c$25 per month\u201d and that for some time after the accident she was unable to do that much work. She also testified to another source of income: \u201cWe received voluntary contributions for literature\u201d from which, as we read the record, she was allowed to \u201cretain\u201d for herself approximately 50 per cent of the monies received, about $10.00 a month. In cross-examining this plaintiff, counsel called her attention to the averment (quoted above) and asked, \u201cAre you an ordained minister?\u201d An objection to this question was overruled. She answered \u201cyes\u201d and was then asked where she was ordained and answered, \u201cI have been ordained by Jehovah God.\u201d She testified she was \u201ca member of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201d; that she had \u201ca certificate of graduation from the Watch Tower College of Gilliad.\u201d She explained the nature of the work performed by herself and the other plaintiffs as members of the religious group to which they belonged. The cross-examination was pertinent to enable the jury to consider the claims for impairment of earning power and losses said to have resulted from the accident. We cannot say that the challenged questions exceeded the scope of fair cross examination of the parties making these claims for loss or impairment of earning power. \u2022 The questions did not challenge appellants\u2019 competency to testify nor go to credibility on the ground of membership in a religious sect. It was not unreasonable cross-examination to ascertain of what the work for \u201c175 hours a month\u201d consisted; and in what circumstances she was allowed to retain \u201c$10.00 a month\u201d out of the papers sold and allowed \u201can expense allowance\u201d of $25, as well as what the plaintiff meant by her evidence of receiving \u201cvoluntary contributions for literature.\u201d The purpose was to obtain substantive information necessary to supply deficiencies in the testimony given by plaintiffs in direct examination; if the answers to these questions, properly allowed in cross-examination, played any part in judging credibility, that effect was incidental and did not bring the subject within the condemnation of section 3 of the statute. There was no condemnation of or aspersion upon the parties\u2019 \u201copinions on religious matters,\u201d (using the words in the title) ; nor in the circumstances presented by the plaintiffs, can the cross-examination be considered within section 3 of the Act to be \u201cconcerning [the party\u2019s] religious belief . . . for the purpose of affecting either his competency or credibility.\u201d If the purpose of the cross-examination had apparently been to create prejudice against the parties because of their religious beliefs, the learned trial judge would undoubtedly have sustained the objections.\nThe verdicts were for the defendant. There was evidence from which the jury may have found that defendant was not guilty of negligence; on that point the jury may have considered the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witness, Hannigan, as conclusive. As the evidence supports the verdicts the court may not set them aside unless there was error. The question now presented by plaintiff-appellants is whether their motions for new trials should have been granted on the ground that they were - prejudiced, within the meaning of the Act of 1909, supra, by the challenged cross-examination. On this record, for the reason stated, we must conclude that the court properly allowed the questions.\nIn each case the judgment is affirmed.\nSee 8 Wigmore on Evidence (3d ed.), section 2213.",
