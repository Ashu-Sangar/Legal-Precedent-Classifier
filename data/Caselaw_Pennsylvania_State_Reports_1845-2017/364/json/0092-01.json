The pertinent legal principles are horn-book; and nothing is to be gained by repeating the appropriate application given them in the opinion for the court en banc justifying the learned trial judge\u2019s entry of a compulsory nonsuit. On the merit of that opinion, the order refusing to take off the nonsuit will, therefore, be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.",
