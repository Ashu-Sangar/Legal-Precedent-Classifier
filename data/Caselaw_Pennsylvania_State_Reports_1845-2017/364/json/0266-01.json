        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDissenting shareholders of The Mountain Telephone Company, who were opposed to the sale of its assets to Conestoga Telephone and Telegraph Company, applied, pursuant to Section 5 of the Act of May 20, 1921, P. L. 949, 15 PS 2415, for the appointment of \u201cthree disinterested persons to estimate and appraise the damage, if any, which such . . . stockholders have suffered or sustained by reason of\u201d such sale. Three appraisers were appointed; after hearing and investigation, a majority of them reported (1) that the dissenting shareholders \u201chave suffered or sustained no damage by reason\u201d of the transaction and (2) that the market value of the common stock of The Mountain Telephone Company at the pertinent date was $250 a share. The third appraiser filed a separate report fixing a higher market value. Exceptions to the report were filed and, after argument, the court dismissed them and confirmed the report. The court then conducted a hearing \u201cto receive further testimony relating to the allowance of fees and expenses,\u201d and made an order taxing as costs, payable by the corporation, certain items amounting to $3,524.10 of which $1,800.00 constituted fees for the three appraisers and $1,200.00 for fees of their counsel. The Mountain Telephone Company then presented in the court below a petition for re-argument of the issue of costs which the court declined to grant. In their petition for the re-argument they stated four objections which may be summarized briefly: (1) the Act authorizing the proceeding does not authorize the imposition of costs; (2) the court had no inherent power by the common law to impose costs; (3) this proceeding is statutory and not within the equity jurisdiction in which the court has control of costs; (4) the fourth objection is stated as follows: \u201cThe action of the dissenting stockholders was unfounded, insincere and vexatious, for even though their bad faith need not be shown, it is strongly suggested, in view of the Public Utility Commission\u2019s approval of the transaction and the failure of the dissenting stockholders to exercise other available remedies for the benefit of all the stockholders; in other words, they were trying to enrich themselves at the expense of the assenting stockholders who had in sincere good faith approved the transaction.\u201d\nThe Mountain Telephone Company appealed and the question now is whether the court had the power to impose these costs on the corporation or whether costs followed the losing parties, the dissenting shareholders, who, as the appraisers reported, sustained ho damage.\nIn reaching its conclusion the learned court below referred to no decisions by our appellate courts but relied on a Delaware case which we must lay aside because the Delaware statute expressly conferred power on the court to tax the costs.\nThe majority of the shareholders, acting in good faith, had the right to vote the disposition of all the assets and the dissolution of the corporation. The Act of 1921, P. L. 919, furnishes a remedy for dissatisfied shareholders by authorizing them to sue the majority shareholders for damages resulting from their action. The statute provides that the appraisers \u201cor a majority of them, shall appraise the share or shares of said stockholders in the said company at the market value thereof, without regard to any depreciation resulting from said purchase and acquisition. Said corporation may, at its election, either pay to the holder of such stock the amount of damages so found or the value of the stock so ascertained. Thereupon said stock shall be transferred to and be vested in the acquiring corporation.\u201d In this case no damages were payable. The dissentients of course will receive the market price for their stock. The statute provides a special remedy by which dissentients may recover for damage sustained by wrongful acts of the majority in disposing of the assets of the corporation. It is an action at law for the benefit of the dissentients not a suit in equity for the benefit of all the stockholders of the corporation.\nCosts in actions at law in this Commonwealth depend on statute, and may not be imposed in the absence of statute authorizing it: Musser v. Good, 11 S. & R. 247 (1824); Steele v. Lineberger, 72 Pa. 239 (1872); Black\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 344 (1884); Tunison v. Commonwealth, 347 Pa. 76, 31 A. 2d 521 (1943). Some of the merger and consolidation statutes provide for costs; and some do not. The Act of 1921, P. L. 949, contains no provision on the subject. The court was therefore without power to assess the costs against the present appellant.\nThe order appealed from is reversed and the record is remitted for further proceedings.\nThe title to tbe Act is, \u201cAn Act Authorizing certain telephone companies and certain telephone and telegraph companies to acquire all or any part of the capital stock, franchises, property, rights, and credits of each other, and to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire all or any part of the lines, systems, rights, privileges, municipal consents, and corporate franchises of each other.\u201d\nIn re General Realty & Utilities Corporation, 52 Atl. 2d 6 (1947).\n43 Dela. Laws, e. 132, sec. 16, page 468, amended section 61 of Chapter 65 of the Revised Code (section 2093 of the Code) as follows: \u201cThe cost of any such appraisal, including a reasonable fee to each of the appraisers, may on application of any party in interest be determined by the Chancellor and taxed upon the parties to such appraisal, or either or both of them, as may appear to be equitable.\u201d\nSee Weisbecker v.
