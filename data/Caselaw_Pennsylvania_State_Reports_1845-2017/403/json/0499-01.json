        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Benjamin E. Jones,\nOn December 26, 1956, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting through the Department of Forests and Waters, condemned for state park purposes certain properties located on 5th, 6th, Commerce and Cuthbert Streets in Philadelphia of which Eobert B. Wolf was the record owner.\nOn January 23, 1957, a board of view was appointed to assess the damages to these properties; after hearing, the board on April 25, 1958 awarded Wolf $415,-800, an amount which included damages as compensation for delay in payment. On May 23, 1958, Wolf appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County alleging that the board\u2019s award was inadequate. The matter was then heard de novo before President Judge Sloane and a jury and, at trial, the court submitted to the jury two questions: (1) the value of Wolf\u2019s properties at the time of taking and (2) whether Wolf was entitled to any detention damages. The jury by its verdict fixed the value of these properties at the time of taking at $355,000 and found that Wolf was not entitled to any detention damages.\nWolf then filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v., the latter motion being premised on the ground that the trial court on the state of the record should have directed the jury to award detention damages at the rate of 6% per annum. The court below refused the motion for a new trial, granted the motion for judgment n.o.v. and entered judgment in favor of Wolf and against the 'Commonwealth in the amount of $421,917.50. The amount of this judgment was composed of the value of the properties as fixed by the jury \u2014 $355,000\u2014together with detention damages of $66,917.50. The judgment as entered by the court awarded detention damages from the date of the taking up to the date of the entry of judgment (February 17, 1960) not up to the date of the jury\u2019s verdict '(November 5, 1959) and furthermore, provided for interest at six (6%) percent per annum from the time of its entry to the time of final payment. From that judgment the Commonwealth has taken this appeal.\nThe Commonwealth contends: (1) that Wolf forfeited any right to detention damages by reason of excessive and unreasonable demands on his part; (2) that, even if Wolf were entitled to detention damages, lie could not claim such damages beyond the date of the jury\u2019s verdict; (3) that-the Commonwealth is immune from the payment, of any interest upon the judgment.\nIn Whitcomb v. Philadelphia, 264 Pa. 277, 107 A. 705, we said (p. 284): \u201cWhen land is taken under the power of eminent domain, the owner thereof acquires the right to its value immediately upon appropriation. Until that value has been definitely ascertained, it -is called-damages, not a debt due; but when ascertained it relates back to the time of taking, and the owner is entitled to compensation for delay in its payment, unless just cause be shown to the contrary. \u25a0 [citing cases]\u201d In Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company v. Commonwealth, 352 Pa. 143, 145, 42 A. 2d 585, Justice (now 'Chief Justice) Jones, speaking for this Court, stated: \u201cPrima facie, an owner of private property which is condemned and appropriated for public use is entitled to damages for delay in payment of the sum due as reasonable compensation for the property taken. [citing cases]. The right to damages for delay in payment in such cases may, of course, be lost if the cause for the delay is the fault of the property owner. Such fault may be evidenced by an unconscionable or excessive claim of damages by the owner of the property or by his refusal, as otherwise indicated,'to negotiate for the amicable settlement of the property damages. \u2018But the lam [does] not presume any such conduct on his [the owner\u2019s] part\u2019: Wayne v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, supra, at p. 515. There is no evidence in this case of any unwillingness or refusal on the part of the plaintiff to arrive at an amicable adjustment of the damages nor of any effort by either party to that end. In that situhtion, the parties presumably being content to have the damages determined by appropriate legal proceedings, the owner\u2019s right to damages for delay in payment remains unimpaired. Cf. Hoffman v. Philadelphia, 250 Pa. 1, 5-6, 95 A. 322.\n\u201cSuch being the law in general;- is damage for delay in payment compensable when the Commonwealth is the condemnor? We think it is. Loss of-use of the property or its proceeds because of delay in payment is an element of damage the same as is the value of the appropriated property. The law so recognizes: see cases cited supra. \u2022\u2022 The Constitution of .the State requires that just compensation be first made or secured for the taking of: private property for public use. Where that is not first done, i.e., at the time of the taking, the integrity of the constitutional reqiiirement can be respected only by including in the award for the value of the property taken such damage as there may have been (within legally.prescribed limits) due to the delay in payment for the property.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth takes the position that Wolf, by reason of his excessive and unreasonable demands, has forfeited any right to detention damages. Of course, if there was proof of such excessive and unreasonable demands, it would work a forfeiture of Wolf\u2019s right to detention damages: Springer v. Allegheny County, 401 Pa. 557, 567, 165 A. 2d 383 and cases therein cited.\nThe Commonwealth argues that it proved that Wolf\u2019s demands were unreasonable and excessive in two ways: (1) that the valuations placed upon the property by Wolf\u2019s real estate experts were unreasonable and excessive and that Wolf was bound by such valuations and, (2) as stated in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief, the \u201c[cjondemnee refused to accept less than $750,000 in settlement of his claim. Immediately prior to trial, it was indicated that h\u00e9 [the condeinnee] might consider accepting an unnamed sum exceeding $600,000. During trial, attempts by the trial judge to effect settlement for a lesser sum were rejected by [Wolf]\u201d.\nAs to the Commonwealth\u2019s first argument the record does not disclose any testimony whatsoever as to what Wolf had demanded from the Commonwealth for these properties. If Wolf did make a demand or demands of any representative of the Commonwealth, why did the Commonwealth not call such representative to prove the nature of such demand or demands? The Commonwealth elected not to present such proof. In lieu thereof, the Commonwealth takes the position that, because the valuations placed by Wolf\u2019s real estate experts were approximately $400,000 greater than the valuations placed by the Commonwealth\u2019s experts, Wolf was bound by such valuations of his experts and the jury could have found that his demand or demands equated the valuations placed by the real estate experts and, therefore, were unreasonable and excessive. Springer, supra, completely and effectively shatters this argument (p. 569) : \u201cObviously, he [the owner] could not be found to have been exorbitant or unreasonable in his demands because of the valuations placed upon it [his properly] by the expert witnesses he produced at trial\u201d. This phase of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument is without merit.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s second argument is not only without merit but somewhat amazing. It is axiomatic that on appeal only that which appears of record is subject to argument by counsel or to consideration by the appellate court. This phase of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument is completely and entirely based upon matters which do not appear upon the record. There is not a scintilla of evidence that Wolf refused to accept less than $750,000, that at trial Wolf indicated that he might accept an unnamed sum in excess of $600,000 or that Wolf rejected any attempts on the part of the trial judge to negotiate a settlement. Not only can we not consider such an argument but such an attempt to go outside the record in this matter is not to be countenanced: Daniels Company, etc. v. Nevling, 385 Pa. 276, 122 A. 2d 814.\nOn the state of the record the court below erred in permitting the jury to pass upon the question of detention damages. Wolf had a prima facie right to recover detention damages and the record is bare of proof of any conduct upon his part which could result in a forfeiture of his right to such damages. In the absence of any such evidence, the jury was not in a position to deny detention damages and, in entering judgment n.o.v., for this reason, the court below justifiably corrected its own error.\nMore serious are the questions of the propriety of the court\u2019s action in allowing detention damages to the date of the judgment rather than the date of the jury\u2019s verdict and the allowance of interest against the Commonwealth until the date of final payment.\nThe Constitution of Pennsylvania provides that \u201cjust compensation be first made and secured for the taking of private property for public use\u201d. (Emphasis supplied). Implicit in the integrity of this constitutional requirement is an obligation upon the part of the Commonwealth to pay such just compensation with as much expedition and with such absence of delay as the circumstances will permit. If the period from the time of the taking of the property to the date of receipt of compensation therefor be unduly extended and if the delay in payment is not due to the fault of the person whose property has been taken, then the compensation to be just should include not only the value of the property at the time of taking but also damages during the period within which payment of such value is withheld.\nWhere the condemnor of property is a body other than the Commonwealth, just compensation is assured not only by tbe award of detention damages from tbe date-of the taking of the property to-the date of tbe award but also-by the allowance of interest from tbe date of tbe -award to tbe date of payment. However, where tbe condemnor is tbe 'Commonwealth we have held that tbe Commonwealth is immune from tbe payment of any interest on tbe award (Culver v. Commonwealth, 348 Pa. 472, 35 A. 2d 64), although recognizing tbe liability of. the Commonwealth for detention damages (Waugh v. Commonwealth, supra; Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. v. Commonwealth, supra).\n\u25a0 As a result of our prior decisions in tbe field of eminent domain tbe Commonwealth is placed in a favored status so far as tbe constitutional requirement of \u201cjust compensation\u201d is concerned and tbe Commonwealth, unlike all other condemnors, does not have to pay tbe person or persons whose property has been taken any compensation for-any delay in payment following tbe award. By way of illustration,- tbe instant jury award was made on November 5, 1959 -but tbe Commonwealth' did not pay any part of such award until May 26, 1960, although tbe jury bad fixed tbe amount of the-basic, as distinguished from tbe detention, damages at -a figure in accordance with tbe Commonwealth\u2019s estimates. Had these properties been taken by a condemnor other than tbe Commonwealth, tbe property owner would have received upwards of $10,000 by way of interest on .the award, whereas the Commonwealth, by reason of a judicially created immunity. from payment of interest, seeks to be relieved from paying, any compensation whatsoever during this period.\nMany years ago this Court stated that \u201cThe compensation (for the taking of land) must be a just one at the time its amount is settled . . . (Emphasis supplied) Klages v. Philadelphia and Reading Terminal Company, 160 Pa. 386, 390, 28 A. 862. The constitutional. mandate of \u201cjust compensation\u201d should be applied regardless of the status of the condemnor and the person whose property has been taken should receive identical treatment at the hands of any condemnor. The only sensible, logical and equitable manner. in which \u201cthe integrity of the constitutional requirement\u201d can be maintained is to require that the Commonwealth pay interest on the amount of the award from the date of the award until the Commonwealth has actually paid the value of the property taken.\nTo require the Commonwealth to pay interest until final payment of the award will impose upon it no unreasonable or wrongful burden and, at the same time, such a requirement will secure equal justice to the condemnee and full compliance with both the letter and spirit of the constitutional guarantee.\nIn the instant factual situation, the jury made its award on November 5, 1959. Approximately three months later, the court entered a judgment n.o.v. which had the effect of adding to the jury\u2019s award of the value of the properties damages for detention up until the date of the entry of the judgment. What the court did was to remold the jury\u2019s award and to enter a judgment expressive of such remolded award, and through such court action the condemnee was awarded both the value of the properties as found 'by the jury plus detention damages. Under these circumstances, the court acted properly in calculating the detention damages to the date of the entry of its judgment. Upon such judgment interest should run until the date of final payment thereof by the Commonwealth to Wolf.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents from that portion of this opinion which allows interest on the judgment.\nIn his opinion for the conrt en bane, President Judge Sloane stated that the provision as to interest \u201cwas in part excessive since [Wolf] would thereby receive interest on detention money in addition to detention damages with respect to the valuation.\u201d It should be noted that the Commonwealth paid Wolf $355,000 on May 26, 1960.\nIn this connection it should be noted -that Morris Wolf \u2014 one of the actual owners \u2014 testified but his testimony disclosed no demand nor did it equate the real estate experts' valuations with any demand he made.\nEven .though detention damage is-not interest, such damage \u2014 - in the absence- of any evidence to justify a lower figure \u2014 is computed at the regular interest rate: Frontage, Inc. v. Allegheny County, 400 Pa. 249, 259, 162 A. 2d 1; Waugh v. Commonwealth, 394 Pa. 166, 175, 146 A. 2d 297.\nAct of April 25, 1929, P. L. 777, No. 328, \u00a71,' as amended by the- Act of March 26, 1931, P. L. 10, No. 7, \u00a71, 26 PS \u00a743.\nCf: Lichtenstein v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 398 Pa. 415, 158 A. 2d 461; Treser v. General State Authority, 190 Pa. Superior Ct. 490, 154 A. 2d 325.\nTo the extent Culver v. Commonwealth, 348 Pa. 472, 35 A. 2d 64, holds to the contrary, it is overruled.\nThe Commonwealth can protect itself by paying into court a substantial amount of the value of the property at the time of its taking as reflected by the opinions and valuations placed on such property by real estate experts selected by the Commonwealth and thus can decrease the detention damages on interest which it may eventually have to pay.",

        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Bell\nConcurring in Part and Dissenting in Part :\nIt has always seemed to me to be unfair and unjust that in these modern times the Commonwealth should be allowed to retain all the attributes, privileges and prerogatives of an ancient Sovereign. In particular I believe that the Commonwealth should have to pay interest on just debts and just claims (including tax refunds) exactly the same as individuals do. However, this Court has often decided to the contrary. Moreover this Court specifically decided in the recent case of Culver v. Commonwealth, 348 Pa. 472, 35 A. 2d 64 (1944), that the Commonwealth did not have to pay interest in an eminent domain proceeding. That case enunciated no new rule or principle; that rule or principle has, until today, always been the law. When the majority decides to overrule Culver v. Commonwealth (as it has), it should not do so under the misapprehension that that case established a new principle of law, or that there has been any change of circumstances since 1&44 which justifies an overruling of that case, or merely of that case.\nThe question of detention of damages and of interest disturbs me. The Courts have remedied part of the injustice which usually results from the exemption of a Sovereign from interest on just claims, by allowing so-called \u201cdetention damages\u201d. \u201cDetention damages\u201d in effect (although in a disguised form) really amount to interest. However, until today, detention damages, if allowable at all, were allowed and assessed by a jury from the time of the taking until the jury\u2019s award. The majority Opinion now changes this well established law and allows a Court not only to overrule the findings of a jury but also to calculate and assess detention damages to the date of the entry of the judgment in favor of the property owner. I know of no authority or reason which justifies this change in the law.\nThe majority Opinion then further changes the law by allowing interest on the judgment until the date of final payment by the Commonwealth, i.e., interest on interest. Not only is the allowance of interest against the Commonwealth contrary, as above stated, to well settled, ancient and recently reiterated principles of law, but the allowance of interest on interest (so-called \u201cdetention damages\u201d) is not only unfair but is also unrealistic so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. If interest is to be allowed against the Commonwealth from the time of entry of the judgment, it should be allowed only where and to the extent that there has been an unreasonable delay in payment of the judgment.\nThe State, unlike an individual, has to appropriate by Legislative action money for payment of claims. Even if no allowance is made for the usual slow bureaucratic processes, it is unrealistic to compel <the payment of interest by the Commonwealth for and during the time reasonably required for State action and payment.",
