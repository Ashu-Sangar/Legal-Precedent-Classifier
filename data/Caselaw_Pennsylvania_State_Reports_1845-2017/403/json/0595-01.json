The defendant filed motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial which, after argument, were denied by the court below. From the judgment entered on the verdict the defendant has appealed.\nWe find no merit in any of the appellant\u2019s assignments of error and the same are, therefore, overruled.\nJudgment affirmed.",
