        "text": "Opinion by\n:Mr. Justice Bok,\nThis is an action in libel. Tbe court below' sustained preliminary objections and. dismissed the complaint on tbe ground that .the communication in question enjoyed absolute privilege. Tbe plaintiff bas appealed.\nThe- amended complaint alleges that tbe plaintiff was a public officer, namely, Chairman of the Plumbing Advisory Committee of tbe Department of Licenses and Inspections of tbe City of Philadelphia; that tbe defendant falsely and maliciously wrote libellously to tbe Mayor of tbe City about tbe plaintiff; that tbe letter was \u201cfirst published through tbe Philadelphia bead-quarters of tbe Republican Party\u201d; and that be bas been injured in bis business, bis reputation, and bis peace of mind. Tbe amended complaint quoted tbe letter.\nTbe preliminary objections reveal that the original complaint attached a copy of tbe letter, complete with letterhead showing defendant to be a councilman-at-large of tbe City Council and bis office at Room 600 City Hall, and that tbe letterhead was missing from tbe amended complaint.\nTbe issue of whether tbe letter is libellous is not before us. Both sides assume for argument that it is and present us only with tbe issue of privilege and its abuse.\nLibel and slander go unscathed when privileged, on tbe theory that it is better that an individual be harmed than that tbe public go uninformed about tbe public business: Montgomery v. Philadelphia, 392 Pa. 178 (1958), 140 A. 2d 100, esp. footnote at 184 quoting Chief Judge Learned Hand; Montgomery v. Dennison, 363 Pa. 255 (1949), 69 A. 2d 520. In order to be privileged, \u201cA communication . . . must be made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive and must be based upon a reasonable and probable cause.\u201d Briggs v. Garrett, 111 Pa. 404 (1886), 2 A. 513; Gray v. Pentland, 2 S. & R. 23 (1815). In Dempsky v. Double, 386 Pa. 542 (1956), 126 A. 2d 915, involving a letter written by a private citizen to a public official concerning another public official, we said: \u201cThe reason for the entry of the nonsuit was that, in the opinion of the court, the circumstances giving rise to the writing of the letter constituted a conditionally privileged occasion as a matter of law and that plaintiff had not presented any evidence to show an abuse of that privilege, as, for example, that the writer was actuated by malice. A privileged communication is one made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, in a proper manner and based upon reasonable and probable cause (Conroy v. Pittsburgh Times, 139 Pa. 334, 21 A. 154; Matson v. Margiotti, 371 Pa. 188, 196, 88 A. 2d 892, 896), and it is always for the court to determine whether the alleged defamatory publication is thus privileged; if found so to be, and if there be no intrinsic or extrinsic evidence of malice, it is the duty of the court to direct a nonsuit or give binding instructions for the defendant: Neeb v. Hope, 111 Pa. 145, 154, 2 A. 568, 572; Restatement, Torts, \u00a7619.\u201d\nOnly the facts and circumstances can determine whether there is privilege, abuse of privilege, or no privilege. Here the face of the complaint shows that publication was not on the floor of City Council but \u201cthrough\u201d a political headquarters. We are of opinion that under such circumstances a City Councilman may enjoy conditional privilege and is open to attack for malice or other abuse, for which we regard the allegation of publication as thin but adequate.\nThere are few cases dealing with privileged statements in legislative bodies at the level of city and borough councils, and they are collected in 40 A.L.R. 2d 933, annotating Mills v. Denny, 245 Iowa 584, 63 N.W. 2d 222 (1954).\nIn Pennsylvania, in Montgomery v. Philadelphia, 392 Pa. 178 (1958), 140 A. 2d 100, we said: \u201cHowever, even though a public officer, in the first instance, establishes the existence of a privileged occasion for a defamatory publication, he may nevertheless be subject to liability if a plaintiff meets the burden of persuading the factfinder that the occasion was abused by showing that the defamatory communication was made for an improper motive, in an improper manner, or was not based upon reasonable or probable cause. . . . The question of whether a privileged occasion was abused is for the determination of a jury unless the facts are such that but one conclusion can be drawn.\n\u201cTo meet this contingency, the defense of absolute privilege, or complete immunity from liability for the publication of defamation was created.\n\u201c \u2018Absolute privilege, as its name implies, is unlimited, and exempts a high public official from all civil suits for damages arising out of false defamatory statements and even from statements or actions motivated by malice, provided the statements are made or the actions are taken in the course of the official\u2019s duties or powers and within the scope of his authority, or as it [is] sometimes expressed, within his jurisdiction. . . .\u2019 Matson v. Margiotti, supra, 371 Pa. at 193-194.\u201d (Original emphasis.)\nAll that we can tell from the complaint before us is that a libellous letter was written on defendant\u2019s official stationery and was first published \u201cthrough\u201d a political headquarters, i.e., not on the floor of City Council, and this allegation removes the possibility of absolute privilege. Imagination can conjure up a dozen scenarios to indicate conditional privilege or the lack or abuse of it, but the plaintiff need not plead his evidence, and it is ancient law that summary judgment may be entered only in clear cases: Dutch Pantry, Inc. v. Shaffer, 396 Pa. 102 (1959), 151 A. 2d 621.\nThe order is reversed, cum procedendo.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell:\nIf a deputy commissioner. of public property of Philadelphia and a city architect are entitled to absolute privilege \u2014 and in Montgomery v. Philadelphia, 392 Pa. 178, 140 A. 2d 100, this Court held that they were entitled to absolute privilege \u2014 I believe that. a Councilman of the City Council of Philadelphia, who is a higher and more important. public official, is. entitled to absolute privilege. However and in. any event the majority has in my judgment confused the scope of absolute or unlimited privilege with the tests for conditional or limited privilege. See: Matson v. Margiotti, 371 Pa. 188, 88 A. 2d 892; and Montgomery v. Philadelphia, supra.\nIn Matson v. Margiotti, supra,, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania sent a letter to the District Attorney of Allegheny County concerning Mrs. Matson, who was an Assistant District Attorney of Allegheny County. The letter accused her of being a Communist, a statement which was libelous per se. The Court in its opinion pertinently said (pages 193, 194, 198, 202, 203-204,205):\n\u201cThe defendant would nevertheless have two possible defenses: (a) Truth: [Citing cases] and (b) Privilege. ...\n\u201cPrivilege has been divided into two.kinds, (1) absolute .or unlimited, and (2) conditional or limited.\n\u201cDefendant contends he is entitled to 'absolute privilege\u2019 and hence absolute immunity from civil suit. Absolute privilege, as its name implies, is unlimited, and exempts a high public official from all civil suits for damages arising out of false defamatory statements and even from statements or actions motivated by malice, provided the statements are made or the actions are taken in the course of the official\u2019s duties or powers and within the scope of his authority, or as it [is] sometimes expressed, within his jurisdiction: [Citing numerous authorities].\u201d (We note parenthetically that this definition of absolute privilege was reiterated and quoted with approval in Montgomery v. Philadelphia, 392 Pa., supra, pages 182-183.)\n. . If the Attorney General was entitled to absolute privilege, his personal or political motives are immaterial as is the presence of malice or want of reasonable and probable cause : Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U. S. 483.\n\u201c. . . We specifically hold that this official letter, being written by a public official in the course and within the scope of his powers, was \u2018absolutely privileged\u2019 ; and that even if the allegations were erroneous and false, and were maliciously made, this privilege was absolute and constituted a complete defense to Mrs. Matson\u2019s action of libel.\n\u201cOne other point has given us grave concern: Was the immediate delivery to the press by the Attorney General of a copy of his letter, prior to its delivery * to the District Attorney \u2014 a regrettable practice pursued by high ranking officials whose victims first learn their fate by radio or press \u2014 incidental to and hence entitled to the same absolute privilege as the letter, or was it outside the scope of the Attorney General\u2019s official duties or powers and therefore entitled only to a conditional privilege? Here once again we have competing rights: the right of the individual to be protected in her property and reputation, and the right of the public to be kept informed of the official actions of their public officials.\n\u201c. . . We therefore hold that under the facts in this ca'se the delivery to the public press of the letter of the Attorney General to the District Attorney of Allegheny County dated January 5, 1951, was within the protection of the absolute privilege accorded in this case to the Attorney General.\u201d\nIn Montgomery v. Philadelphia, supra, the Court said (page 183) : \u201cWhereas qualified privilege could be successful only after a full trial, thus placing a government official at the whims and mercy of a jury, the purpose of absolute immunity is to foreclose the possibility of suit. l. . . [A] bsolute immunity is designed to protect the official from the suit itself, from the expense, publicity, and danger of defending the good faith of his public actions before a jury. And yet, beyond this lies a deeper purpose, the protection of society\u2019s interest in the unfettered discharge of public business and in full public knowledge of the facts and conduct of such business. Absolute immunity is thus a means of removing any inhibition which might deprive the public of the best service of its officers and agencies.\u2019 Note, 20 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 677, 679 (1953).\u201d\nFurthermore, if privilege is absolute, malice is immaterial, as is mailing or publicizing of an official letter after it was sent but before it was delivered to the addressee. (Cases, supra).\nIt is very difficult if not impossible to tell from plaintiff\u2019s complaint whether defendant abused and thus lost his right to absolute privilege, or if his privilege was conditional whether he violated his conditional privilege.\nI therefore concur in the majority\u2019s action in remanding the case to the lower Court for further proceedings, but I would require plaintiff to file a more specific complaint setting forth with particularity all the important essential facts.\nWe note that a Committee of the Allegheny County Bar cleared Mrs. Matson of any charge of .Communism,\nItalics, ours.\nThe majority\u2019s quotation, from the Court\u2019s opinion in the Montgomery case, which was in turn taken from Dempsky v. Double, 386 Pa. 542, 126 A. 2d 915, and from Montgomery v. Dennison, 363 Pa. 255, 69 A. 2d 520, concerned and involved only conditional privilege.\nIf, as appears from plaintiff\u2019s amended, pleadings (which, inter alia, omitted one or more essential facts which appeared in his original complaint), plaintiff has purposely omitted vital facts, \u25a0he is deserving of censure for such reprehensible conduct; defendant, in my judgment, pursued a regrettable practice if he had the letter to the Mayor published before its delivery to the Mayor.",
