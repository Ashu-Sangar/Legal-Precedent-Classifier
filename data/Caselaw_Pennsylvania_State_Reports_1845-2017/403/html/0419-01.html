The Commonwealth was clearly justified when it included freight cars on the lines of other railroads in the proportionate exemption from the capital stock tax of railroads that had tracks without as well as within Pennsylvania. Tinder the track mileage apportionment standard and the aforementioned tax situs rules for freight cars, such freight cars acquired a tax situs only in those states in which the tracks of the railroad were situated and this tax situs was based solely on the percentage of trackage in the particular state. That method of taxation is perfectly consistent with our holding in this case.</p>
