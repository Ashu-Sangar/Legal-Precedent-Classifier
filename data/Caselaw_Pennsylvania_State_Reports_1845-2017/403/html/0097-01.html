Scholler, who was unmarried and without issue. His five brothers had died without issue prior to 1939 and his only close relative, a maiden sister, died a year later. When the trust was created the settlor was, for all practicable purposes, the only shareholder of Scholler Brothers, Inc. which in turn owned Scholler Brothers, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary, and <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>Trisco Products, Inc. (Scholler Corporations). The settlor served as president of the Philadelphia Textile Institute Foundation, vice-president of the LaSalle Foundation and a director of Northeastern Hospital.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[173,567,1142,90]]]'>The important provisions of the deed of trust can be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[169,678,1147,531]]]'>The settlor first recited his desire “to create a fund, the income of which shall be used .for the benefit of mankind; to set up a charitable entity to which I may ultimately transfer all my shares of stock in [the Scholler Corporations] . . .” so that the income derived from these shares and from other property added to the trust “will be used for the benefit of mankind. . . Therefore, in his words, he established, “a charitable trust to be known as The Scholler Foundation. . . .”</p>

Then, the deed of trust provided that increases in officers’ salaries had to be approved by the trustees of the Foundation. The deed contains an elaborate formula for a limitation on bonuses paid to officers and employees. The trustees were required to vote for directors nominated by the existing board, provided that the nominations were in good faith. However, the trustees would not be bound by this requirement if the companies operated at a loss for two years or failed to pay prescribed dividends and, in addition, the directors could be removed for incompetence.</p>

However, in 1951, when the trustees proposed to transfer to the Foundation the stock of Scholler Brothers, Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary of Scholler Brothers, Inc., they were required to obtain a charitable classification for the Foundation from the Canadian tax authorities. Application was made for such designation but the Canadian authorities questioned certain provisions of the trust under the heading “Transfer of Property.” In particular, objection was made to the latter part of this section which referred to distribution in favor of employees of Scholler Corporations. In response to these objections the deed of trust was amended on August 17, 1951. A second amendment, which made further minor deletions to satisfy additional objections by the Canadian authorities, was adopted on March 17, 1952 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Since tbe intention of tbe settlor is tbe guide primarily to be followed in construing a deed of trust, <em>Scott’s Trust, </em><a href="/pa/322/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="322 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1167861" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0001-01">322 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%20245" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="184 A. 245">184 Atl. 245</a> (1936), we have scrutinized tbe entire record for evidence of such intent. An examination of tbe deed of trust shows that tbe settlor repeatedly used typical and traditional charitable trust phraseology. Tbe use of tbe terms “charitable entity,” “charitable trust,” “benefit of mankind” and “betterment of mankind” are indeed strong evidence of bis intent to establish a charitable trust. The detailed listing of tbe purposes for which be wished distribution made — almost all of which are unquestionably charitable — similarly reveals a dominant intent upon tbe part of tbe settlor to create a charitable trust. Since a court, in an effort to ascertain a settlor’s intent, may look beyond tbe deed itself to contemporaneous circumstances, <em>Wolters Estate, </em><a href="/pa/359/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="359 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="473114" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0520-01">359 Pa. 520</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20147" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="59 A.2d 147">59 A. 2d 147</a> (1948), our <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>conclusion is supported by evidence of tbe settlor’s charitable propensities and the absence of close relatives and others who might qualify as the natural objects of his bounty.</p>
    <p id="b123-5" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[118,577,1152,984]]]'>The appellants contend, however, that the provisions in the “Transfer of Property” section for benefits to the employees of the Scholler Corporation nullifies the charitable nature of the trust.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Viewing these provisions in context we find that the settlor’s desire to aid such employees is only subsidiary to his overall charitable intent. Thus, even if these allegedly non-charitable provisions were still present in the deed they would not nullify the trust since the settlor provided a severability clause specifically designed to preserve the charitable nature of the instrument. In addition, it is well settled that “where a valid charitable trust contains illegal or improper provisions for directions to the trustees, the law will strike down the unlawful direction to leave the primary intent untouched.” <em>Manners v.

Although the deed of trust was irrevocable and unamendable the two amendments were effective to <em>reform </em>the instrument. “. . . [W]here the settlor receives no consideration for the creation of the trust ... a unilateral mistake is ordinarily a sufficient ground for a rescission, as it is in the case of an outright gift. It is immaterial that the bene<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>ficiaries of the trust did not induce the mistake or know of it or share it.

There the settlor by inter vivos deed created an irrevocable trust for his children. There was no provision in the event that the settlor survived all of his children and that they failed to exercise the power of appointment given under the trust. Following <em>Spiegel’s Estate v.

The evidence does not support this contention. An examination of the circumstances contemporaneous to the 1951 and 1952 amendments dispels any doubt as to the settlor’s intent in regard to this matter. The settlor, who acted as a trustee prior to and during the period of the amendment, supervised the distribution of approximately one quarter of a million dollars in gifts to recognized charitable endeavors.
