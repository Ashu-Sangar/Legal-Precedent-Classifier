He rented her out as a prostitute. Querey, the deceased victim, after Ms mother’s death, came from North Carolina to Pennsylvania to collect her life insurance. He collected the insurance and on his way home engaged Patricia through a cab driver for purposes of intercourse. The price was $50. He paid her the $50 and also bought her some presents. Patricia remained some time and after it was over went back to the Naples Restaurant to meet defendant. She gave defendant $50. He became very angry because his price was $50 an hour and she had stayed three hours. Defendant shouted at her and said “You are going out and see that man with me.” He said the man was trying to get something for nothing. <a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>Patricia was' afraid to tell defendant that Querey had bought her presents because he had told her that if she ever let anybody buy her anything he would beat her— which he had already done on a prior occasion. Defendant and Patricia, at his insistence, went to the Airport to see Querey to get the additional money to which he claimed he was entitled. They knocked on Querey’s door and telephoned repeatedly but unsuccessfully. Defendant insisted they try once again and after defendant banged very loudly on Querey’s door he forced Patricia to call Querey once more. Querey then opened the door slightly. Defendant pushed the door open and pushed Patricia inside. Then Querey asked: “What’s this all about?” Defendant answered “I think you owe this girl some money.” Querey denied knowing Patricia and told defendant to get out. Patricia begged defendant to leave the room, but defendant replied <em>he wanted that money. </em>Querey threatened to call the police. He went to the phone and defendant followed him. They began struggling over the telephone. Patricia begged defendant to leave Querey alone. Querey started to put his leg in his trousers and at that point defendant, who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 170 pounds, started hitting Querey in the face with his fists. Patricia screamed at defendant, who repeatedly told her to be quiet and threatened to hit her too if she were not. Querey, who was about 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 150'pounds and was further handicapped by putting on his trousers, just stood there while defendant beat him until he fell to the floor. While he lay there defendant kicked him in the back of the head — which was later proved to be the cause of death. Then defendant bent down, and while Querey was unconscious, took the wallet out of Querey’s pocket, removed four (or more) $50 bills from the wallet, and threw the wallet between Querey’s legs.</p>

      <a id="p657" href="#p657" data-label="657" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*657</a>Patricia at that point ran to the elevator, followed by defendant. He told her that he had gotten : over-$300. Defendant then concocted several lies for Patricia to tell, including a story that Querey had beaten her. Defendant soon became scared, hid, dyed his hair, and several days later fled with Patricia and another friend to New Orleans. In his confession to the district attorney (which was freely made after due admonitions and warnings) he admitted that he had gotten $200; that he had struck Querey and while Querey was unconscious but still living had taken his money.</p>
    <p id="b677-4" data-blocks='[["BL_677.4",677,[174,981,1162,315]]]'>Defendant contends that the above mentioned facts cannot amount to a felony murder because the Com-. monwealth failed to prove that he “had any preconceived intention .to rob” Querey when he went to his room; that the robbery was merely “an -afterthought” which was formulated after the beating occurred.</p>
    <p id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[170,1307,1163,754]],["BL_678.1",678,[246,372,1144,210]]]'>The Commonwealth’s evidence to prove both robbery and murder<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> was direct and overwhelming. Not only did Patricia see and- testify to the beating, kicking and robbery by defendant, -but defendant freely admitted it to the district attorney, who testified in behalf of the Commonwealth.. Defendant in his testimony at the trial admitted striking Querey with his fist but denied taking any money from Querey, - denied kicking him, and testified that he made up the -story to protect and help Patricia. . He likewise testified that he never lived • with Patricia nor received any money from her (except once inadvertently), but he just liked to protect her. On cross-examination he was unable to recall or remember many of the incriminating statements he had <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>made to the district attorney or to the assistant district attorney. A reading of the record demonstrates beyond any possible doubt that the jury could have found that he was an evasive, lying witness.</p>
    <p id="b678-4" data-blocks='[["BL_678.4",678,[238,593,1151,1129]]]'>Defendant’s highly technical argument amounts to this: Unless the Commonwealth proves that the intention to commit a robbery was formed before the beginning of the fatal assault, the evidence cannot amount to a murder which was committed in the perpetration of a robbery. In other words, defendant would require a televised stop-watch in every robbery or felony-killing to prove that the felonious intent existed before the attack. It is rare, we repeat, that a criminal telephones or telegraphs his criminal intent and consequently such intent can be properly found by the jury from the facts and circumstances in a particular case. In the instant case the facts and circumstances, particularly defendant’s belligerently expressed intent to get the money (to which he said he was entitled) out of Querey, followed by his use of force to obtain it, were amply sufficient to justify a jury in finding the necessary criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no authority to support defendant’s proposition — indeed there are two authorities, although none are needed, to the contrary.</p>

In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Homeyer, <a href="/pa/373/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="373 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1240350" data-case-paths="/pa/373/0150-01">373 Pa. 150</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.2d%20743" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="94 A.2d 743">94 A. 2d 743</a>, defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree (with penalty of death) upon proof that the head of his wife had been severed from her body and encased in concrete in the cellar of defendant’s home. Defendant testified that his wife had been taking sleeping pills for 5 years because of sickness and high blood pressure, and that on her birthday he went to a store to purchase a cake for her. When he returned he found her dead on their bedroom floor. Defendant testified that on the floor by her side he <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>found one sleeping pill and an empty bottle which had contained twenty sleeping pills. Eighteen such pills would have been a fatal dosage to a person in the physical condition of Hannah Homeyer. He further testified that upon discovering his wife’s body he was seized with panic and in order to avoid responsibility for her death, decided to dispose of her remains, which he did by dismembering her body and burning certain portions of it. In that case defendant contended that the Commonwealth failed to prove either a preconceived intent or any crime whatsoever. Defendant’s conviction was sustained. That case also reiterated the well settled principle (1) that the fabrication of false and contradictory statements by an accused criminal and (2) flight, are evidence from which a.jury can find a guilty intent or, as the case may be, a felonious act.</p>

As the victim lay on the ground, defendant took money from his pockets, but he claimed he never intended to do this until after the victim was lying unconscious or dead. The Court in sustaining a conviction of murder in the first degree with penalty of death, said (page 321) : “. . . The defendant’s argument that the intention to rob originated subsequent to the assault upon the deceased need not be seriously considered in view of the verdict of the jury. Moreover, even though such were the case, it- is immaterial when the design to rob was conceived, if the homicide occurred while defendant was perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery. Where the killing occurs in the perpetration of any of the crimes specifically named in the statute referred to, the intent to kill is immaterial. Such considerations do not affect the situ<a id="p660" href="#p660" data-label="660" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*660</a>ation here presented because the circumstances leading up to the attack on Doyle indicate an assault with an intent to rob, ...”</p>

Defendant at first refused counsel but subsequently changed his mind and requested the Court to appoint as his counsel Armin Friedman. Friedman, who was an able, experienced lawyer in the county of trial, was appointed by the Court more than four weeks prior to trial. He saw the defendant every, day from that time until trial. Two or three days before trial H. David Rothman, an attorney, sought to become counsel, allegedly at defendant’s request. The Court appointed Rothman as an investigator to assist Friedman. Rothman then asked for a continuance, which the Court refused because counsel of defendant’s choice had been appointed by the Court over four weeks prior to trial. Rothman contends that Friedman did not interview a number of witnesses whom he should have interviewed — this was disputed — and disagreed with Friedman about several trial tactics. These facts, without more, are neither a sufficient reason for continuance, nor for the grant of a new trial. Succeeding or other counsel, especially where defendant has been convicted (or lost his case) can always discover tactical or strategical or other errors which he believes his predecessor (or superior or associate) counsel had committed. If that were sufficient ground for a new trial there would never be an end of litigation. A defendant in a capital case is entitled to assistance of counsel at all stages of the proceedings, including the right to counsel of his choice, if the request is timely made and the accused is <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>willing to pay such counsel. However, when an accused is unable to engage and pay tbe cost and expense of a counsel of bis choice or does not desire or, for any reason, is unable to do so, the 'Court will appoint, <em>in its discretion, </em>proper counsel for bim, and that right and power in tbe Court will not be cause for reversal unless tbe appointment constituted a palpable abuse of discretion.</p>

    <p id="b683-5" data-blocks='[["BL_683.6",683,[183,1334,1147,764]]]'>The gist of this contention is that the assistant .district attorney in obtaining a confession of the robbery had lulled defendant into a sensé of security by not explaining to him the felony-murder doctrine. Defendant had previously voluntarily confessed the robbery and the assault to the district attorney and he knew he was being charged with robbery and murder. He was offered counsel which, at that time, he refused; he was advised of his rights and was warned that anything he said would be used against him. His confession to the assistant district attorney was the day after his confession to the district attorney. We have examined the record and are convinced that he was not over-reached by the assistant district attorney.</p>
