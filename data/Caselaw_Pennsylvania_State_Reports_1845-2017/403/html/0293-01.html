All the requirements of that Act, and particularly of §1108, and all the requirements of due process were complied with — Swingle received due notice with ample time to prepare his case and was accorded a hearing and was represented by counsel. He admitted the murder in New York. He presently contends that he could not be sentenced under the Habitual Offenders Act, but only under that section of The Penal Code under which he was illegally sentenced in 1949 and under the facts which were presented to jus<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>tify that illegal sentence. There is no merit in this contention. When this Court remanded the record to the Court below for imposition of a proper and legal sentence it did not restrict the Commonwealth to either the facts which were presented to the sentencing Court in 1949, nor to the section of the Code under which Swingle was illegally sentenced. The lower Court after hearing, imposed a sentence of 20 to 40 years under §1108(a) and (c) of The Penal Code, which, unlike §701, provides:</p>
