Defendant then, left his wife Avithout reasonable cause and moved to Philadelphia, where he lived until some time in. I960. Under agreement, he paid, her monthly |290 for two years and then |300 for two more. Since May 1, 1960, he has paid nothing and has left the Commonwealth.

Two banks and two stockbro<a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>kers were also joined as defendants but at tbe preliminary hearing counsel was satisfied that they had nothing belonging to defendant and discontinued the action against them.

This amendment added to section 1 of the Act of 1907 the phrase “the county where service may be had on the husband as in other actions at law or in equity” as a third locus of venue, and to section 2 the-phrase, in the provision for service, “as in other ■ actions, at law or in equity.” The phrases thus added clearly meld the venue provisions of the two sections, including the action in rem that is the subject of the Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 387, 12 PS §§1254 &amp; 1255, whose title refers to equity process “concerning property within the Jurisdiction of the Court, and on the Defendants not resident or found therein.” Thus we regard jurisdiction of the person as established by section 1 and jurisdiction of the <em>res </em>as established by section 2, with venue of the action established by both sections together in the county (a) where the desertion occurred, (b) where the wife and children reside, (c) where service can be had on the defendant as in other actions, at law or in equity, and (d) hence, since the action in rem under section 2 is “another action”, in the county where property is and the defendant is not.

It is important not to confuse jurisdiction and venue in this type of action. Nor need we concern ourselves with the situation in <em>Boudwin v. </em>Boudwin <a href="/pa/320/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="320 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="1163694" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0147-01">320 Pa. 147</a> (1936), <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20536" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="182 A. 536">182 A. 536</a>, where we held that .no order could be made against the nonresident defendant personally because the proceeding was strictly in rem; in the instant case the husband defendant has entered a general appearance and filed a pleading. See <em>Civera v. Civera, </em><a href="/pa-super/174/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="174 Pa. Super. 43" data-case-ids="718911" data-case-paths="/pa-super/174/0043-01">174 Pa.

    <p id="b662-7" data-blocks='[["BL_662.7",662,[219,1369,1150,869]]]'>I do not concur in the majority’s dictum interpreting Section 1 of the Act of 1907, as amended by the Act of 1955 (48 PS §§131, 132), which section the majority concedes gives the wife an equitable action in personam against the husband. The majority now limits the wife’s in personam action by denying her the right to proceed in the same action against the holders of her husband’s property and relegating such relief to a separate proceeding to enforce the in rem remedy provided for in Section 2. This misconstrues the Act. Since the legislature has given the wife recourse to an equitable proceeding our court should not restrict the method by which she exercises her newly acquired rights, nor limit the type of remedy she might pursue in order to obtain full satisfaction. Hence, I concur in the result only.</p>
