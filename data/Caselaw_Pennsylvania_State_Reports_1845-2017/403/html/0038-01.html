The bonds stood in their joint names, alternatively, and were kept in a safety deposit box to which both had access.</p>
    <p id="b59-13" data-blocks='[["BL_59.20",59,[175,2269,1142,99]],["BL_60.1",60,[238,346,1146,871]]]'>During the late autumn of 1956 defendant redeemed all but $3000 of the bonds and put $2500 of it <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>into a new safety deposit box standing in Ms name only. Plaintiff has the remaining $500 of these bonds. In the spring of 1959 defendant withdrew all but a few dollars of the three bank accounts and shortly after opened two savings accounts in his name alone: into one of these he put $6,069.90, with $246.45 interest, in trust for his two sons, and in the other he put $5,606.07, of which he later withdrew $5000 and put it in his checking account. These two sums represent the proceeds of his redemption of the Series E bonds. At trial he had $1200 left of the $5000 in his account. Since the separation defendant paid $750 out of entireties money for taxes on the real estate. Admittedly, only these taxes were used for the joint benefit of the parties out of the money appropriated by defendant.</p>
    <p id="b60-5" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[236,1236,1145,316]]]'>Plaintiff began this action in equity to compel defendant to account for the bonds and savings accounts and to pay one-half of them to her.

He bases this argument upon the word ing of 31 C.F.R. 313.60(a), that “. . . upon payment to either co-owner, the other co-owner shall cease to have any interest in the bond.” We fail to follow. The regulations are designed to protect the government rather than to control the relationship between co-owners, and are silent on the right of either to possession in a contest: see <em>Horstman Estate, </em><a href="/pa/398/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="398 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1289092" data-case-paths="/pa/398/0506-01">398 Pa. 506</a> (1960), <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20514" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="159 A.2d 514">159 A. 2d 514</a>.

    <p id="b61-5" data-blocks='[["BL_61.4",61,[181,739,1150,1150]]]'>In <em>Ealstrick </em>the court correctly said: “It will thus be observed that, where a husband purchases savings bonds, series E, in his name and that of his wife, as co-owner, under the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, there is created an estate involving unity of interest, title, time and possession, with the right of survivorship, and it has been held under our State laws that where property is so taken and held, that is, in the name of husband and wife, or husband or wife, where these unities are present, the estate thus created is one by entireties: Klenke’s Estate No. 1, <a href="/pa/210/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="210 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="937873" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0572-01">210 Pa. 572</a> (1905); O’Malley v.

The incidents of ownership of the bonds by the husband and wife, as co-owners, laid down in the Federal regulations are the same as those which create an estate by the entireties in our State law, and there is nothing in holding that the husband and wife own the property as tenants by the entire-ties which runs counter to the Federal regulations. The Federal regulations stop short of determining the interest and ownership as between co-owners.”</p>

Berhalter, </em>supra (<a href="/pa/315/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="315 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1156634" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0225-01">315 Pa. 225</a>); <em>Werle v.

This in turn makes the wife’s share her separate property and brings the case within the exception to the Married Women’s Property Act of June S, 1893, P.L. 344, 48 PS §111, which provides that a married woman “may not sue her husband, except in ... a proceeding to protect and recover her separate property.”</p>

In <em>Watkins </em>there were four bank accounts, and the Court, we affirming, ordered all four divided although funds from only two had been diverted by the defendant husband. The Court said: “Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the policy of the Berhalter case to require plaintiff to wait until funds also are diverted from the two hitherto unwithdrawn accounts before suing to protect her interest in them.”</p>
    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.6",62,[230,2272,1141,103]],["BL_63.1",63,[174,341,1146,321]]]'>Defendant contends that his capture of the funds was with plaintiff’s consent, but the court’s finding, <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>which is supported by the record, is that she did not consent. The Chancellor also found no direct evidence of bad faith but did find that defendant’s actions and the enveloping circumstances give clear and indubitable proof of it. With these conclusions, after a careful perusal of the record, we are in full accord.</p>
    <p id="b63-4" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[172,673,1149,1644]]]'>Finally, defendant argues that he is entitled to more credits than the Chancellor allowed him, namely, those between 1956, when he began to cash in the bonds, and 1958, when plaintiff began suit. The argument has surface plausibility, for if the law creates a contract to dissolve the estate by the entireties, however fictionally, it cannot be fictionally complete until a fictional offer has been fictionally accepted. It is unnecessary to decide this intriguing question, however, since defendant has not proved that he made the payments for which he claims credits out Of the funds that he appropriated, and it is doubtful that he even proved making the expenditures at all. He had the burden of proof, and he failed to carry it. In <em>Glazer v. Kurman, </em><a href="/pa/384/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="384 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1263166" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0283-01">384 Pa. 283</a> (1956), <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="120 A.2d 892">120 A. 2d 892</a>, defendant mingled partnership funds with his own and in various ways breached his fiduciary duty as a partner. We held that all financial ambiguities should be resolved against him. In his adjudication in the instant case the Chancellor said: “This record is replete with inconsistencies, evasions and contradictions. The only witness who testified was the defendant, first, when called as on cross-examination by the plaintiff, and then in his own behalf. His arrogance and domineering attitude on the stand, his ineffectual attempts to exculpate himself and his mingling of the entireties funds with his own, lead to but one conclusion. He had resolved to get control of this property for his own benefit and to keep his wife from sharing it in any way.”</p>
