This is the narrow question for decision in this case.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.9",243,[162,999,1148,930]]]'>The issue arises out of an automobile accident wherein the negligence of both the appellant and the appellee allegedly resulted in injury to the person and damage to the property of innocent third parties. The appellant settled with the aggrieved persons before the entry of suit and, in consideration, gained a release of all claims against both tortfeasors. In this case, he seeks contribution from the appellee for one-half of the amount paid in settlement. The lower court sustained preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer and entered judgment for the defendant. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. The rationale of both decisions is that before a tortfeasor may seek contribution by a separate suit in assumpsit, the basis for such action must be predicated on liability for the wrong established by a judgment.</p>

In addition, a reading of the act signifies <em>that only two conditions </em>must exist before the right of contribution arises, namely, (1) that one joint tortfeasor has discharged the common liability or paid more than his pro rata share; (2) that the liability of the other joint tortfeasor to the injured persons has been extinguished by the settlement.

It was designed to effectuate a just result for all parties involved without undue delay and to stimulate and permit settlements of valid claims without expensive and time-consuming litigation. We note the following significant comment in Section 2(3) by the Commissioners of the Act (Note, 9 U. L. A. 236) : “Nobody would deny that payment of an injured person’s claim by one of the tortfeasors, <em>pursuant to a settlement instead of after judgment in a lawsuit, </em>should entitle the paying tortfeasor to recover contribution to his payment from other joint tortfeasors.”</p>
