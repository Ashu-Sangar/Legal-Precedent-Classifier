      <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>On October 22, 1957, the decedent, Andrew A. Kubacki, in possession of a license authorizing him to fish in the defendant’s Oanonsburg Water Dam No. 2, was found dead on the crusted area of a mud flat at the eastern section of that site. A lengthy drought in the summer of 1957 had reduced the water in the eastern section of the reservoir, by two-thirds and the muddy lake bottom, exposed to . the sun .and wind, became dry and baked to a crust with soft mud underneath. Cracks appeared on the crust, however, and reveáled the blue semi-liquid below. Decedent, wearing his fishing boots but leaving his fishing equipment in his automobile, entered the lake bed near the road where he had left his car with the motor running. His foot tracks showed that he walked- about 125 to 150 feet east, along the water’s edge, and then turned north and walked fifteen to twenty-five feet away from the water’s edge. At this’ point he broke- through the crust and could not extricate himself. No one. saw him getting into this difficulty and when his body was discovered he was on his back, one leg on top of the crust, having been pulled out of his fishing boot and the other leg remaining in its boot which was stuck in the mud. While there was a conflict as to the cause of death there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the plaintiff’s theory that death was caused by a cerebral hemorrhage precipitated by the fright and emotional distress arising from being bemired. The gravamen of plaintiff’s complaint is that defendant breached its duty to the decedent, a business visitor<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, by its failure to warn him of the peril incident to walking on-the encrusted quagmire. We do not feel, under these <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>particular circumstances,-.that defendant owed such a duty to decedent.</p>

He entered upon property replete with the dangers and uncertainties of land in an unimproved state. We cannot say that he expected or was entitled to receive the extent of preparation normally associated with improved property for it was the natural and unimproved state of the land that made the property attractive and beneficial to both fish and fisherman.</p>
