The book value of this company’s current assets, as alleged in the complaint, was about $8,500,000 and the market value of the stock “greatly in excess of $7,000,000”. Fraud and deception are alleged. In addition to the complaint,' answer, and interrogatories, extensive depositions were taken of the presidents of the two companies involved.</p>

Dyson’s Boston bank, to finance the purchase of the Hubbard Company’s stock and to hold it. The Corporation had no Pennsylvania office of its own, nor was it registered to do business in the Commonwealth. The plaintiff was a resident of Pittsburgh, and defendant Knowles was president of the Hubbard Company and son-in-law of defendant Gretchen Pack Bose. Mrs. Bose owned % of the Hubbard stock and Mrs. Williams., the plaintiff, owned %. These women were half-<a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>sisters and received their Hubbard stock from the Estate of John W. Hubbard. According to the complaint, Knowles brought Dyson into the picture, and together with Mrs. Rose induced Mrs. Williams, with Dyson’s knowledge and by fraud and artifice, to sign an option agreement for the sale of her stock. A Pittsburgh bank was made escrow agent, and the exercise of the option and sale of the stock were completed there.</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[193,806,1146,322]]]'>The money by which the Dyson Corporation made the purchase was borrowed from Dyson’s Boston bank through the Pittsburgh bank as escrow agent, and the Hubbard Company then borrowed enough to pay a dividend of $4,600,000 to its stockholder, the Dyson Corporation.</p>
    <p id="b643-6" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[192,1138,1147,486]]]'>The Hubbard Company had plant, machinery, and an office in Pittsburgh. Between September 28, 1954, and November 29, 1955, the appellant held four directors’ and stockholders’ meetings in Pittsburgh, and the Hubbard Company held two: corporate business was transacted at these meetings. Between 1954 and 1958 the Hubbard Company made advancements to the Dyson Corporation from funds in its Pittsburgh bank totalling $1,585,000.</p>

It seems obvious that he dominated both companies. Knowles, a Dyson director, lived in Pennsylvania and acted as President of the Hubbard Company in its Pittsburgh office. Billock, Treasurer of Dyson, acted similarly from 1955 to 1958. The Dyson Corporation had no payroll of its own before October, 1958, and all salaries were paid by Hubbard from Pittsburgh for work done there. From 1954 to 1956 both companies had the same directors. And since Dyson owned all of Hubbard’s stock and since Hub<a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>bard was admittedly doing business in Pittsburgh until it moved out of the State, it is obvious that Dyson had valuable assets here.</p>

    <p id="b645-5" data-blocks='[["BL_645.4",645,[151,595,1153,1645]]]'>Appellant makes several arguments, such as that there was no “doing business” by appellant under the original or amended versions of the Act; that the fraud, if any there was, was done before appellant entered the State; that the separation between the two companies was scrupulously observed; and that due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is involved. It need only be mentioned en passant that from the record there is indication enough that the formation of the Dyson Corporation was part of the alleged fraud. A scrupulous separation of corporate identities may itself be an instrument of artifice. It also appears, prima facie, that the companies were operating in Pennsylvania under the Business Corporation Law and that the Dyson Corporation was served at least under Section 1011(B) thereof. It is not necessary that the preliminary evidence cover the entire case; it suffices that enough appear to carry the burden of preliminary persuasion. We now pass on no more than what is needful to ensure a full exploration of the facts by trial; what may appear belongs to a future day. But we are clear that jurisdiction adequately appears under the Act because of the activities of these closely related companies within Pennsylvania at the time pertinent to the alleged fraud. This doing business within the State satisfies the Fourteenth Amendment, and each case must rest on its own facts: <em>Shambe v. Delaware &amp; Hudson R.R.
