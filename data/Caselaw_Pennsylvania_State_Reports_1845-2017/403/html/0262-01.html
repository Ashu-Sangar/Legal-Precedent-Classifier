Their principal objective was to rob the Sehlosses, who were each 65 years of age. Melton grabbed Schloss and brutally and mercilessly beat Mm on his head with a hatchet and various large pieces of brass pipe — the blood was spattered on the floor, the walls and even the ceiling. Defendant went into another room, knocked Mrs. Schloss to the ground, stamped several times on her face with Ms heel, beat her into unconsciousness and then stabbed her in several parts of her body with a long boning knife, which he left in her body. She died from these knife wounds. Without further detail it will suffice to say that it was one of the most brutal, vicious, merciless, unnecessary and inhuman killings ever committed. It was not only committed in the perpetration of a robbery, <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>but it was also a willful, deliberate and premeditated murder.

We have expressly decided this question adversely to defendants. The murder was committed, tbe verdict of tbe jury was rendered, and tbe judgment of sentence was entered prior to tbe Act of December 1, 1959 — tbe split verdict Act — and that statute will not be applied retroactively: <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Scoleri, <a href="/pa/399/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1290525" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0110-01">399 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="160 A.2d 215">160 A. 2d 215</a>.</p>

The Judge charged the jury, in material part, as follows: “The defendant has not seen fit to produce any evidence- in answer to the charge of the Commonwealth, and in answer to the evidence produced by the Commonwealth. It is the law, and I so charge you, that the fact that the defendant does not go on the stand is not to be taken and considered as any evidence of guilt, <em>or to be taken and considered as anything against him whatsoever. </em>When the General Evidence Act of 1887 was passed ... it was provided ... ‘Nor may the neglect or refusal of the defendant actually on trial in a criminal court to offer himself as a witness be treated as <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>creating any presumption against Mm, or be <em>adversely </em>referred to by court or counsel during the trial.’ I want you to know that.”</p>
