The Commission shall not consider an application for a license “until a majority of the electorate of the county in which the racing plant is located shall have voted in favor of locating a racing plant within the county” at a primary election. Such an election shall be conducted when at least 5,000 registered electors of any county petition the Commission therefor. The Act imposes a 5 percent tax upon the admission price of tickets to harness race meetings and a 5 percent tax upon the amount wagered through pari mutuel betting. All moneys received by the Commonwealth under the provisions of the Act shall be paid into a special State Harness Racing Fund. After the payment of expenses incurred by the Commission, including salaries of the employees thereof, three-fourths of the remaining <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>moneys shall be paid into the General Fund of the Commonwealth.

Nothing in the Harness Racing Act prevents such counties from becoming members of the class having more than 5000 registered voters. All that is required is that their population and registered electors increase to the required minimum number. Such a classification is not lacking in uniformity. Indeed this section of the constitution recognizes classification as to cities ...
