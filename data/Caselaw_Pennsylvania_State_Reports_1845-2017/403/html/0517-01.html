Grier who died resident in Philadelphia on June 13, 1958, at the age of 87. Mr. Grier had never married and left to survive him as his heirs at law and next of kin three cousins, two on his maternal side and one paternal. For 67 years he had been a member of the bar of Philadelphia County and, in the practice of his profession, had acquired a reputation as a specialist in probate and orphans’ court matters. His will is typewritten, the typing evidently being his own work. The validity of the will is undisputed. The sole question of law involved is as to the quantum of the decedent’s estate made subject to his testamentary dispositions.</p>

This is evident from the fact that the type in the last specification is lighter in shade than the preceding typing and the left-hand margin is indented by the width of three type spaces beyond the margin established when the will was originally written. There is also a deviation of two type spaces in the marginal indentation of the three named beneficiaries immediately preceding the last one. It is possible, therefore, that those three specifications were also typed in the blank space subsequent to the testator’s <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>execution of the will as originally written.

On exceptions to the decree nisi entered by the auditing judge, the court en banc reversed and substituted the final decree now here on appeal. This decree, instead of awarding the “residue” of the decedent’s estate after payment of “all debts, inheritance taxes and the like” to the testamentarily named beneficiaries, restricts the distribution to them to the specified sums of the monetary allocations. The result is an intestacy as to four-fifths of the decedent’s estate available for distribution and, this, the court awarded to the testator’s three cousins. The maternal cousins, as already stated, are among the named beneficiaries in the will. But, the testator bequeathed nothing to his paternal cousin whom he had neither seen nor heard of for years, according to the evidence adduced at the audit. The testator’s deliberate intent to exclude that cousin from sharing in the distribution of his estate could hardly be more evident.</p>

Authority for that fundamental rule of construction hardly needs citation.</p>

On the other hand, if percentages or fractions were used to designate the beneficiaries’ respective interests in the “residue” for distribution, every time the testator wanted to add a beneficiary he would have to rewrite his will because of the necessity of making a change in all of the other percentages or fractions.

    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[254,985,1151,1300]]]'>This case bears a certain analogy to cases of lapsed or void legacies. Any lapsed or void legacy, bequeathed to a person not within the statutorily specified consanguineous relationship, falls into the residue and passes to the residuary legatees “in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue.” See Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, §14(10), 20 PS §180.14(10). This provision of the Wills Act of 1947 is not presently applicable, but it would have been had one of the individual beneficiaries died or one or more of the corporate beneficiaries ceased to operate and dissolved prior to the testator’s death. The situation obtaining in the instant case is not different in principle. Here, there was a monetarily unallocated portion of the “residue” of the decedent’s estate for distribution, as defined by Item One of his will. Only by dividing such residual balance among the named beneficiaries in proportion to their respective interests, as fixed by the decedent’s own testamentary apportionment, could Ms executors carry out the plainly expressed mandate of Ms will. The monetarily unallocated balance of the “residue” was a necessary incident of the testator’s scheme for the distribution of Ms entire net estate to Ms beneficiaries.</p>

By placing one unwarranted <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>inference upon another, the lower court brought about a result which is a complete negation of the testator’s pervading intent, that the <em>residue </em>of his converted personal property, after payment of all debts and taxes, should be distributed <em>to and among </em>his named beneficiaries. The course pursued by the court below to reach its result was, first, to impute to the testator, who was concededly well versed in probate nomenclature, a corrupted use óf the word “residue” in the dispositive provision of Item One, and then to infer from this assumption that the testator did not mean the word “residue” to embrace the entire balance of his converted personalty after payment of all debts and taxes as he provided in Item One. In so doing, the court ignored the well-established rule that “In construing a will technical words must ordinarily be given their legal effect since it must be presumed that they were intentionally and intelligently employed: [citing cases].” <em>Baldwin Estate, <a href="/pa/377/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="377 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="1249562" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0268-01">377 </a></em><a href="/pa/377/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="377 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="1249562" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0268-01">Pa. 268</a>, 273, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%2052" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="105 A.2d 52">105 A. 2d 52</a>.

This assumption plainly begged the question for decision. The court’s problem was to interpret the will so as to give effect to, and harmonize, all of its parts in order to effectuate, if possible, the testator’s intent. As lately recognized in <em>O’Brien Estate, </em><a href="/pa/381/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="381 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1258832" data-case-paths="/pa/381/0322-01">381 Pa. 322</a>, 325-326, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.2d%20178" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="112 A.2d 178">112 A. 2d 178</a>, “It is hornbook law that a testator’s intention must be ascertained from a consideration of the entire will; and that <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>every clause and every word of a will must be construed together and given effect if that is reasonably possible; and that a clause will not be considered inconsistent or repugnant to other provisions of the will if it can reasonably be construed in a manner consistent with the other provisions of the will: [citing cases].”</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[213,751,1153,1462]]]'>Having thus concluded that there existed a different residue than what had been disposed of by the testator’s order and direction to his executors in Item One, the court below then drew the further unsupportable inference that the purpose of the blank space was to enable the testator to type therein later an additional residuary clause, which he never did. There is nothing written or intrinsic in the will to justify such an inference. The only permissible inference to be drawn from the will, itself, as to the purpose of the blank space, is that the testator could later type therein the names of additional beneficiaries with monetary allocations to each, just as he unquestionably did in at least one instance. That is the only fact from which any inference as to the purpose of the blank space can justifiably be drawn. All else is mere guess or speculation. Inferring without basis that “This aged man either wholly forgot to complete his will [by filling in the blank space with a further residuary clause] or died before he made up his mind with finality”, the court en banc gave controlling effect to the blank space, where obviously <em>nothing </em>is expressed, rather than to what the written words of the will plainly import, viz., that what remained of his estate’s converted personality “after all debts, inheritance taxes and the like have been fully paid”, should be distributed “to and among” his named beneficiaries.</p>
    <p id="b546-6" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[210,2233,1147,210]],["BL_547.1",547,[151,372,1150,1851]]]'>The opinion for the court below further argues that, since the will provides in the case of each of the monetary allocations that it should be “free of taxes and absolutely”, the only funds with which the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>inheritance and estate taxes could be paid would be the portion of the decedent’s estate remaining “after the payments of debts, taxes and the other pecuniary legacies”. This argument completely overlooks the provision in Item One of the will that “all debts, inheritance taxes and the like” were first to be paid out of the funds realized from the sale of the decedent’s personal property. The reason for the specific inclusion of a tax free provision in the case of each of the monetary allocations is not difficult to perceive. It was included in order to preserve intact the proportional amounts of the allocated interests in the decedent’s estate. Otherwise, the proportions might have been changed by possible apportionment of estate taxes or by relief of the charities from the Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax liability which actually did occur a little later. At the time of the execution of the will on May 7, 1955, charities were not so exempt; however, they did become exempt by virtue of the Act of May 28, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1757, which took effect on June 1, 1957. But, the bequests to the individual beneficiaries have never been so exempted. If the testator had not attached the tax free provision to each of the monetary allocations, by the time of his death the bequests to the individuals would have been chargeable with their pro rata share of such taxes and their interests in the “residue” proportionate to the charities’ interests would have been lessened by so much. The provisions in the will securing to each of the beneficiaries complete freedom from liability for inheritance or estate taxes preserved to all alike their proportional interests in the “residue” for distribution on the basis of the monetary allocations as fixed by the testator in his will.</p>

Even more important the presumption relied upon by the majority is overcome completely by the testator’s clear language of a specific pecuniary <em>dollar gift </em>which cannot be distorted into a “percentage” gift. Even a layman, let alone an experienced probate lawyer, knows that there is a tremendous difference between a legacy of $10,000 or $5,000 or $100 and a <em>percentage </em>of l/10th of 1%, 10%, 5%, etc.</p>

There is nothing uncertain about a direction to sell all personal property “and after all debts, inheritance taxes and the like have been fully paid, to distribute the residue to and among the following named persons and/or corporations”, naming four persons, one twice, and twenty-three charitable corporations. There is nothing uncertain about his putting a definite bequest in dollars after each name, plus the legend: “free of all taxes, and absolutely.”</p>

    <p id="b550-6" data-blocks='[["BL_550.6",550,[248,1571,1145,318]]]'>This was the whole will. Looked at flat as a plate, it needs no construction or inferential interpretation. With a will that leaves part undisposed of, the law is that the remnant is an intestacy and passes to the next of kin under the Intestate Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 80, 20 P.S. §1.1 et seq.</p>

The Majority says that “the testator’s . . . intent to exclude that cousin . . . could hardly be more evident.” I see nothing evident about it: there may be a handful of reasons to explain the cousin’s absence. Why should we guess at intention when the will, as a fact, is clear and no word within it needs <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>interpretation? The testator did what he did, and we must judge the paper fact exactly as it lies.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[120,470,1155,1202]]]'>The clearest tell-tale that the will has no residue is the legend that each bequest shall be free of tax. A lawyer expert in probate law must know that taxes are to be paid out of something, and that the residue. The twenty-eight specific legatees are effectively separated by the legend from any residuary provision; the tax is passed along to someone not named as residuary legatee, and the specific bequests are not to be reduced by their proportionate shares of what has already been paid in taxes. They are as separate from the residue as if they had appeared in an item by themselves. The testator has made twenty-eight specific bequests and no residual disposition whatever beyond a direction to pay the tax. Had he added one name to take all that was left and added the same legend, all twenty-nine legatees would have had to share the tax; in such case the tax-free legend would mean nothing. Had he added one name without the tax-free legend, that person would have born the entire tax and taken the entire balance. Had Item 1 contained only two names, each to receive $100, it is unthinkable that they would take the whole residue of about $800,000.</p>

The law has created its own compromise of myriad shadings of such facts by making the undisposed of remnant an intestacy. After all, the testator let his will sit and even republished it to include a new executor.</p>

But it cites no authority for any artful meaning of the words. Actually, they aren’t relevant and don’t affect the case, since there is no effective residue to which the words can apply, and the phrase in question therefore applies to nothing. The testator had not begun to make his actual residual dispositions. Why is it odd <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>or forced that he should list everyone he could think of as a special donee and he satisfied that the rest, minus the tax, should go to his kin? It may be asked why he included two of his three cousins among the twenty-eight legatees, and the answer is of course that no one knows, but that it is as convenient to assume that the testator put them there until he had completed his thought as it is to assume that he wanted them to share but the third cousin not.</p>

Moreover, a presumption is of use only when there is need for it. It fills a gap, as Nature does a vacuum. This testator may well have intended to leave twenty-eight specific bequests and let the intestate law dispose of the rest. This is an obvious testamentary scheme for an expert lawyer and comes nearer to being his obvious intention, since nothing need be done by way of interpretation to reach it, than does another solution that requires artificial rules.</p>
