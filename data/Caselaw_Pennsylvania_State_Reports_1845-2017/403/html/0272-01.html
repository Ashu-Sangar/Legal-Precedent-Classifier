    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.9",294,[254,904,1146,695]]]'>The County of Allegheny appealed to the court below the viewers’ award of $14,560 in favor of the plaintiffs as damages for a taking by the county of the property of the plaintiffs for highway improvement. The county denied liability on the ground that the statute of limitations was a bar to the plaintiffs’ claim. The mattér was submitted to the court below on a case stated whereon the hearing judge, adopting the county’s contention, entered a compulsory nonsuit which the court en banc later refused to- take off. From the ensuing judgment in favor of the county, the plaintiffs have appealed, their right so to do having been reserved in the case stated.</p>

Lebanon, Upper St. Clair and Scott. The plan attached to the grand jury report, which was placed of record, showed the property of the plaintiffs’ predecessor in title as abutting on Bower Hill Road for a distance of 100 feet. The plan established center line elevations for the road, inter alia, opposite the easterly and westerly corners of the property here in question and approximately midway between the indicated easterly and westerly elevations. <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>The plan did not provide for any slope easement over or upon the property.</p>
    <p id="b295-4" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[152,477,1153,702]]]'>On October 19, 1926, the plaintiffs’ predecessor in title obtained a building permit for the erection of a dwelling house and garage on the property. The rough-in phase of the work of constructing the house and garage was completed by December 19, 1926. Pursuant to a contract let by the County of Allegheny on November 16, 1926, a paved cartway 18 feet wide was constructed in 1927 along the center line of the 60-foot right of way. In constructing the cartway, the contractor raised the center line elevations a number of feet higher than established by the recorded plan attached to the grand jury report approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions in 1925.</p>

    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[142,1376,1157,978]]]'>On January 7, 1958, subsequent to the purchase of the property by the plaintiffs, the Commissioners of Allegheny County adopted a resolution providing for the relocation, widening, altering, opening to variable widths, improving and reconstructing of a portion of Bower Hill Boad. This resolution was approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions on January 22, 1958. Beferred to in the resolution and attached thereto was a condemnation plan showing an irregular slope easement of 550 square feet on the plaintiffs’ property abutting on the 60-foot right of way. Pursuant to this resolution the County widened the cartway of Bower Hill Boad from 18 to 44 feet and the Township of Mt. Lebanon entered upon the right of way and constructed sidewalks 7 feet in width together with curbs on either side of the paved roadway. The slope easement rwas utilized to support Bower Hill Boad as widened and improved.</p>

    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[270,860,1148,475]]]'>The floor of the plaintiffs’ garage, which, it will be recalled, was constructed in 1926, is at an elevation ;of approximately 8 feet below the grade of Bower Hill Road as constructed pursuant to the widening and improvement resolution of 1958. Prior thereto, access to Bower Hill Road from the garage was had by crossing the unimproved portion of the 60-foot right of way. However, such access is no longer available since the construction work of 1958.</p>
    <p id="Ajm" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[265,1355,1150,702]]]'>The plaintiffs concede that any claim for damages resulting from the establishment of the 60-foot right of way, provided for in the condemnation plan of 1925, or that may have arisen from the construction of the 18-foot cartway in 1927 at elevations higher than were designated on the condemnation plan of 1925, is barred ■by the statute of limitations. What they do contend for is a right to damages due to the increased elevations above those shown on the plan of 1925 along a portion of the road outside of the previously improved 18-foot cartway and for the taking of 550 square feet of their property for slope easement necessary for the lateral support of Bower Hill Road as widened in 1958.</p>

    <p id="b297-3" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[169,746,1153,1364]]]'>When there has been a taking of a landowner’s property by condemnation, he is entitled to a board of view for the assessment of his damage for the property so appropriated. A “taking” occurs when an entity clothed with the power of eminent domain condemns property in accordance with a statutorily authorized procedure or when such an empowered entity substantially deprives the owner of the beneficial use of his property. <em>Griggs v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/402/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="402 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="1296726" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0411-01">402 Pa. 411</a>, 414, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20123" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="168 A.2d 123">168 A. 2d 123</a> (1961). In the instant case the change in the grade of Bower Hill Road from what the condemnation plan of 1925 provided for was not the subject of any statutorily authorized condemnation procedure until 1958; nor was the owner of the property in question substantially deprived of the beneficial use of his property .because of any change in the elevation of the portion of the 60-foot right of way lying outside of the 18-foot paved cartway, constructed in 1927, until such change was actually made pursuant to the resolution approved by the Court of Quarter Sessions of January 22, 1958. Consequently, no right to petition for the assessment of damages for the taking occasioned by the change in grade of the 60-foot right of way outside of the 18-foot paved cartway accrued to the abutting property owners until 1958.</p>

Superior Ct. 130</a> (1914), the defendant borough changed the grade of the middle 21 feet of the cartway of a street; the sidewalks and about 4 feet of the width of the cart-way next to the sidewalks abutting each side of the street remained at the former level. The plaintiff, an abutting landowner, was awarded the sum that his property would have been damaged had the entire street been graded down to the level of the middle 21-foot cartway. The Superior Court, however, reversed the judgment for the property owner declaring that “If the borough at some future time, in pursuance of proper municipal action, proceeds to reduce these sidewalks to the grade of the cartway, and an injury results to abutting property, the right to recover for that injury will be in the parties who own the property at the time it occurs: [citing cases].”</p>

Superior Ct. 283</a> (1915), involved a claim for damages due to the reconstruction and improvement of a street which had had an established right of way of 150 feet but had been opened only to a width of 80 feet. A city ordinance, designed to eliminate a railroad grade crossing, provided for the lowering of the 80-foot roadway which had béen opened. The plaintiff, an abutting property owner, asked for damages for a change of grade of the entire 150-foot right of way. The Superior Court held, however, that the owner was entitled to damages only for the lowering of the elevations of the 80-foot cartway saying (at p. 290), “the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the actual grading that has been done and , . . if the city hereafter should grade the <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>remainder of the street, he, or the party then having the title, might recover damages and the record of the present proceeding could not be offered in bar of such action.”</p>

But, in that case, the defendant township filed with the board of view a condemnation plan showing a change of grade, by means of cuts and fills, to the full 50-foot width of the street.</p>

Later the borough by ordinance lowered the elevation of that portion of the right of way outside of the township road to the level of the township road. Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioned for the appointment of a board of view to assess damages for the “excavation and change of grade.” We affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff, holding that “If she has been damaged by this change of the natural grade of the street, as it existed at the time she purchased the property . . . her right to recover is not open to question: [citing cases].”</p>
