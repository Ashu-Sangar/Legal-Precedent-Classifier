The trial court overruled the defendant’s demurrer to the Commonwealth’s evidence and, after verdict, denied his motion in arrest of judgment. On appeal from the judgment of sentence entered on the jury’s verdict, the Superior Court affirmed. We granted allocatur because of the important question present as to whether the defendant’s unlawful and reckless conduct was a sufficiently direct cause of the death to warrant his being charged with criminal homicide.</p>

L. 905, as amended. In fact, it may be noted, in passing, that the Act of January 8, 1960, P. L. (1959) 2118, §3, 75 PS §1041, amending The Vehicle Code of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, 75 PS §101 et seq., makes automobile racing on a highway an independent crime punishable by fine or imprisonment or both up to $500 and three years in jail. As the highway racing in the instant case occurred prior to the enactment of the Act of 1960, cit. supra, that statute is, of course, not presently applicable. In any event, unlawful or reckless conduct is only one ingredient of the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Another essential and distinctly separate element of the crime is that the unlawful or reckless conduct charged to the defendant was the <em>direct </em>cause of the death in issue. The first ingredient is obviously present in this case but, just as plainly, the second is not.</p>

When proximate cause was first borrowed from the field of tort law and applied to homicide prosecutions in Pennsylvania, the concept connoted a much more direct causal relation in producing the alleged culpable result than it does today. Proximate cause, as an essential element of a tort founded in negligence, has undergone in recent times, and is still undergoing, a marked extension. More specifically, this area of civil law has been progressively liberalized in favor of claims for damages for personal injuries to which careless conduct of others can in some way be associated. To persist in applying the tort liability concept of proximate cause to prosecutions for criminal homicide after the marked expansion of <em>civil </em>liability of defendants in tort actions <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>for negligence would be to extend possible <em>criminal </em>liability to persons chargeable with unlawful or reckless conduct in circumstances not generally considered to present the likelihood of a resultant death.</p>

Commonwealth v. Almeida, <a href="/pa/362/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="362 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="477368" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0596-01">362 Pa. 596</a>, 603, 611, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.2d%20595" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="68 A.2d 595">68 A. 2d 595</a> (1949).” It is indeed strange that the <em>Almeida </em>case should have been cited as authority for the above quoted statement; the rationale of the <em>Almeida </em>case was flatly rejected by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Redline, </em><a href="/pa/391/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="391 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1276839" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0486-01">391 Pa. 486</a>, 504-505, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20472" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="137 A.2d 472">137 A. 2d 472</a> (1958), where we held that the tort liability concept of proximate cause is not a proper criterion of causation in a criminal homicide case. True enough, <em>Commonwealth v. Redline </em>was a murder case, but the distinction between murder and involuntary manslaughter does not rest upon a differentiation in causation; it lies in the state of mind of the offender. If one kills with malice aforethought, he is chargeable with murder; and if death, though unintentional, results directly from his unlawful or reckless conduct, he is chargeable with involuntary manslaughter. In either event, the accused is not guilty unless his conduct was a cause of death sufficiently direct as to meet the requirements of the <em>criminal, </em>and not the <em>tort, </em>law.</p>

In the <em>Levin </em>case two cars were racing on the streets of Philadelphia at speeds estimated at from 85 to 95 miles per hour. The defendant’s car, in the left-hand lane, was racing alongside of the car in which the deceased was a passenger when the defendant turned his automobile sharply to the right in front of the other car, thereby causing the driver of the latter car to lose control and smash into a tree, the passenger being thrown to the road and killed as a result of the impact. It is readily apparent that the elements of causation in the <em>Levin </em>case were fundamentally different from those in the present case. Levin’s act of cutting his automobile sharply in front of the car in which the deceased was riding directly forced that car off of the road and into the tree. The defendant’s reckless and unlawful maneuver was the direct cause of the crucial fatality. In the instant case, the defendant’s conduct was not even remotely comparable. Here, the action of the deceased driver in recklessly and suicidally swerving his car to the left lane of a 2-lane highway into the path of an oncoming truck was not forced upon him by any act of the defendant; it was done by the deceased and by him alone, who thus directly brought about his own demise. The <em>Levin </em>case was properly decided but it cannot, by any ratiocination, be utilized to justify a conviction in the present case.</p>

This is especially necessary because the tests for involuntary manslaughter, particularly in cases arising out of automobile accidents, have been different and varying in the Superior Court and in the lower Courts, with no clear standard. This was due to an attempt by these Courts to apply a proper test to the different circumstances of each particular case. For example the following tests have been applied by the Superior Court: Rash or reckless conduct; proximate cause; legal cause; substantial factor; natural and probable consequence such as should have been foreseen; efficient cause; concurring cause; must be more than remote cause — substantial factor; natural result or probable consequence.</p>

Racing an automobile at 90 miles per hour, trying to prevent another automobile going in the same direction from passing him, in a no-passing zone on a two-lane public highway, is certainly all of that. Admittedly also, there can be more than one direct cause of an unlawful death. To me, this is self-evident.

That the victim’s response was normal under the circumstances, that his reaction should have been expected and was clearly foreseeable, is to me beyond argument.

Quite to the contrary, both the facts and the law oppose it. The majority omits the pertinent part of the rule cited, at p. 364, the whole of which is as follows: “Where a second actor has become aware of the existence of a potential danger created by the negligence of an original tortfeasor, and thereafter, by an independent act of negligence, brings about an accident, the first tort-feasor is relieved of liability, because the condition created by <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>Mm was merely a circumstance of the accident and not its proximate cause. <em>Where, however, the second actor does not become apprised of such danger until his own negligence, added to that of the existing perilous condition, has made the accident inevitable, the negligent acts of the two tort-feasors are contributing causes and proximate factors in the happening of the accident and impose liability upon both of the guilty parties.” </em>The <em>KUne </em>case involved a truck, operated by Albert, which he abandoned on a highway without any lights to warn approaching motorists of the danger. Moyer drove down the highway and upon seeing the truck, failed to reduce Ms speed and went into the lane of oncoming traffic and crashed into Kline. This 'Court said, at p. 363, “It is clear that when an unlighted parked truck is seen by the operator of an approaching vehicle, the fact of its being unlighted becomes thereafter<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> of legal inconsequence, because the purpose of a light as warning has been otherwise accomplished. <em>If already at that time, by the negligence of its driver, the moving vehicle is in such a position and under such impetus that an accident cannot be avoided, the negligence of the truck owner is as much a proximate cause of the accident as is the negligence of the driver of the car; the negligence of each has contributed to the result. </em>But if, after seeing the unlighted truck, although he would still have been able to guide his car without accident, the driver proceeds in such negligent manner that an accident results, the original negligence of the truck owner has become a noncausal factor divested of legal significance; as to it the chain of causation is broken, and responsibility remains solely with the operator of the moving car.” Because the evidence was not undisputed that Moyer became aware of the presence of the abandoned truck on the highway in time to <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>stop, we stated that the question of causal connection was for the jury and not for the court as a matter of law. In the present case, there wasn’t any evidence that Hall saw the oncoming truck when he pulled out to pass Root. This would have been suicide, against which there is a presumption. II P.L.E. §21. The act of passing was not an “extraordinary negligent” act, but rather a “normal response” to the act of “racing.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> Furthermore, as Hall pulled out to pass, Root “dropped off” his speed to 90 miles an hour. Such a move probably prevented Hall from getting back into the right-hand lane since he was alongside of Root at the time and to brake the car at that speed would have been fatal to both himself and Root. Moreover, the dangerous condition of which the deceased had to become aware of before the defendant was relieved of his direct causal connection with the ensuing accident, was not the fact that the defendant was driving at an excessive rate of speed along the highway. He knew that when the race began many miles and minutes earlier. <em>The dangerous condition necessary was an awareness of the oncoming truclc and the fact that at the rate of speed Root was traveling he couldn’t safely pass him. </em>This important fact was not shown and, therefore, was a question for the fact-finders and not a question that could be decided as a matter of law.</p>

It is not essential to the existence of a causal relationship that the ultimate harm which has resulted was foreseen or intended by the actor. It is sufficient that the ultimate harm is one which a reasonable man would foresee as being reasonably related to the acts of the defendant.” Section 295, in speaking about manslaughter, says: “When homicide is predicated upon the negligence of the defendant, it must be shown that his negligence was the proximate cause or a contributing cause of the victim’s death. It must appear that the death was not the result of misadventure, but the natural and probable result of a reckless or culpably negligent act. To render a person criminally liable for neg<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>ligent homicide, the duty omitted or improperly performed must have been his personal duty, and the negligent act from which death resulted must have been his personal act, and not the act of another.

The force thus created must (a) have remained active itself or created another <em>force </em>which remained active until it directly caused the result; or (b) have created a new active <em>risk </em>of being acted upon by the active force that caused the result.” 2 Bishop, New Criminal Law §424 (19T3), says: “He whose act causes in any way, directly or indirectly, the death of another, hills him, within the meaning of felonious homicide. It is a rule of both reason and the law that whenever one’s will contributes to impel a physical force, whether another’s, his own, or a combined force, proceeding from whatever different sources, he is responsible for the result, the same as though his hand, unaided, had produced it.”</p>
