In construing a deed or a contract, certain general principles must be kept in mind. First, it is the intention of the parties at <em>the time of entering in thereto that governs, </em>and such intention is to be gathered from a reading of the entire contract: <em>P. M. &amp; Co. v. Stephano Bros., </em><a href="/pa/331/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="331 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1184360" data-case-paths="/pa/331/0278-01">331 Pa. 278</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.%20605" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="200 A. 605">200 A. 605</a> (1938); <em>Maxwell v.

In addition, <em>“ </em>'Contracts must receive a reasonable interpretation, according to the intention of the parties at the time of executing them, if that intention can be ascertained from their language. (Citing cases). Where the language of a contract is contradictory, obscure, or ambiguous, or where its meaning is doubtful, so that it is susceptible of two constructions, one of wMch <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>makes it fair, customary, and such as prudent men would naturally execute, <em>while the other makes it inequitable, unusual, or such as reasonable men would not be likely to enter into, the interpretation which makes a rational and/ probable agreement must be preferred.</em>

It is also beyond controversy, that a written document must be construed most strongly against the parties drafting it: <em>Cities Service Oil Co. v.

It is equally well fixed in the law that a doubtful reservation or exception in a deed will be construed most strongly against the grantor and in favor of the grantee: <em>Bundy v.

The term “surface,” when used in law, is seldom, if ever, limited to mere geometrical superficies.

Therefore, the grantor conveyed complete title and right of possession in and to the soil and earth resting upon the coal. But, title to the coal with the right ,to remove it remained in and' was reserved to the grantor. .These facts are clearly established by .the' language of the deed. As to the method to be employed in the removal of the coal, that is something again. What did the parties contract in regard to this? How did they intend that this would be accomplished? Did they contemplate that, by virtue of the stated mining rights, the grantor was entitled to occupy the surface, mine the coal by intentionally ' removing and destroying the soil overlying it? This is the pivotal question and the answer is not specifically spelled out in the deed. Nor is there language from which the same may be implied. To conclude that such extraordinary rights were reserved and intended, one must necessarily read into the deed an intent that is just not there. Such a construction would violate every principle of law we have herein-before enunciated. It would amount to construing the reservation in favor of the grantor, stretching it and adding substantially thereto. It would be an unreasonable interpretation; one grossly inequitable and of a nature well meaning men would not likely bargain for. It would be inconsistent, with the grant itself. Further, the standard of. interpretation to be applied is the meaning that would be attached by a reasonably intelligent person, <em>acquainted with all operative usages, and knowing all the circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the making of the contract: </em>Restatement, Contracts §230; <em>Clearfield Dev.

The excavations carried out in this case <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>were, undoubtedly, those incident 'to strip mining. Such operations were never heard of in the hard coal field until recent years. Can anyone reasonably contend that in the year 1893, when this deed was executed and delivered, that the parties contemplated or intended that the surface of the land would be strip ‘mined?

Therein this Court held that a deed containing reservations of a‘ similar nature, including the liability-saving clause, in the event of damage to the surface resulting from the removal of the coal, applied only to shaft, or vertical mining, because-the deed demonstrated that such was the intent of the parties to the contract.
