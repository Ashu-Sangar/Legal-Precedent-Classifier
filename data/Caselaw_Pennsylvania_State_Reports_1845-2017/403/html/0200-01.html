However, where, as here, the plaintiff is content to prove a collision as a result of the defendant’s car being over on the wrong side of the road, the burden is upon the defendant to offer exculpatory proof. The truthfulness of defendant’s explanation of why and how the Robertson car was over on the wrong side of the road was for the jury; this, together with the other testimony, was for its consideration in determining the issue of negligence. In itself, it was not automatically self exculpatory.</p>

The jury’s unwarranted action was invited by the instructions of the trial judge, who incorrectly told them, on more than one occasion, that the plaintiff could recover against the owner of the car alone and that the jury could in its discretion exculpate the driver of the automobile. This was basic, fundamental, and prejudicial error. The general exception to the charge was sufficient to preserve the right to appellate review of this erroneous instruction: <em>Nunamaker v.

The merits of the controversy are already adjudicated and this Court says they may not be re-adjudicated. Yet it sends the case back for a new trial to bring about the •very thing it deprecates, namely, a retrial on the merits!</p>

      <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>The argument of the appellant that the omission of Mattie Robertson’s name from the verdict slip vitiates the trial is sheer subterfuge because, if there is a verdict against the defendant in any way at all, the insurance company must pay the verdict. Hence, the desire of the insurance company for a new trial is the hope that this time the jury may return a verdict against the plaintiff completely. In other words, a retrial on the merits. Should this Court permit this kind of a basketball game?</p>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[264,926,1146,537]]]'>Even if we were to admit that the lower court erred in its charge to the jury, no harm resulted, and this Court has said more times than there are gasoline stations in Delaware County that where an error is harmless no new trial will be granted. Is this Court now repudiating that salutary rule? If a surgeon overlooks to wear his mask or don his rubber gloves, but the operation is successful and the patient is cured, must the patient nevertheless undergo a second operation so that the surgeon may be properly clothed?</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[264,1475,1144,316]]]'>The Majority says that it is reluctant to order a new trial. This Court should never act with reluctance. To the extent that it is reluctant, there is a suggestion that it may not be right. And why should it not be right when there are no fogs or mists to dim perspective on the highway of justice?</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[262,1801,1147,312]]]'>The reason the Majority gives for ordering what it is reluctant to accept is that, it says: “to condone such error would do havoc to the principles of law concerning the rights of indemnity and might well influence the compounding of the error in the trial of future cases.”</p>
    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[260,2132,1145,263]],["BL_231.1",231,[157,356,1147,318]]]'>But this is a non sequitur. We do not have to condone the lower court’s error, if there was error. We can spread the error on the record so that the whole world may see it and no future judge may follow that irregular path on the basis that the error has <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>been condoned. We do not condone tbe error, we only-say that the patient was not injured as a result of the surgeon’s wearing silk gloves instead of rubber gloves, and therefore there is no need for a second operation. This does not mean we repudiate surgical rubber gloves.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[152,695,1151,872]]]'>The Majority Opinion says also: “We are reluctant to order a retrial, particularly in view of the family relationship existing herein between the defendants.” This suggests that the rights of the father and daughter are adverse to each other. The converse is true. The father and daughter are on the same side, and they are both in the hands of the insurance company. It is, of course, proper and demanding that in a jury trial no mention must be made of insurance, but in an appellate court we should not wear the blindfold of fiction. The appellant in this case is the insurance ■carrier. It, of course, has the right to appeal and it is entitled to every benefit due its insured, but where its argument is so obviously dissembling as it is here, this Court should not permit illusion to take the place of facts, and technicality to defeat justice.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[151,1586,1147,316]]]'>The plaintiff here has won a case fairly and squarely, as the appellant has lost it fairly and squarely. To order a new trial on the basis of an equivocation as transparent as it is unfair, is to do the very thing the Majority decries, namely, bring “havoc to the principles of law.”</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[149,1924,1148,263]]]'>The object of every lawsuit should be to achieve a result which will meet the demands of conscience in the eyes of the law. That result has been achieved here. To undo what has properly been done is to bring havoc to the cause of justice itself.</p>
