I, §1, as amended, 72 PS §2301. By Acts of May 28,1956, P. L. (1955) 1757, and of July 11,1957, P. L. 821, 72 PS §2301.1, both made effective as of June 1, 1957, the Legislature provided that “No transfer inheritance tax shall be imposed upon the transfer of any property, real or personal, or of any vested or future interest therein or income therefrom, in trust or otherwise”, to charitable institutions.</p>
    <p id="b394-8" data-blocks='[["BL_394.10",394,[243,1574,1147,427]]]'>On March 5, 1959, the Commonwealth filed its appraisement showing as taxable the value of the testatrix’s gifts to charity, and on March 30, 1959, a transfer inheritance tax was assessed on such value. The estate appealed from the appraisement and assessment, which the court below sustained, holding that the gifts to charity were now exempt from tax. The Commonwealth then appealed.</p>
    <p id="b394-9" data-blocks='[["BL_394.11",394,[241,2014,1147,373]],["BL_395.1",395,[140,347,1146,210]]]'>The parties agree that the right to tax accrued at death, which is the taxing event, and that the transfer occurred at that time. The Act of 1919, in imposing the tax on a transfer, made it payable when the person liable for the tax shall actually come into possession of the taxable estate at the end of intervening estates for life or years. The Act of 1956, exempting <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>gifts to charities, was made prospectively effective to June 1,1957, and by the Act of July 11, 1957, P.

    <p id="b395-4" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[139,567,1149,430]]]'>The positions of the parties can be stated simply. The Commonwealth contends that its claim to the tax was vested before the Act of 1956, which in terms was an amendment to the Act of 1919, rather than a repeal, and acted prospectively only. The appellee argues that the Act of 1956 was a repeal, that it had no saving-clause, and that it was effectively retrospective. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[141,1009,1148,854]]]'>We begin with a presumption against retroactivity. Section 56 of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS §556, provides: “No law shall be construed to be retroactive unless clearly and manifestly so intended by the Legislature.” Section 58 of the Act (46 PS §558) provides for strict construction of retroactive provisions. Here the Act of 1956 is labelled an amendment and not a repeal, and the Act of July 11, 1957, expressly makes unincorporated associations and societies exempt from the tax retroactively to June 1; the Legislature knew how to be retroactive when it meant to be.

    <p id="b396-4" data-blocks='[["BL_396.4",396,[240,464,1146,484]]]'>The turning question at bar is whether the Act of 1956 was a repeal, in part, or an amendment to the Act of 1919. For the reasons above suggested we are of the opinion that it was an amendment and prospective only. We are supported in this position by certain decisions of this court, which we regard as of better authority and purpose than <em>Lloyd’s Estate. </em>They not only support our basic view but they answer appellee’s arguments.</p>
    <p id="b396-5" data-blocks='[["BL_396.5",396,[235,960,1149,918]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v.

The legitimating act passed the next year contains no word to release the Commonwealth’s vested right, and that it can have no such retroactive effect, <em>proprio vigore, </em>is shown by the case of Galbraith v. The Commonwealth, 2 Harris 258, where a similar act, passed the next day after the death of the decedent, was held insufficient to take the estate out of the Collateral Inheritance Law.” (Original emphasis.)</p>

We said: “Notwithstanding the different situations, <em>the tax springs into life on the </em>

      <em>death of property </em>owners: eo instanti, it becomes seated on their estates. If, however, no provision has been made for the ascertainment of the tax, the mere announcement by statute of an intention to tax would not burden an estate.</p>
    <p id="b397-4" data-blocks='[["BL_397.4",397,[136,635,1150,924]]]'>“Having inaugurated this tax, fixing ways and means for determining the amount, it is possible, under certain conditions, that a part of it does not become payable until a certain event, or the amount may not be ascertainable because the assessment or value on which the rate is to be applied is not known until such event happens; nevertheless, to preserve and safeguard this revenue, the legislature ordered that the tax, when on real estate, should remain a lien until paid. This is an incident of the tax without regard to matters that make it up. The amount may not be known presently; it may with certainty be ascertained in the future, and whatever that sum may be, it remains a lien on the property until removed in some way pointed out by law; persons dealing with property must be held to have notice of it.” (Original emphasis.)</p>
    <p id="b397-5" data-blocks='[["BL_397.5",397,[134,1572,1149,535]]]'>We then stated and answered appellee’s argument here: “But, says appellee, ‘surely it was not the intention of the legislature to prevent alienation for unnumbered years while the lien of this tax remains.’ The act points a way out. The purchaser, as an owner, could no doubt pay the tax; and here, if the land was sold clear of liens, the executors may be required to make good the tax. The act gives other methods through which the tax may be presently ascertained and paid.”</p>

Appellant contends, however, relying upon section three, that <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the tax is not due until the remainderman actually secures possession, and that in the event of the remaindermen’s death during the continuance of the intervening estates, the contingency upon which the tax shall become payable has not occurred and no tax can be collected. We think this contention must be rejected. The tax is a <em>transfer </em>tax: cf. Haggerty’s Estate, <a href="/pa/311/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="311 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="1146241" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0503-01">311 Pa. 503</a>. 'Transfer’ is defined in the act (section forty-five) 'to include the passing of property, or any interest therein, in possession or enjoyment, present or future. . . .’ 'Construing the same definition in the New York statute, the Court of Appeals held that the word (transfer) 'thus contemplates a present enjoyment <em>or a fixed and absolute right of future </em>enjoyment'': Matter of Hoffman, <a href="/ny/143/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="143 N.Y. 327" data-case-ids="2262340" data-case-paths="/ny/143/0327-01">143 N.

[Italics ours.] The tax is assessable upon the <em>transfer </em>of any vested property interest when that transfer takes place under any of the conditions enumerated in section one. The imposition of the tax and the liability therefor are fixed by the first section and section three simply refers to the time of payment of that tax in the case of future interests.” (Original emphasis.)

The gist of the error appears in the statement: “ ‘The tax on such estate shall not be payable, nor interest begin to run thereon, until the person or persons liable for the same shall come into actual possession of such estate.’ If the tax shall not be payable until that event, it does not arise, it has no beginning, and hence the commonwealth has no title to it and cannot demand its payment until the estate itself ‘comes into actual possession’ of the person entitled.
