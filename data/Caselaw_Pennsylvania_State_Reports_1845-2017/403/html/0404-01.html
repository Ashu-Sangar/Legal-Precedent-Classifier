Cassida, while driving his automobile negligently, caused a collision resulting in serious personal injury to the plaintiff, Mary Smith, minor personal injuries to her husband, Howard Smith, and property damage to the latter’s automobile. An <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>action in trespass resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. The specific monetary awards were as follows: (1) Mary Smith, wife-plaintiff, for her injuries, $12,500; (2) Howard Smith, husband-plaintiff, to cover the cost of medical care and loss of services caused by the wife’s injuries, $12,000; and, (3) Howard Smith for his own personal injuries and for damage to the automobile, $500.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.4",426,[245,795,1147,426]]]'>Cassida carried a liability insurance policy on his automobile with the defendant-garnishee insurance company providing for a $10,000 and $20,000 limit. The insurance company paid to the plaintiff, Mary Smith, the sum of $10,000 in full settlement of her judgment; and offered to pay the plaintiff, Howard Smith, the sum of $500 plus accrued record costs, in full discharge of its liability under the policy. This was refused.</p>

    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[133,637,1150,750]]]'>The plaintiff urges that the controlling question is to whom the damage was done, not the nature of the damage. He contends that two persons incurred damage as a result of the occurrence; that the insurance carrier is obliged to pay for “all damage” sustained by the two persons up to the specified limit. In other words, that the elements for which the wife-plaintiff may recover in her own right for the injuries she suffered are those covered by the limitation to one person, and that the consequential damages suffered by her husband which arise out of the same injuries, are separately covered under the clause providing additional insurance up to a maximum of $20,000 for each occurrence.</p>

The recoverable damages, direct and consequential, are essentially due to the bodily injury of one person. They may not be broken up in order to increase the liability limit provided for. The limit of liability applies to the person injured and not to the person suffering loss. Any other construction would completely annihilate that language of the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>policy, which reads, “Such limits of liability for all damages includes damages for care and loss of services arising out of bodily injury, sickness or disease.” In addition, the “Declarations” which are part of the policy, expressly provide that the limit of liability for “bodily injury” for “each person” is $10,000. In the body of the policy, it is also stated that the “limit of bodily injury liability stated in the declarations as applicable to ‘each person’ is the limit of the company’s liability for <em>all damages </em>sustained by one person.”</p>
