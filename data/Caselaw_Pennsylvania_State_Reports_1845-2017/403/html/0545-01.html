Two hours later he left the Lodge and walked to his ear. lie walked along the abutment, the top of which was 18 inches wide, and fell off precipitately into a creek 9% feet below. He had walked along this abutment two hours before and was <em>thoroughly familiar </em>with it and the abutting drop into the creek. He retraced his steps over the same abutment he had used to enter the Lodge, reached the door of his car, opened it, and without looking, stepped backward, caught his heel on the abutment, lost his balance, fell into the creek, and suffered very severe injuries.</p>
