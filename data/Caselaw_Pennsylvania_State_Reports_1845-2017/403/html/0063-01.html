The chancellor further found that the restriction had been neither abandoned nor waived by Ratkovich, that it was still of substantial benefit to them and decreed nisi “that any house erected by . . .

[Randell] shall conform in every way to the popular idea or conception of a <em>house” </em>Randell’s exception to this decree on the ground of vagueness was sustained by the court en banc. The court en banc concluded that the words “immediate vicinity” in the chancellor’s decree meant the lots adjacent to and across the street from Randell’s lots, and, since there were ranch type houses one story in height on those lots, <em>the court decreed that any building erected on RandelVs lots would be required to be “a ranch type house substantially the same as [Rathovichs’l house in size and outward appearance </em>From that final decree, Randell appeals.</p>

Mr. Justice Musmanno, speaking for a unanimous court, construed the word “house” to be not all embracing and that its use in that situation in a restricted sense meant a “single private dwelling”.

In Bennett&gt; supra, the Court concluded that the word “house” meant a “single private dwelling” not merely because the word “house” was used but rather because other words and phrases contained in the restriction qualified and restricted the meaning of the word. Bearing in mind that the structure proposed to be erected in <em>Bennett was a three story 3Jf-umt apartment building, </em>the Court found that such structure was prohibited by the intent inherent in the language of the restriction. The phrases “with private garage to be used in connection therewith” and “detached or semi-detached” together with the minimum required expenditure — $4000—and the word “house” were construed to indicate an intent on the part of the creator of the restriction to prohibit and exclude from the land covered a three story 34-unit apartment building. Giving full consideration to the factual situation and the language of the restriction in <em>Bennett, </em>the Court was fully justified in concluding that the word “house” was not intended to be so all-inclusive as to embrace a building with 34 apartments. The construction of the word “house” in <em>Bennett </em>— an entirely dissimilar situation — neither controls nor governs the present issue.</p>
