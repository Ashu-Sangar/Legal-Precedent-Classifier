Immediately, as disclosed by the official minutes of the meeting, the following occurred: “ ‘Mr. Christopher nominated Mr. Arthur Chace, seconded by Mr. Waychunas. Mr. Whittington nominated Mr. Skulski but no second was received. A motion to close the nominations was made by Mr. Hensley and seconded by Mr. Phillips.

Citing, Roberts Rules of Order, Revised. Hence, since there was more than one nominee to fill the existing vacancy, a vote should have been taken by the members of the council through which each councilman would have recorded his choice of the two nominees. Failing this no valid election or appointment followed. The court further held, that Section 901 of The Borough Code of May 4, 1927, P.L. 519, as amended, 53 PS §45901, requires such vacancies to be filled by appointment, through a resolution, and that such formal action was lacking in this case.</p>

If this be so, and it is expressed in a way not inconsistent with the statutory provisions, the fact that the niceties of every parliamentary rule have not been followed does not render the act illegal: 4 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations §13.42 (3rd Ed. 1949). This is particularly apropos in the case of proceedings of a borough council There is no requirement in the borough code, <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>statute or rule of law in Pennsylvania, prohibiting a borough council from requiring a second on any motion or nomination submitted for its consideration. Neither are they (the members) required to follow any specific rules of order. In the absence of such restrictions, the council has the legal right to adopt its own rules of procedure or parliamentary usage: <em>Hicks v.

Further, rules of procedure are always within the control of the majority and may be changed at any time by a majority vote: <em>Commonwealth v.

In the last mentioned case, the court relied upon <em>People v. City of Rochester, </em>5 Lans. (N.Y.) 11, wherein the facts disclose that at a meeting of a municipal council, a motion to pass a sewer improvement ordinance was defeated. At the next meeting, the ordinance was reconsidered on a <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>motion of an alderman, who voted with the minority in the original vote.. The ordinance passed at the next meeting. The ordinance was subsequently challenged on the ground that the rules of council were not complied with. The court said, at 160 (S.W.): “‘Parliamentary law requires that the motion to reconsider be made by one who voted with the majority on the motion proposed to be reconsidered. But whether this shall be insisted on or dispensed with, and the motion made by one voting with the majority, rests exclusively in the discretion of the body whose action it is proposed to reconsider, and no other tribunal has a right to treat a reconsideration thus moved for as void. A majority could dispense with the rule requiring the reconsideration to be moved by one who voted with the majority, and if the majority treat the motion as regularly made, it is to be considered as a <em>tacit suspension of the rule.</em>

Further, it is crystal clear that every member of the council, except one, willed that appellant, Ohaee, be appointed to fill the existing vacancy.

The election or appointment of Chace was not by “appointment through a resolution” as required by §901 of The Borough Code of May 4, 1927, supra. There was no evidence that the Borough Council had adopted (a) any rule about an appointment or a nomination or whether it had to be seconded, or (b) that it had waived any statutory requirement or any Council-manic ordinance or rule. The result is Skulski was deprived of the right the law gives him, and Cha-ce’s appointment or election, as the record discloses, was illegal. If Chace is really the choice of a majority of the Councilmen of the Borough of Brookhaven, the Council’s error can be quickly corrected by a new and legal vote.</p>
