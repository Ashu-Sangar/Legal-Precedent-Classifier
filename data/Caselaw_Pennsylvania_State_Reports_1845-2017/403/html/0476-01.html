Upon the termination of the trust, the trustee is directed to pay over, inter alia, “Twenty-five per centum (25%) [of the residuary estate] ... to the niece of my late husband, F. B.

The First Seneca Bank and Trust Company, successor trustee, filed an answer to the merits and Bucknell University filed preliminary objections which averred that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment because of the availability of another remedy, i.e., audit of the trustee’s account and distribution in the Orphans’ Court.

As former Chief Justice Stekn well stated in <em>Eureka Casualty Company v.

Moreover, in a declaratory judgment proceeding the court will not decide future rights in anticipation of an event which may not happen, but, just as in the ordinary executory action, it will wait until the event actually takes place, unless special circumstances appear which warrant an immediate decision, as, for instance, where present rights depend on the declaration sought by plaintiff; and even then such rights will not be determined unless all parties concerned in their adjudication are present and ready to proceed with the case (see section 11, of the act) so that the judgment rendered will make the issues involved res judicata in the full sense of that term.”</p>

In <em>Lifter Estate </em>we allowed a declaratory judgment proceeding because the will contained conflicting provisions and a residuary gift to the Federation of Jewish Charities was extremely <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>doubtful because of tbe provisions and limitations with respect to the gift. Testator gave the income from his residuary estate to his wife for her life with a discretionary power in the trustees to expend principal in her behalf. His wife survived him. The will then provided that upon the death of his wife the trust should terminate and the principal should be paid over and distributed to 17 persons or charities and the residuary estate to the Federation of Jewish Charities to erect a building, provided (a) such erection began within five years from the date of his death, and (b) that the Federation notify testator’s trustees of its acceptance of the bequest and (c) that the conditions attached thereto are met within 60 days from the date of testator’s death. There was a gift over if for any reason the Federation did not accept or meet all the conditions. The conflicting, confusing and litigation-producing provisions of the <em>Lifter will </em>made a declaratory judgment not only appropriate but vitally necessary.</p>

An interpretation of this contract and the arbitration provision was what the petitioner sought. The Court said (page 66): “A declaratory judgment should not be granted where a more appropriate remedy is available. See Stofflet &amp; Tillotson v.

Many years may elapse before the present subsisting trusts terminate, and long before that period the right of the executors to appeal from any tax imposed on their interest in this estate, if any, would expire.’ Doubtless it would be more convenient for the executors to have us construe the will in advance, but this is by no means an adequate rea<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>son. The allegation that it is necessary in order that the estate may be properly appraised for taxation, affords no sufficient reason for our action. Under the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, the tax on the interest of Frederick G. NixonNirdlinger in the estate of Emanuel Straus, whatever it may be, will not be assessed until such interest vests in possession after the termination of the life estate. If the taxing authorities assess it now, the remedy is by appeal, and the taxing authorities of the Commonwealth and of the federal government are not before us asking for any decision on the question in futuro. If we allowed a declaratory judgment in this case, we might be asked in other cases to adjudicate the rights of the remaindermen in order that they might borrow of money lenders on their future interests, which it would not be pleasant to contemplate.”</p>
