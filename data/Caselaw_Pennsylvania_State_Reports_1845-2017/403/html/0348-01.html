The bonding company asked the court to discharge it from any further liability on its bond or, in lieu thereof, to require the guardian to file an account within ten days and to display the estate assets for examination to the bonding company’s representative or someone appointed by the court. Pursuant to that petition, the court granted a rule on the guardian and after a hearing (at which the guardian did not appear), President Judge Shumaker on July 23, 1954 found the following facts, inter alia: (1) that the guardian had failed to file triennial accounts; (2) that the guardian had failed to cooperate with her bonding company; (3) that the guardian had failed to cooperate with her own attorney; (4) that, in spite of notice given, the guardian had failed to appear at the hearing. On that date, the court directed that the safe deposit box in the guardian’s name at the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company, Butler, Pa., be sealed, that an attachment be <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>issued to the sheriff to produce the guardian before the court on August <em>2, </em>1954 and that the guardian be directed to have with her at such time in court all her books, records, accounts, etc., pertaining to the ward and to show cause why she should not be held in contempt of court.</p>

On August 30, 1954, the court directed the guardian to file a second and partial account and, upon the filing of that account, to resign as guardian. The court then appointed the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company as the successor guardian and directed that Eileen Marshall deliver to the Mellon Bank all the assets of the ward’s estate and, upon such delivery, her bonding company would be discharged from all future liability on its bond.</p>

The court then issued an attachment directing the sheriff to bring the guardian before the court forthwith and granted a rule to show cause why the guardian had not complied with the court’s order. On July 25, 1955, the guardian appeared before the court at which time she was released upon posting an appearance bond.</p>

Stewart Shoemaker (the bonding company representative authorized to countersign checks) be directed to countersign the check in the possession of the Clerk of Courts.

The court then cited the guardian to show cause why she should not be directed to pay to her ward $4,817.18, together with $900 claimed as guardian’s commissions, or in lieu thereof, to file a final account and to show cause why she should not be sentenced for contempt. On the return day of the citation, the guardian failed to appear and, on March 8, 1957, the court found that there was a shortage in the guardian’s account in the amount of $4,817.18, held the guardian in contempt of court and disallowed any claim for commissions by the guardian. The bonding company excepted to this order for the following reasons: (1) that the court’s direction to the guardian to pay to the ward $4,817.18, plus $900, was an adjudication of an amount owed which was not based upon a finding of fact supported by any evidence and was an <em>eos parte </em>adjudication; (2) that it was the court’s failure to discharge the bonding company upon its request which subjected the bonding company to severe losses after the date of its request for discharge; (3) that the court had failed to enforce its order di<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>recting an accounting to be made by a court-appointed individual and a bonding company representative and (4) the court erred in failing to take more drastic action against tbe guardian. On March 3, 1959, in an order reciting that, although a bench warrant had been issued for the guardian, the sheriff had never been able to apprehend her, and that, although the matter had been referred to the District Attorney’s office for action, no such action had been taken, and that it then appeared that the guardian was a non-resident of Pennsylvania being a West Virginia resident, the court directed that the entire matter be referred to an auditor, that the guardian be brought into court to testify and the court continued generally the entire proceeding.</p>
    <p id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[241,1136,1148,697]]]'>On May 29!, 1959, the ward once again petitioned the court for an order under §301.(6), §721 and §751 of the Orphans’ Court Act of 1951 to enter a judgment against the guardian and her surety for the sum of $4,817.18, with interest from July 21, 1955 (the date of the second partial account) together with the sum of $900 representing disallowed guardian’s commissions. On July 1, 1959, the court dismissed this petition upon the ground that, the exceptions filed by the bonding company to the court’s previous order of March 8, 1957 not having been disposed of, the court could not make the requested order. Prom that action of the court below this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[241,1854,1144,487]]]'>The instant record presents a sorry picture. The record reveals a guardian not only oblivious of the responsibility of her stewardship but defiant of the court and its decrees, a surety attempting to avert payment of the obligations on its bond by blaming the court for delay and inaction, of an overly-indulgent and patient court and of a ward who has long since reached his majority and is frustrated in every attempt to secure payment of that which rightfully belongs to him.</p>

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>The record reveals that the guardian did file a second and partial account accounting for her administration of the estate up until a period approximately six months prior to the time when the ward reached his majority. This account was confirmed by the court and there appears on this record no objection to the accounting or to the figures stated therein with the exception of the credit claimed by the guardian for commissions. As <em>far as the record reveals, as of the date of the confirmation of that account, the balance in the hands of the guardian due to the ward was fully established.</em>

    <p id="b375-4" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[141,1037,1148,648]]]'>Subsequent thereto, certain monies and assets were turned over by the court’s direction to the Clerk of Courts who, in turn, turned them over to the ward. The value of such assets is purely a mathematical computation and the difference between the value of such assets and the amount of the balance shown on the second accounting likewise is a mathematical computation. All that the ward seeks is a judgment for the amount shown by that account as due and owing to him less that which he has already received. There is no difficulty in establishing from the records of the court that which is rightfully due to the ward.</p>

The order appealed from, dated July 1, 1959, refused the petition for judgment against the guardian and the bonding company on the following grounds: “an order cannot be made on the petition now before the Court for judgment for attachment execution to issue until the Court has disposed of the exceptions to the order of March 8, 1957”. On March 8, 1957 the court found that there was due and owing to the ward $4,817.18 and that the guardian was not entitled to credit for commissions of $900. The bonding company filed exceptions to this order questioning the sufficiency of the record to support the court’s findings, averring that the court’s failure to discharge the bonding company when it had requested such discharge and the failure of the court to take penal action against the guardian had resulted in loss to the bonding company which it should not be called upon to assume. These exceptions have never been disposed of although over three years have passed since they were filed and no satisfactory reason appears of record for failure to dispose of these exceptions.</p>
