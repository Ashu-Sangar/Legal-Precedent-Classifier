At the audit of the first and final account of the executors of the testator’s will, questions were raised concerning the proper construction of the document principally with respect to the trust of the residuary estate as specified <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>in paragraph (15) of the will. It is the contention of the testator’s heirs at law that the trust failed because of vagueness and for want of definiteness of purpose and that the decedent died intestate as to his residuary estate. The auditing judge resolved this question in a well reasoned opinion by concluding that a valid charitable trust had been testamentarily created, and entered a decree of distribution accordingly. The decedent’s .two sisters and brother filed exceptions which, after argument, the court en banc dismissed and approved the auditing judge’s disposition of the controversy. The court en banc, however, modified the decree entered by the auditing judge to the extent of detailing the specifications of the trust’s purposes and, as so modified, affirmed the decree of distribution. The decedent’s two sisters and brother have separately appealed.</p>

In support of this conclusion, we cannot do better than quote the cogent opinion of the auditing judge as follows: “The fifteenth paragraph of the decedent’s will provides: ‘The balance of my Estate, real, personal and mixed is to be deposited, after payment of taxes in a fund. Erom this Fund there must be a suitable memorial for my saintly brother Hyman &amp; my wonderful parents Lizzie &amp; Jacob Little. I entreat my executors to seek advise from good friend Leon Falk as to the nature of ■the memorials.

The testator’s heirs at law infer, by reason of this omission, that he did not intend to limit the use of the trust funds to charitable uses, and, by reason of his failure to impose specific duties on his trustees in relation thereto, the trust is a dry trust.

His will repeatedly expresses his veneration and love for his deceased brother Hyman and his deceased parents. In the third paragraph he refers to his ‘gentlemanly father’ and his ‘brilliant ambitious mother’. He states: ‘They are both in heaven, waiting, for me — if there is such a place’. In the sixteenth paragraph he provides : ‘I want to - be buried in an inexpensive casket and a vault next to my brother Hym. &amp; dearest pal I ever had. He was a paragon’. In paragraph 22 he states: ‘Of everything that meant good in life, I insist that his name Hyman Little be honored in death by my executors.

The active interest of Lonis Little in philanthropy during his lifetime, the tenets of his faith, his demonstrated affection for his deceased brother Hyman and his deceased parents, his testamentary plan for the disposition of his estate, the emotional tone of his will, the magnitude of his residuary estate, which comprises the greater part of his estate, which is inventoried at approximately $1,000,000, and, finally, Ms purpose in creating the trust from Ms residuary estate as a memorial to his deceased brother Hyman and his deceased parents, clearly demonstrate that Louis Little intended the trust fund to be used for charitable uses and to limit its use to charitable uses, and the writer would so hold if there were no other evidence bearing on his intent.

His direction in the last sentence of this provision, that the trust fund should not be governed or used by social workers, is likewise significant. Social workers ordinarily are engaged in philanthropic enterprises. His interdiction of the use of the trust fund by social workers evidences that he intended the trust fund to be used for charitable uses, but did not want social workers to be employed in or control its use.

Even if the court’s interrogations were deemed to constitute technical error, it obviously would be harmless in the circumstances. There was no jury to be misled by inadmissible testimony and the auditing judge, as his opinion plainly reveals, did not rely upon Falk’s testimony in construing the testator’s intended meaning of the words “memorial” and “memorials.” In the will itself, the decedent <em>entreated </em>his executors to seek advice from his “good friend Leon Falk as to the nature of the memorials.” What the court understandably sought to ascertain in its inquiries of Falk was what the latter had in mind as possible memorials and what he had suggested, as such, in consultation with the executors.

The 19th paragraph of the will reads as follows: “To my sister Ethel Silverman of Miami, who now has a comfortable estate, I order my Executors to keep Ten Thousand for her for a period of ten years. If at that time or during that time she does not need it, then it must be disposed of as hereinafter designated.” The court below held that this provision created a valid conditional gift to Ethel Silverman to be held in trust, necessarily, to await the possible happening of the specified condition.

But, as the court below correctly pointed out, “Lowitz Estate, supra, is clearly distinguishable on its facts from the instant case. In Lowitz Estate the decedent made a gift of ten thousand dollars in trust for his sister, Edith Lowitz. He attached no condition to the gift and imposed no duties on his trustee in relation thereto. The trust was clearly a dry trust. In the instant case, however, as is clearly shown by the language of <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>the provision, the testator considered the possibility that, although at the time he wrote his will Ethel Silverman had no financial need, such need might arise in the future. He made a conditional gift to her. The condition is that within a period of ten years after his death she need financial assistance in an amount not exceeding ten thousand dollars. He directed his executors to hold the sum of ten thousand dollars for a period of ten years and to pay that part or all of the ten thousand dollars to her if during that period of time her financial position should change and she should be in need of part or all of the gift. This is a valid and enforceable condition and, unlike the trust created for Edith Lowitz in Lowitz Estate, this trust is not a dry trust. Although the testator provides that if at the end of ten years or within that period of time ‘Ethel Silverman does not need it then it must be disposed of as hereinafter designated’, the provisions which follow thereafter make no disposition of the ten thousand dollars in the event it is not needed by Ethel Silverman. A reading of the decedent’s will in its entirety, as has been previously discussed, clearly evidences that the decedent intended the fifteenth paragraph of his will to dispose of his residuary estate. If all or part of the ten thousand dollars is not needed by Ethel Silverman it will fall into the residue and be distributed under the fifteenth paragraph of the decedent’s will.”</p>

Therefore, it must be clear that Mr. Little desired that his brother and parents be memorialized, that is, commemorated, through works of charity.

No two persons confide and have as much faith in each other as do brothers. The relationship between brothers is one of sweetness, sanctity, and even saintliness. And if, while the sun is still in the sky, one falls prior to the other, the survivor lives on, but half of him is buried with the one who has fallen.</p>
