Turkelson, a member of the Lower Merion Township police department, on March 7, 1958 was suspended from duty on a charge of having failed to account for money received by him in his official capacity. After hearing, the Civil Service Commission of Lower Merion Township found Turkelson guilty of a violation of the Police Code of Discipline and directed that he be removed from the police force as of March 7, 1958. Turkelson then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County and Judge Groshens of that court reversed the Commission’s order and reinstated Turkelson as a police officer as of June 1, 1958 “with pay from that date.” The Township appealed to this Court and we affirmed Turkelson’s reinstatement as of June 1, 1958 <em>(Lower Merion Township v.

Turkelson then demanded that the Township pay him his salary of $5,534.03 from June 1, 1958 (the date of his reinstatement) to July 9, 1959 (the date of his resignation). The Township refused payment upon the ground that, during the period Turkelson was off the police force he had been employed by the Post Office Department at which employment he earned $5,690.60, and that such sum constituted a set-off against Turkelson’s claim for salary.</p>

In support of its position, the Township relies upon <em>Vega v. Burgettstown </em>Borough, <a href="/pa/394/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="394 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1280942" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0406-01">394 Pa. 406</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 A.2d 620">147 A. 2d 620</a>, wherein we held that, in an action by a Chief of Police against a municipality to recover salary for the period during whieh he was improperly dismissed, the municipality had the right to set off against such salary any amount earned by him in a private capacity during that period.</p>

Turkelson would differentiate <em>Vega </em>from the present situa<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>tion upon the ground that in <em>Vega </em>the statute which provided for an appeal differs in wording from the statute which provides an appeal in the instant situation. Section 5 of the General Municipal Law, supra, (53 PS §815), under which <em>Vega </em>was suspended, provides : “The suspended . . . employe shall have the right to appeal to the court of common pleas of the county in which he was employed.” Section 645 (53 PS §55645), of The First 'Class Township Law, under which Turkelson was suspended, provides: “. . . the person suspended . . . shall have immediate right of appeal to the court of common pleas of the county and the case shall there be determined <em>as the court deems proper </em>(Emphasis supplied). From the phrase “as the court deems proper” Turkelson argues that the court is vested with plenary authority to direct reinstatement with full pay regardless of any amount which might be earned by the police officer in other employment during the period the police officer was not on his official duties, and, that our Court by affirmance of the lower court’s order in <em>Lower Merion Township v. Turkelson, </em>supra, did reinstate Turkelson with full pay and precluded the Township from setting off that amount of salary which Turkelson earned in the Post Office Department. The exact wording of the lower court’s order which we affirmed “reinstated [Turkelson] ... as of June 1, 1958 with pay from that date.”</p>
    <p id="b95-4" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[111,1845,1151,538]]]'>Turkelson’s argument in this respect is without merit. In <em>Lower Merion Township v. Turkelson, </em>supra, the issue was not raised nor did this Court, either expressly or by implication, indicate that Turkelson was to be reinstated without any deduction for moneys he had earned during the period he was off the police force and in private employment. Turkelson’s argument is a complete misconception and misconstruction of the order of the court in <em>Lower Merion Township v. Turkelson, </em>supra.</p>

      <em>Vega </em>directly controls the present situation. The legislature by permitting reinstatement of a police officer with full pay simply protected the dismissed employee “from possible economic retribution by the discharging authority upon reinstatement” and it was not the legislative intent that a reinstated police officer should receive both service-connected and non-service-connected salaries for the same period of time.</p>

However, there is still a deplorable tendency on the part of the Courts to “interpret” the English language in a way which not only mystifies the nonlegal population but confuses even lawyers and others trained to understand the medieval abracadabra of the law. This case is in point.</p>

He appealed the dismissal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County which reversed the order of the Civil Service Commission and reinstated Turkelson as of June 1, 1958, “with pay from that date.” The Township appealed to this Court which affirmed the decision of the court of common pleas (<a href="/pa/396/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="396 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1284887" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0374-01">396 Pa. 374</a>).

Did it mean half pay, one-third pay, part pay, or did it mean full pay? The Majority says that it meant full pay less <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>whatever amounts the police officer may have earned while suspended. But if the Legislature meant to convey that meaning, why would it not have said “full pay less whatever amounts the police officer may have earned while suspended”?</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[220,626,1144,476]]]'>The Legislature, busy as it is, and concerned, as it must be, with the multitudinous problems confronting the Commonwealth, is not so parsimonious with its time and so distraught over its responsibilities that it would omit a phrase highly essential to an understanding of its intention, when that phrase was available at the time of the original drafting of the bill, in committee, and when the bill was being considered on the floor of the House or Senate.</p>

    <p id="b98-6" data-blocks='[["BL_98.6",98,[215,1508,1147,872]],["BL_99.1",99,[188,350,1144,106]]]'>Even more than that, this Court is telling the Legislature that it does not know the meaning of words. And still more than that, it is amending the dictionary. One can leaf through the dictionaries bearing the reliable imprints of Webster, Oxford, Punk and Wagnalls, New Century, Merriam-Webster, Random House, Simon and Schuster, World, Thorndike-Barnhart, and Winston, and in none of them will one find that the word “full” can under any circumstances mean not full, half, part. In each and every volume dedicated to the definition of words, one will find that <em>full </em>means the cup filled to the brim, the glass with wine reaching the rim, the barrel loaded to the barrel-head, the reservoir with water lapping at the high water mark, the bottle with its liquid pushing at the cork. This Court, thus, in denying Turkelson full pay, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>defies every dictionary instructing the English-speaking people on the use of language.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[187,464,1147,876]]]'>The Court errs in another wise. It assumes that by assuring the improperly suspended policeman an amount which, added to what he has otherwise earned, will make up what his pay would have been if not suspended, it is acting equitably and fairly. But here it overlooks that the Legislature may well have intended the “full pay” provision as a punitive feature. It is no small matter to charge a police officer with misconduct. Such a charge can ruin a man’s reputation, even though he is later vindicated. In order to warn municipalities that they must proceed with the utmost caution in tarnishing a policeman’s badge, the Legislature has in effect said: “Beware! Don’t bring charges recklessly for, if it is proved they are without merit, you will be compelled to pay the officer his full pay regardless of what he has earned elsewhere.”</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[186,1349,1147,652]]]'>The Majority seems to proceed on the theory that it is called upon to consider presumably applicable common law principles and what the Legislature intended to say or should have said. But we are to be guided only by what the Legislature actually did say, namely: “The appointing authority may suspend any such person without pay pending the determination of the charges against him, but <em>in the event the appointing authority fails to uphold the charges, </em>then the person sought to be suspended or removed <em>shall he reinstated with full pay </em>for the period during which he was suspended.”</p>

I said in my dissenting opinion in the <em>Vega </em>case: “If Vega had sat in his parlor for nineteen months doing nothing but watching television, eating sandwiches, and drinking beer, the Borough would have had to pay him $5,-850, but, because he exerted himself, as a good citizen and a responsible member, of society should, by working, while the Borough was denying him what he was entitled to, he must give up $5,608.56 which he earned by his own sweat and toil.

The Township then appealed to this Court and this Court declared (<a href="/pa/396/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="396 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1284887" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0374-01">396 Pa. 374</a>, 378) : “The statute clearly gives the Court of Common Pleas <em>full </em>discretion to affirm, reverse or modify the action of the Civil Service Commission.

If ¡by “full discretion,” this Court means anything less than full, I can see that our State reports are being launched on a wild, tempestuous and uncontrolled lexicographical sea.
