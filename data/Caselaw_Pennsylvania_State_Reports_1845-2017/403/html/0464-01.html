The issuer of the. bonds, i.e., the United States Government, covenanted with the decedent through the medium of the Treasury regulations, that, upon the registration of the bonds in co-owner form, such registration would be <em>conclusive </em>of the ownership and interest in the bonds. Upon the basis of that contract and agreement between the Government and. the decedent the named surviving co-owners of these bonds, as third party beneficiaries, seek to establish their rights to the bonds.
