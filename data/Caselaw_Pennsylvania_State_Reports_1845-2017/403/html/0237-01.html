The lower Court, after hearing, entered a preliminary injunction, but strange to say the appeals were taken only from the Orders which overruled the preliminary objections. The appeals raised a narrow question of jurisdiction — (1) did the lower Court lack jurisdiction because of want of an indispensable party, and (2) because Equity had no jurisdiction of the com<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>plaint since jurisdiction lay by statute solely and exclusively in the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania.</p>

    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[151,868,1149,650]]]'>Rosenberg was employed by plaintiff as a sub-agent in 1951; he was thereafter promoted to sales manager and later to president of the company. In these capacities he occupied a position of trust and confidence and had access to all the records of plaintiff. When Rosenberg resigned from the plaintiff company in May, 1960, he secretly took from the files and possession of the plaintiff certain of its confidential records and data, including names, premium dates and amounts, and pertinent information concerning the active policyholders to whom plaintiff had sold insurance. These constituted a very valuable asset of plaintiff.</p>

These averments were sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction against both Rosenberg and World, although the injunction was issued only against Rosenberg: <em>Robinson Electronic Supervisory Co. v.
