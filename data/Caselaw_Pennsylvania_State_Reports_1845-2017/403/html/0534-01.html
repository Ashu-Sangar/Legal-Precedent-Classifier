    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[219,981,1149,1031]]]'>Appellant’s first and principal contention is “This bequest as stated by the testator has the effect of inviting the legatee to commit murder or to destroy his marriage by obtaining a divorce.” This is so farfetched as to be utterly devoid of merit. The bequest was clearly a contingent gift to Don Little, contingent, not upon murder or even divorce, but upon his surviving his wife, with a gift over in the event of his failure to do so. It seems to be often forgotten that a man (who has testamentary capacity) can disinherit his children and his closest relatives, except his wife, and can give his own property to such individuals andi to such charities and to such objects of his bounty as he desires, subject only to the limitation that the gift cannot be in violation of law or of the Constitution or of clearly established public policy. <em>Girard Will Case, </em><a href="/pa/386/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="386 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1268320" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0548-01">386 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20287" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="127 A.2d 287">127 A. 2d 287</a>; <em>Cannistra Estate, </em><a href="/pa/384/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="384 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="1263143" data-case-paths="/pa/384/0605-01">384 Pa. 605</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.2d%20157" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="121 A.2d 157">121 A. 2d 157</a>; <em>Johnson Will, </em><a href="/pa/370/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="370 Pa. 125" data-case-ids="1234581" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0125-01">370 Pa. 125</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20188" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="87 A.2d 188">87 A. 2d 188</a>; <em>Borsch Estate, </em><a href="/pa/362/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="362 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="477347" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0581-01">362 Pa. 581</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20119" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="67 A.2d 119">67 A. 2d 119</a>.</p>
