Testator’s widow, the life tenant, died on March 4, 1958, at which time the testamentary residuary trust terminated. The trust principal which was reappraised as of the death of testator’s widow, amounted to $1,626,000.

In other words, the Orphans’ Court held that the testator intended to give his residuary estate after the death of his widow to his children who survived his widow and the then surviving children, per' stirpes, of his deceased children.</p>

This latter provision she contends applies only to income and consequently her husband’s vested interest was not cut down or changed to a contingent interest by this second dispositive provision. First of all, appellant’s contention that this dispositive provision applies only to income is devoid of any merit. Moreover, we cannot read or consider the first dis-positive clause or provision in the third paragraph without reading and considering it in connection with and together with the second dispositive clause or provision of the third paragraph.
