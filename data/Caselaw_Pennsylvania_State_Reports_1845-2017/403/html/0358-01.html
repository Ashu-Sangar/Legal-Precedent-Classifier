Upon being informed no. such person lived in that house, Ross and his companion left the premises. Tschudi then also left the house and returned approximately 25 minutes later. Upon Tschudi’s return, he noticed Ross’ companion at Walker’s bedroom door placing a handkerchief on his face and Ross at the door to the bathroom in the upper hall. Tschudi went to his own room and, while there, heard things being thrown about in Walker’s apartment. Tschudi directed the attention of Mrs. Kramer, the housekeeper on the premises, to this disturbance. Mrs. Kramer went to Walker’s room and, as she pushed open the door she was pulled into the room. Tschudi then saw Ross coming from Walker’s kitchen; upon Ross observing him, Ross chased him, threatening to shoot him, and then left the premises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Later in the evening, having been alerted by Tschudi, she went to Walker’s room and, as she pushed open the door, Houlahan pulled her into the room and threw her on Walker’s bed. The only persons then in the bedroom were Walker, Houlahan and Mrs. Kramer. Walker was bound hands and feet and lying flat on the bed. Houlahan left the room and, “immediately” thereafter, Walker told her “[t]hey tried to kill me” and “[t]hey wanted more money”. A doctor was summoned <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>and gave Walker medical attention. Walker refused the doctor’s suggestion that he be hospitalized. Mrs. Kramer stated that “Everything [in the bedroom] was disrupted and all the drawers and things were emptied on the bed.

This is so not because such confessions are unlikely to be true but because the methods used to extract them offend an underlying principle in the enforcement of our criminal law: that ours is an accusatorial and not an inquisitorial system — a system in which the State must establish guilt by evidence independently and freely secured and may not by coercion prove its charge against an accused out of his own mouth, [citing cases]”. Accordingly, if a confession is “found to be the product of constitutionally impermissible methods in . . . [its] inducement”, the reception into evidence of such confession offends the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

Ross then stated: “I thanked Captain Flynn but told him that I could tell him nothing because of it. Captain Flynn became angry and he rescinded the order to take me to the dentist.” According to Ross, several times he renewed his request to be taken to a dentist bub received no response and it was not until the next morning, after the confession, that he was taken to a dentist who then removed two badly decayed teeth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Ross also stated that an officer named Nestor told him that the Hoffmans — in whose home Ross was arrested — were in a police station and would be held as material witnesses unless Ross confessed and that, likewise, Ross’ niece would be arrested for having an abortion. On cross-examination, Ross admitted that it was he who suggested to Captain Flynn that he would tell the police exactly what happened if the Hoffmans were not arrested.</p>
    <p id="b384-4" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[243,1346,1149,636]]]'>Leonard Monti of the homicide squad testified that Ross, when arrested, had toothache medicine in his room which he was allowed to take with him, that Ross did complain of a toothache, that he did not ask Captain Flynn to be taken to a dentist but he was told that, after the questioning, he would be taken to a dentist to which Ross replied: “Oh, I have to cooperate to get my teeth pulled”, a remark which made Captain Flynn angry. Before the confession was taken Monti tried to reach Dr. Corsello, a dentist, to treat Ross but was unable to locate him. The next morning Monti took Ross to that dentist.</p>

After Ross’ visit to the dentist on the day following the confession, Ross’ confession was read in the presence of both Ross and <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>Ms codefendant, Houlahan. At that time and, in fact, lip until tlie time of trial Ross made no complaint that the confession had been involuntarily obtained.

The court in its instructions to the jury carefully and adequately outlined for the jury Ross’ contention that the confession was impermissibly obtained.

That is not the law in this Commonwealth. In <em>Commonwealth v.

On the other hand, a defendant may not be given a hearing for ten days after his arrest, yet during that period he might voluntarily confess Ms guilt without any questions whatsoever. <em>The delay in giving him a hearing would not make his confession inadmissible.” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) That Ross <em>knew </em>and had been informed of the fact that he was being charged with the murder of Walker and that he <em>knew </em>that he had the right to refuse to make any statement prior to <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>the time he made his written confession is clear beyond any doubt upon this record.

    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[132,646,1149,1243]]]'>Ross next urges that the trial court should not have permitted the Commonwealth to show Ross’ conduct subsequent to making the confession, i.e., Ross’ failure, when the confession was read in Houlahan’s presence, to repudiate the confession or make complaint of the means employed to induce the confession and Ross’ reenactment for the police of the route taken by himself and his two companions en route to the Walker home on the night of the crime. It is Ross’ position that, while he made only one written confession, his subsequent conduct, which was interpreted by the Commonwealth as incriminating and in the nature of an admission or confession, was the “fruit of the . . . [confession].” <em>(United States v. Bayer, </em><a href="/us/331/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="331 U.S. 532" data-case-ids="6158265" data-case-paths="/us/331/0532-01">331 U. S. 532</a>, 540). Therefore, Ross argues, since his written confession was obtained by impermissible means, his subsequent conduct, subject to interpretation as incriminating, likewise should be inadmissible in evidence. Ross’ subsequent conduct corroborated both the voluntary nature of the confession and its trustworthiness. The propriety of the admission into the record of such testimony is self-evident and the trial court very properly permitted the reception of such testimony.</p>

The rule which governs this situation is set forth in <em>Commonwealth v.

The corpus delicti, like other facts, may be shown by circumstantial evidence; it is sufficient if these circumstances are consistent with crime even though they are also consistent with suicide or accident; . . .” See also: <em>Commonwealth v. Kravitz, </em><a href="/pa/400/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="400 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1292477" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0198-01">400 Pa. 198</a>, 209-211, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="161 A.2d 861">161 A. 2d 861</a>. Before the Commonwealth may introduce a confession into evidence it must first establish, either by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the person for whose death the prosecution is instituted is actually dead and that such death took place “under circumstances which indicate criminal means”. In this case, the Commonwealth fully and completely satisfied this rule; it proved that Walker was dead and his death resulted from shock which arose from beatings which inflicted multiple injuries on his body, that, from the condition of Walker’s living quarters and the res gestae statements of Walker, a robbery had been, at least, attempted and that the death arose from-criminal means. At the time Ross’ confession was offered and received the corpus delicti <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>had been, adequately established.

A • reading of the court’s charge in its entirety together with the context in which the court made the attacked ■statement to the jury completely shatters this argument. A trial court must neither magnify the evidence on one side nor belittle it on the other: <em>Commonwealth v.

However, the manner in which the trial court in its instructions recalls the testimony to the jury must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The instant facts and circumstances fully justified the manner in which the trial court dealt with the testimony and we are convinced that the instructions were fairly given to the jury and in a manner fair to both the Commonwealth and the defendant. <em>Commonwealth v.

On the other hand, the statements of Walker were made immediately after Ross and his companions had left the room and were expressions of what Walker had observed of the actions of his assailants and had Walker lived he could have so testified. <em>Fugmann </em>clearly does not control this situation. Walker’s statements made “immediately” after the assault were patently admissible.</p>

The court en bane’s opinion well covered this contention: “It is next contended that the Court erred in admitting photographs taken of the deceased lying in bed the morning after the assault, and shortly after his death was discovered. In the first place the photographs of the deceased were not inflammatory. ... It was testified that the deceased was suffering from tuberculosis, as well as having a heart condition, and that there was some evidence of syphilis. The question then arose for the jury’s determination as to what was the cause of the death. Dr. Helm bold, a pathologist of great experience, stated that in his opinion death resulted because of shock from the severe beating administered. We believe that the photographs were helpful to the defendant upon the issue of the cause of death. When objected to the jury was instructed as follows: ‘The Court: Overrule the objection with this admonition to the jury, that you must not al<a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>low these photographs of the body to prejudice you or inflame you in any way. They are only offered for the purpose of showing where this bed was in the room, and the Commonwealth, according to the opening of the District Attorney, is going to show that at least this deceased was thrown there, and I don’t think they are inflammatory, nothing to inflame you, but if they should in any way inflame you, you; must be very careful not to allow anything of that character to arise in your minds.’ ” It is interesting to note that, although objection was made to the photographs taken in the bedroom showing deceased'on the bed, no objection was made to two photographs of deceased in the morgue. In <em>Commonwealth v. Novak, </em><a href="/pa/395/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="395 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1282805" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0199-01">395 Pa. 199</a>, 212, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="150 A.2d 102">150 A. 2d 102</a>, we recently said: “The law is likewise well settled that in the trial of criminal cases photographs of the victim and of the scenes of the crime are admissible to aid the jury in their understanding of the alleged crime, the kind of crime it was, exactly what caused the victim’s death and what, if any, connection defendant had with it; however, they are not admissible for the purpose of exciting or inflaming the emotions of the members of the jury. The admission of photographs is largely within the discretion of the trial Court and will not be reversed except for a flagrant abuse of discretion: [citing cases].” We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in admitting these photographs, into evidence.</p>

We there reiterated — citing many cases in support — that the Court and the district attorney could properly say that the evidence of the Commonwealth was uncontradicted and undenied, but neither the Court nor the district attorney could adversely refer to defendant’s failure to take the witness stand or draw an unfavorable inference from his failure to testify.” See also: <em>Commonwealth v. Morrison, </em><a href="/pa-super/180/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="180 Pa. Super. 121" data-case-ids="730846" data-case-paths="/pa-super/180/0121-01">180 Pa.

Neither the Court nor the District Attorney, under the law, has any right to comment upon this adversely to the jury. But it is my duty to tell you that it must not be considered as evidence against him. It is one of his constitutional rights. He doesn’t have to take the stand if he doesn’t want to, and it must not be considered as evidence against him. When he enters a plea of not guilty, that means he says that he didn’t have anything to do with this. So you aré not to consider that as evidence against him”. We are satisfied from the record that the jury clearly understood that the defendant’s failure to take the stand should not militate against him and that the remarks of the prosecuting attorney in nowise infringed upon Boss’ constitutional privilege.</p>
