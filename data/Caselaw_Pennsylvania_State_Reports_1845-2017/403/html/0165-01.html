Defendant counterclaimed for $4,000 for commissions due him by plaintiff in accordance with a separate agreement made between Falconer and Mazess dated August 13, 1953. The lower Court entered judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $1346.33, and for plaintiff on defendant’s counterclaim. The Superior Court in a per curiam three to three decision affirmed the judgment.</p>

Plaintiff desired to acquire rights to take the place of those he had lost and in order to do so desired to purchase the stock of a corporation which owned the desired rights. William Howard Bair was the owner of all the stock of Marine Forwarding Co., Inc., which had a certificate of public convenience giving it the rights which plaintiff desired.</p>

The testimony differed as to his reason and excuse for withdrawing his offer. If placing the acceptance letter in a United States mail box was the date of acceptance, the offer was accepted within the. required five-day period.

Plaintiff’s letter-offer of August 13 did not expressly state how it was to be accepted,' but under the circumstances of this case the use of the mails as a means of acceptance was impliedly authorized.

    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[155,967,1150,708]]]'>The lower Court dismissed defendant’s' counterclaim because it said, first, that Polin’s authority must be in writing, and secondly, because there was no evidence of Polin’s authority to act as Bair’s agent in accepting the offer. In each of these the Court erred. The general rule is that an agency relationship requires no special formalities. It need not .be in writing and it arises whenever a person authorizes another expressly or by implication, i.e., by words and/or by conduct, to act as his agent. <em>Brock v.

Under this contract it was recited that Falconer had made the same day an offer to purchase from William Howard Bair the stock of the Marine Forwarding Co., Inc. and wished to engage the services of Mazess to represent him in the consummation of the purchase from Bair and “In consideration of Mazess representing Falconer in this Bair transaction, Falconer will pay to Mazess the sum of $4,000. . .</p>
