On May 23, 1958, Wolf appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County alleging that the board’s award was in<a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>adequate. The matter was then heard de novo before President Judge Sloane and a jury and, at trial, the court submitted to the jury two questions: (1) the value of Wolf’s properties at the time of taking and (2) whether Wolf was entitled to any detention damages. The jury by its verdict fixed the value of these properties at the time of taking at $355,000 and found that Wolf was not entitled to any detention damages.</p>

If Wolf did make a demand or demands of any representative of the Commonwealth, why did the Commonwealth not call such representative to prove the nature of such demand or demands? The Commonwealth elected not to present such proof. In lieu thereof, the Commonwealth takes the position that, because the valuations placed by Wolf’s real estate experts were approximately $400,000 greater than the valuations placed by the Commonwealth’s experts, Wolf was bound by such valuations of his experts and the jury could have found that his demand or demands equated the valuations placed by the real estate experts and, therefore, were unreasonable and excessive. <em>Springer, </em>supra, completely and effectively shatters this argument (p. 569) : “Obviously, he [the owner] could not be found to have been exorbitant or unreasonable in his demands because of the valuations placed upon it [his properly] by the expert witnesses he produced at trial”.

In particular I believe that the Commonwealth should have to pay interest on just debts and just claims (including tax refunds) exactly the same as individuals do. However, this Court has often decided to the contrary. Moreover this Court specifically decided in the recent case of <em>Culver v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/348/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="348 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1220308" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0472-01">348 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%2064" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="35 A.2d 64">35 A. 2d 64</a> (1944), that the Commonwealth did not have to pay interest in an eminent domain proceeding. That case enunciated no new rule or <em>principle; </em>that rule or principle has, until today, always been the law. When the majority decides to overrule <em>Culver v. Commonwealth </em>(as it has), it should not do so under the misapprehension that that case established a new principle of <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>law, or that there has been any change of circumstances since 1&amp;44 which justifies an overruling of that case, or merely of that case.</p>
    <p id="b529-3" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[118,532,1148,814]]]'>The question of detention of damages and of interest disturbs me. The Courts have remedied part of the injustice which usually results from the exemption of a Sovereign from interest on just claims, by allowing so-called “detention damages”. “Detention damages” in effect (although in a disguised form) really amount to interest. However, until today, detention damages, if allowable at all, were allowed and assessed by a jury from the time of the taking <em>until the jury’s award. </em>The majority Opinion now changes this well established law and allows a Court not only to overrule the findings of a jury but also to calculate and assess detention damages to the date of the entry of the judgment in favor of the property owner. I know of no authority or reason which justifies this change in the law.</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[114,1358,1150,747]]]'>The majority Opinion then further changes the law by allowing <em>interest </em>on the judgment until the date of final payment by the Commonwealth, i.e., interest on interest. Not only is the allowance of interest against the Commonwealth contrary, as above stated, to well settled, ancient and recently reiterated principles of law, but the allowance of interest on interest (so-called “detention damages”) is not only unfair but is also unrealistic so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. If interest is to be allowed against the Commonwealth from the time of entry of the judgment, it should be allowed only where and to the extent that there has been an <em>unreasonable </em>delay in payment of the judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>
