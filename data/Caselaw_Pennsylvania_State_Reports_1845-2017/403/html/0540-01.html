Plaintiff died after trial but pending this appeal and is now represented by his Administratrix. Plaintiff sought to recover on an <em>express oral </em>contract (a) the difference between the wages he was paid as assistant mine foreman and later as mine foreman and the usual wage of an assistant mine foreman and a mine foreman for the same period of time and (b) 10% of the profits. The alleged oral contract was entered into between plaintiff and defendant in December, <em>1951. </em>The claim was made, for the first time, in <em>1959 </em>after defendant’s death. Defendant’s Administratrix (a) denied the contract, and (b) also pleaded as to part of the claim, the Statute of Limitations.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.8",561,[127,1479,1147,372]]]'>Plaintiff proved an oral contract which we shall hereinafter discuss in detail. Defendant proved that plaintiff made no demand for payment until June, 1959, and that several months before this demand he attempted to purchase the mine from defendant’s estate without ever mentioning his claim for additional wages or for profits.</p>
    <p id="b561-6" data-blocks='[["BL_561.9",561,[124,1864,1150,420]]]'>The Court nonsuited plaintiff with respect to his claim for additional wages because plaintiff failed to produce evidence sufficient to show the actual difference between the wages which he received and those which he allegedly should have received.

Plaintiff alleges three errors, only two . of which merit discussion. The first error alleged was the charge of the Court as to plaintiff’s burden of proof.

Indubitable proof is defined as evidence that is not only found to be credible but of such weight and truthfulness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.’’ That charge finds support in <em>Stafford v.
