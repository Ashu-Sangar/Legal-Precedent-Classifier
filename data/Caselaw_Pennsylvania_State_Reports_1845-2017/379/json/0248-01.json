        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nPlaintiff appeals, from the order of the court below refusing to take off a compulsory nonsuit entered in an action of trespass. The case arises out of the death of plaintiffs decedent after being struck by defendant\u2019s automobile.\nThe accident occurred on a twenty foot public highway at 10:30 A.M. on a clear, dry day. Decedent had been walking in a northerly direction on the berm and on his left side of the road. One Eckman, driving in the same direction, stopped his car on his side and \u201chollered back\u201d to offer decedent a ride. As he did so, he saw defendant\u2019s automobile about a \u201ccar length\u201d from decedent, proceeding southerly on the paved portion of the highway at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Eckman\u2019s warning to decedent of the car\u2019s approach was not heeded, and decedent \u201cwent to take a step . . . lost his balance . . . went forward and the car struck him.\u201d Defendant\u2019s ear was brought to a stop on the pavement within a \u201ccar length and a half\u201d from the point of collision, and the only skid marks were approximately one foot in length on the paved portion of the highway. The damage to defendant\u2019s car was on the side of the right headlight, the windshield, and the right door.\nPlaintiff contends that defendant was negligent because deceased was struck when \u201cstanding on the berm.\u201d The difficulty with this contention is that it is not supported by the evidence. Eckman testified: \u201cQ. Now, do.you know of your own knowledge as to whether Duda, the decedent, was on the paved portion or on the berm portion when he was struck? A. I couldn\u2019t say that. Q. What did he do if you know? A. It looked like he just took a step forward toward the pavement of the road. It looked like he lost his balance and kind of went forward and the car struck him. Q. And for that reason you weren\u2019t able to state whether or not Mr. Duda was on the pavement proper or alongside of the pavement; is that right? A. That is right.\u201d\nAlthough the plaintiff starts with the presumption that the deceased used due care, the presumption does not establish the negligence of the defendant. In Moore Exrx. v. Esso Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania, 364 Pa. 343, 344, 345, 72 A. 2d 117, this Court affirmed on the opinion of Judge Sweney of the court below, in which that judge stated: \u201cTwo questions are here presented: (1) what effect, if any, does the presumption that decedent exercised due care have upon the question as to whether he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law; and (2) did plaintiff prove any negligence on the part of the defendants? The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove the defendants negligent by a preponderance of the evidence ... It is our opinion that the presumption of due care is a presumption of fact. As such, the presumption is not evidence and should not be substituted for evidence; it has no probative quality. [Citing Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Co., 315 Pa. 479] . . . One thing is clear and that is that the presumption of due care does not prove the defendant negligent; nor does the presumption take the case to the jury, without real proof of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The presumption has no significance, until plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d See also Ebersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa. 12, 17, 82 A. 2d 11. The mere collision between the automobile and decedent-pedestrian does not prove negligence: Thompson v. Gorman, 366 Pa. 242, 246, 77 A. 2d 413.\nIn this case there is nothing which the jury could reasonably use as a basis for a finding of negligence in the defendant, and it is not permitted to speculate or guess: Lanni v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 371 Pa. 106, 110, 88 A. 2d 887.\nJudgment affirmed.\nEckman also testified that just before and immediately after the collision all four wheels of the defendant\u2019s car were on the pavement.",

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno :\nAn ancient Chinese proverb proclaimed that a picture was worth a hundred words. With the passage of time the ratio was augmented by Oriental philosophers who gravely announced that a picture was worth five hundred words. This self-speaking epigram spoke loudly and eventually was heard in the Occidental world where it was duly worked -up to declare that a picture was worth a thousand words. Yankee cartoonists and photographers boosted it to ten thousand to one, and it is not known with precision what the odds are today.\nIn many ways the comparison between spoken words and pictures is empty of merit because there are some written messages which convey meaning that the most priceless painting could never conjure. The beauty and spirituality of the Sermon on the Mount and Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address go infinitely beyond what pictures and three-dimensional reproductions could ever portray. Be that all as it may, there can be no doubt that a photograph of the locale of an automobile accident usually can tell more than scores of pages of testimony from witnesses who stumble, equivocate, blunder, and contradict under the driving examination of friendly or enemy attorney.\nThe case before us is directly in point. F. E. Eckman witnessed the accident which is the subject matter of this litigation. During the oral examination there were times when his testimony was far from edifying or illuminating. For instance, under plaintiff\u2019s attorney questioning, the following ensued: \u201cQ. Now, then, where were you driving and in what direction were you driving on the morning of May 30, 1950, Mr. Eckman? A. I was going to visit my mother. . . Q. Now, you had gone up to your mother\u2019s; is that right? A. That\u2019s right. Q. What time did you arrive at your mother\u2019s? A. Around 10:30 or something like that. Q. I see. Did you stay very long at your mother\u2019s place? A. She wasn\u2019t home.\u201d\nAlso: \u201cQ. How far over on the right hand side of the road did you stop? A. I wouldn\u2019t say how far. .1 don\u2019t know how far I was off \u2014 I was on the road. Q. On the road. Were you over at the extreme right of the road, the center of the road, or the left of the road? A. I was on the other side.\u201d\nWhat was the other side?\nThe attorney himself was not certain of directions: \u201cQ. Now, then, when you got on the highway which direction were you traveling? A. Toward Boston. Q. And that would be traveling in a southerly direction? A. North. Q. Sir? A. North. Q. Northerly direction, yes. A. North.\u201d\nIt is to be noted, however, that when photographs were introduced in evidence, all the mist and fog of uncertainty which had up to that moment enveloped the story of the accident lifted. As indicated in the Majority Opinion, Eckman was driving in the same direction that the decedent was walking. Eckman stopped his car and offered the decedent a ride. At the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel displayed a photograph (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1), and Eckman testified as follows: \u201cQ. Would you be able with the assistance of the picture here to indicate to the jury where your car was parked at the time of the accident? THE COURT: Wait before you mark it. (To Mr. Bielski) : How do you want him to mark it? MR. BIELSKI: Q. Mark the outline of the car. A. Right across this line. That is a hillside (indicating). Q. And where was Mr. Duda standing at the time he was struck? A. Just about right in here (indicating). Q. Mark an \u2018X\u2019 and put a circle around that. And, looking at that picture, in what direction would you say the picture was taken? A. This is going up the hill.\u201d\nThis photograph, which the witness marked, is before me as I write. - The \u201cX\u201d shows that the decedent with all geographical certitude was standing off the road and and on the berm. How can this Court affirm a nonsuit based on a trial the evidence of which demonstrates that at the time of the accident the injured person was standing off the highway? In order to have been struck, the assailant car would have had to leave the highway or be so close to the berm as to constitute negligence by its very position.\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel presented another photograph (Exhibit 2) : \u201cQ. I show you plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 2 and ask you whether or not you recognize that picture? A. I do. . . . Q. Would you be able to point out on that picture where Mr. Duda was standing at the time he was struck? A. Yes, sir. THE COURT: Q. You indicated that with an \u2018X\u2019 and a circle. A. Yes, sir. Q. Let me see that. The ink didn\u2019t take very well there. Can you \u2018X\u2019 that over a little?\u201d The witness did \u201cX\u201d it over a little and that picture is here on my table as I write. It again reveals that the decedent was standing a foot or two off the road when the accident occurred.\nIt is true, as the Majority Opinion states, that Eckman at one time in his testimony wavered in his recollection as to whether the decedent was on the paved portion of the road or on the berm when he was struck. However, as against this equivocal reply, we have his positive answer: \u201cQ. And what portion of the road was he walking on? A .He was on the berm.\u201d\nIt is to be noted also that Eckman stated that there was adequate space on the road between Eckman\u2019s car and the spot where the decedent stood for the defendant\u2019s car to pass. Eckman also testified that the defendant failed to blow the horn of her car to warn the decedent.\nEven if the accident happened as quoted by the Majority: \u201cQ. What did he .[the'decedent] do if. yoii .know? A. It looked like lie just took a step forward toward the pavement of tlie road. It looked like be lost Ms balance and kind of went forward and tbe car struck Mm.\u201d there would still be a question for the jury as to whether the defendant was not negligent in driving her car so close to a pedestrian, who was in her direct vision, that the slightest movement of the pedestrian would bring him into contact with the car.\nReading the record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we are required to do in considering the matter of a compulsory nonsuit, I believe that a question of fact was presented here for the consideration of a jury.\n(Italics throughout, mine.)",
