In 1949, when he was 13 years of age, he was adjudged delinquent by the Juvenile Division of the Municipal Court of Philadelphia on a petition alleging that he was involved in a highway robbery, and he was then placed on probation. He was later accused of participation in a burglary, but that offense was not proved; however, he failed to attend school for long periods of time and in 1951 his probation was continued. He continued to be a persistent truant from school, and, in August, 1952, being charged with participation in a highway robbery and assault and battery, he was committed to Pennypack House and remained there until November of that year when he was again placed on probation.</p>

There was definite evidence that the automobile had been stolen and appellant admitted driving it without a license but he denied guilty knowledge of the theft of the car. The Juvenile Court adjudged him delinquent on the charge of operating a motor vehicle without a license. Five days later a delinquency petition was filed alleging his participation in the armed robbery of a church. At/a hearing on that charge held on January 23, 1953, the court revoked his probation and committed him to the Pennsylvania Industrial School at White Hill, basing <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>this action on his prior record, his present activities, the failure of his parents to control him, and the desirability of his receiving the training provided in such an institution. Counsel for appellant thereupon intervened and requested a rehearing, which was held on March 6, 1953, and at which additional testimony was taken.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court repeated its adjudication of delinquency and ordered Holmes remanded to White Hill. On appeal to the Superior Court this order was affirmed.</p>

Such claims, however, entirely overlook, in our opinion, the basic concept of a Juvenile Court. The proceedings in such a court are not in the nature of a criminal trial but constitute merely a civil inquiry or action looking to the treatment, reformation and rehabilitation of the minor child. Their purpose is not penal but protective,- — aimed to check juvenile delinquency and to throw around a child, just starting, perhaps, on an evil course and deprived of proper parental care, the strong arm of the State acting as parens patriae. The State is not seeking to punish an offender but to salvage a boy who may be in danger of becoming one, and to safeguard his adolescent' life. Even though the child’s delinquency may result from the commission of a criminal act the State extends to such a child the same care and training as to one merely neglected, destitute or physically handi<a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>capped.

In our own Commonwealth The Juvenile Court Law of June 2, 1933, P. L. 1433, section 8, gave to the judges of the Municipal Court in Philadelphia the duty, after an inquiry of the facts at a hearing, to determine whether the best interests and welfare of a child and the State required the care, guidance and control of such child, and to mate an order accordingly; by the amendatory Act of June 15, 1939, P.

Fisher, <a href="/pa/213/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="213 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="943354" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0048-01">213 </a></em><a href="/pa/213/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="213 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="943354" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0048-01">Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.%20198" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="62 A. 198">62 A. 198</a>, which held the Act of April 23, 1903, P. L. 274, the forerunner of the present Juvenile Court Act, constitutional. It may be added that appellant was not “compelled” to testify; he was questioned in the same manner and in the same spirit as a parent might have acted, for whom, under the theory of juvenile court legislation, the State was substituting. It is true that section 18 of The Juvenile Court Law provides that if the child had been held by a magistrate or justice of the peace for any offense, other than murder, punishable by imprisonment in a State penitentiary, the judge of the Juvenile Court might, if in his opinion the interests of the State required a prosecution of such case on an indictment, certify the same to the district attorney of the county, who should thereupon proceed with the case in the same manner as though the" jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court had never attached. But such a certification could not be made after the Juvenile Court had made an adjudication of delinquency nor, perhaps, after any self-incriminatory examination of the child. That question,, is not. here involved, but it may be noted that section 19 of the Act provides, that “The disposition of a child or any evidence given in a juvenile court shall not be admissible as evidence against the child in. any case or proceeding in any other court.”;.</p>

Appellant complains .that the. court received, certain hearsay testimony in regard to the-.charge that he.-was implicated in the armed robbery of the church. ■ It <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>seems that one of the two men who were convicted of that crime had confessed to having committed it, and a detective testified at appellant’s hearing as to the substance of that confession and that it implicated appellant. It is true that subsequently the man who had made the confession repudiated it and now stated that appellant did not participate in the robbery, but of course the judge was not obliged to believe’ his retraction. He admitted that he had made the confession and the fact that the testimony of the detective was technically “hearsay” was therefore wholly unimportant. Moreover, from the very nature of the hearings in the Juvenile Court it cannot be required that strict rules of evidence should be applied as they properly would be in the trial of cases in the criminal court. Although, of course, a finding of delinquency must be based on sufficient competent evidence, the hearing in the Juvenile Court may, in order to accomplish the purposes for which juvenile court legislation is designed, avoid many of the legalistic features of the rules of evidence customarily applicable to other judicial hearings. Even from a purely technical standpoint hearsay evidence, if it is admitted without objection and is relevant and material to the issue, is to be given its natural probative effect and may be received as direct evidence: <em>Harrah v.

The court granted this request as far as the notes of testimony were concerned but refused it as to the reports of probation officers. As the Superior Court properly held, the records referred to in the statute are obviously the ordinary petitions, docket entries, notes of testimony and court orders; the reports received by the court from probation officers are not entered in the docket as a part of the “records of the proceedings.” It is true that ex parte information received by the court and not publicly disclosed cannot properly be made the basis of a finding of delinquency in the Juvenile Court any more than of any important adverse finding in a trial before a judge in any other court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, this rule does not apply in connection with the determination of a <em>sentence </em>in a criminal court and, all the more, should not apply to the disposition of a case in a Juvenile Court. In <em>Williams v. New </em>York, <a href="/us/337/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="337 U.S. 241" data-case-ids="572499" data-case-paths="/us/337/0241-01">337 U. S. 241</a>, the court pointed out that, as distinguished from the situation where the question for consideration is the <em>guilt </em>of a defendant, it has always been the right of a court in sentencing to consider information concerning the defendant’s past life, health, habits, conduct, and mental <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>and moral propensities, even though such information is obtained outside the courtroom from persons whom the defendant has not been permitted to confront or cross-examine. The court said: (p. 247) “Highly relevant — if not essential — to his selection of an appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant’s life and characteristics. And modern concepts individualizing punishment have made it all the more necessary that a sentencing judge not be denied an opportunity to obtain pertinent information by a requirement of rigid adherence to restrictive rules of evidence properly applicable to the trial.” And further (p. 249) : “Under the practice of individualizing punishments, investigational techniques have been given an important role. Probation workers making reports of their investigations have not been trained to prosecute but to aid offenders. Their reports have been given a high value by conscientious judges who want to sentence persons on the best available information rather than on guesswork and inadequate information.” If all this is true as applicable to a criminal court it is certainly a fortiori true in regard to proceedings in the Juvenile Court.</p>

It- is, however, wholly immaterial whether those hearings were initiated for the purpose'cjf passing upon the <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>revocation of appellant’s probation or considering an adjudication of delinquency. Neither the district attorney nor any probation officer complains of any lack of notice. At the January hearing the court had revoked appellant’s probation, and while, at the rehearing, it again adjudged appellant delinquent, the order remanding him to White Hill was in effect merely a reaffirmation of the revocation of the probation.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[168,816,1149,1265]]]'>Complaint is made of the fact that it does not affirmatively appear from the record that notices of the hearings were given to appellant’s parents. The parents of a child involved in a Juvenile Court proceeding should certainly be notified in regard to what ought to be to them a matter of supreme importance. It has been held to be “an abuse of discretion for a [juvenile] court to go into such hearing and adjudication without notice to the persons having custody of the child, and without an opportunity for them to be heard, unless imperious reasons exist therefor.”: <em>Rose Child Dependency Case, </em><a href="/pa-super/161/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="161 Pa.

However, the record definitely indicates a total lack of interest on the part of appellant’s parents rather than any absence of notification to them on the part of the court. After counsel appeared in the ease it must be assumed that he was in touch with them and that, if they had wanted to be present they would have been there instead of the uncle and aunt who did appear. Appellant’s repeated derelictions are proof positive of the fact either that his parents were indifferent to his bad behavior or were unable to control him.</p>

Section 8 of The Juvenile Court Law, as amended by the Act of June 15, 1939, P. L. 394, provides that the court may “Commit any child over the age of sixteen years to any state industrial school or home for the reformation and correction of youths above the age of sixteen.” The fact that the Act of July 29, 1953, P. L. 1447, provides that minors between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one who were sentenced in the criminal court may be committed to the Pennsylvania Industrial School if not known to have been previously sentenced to a State penitentiary does not make that institution a prison; the Act merely extends the benefits of reformatory treatment to minors even though convicted in the criminal court instead of being adjudged delinquent in the Juvenile Court.

But this approach to the problem before us completely misses the <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>target of inquiry.

In all civilized countries it is determined by following a certain organized procedure which assures to the accused an opportunity to assert his innocence, face his accusers, call witnesses in his behalf, obtain the services of counsel and be adjudged by an impartial tribunal. Nowhere in the world are the rights of an accused so jealously guarded as in the United States. The case before us, however, presents an amazing paradox in jurisprudence. This Court says, through a majority of the Justices, that certain constitutional and legal guarantees such as immunity against self-incrimination, prohibition of hearsay, interdiction of ex parte and secret reports, all so zealously upheld in decisions from Alabama to Wyoming, are to be jettisoned in Pennsylvania when the person at the bar of justice is a tender-aged boy or girl.</p>

To say that a graduate of a reform school is not to be “deemed a criminal” is very praiseworthy but this placid bromide commands no authority in the fiercely competitive fields of every-day modern life.</p>

But when the minor is charged with what (as against an adult), would be a felony, and the minor denies the charge, the resulting proceeding can only be a judicial <em>contest </em>to determine conflicting facts and contentions; and, being such, it is a <em>trial </em>in every sense of the word.

What a child charged with crime is entitled to, is <em>justice </em>not a <em>parens patriae </em>which in time may become a little calloused, partially cynical and somewhat over-condescending.

But informality may be at times carried to the point of confusion, sloppiness and unreliability. The appellee Commonwealth categorically declares in its brief that “commitment to an industrial school is not punishment.” But it certainly does not come under the classification of pleasure. Calling a reformatory <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>an “industrial school” does not mitigate its bleakness, loneliness and destitution of parental love and care.</p>

To take a child from the comfort of his home, the joy of his companions and the freedom of field, river and wood, and confine him to a building with whitewashed walls, regimented routine and institutional hours is punishment in the strictest sense of the word. To say, as the Commonwealth says, that this institutionalized incarceration is “for the care and treatment” of the juvenile does not make it any less abhorrent to the boy of spirit, health and energy.</p>
    <p id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[259,1018,1147,811]]]'>The Commonwealth argues further in its brief that many constitutional restrictions against prosecuting authorities in a trial of adults in the criminal courts do not apply in Juvenile Court because the proceedings there do not constitute a criminal trial. From this it is argued that in Juvenile Court proceedings the rules of evidence may be relaxed. To say that the rules of evidence may be relaxed in Juvenile Court is like saying that during a surgical operation on a child the surgeon may relax the rules of precise hygiene. Hygienic precautions in the operating room are taken to keep out microbes and germs of infection in the same way that rules of evidence in court erect barriers to bar the microbes of lies, the germs of prejudice and the infection of rumor.</p>

The so-called evidence presented to establish his participation in this robbery is so devoid of every symptom of competence that were a District Attorney to attempt to produce this same kind of testimony against an adult defendant in Criminal Court, he would properly earn for himself the censure of the Court. At this Juvenile Court hearing on January 23rd a detective by the name of Ashmore was allowed to testify orally to an alleged confession by a third person who, he reported, charged Holmes with participation in the robbery. The detective did not exhibit the confession, he did not produce the confessor, and the defendant Holmes was not given an opportunity to face the stranger who had supposedly implicated him. The Majority, which would undoubtedly condemn such sham testimony if presented in a Criminal Court, accepts it implicitly here because it is introduced against a child in Juvenile Court. The Majority goes further. It even pays a tribute to hearsay testimony and says that, unless objected to, it may be received as direct evidence. The statement that hearsay may be utilized to strike down a child charged with the most reprehensible of crimes — robbery of a chureh-^-is to me appalling.</p>

Detective Ashmore testified: “In regard to these two boys here, Holmes and Bichard Hodges, one of the boys that was arrested here had given a signed confession and they implicated these two boys.” Ashmore then proceeded, as indicated above, to give an oral description of the statement supposedly signed by one Widman. The Court, instead of demanding the exhibition of the confession or, more imperatively, the appearance of Widman himself, listened to this fantastic hearsay and then asked: “What did Hodges and Holmes actually do in the holdup?” This question was not only improper but it revealed a most serious lack of appreciation on the part of the Court as to its judicial duties. Ashmore had no . knowledge of his own as to what Hodges and Holmes had done, he did not know whether Hodges and Holmes had participated in the holdup, and was in fact personally ignorant of facts as to whether there even was a holdup. The Court, brushing all this incompetence aside, and accepting Ashmore’s ignorance as knowledge, his non-presence as presence and his.ir<a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>responsibility as reliability, questioned this bearer of twice-told tales as follows: <em>“What did Hodges and Holmes do in the </em>holdupf”</p>

What did Joseph Holmes know about objections? He is a minor. He had no lawyer to represent him. No one informed him as to his rights. He was not told he could object. A child in a courtroom amid a throng of police officers, probation officers, court attendants and other officials, with a judge officiating from a podium, is not apt to summon the audacity, even if he possessed the knowledge, to lift his voice and cry out that what a police officer testified to was hearsay, even if he knew what hearsay meant. Children are usually brought up with the admonition that “they are not to speak unless spoken to.” To convict a child of crime because, he. dq.es. not object to what a judge should never have allowed to be heard in the first- place is, in my- opinion, -an unfairness that sheds none of its repellence because, approved-by an . appellate court.</p>

      <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>But there is something more extraordinary about this affair than I have already indicated. At the third hearing (the one on March 6, 1953) the heretofore-missing Widman came into Court and repudiated the confession in which it was alleged he had implicated Joseph Holmes. But on this important disclosure the Majority maíces the amazing observation: “Of course the judge was not obliged to believe his (Widman’s) retraction.” It cannot be denied that the Judge was not compelled to believe Widman. He was not obliged to believe anything that might be presented in exoneration of charges against Holmes. That is the prerogative of a Judge, and he needs to answer only to his conscience. But if a Judge chooses to close his ears to the words of the actual robber, it is difficult to understand why he should accept as gospel the erratic narrative of a third-handed listener of a distantly-told tale. But if, as the Majority suggests, the Juvenile Court Judge could disbelieve Widman’s retraction, he then could only go back to the credibility-riddled narrative of Ashmore whose knowledge of the holdup was zero.</p>

Joseph, you have been before us too many times for me just to disregard this. Highway robbery in 1949, burglary in 1951, highway robbery in 1952, discharged from Penny-pack House two months later, and <em>now this. </em>A. I had nothing to do with it.

Moreover, his reference to highway robberies in 1949 and 1952 and a burglary in 1951 was not only gratuitous but unjustified. If the proof of participation in the past robberies and burglary was no stronger than that presented in connection with the church robbery one could well fear that Holmes has received little of the protection for minors for which Juvenile Courts were created. In point of fact, Joseph Holmes was never proved guilty of the crimes referred to. The Majority makes that admission at the very beginning of its Opinion, when it says: “In 1949, when he was 13 years of age, he was adjudged delinquent by the Juvenile Division of the Municipal Court of Philadelphia on a petition <em>alleging </em>that he was involved in a highway robbery . . . He was later <em>accused </em>of participation in a burglary, but that offense <em>was not proved </em>. . . and, in August, 1952, being <em>charged </em>with participation in a highway robbery and assault and battery, he was committed to Pennypack House.”</p>

And yet, this question (that is, the first one) has been answered in the negative by the Majority of this Court.

Aside from the inhumanity embodied in such an observation it is subject to criticism for other reasons. In the first place, it is not true, for instance, that the constitutional immunity against self-incrimination is limited to criminal court trials. This immunity applies anywhere and everywhere; it applies to any proceeding which can conceivably end in a criminal prosecution. Practically every day the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution (in this respect the counterpart of Art. I, Sec. 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution) is invoked <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>before legislative committees which are certainly not branches of a criminal court. The immunity against self-incrimination may be invoked in the civil law courts and equity courts if one is asked a question the answer to which may become a link leading to involvement in criminal prosecution. The immunity can be used as a barrier against being questioned in a magistrate’s court or before a justice of the peace. It can be employed anywhere except, according to the Majority, where it should, in all fairness, receive the highest sanction — in Juvenile Court. This Constitutional immunity is obviously intended to help those unjustly accused of wrongdoing. If then, it is handed to adults as a shield, why should it become a sword when the person accused is a child?</p>

Although the Majority asserts that the minor is entitled to protection, it still will not make the bold statement that any self-incriminating evidence obtained from a child while still in Juvenile Court may not be used against him in any subsequent criminal proceedings. The farthest the Majority will go in guarding the interests of a child from whom self-incriminating evidence has been wrung, is to say that after a self-incriminating examination, a child’s case “perhaps” should not be sent to the criminal court. “Perhaps” is a slender thread on which to suspend the constitutional rights of children obtained by their fathers and forefathers through hardship and sacrifice, not excluding the shedding of blood on the battlefields of the nation’s wars. The district attorney in his able brief meets this situation quite objectively, and very candidly says: “It may be that after questioning a <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>child concerning his participation in a crime, the na- : tnre of the answers of the child may convince the Juvenile Court judge that the interest of the state require the prosecution of the case on an indictment.

The Legislature may not, by changing the name of armed robbery to “juvenile delinquency”, strip from any citizen the constitutional guarantees which are his when he is tried for armed robbery. If the Legislature may, by a mere change in terminology, take away from a 17-year old boy the safeguards which the parent law of the land assures to him, then it can take it away from 18-year old boys and 25-year old men. Who is to decide the dividing line? I do not believe that the Pennsylvania Legislature ever planned by The Juvenile Court Law to make it easier to convict boys than to convict men. I cannot bring myself to accepting the self-revolting <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>idea that the Legislature intended that children should be deprived of their liberty on evidence that would walk their grown-up elders triumphantly out of criminal court. If there is anything in The Juvenile Court Law which by fair interpretation sanctions this unconscionable thing, I must say that such an un-American proposition is unconstitutional and I would, therefore, declare it null and void.

Taking up the question of the parents’ participation or non-participation in the Juvenile Court proceedings the Majority says that “The parents of a child involved in a Juvenile Court proceeding should certainly be notified in regard to what ought to be to them a matter of supreme importance,” but it then goes on to say that: “Appellant’s repeated derelictions are proof positive of the fact either that his parents were indifferent to his bad behavior or were unable to control him.”</p>

For a judge to sentence on these secret reports without allowing the defendant’s attorney to even see them for possible correction or explanation is to impose a sentence based on the utterances of phantoms. Our American traditions of fairness have always rebelled at secret reports, hearings or recommendations. The District Attorney well states this objective situation in his brief as follows: “A sound and thorough inquiry into the needs of the child as well as the state would seem to require scrutiny by the child’s counsel of the materials to be used by the court in the determination of ultimate disposition.

The filing of a delinquency petition does not of itself prove that the named minor needs or must have a <em>parens </em>patriae.
