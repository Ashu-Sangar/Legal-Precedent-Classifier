The bill further alleged that an agreement had been entered into between plaintiff and defendant that the property should be placed in the hands of a trustee and their mother removed to a nurs<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>ing home, and that representatives of the parties were trying to effect snch an arrangement at the time of the conveyance. It was further stated that Mrs. Kirk was 85 years of age, “and in a very feeble mental condition,” that defendant, together with her husband, was in a position of confidential relationship with her mother, that Mrs. Kirk died April 18, 1949, leaving a will dated October 7, 1943, in which she had left her residuary estate to her grandson, David Kirk Quinby, plaintiff’s son by a former marriage, and that he had assigned to plaintiff all his right, title and interest under the will.

The learned chancellor made findings of fact, affirmed by the court en banc, that at the time Mrs. Kirk executed the deed to defendant “she was mentally competent to do so, and appreciated the import of her act, which was voluntary, at her direction, and not induced by fraud, deceit, or coercion, nor undue influence on the part of the defendant or anyone else;” that “it was the intent of the grantor to make a gift of her residence property to her daughter as a natural object of her limited bounty”; and that “no confidential relationship in business affairs existed between the grantor and the grantee.” And the court concluded that “the Plaintiff did not prove that the Defendant took the Deed under an oral agreement or understanding, whereby the Defendant became constructive trustee for the benefit of the grantor,” <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>or that “an oral agreement had been entered into between her [the Plaintiff] and the Defendant with respect to placing the property in the hands of a trustee for the purpose of raising funds to place their mother ... in a nursing home.” Accordingly the court dismissed the bill, and plaintiff now appeals from its decree.</p>

There is nothing in the testimony in the present case to warrant any finding of confidential relationship, in the legal sense, between defendant and her mother. Defendant did testify that “we talked about most everything because no matter what happened it concerned both of us,” and, as to business affairs, “sometimes she would take my advice; sometimes she wouldn’t.” It is perfectly natural that a mother and daughter would talk over matters of mutual concern, but this impoverished old mother certainly had no extended business affairs to be looked after, nor was there the slightest shred of testimony that she was overpowered, dominated, or unduly influenced in her judgments by this defendant. It might be added that, as the learned chancellor stated, the testimony offered on behalf of the defendant was of such quality that the defendant would have met the burden even if she <em>had </em>stood in a confidential relationship with the grantor,</p>

There is not a word of testimony in the record of any trust expressly created by the grantor, nor of any oral promise made by the defendant to her mother whereby she accepted the property subject to any particular duty or obligation on her part which, in the light of their close kinship, might have made her a trustee ex maleficio.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Of course, there may have been — in fact <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>in every gift there necessarily is — some motive which actuated the grantor in making the gift. Here plaintiff in her complaint alleged that the underlying purpose was to effect the eviction of plaintiff from the premises; by the testimony of her witnesses, however, she sought to establish a totally different purpose, namely, that the property was to be sold for the purpose of obtaining funds to enable Mrs. Kirk to move to Florida for the purpose of recuperating her health. No doubt this latter did constitute the <em>motive </em>for the gift; defendant herself testified that it was <em>her </em>object, in taking the property, to sell it and use the proceeds to take her mother to Florida. But this intention on <em>her </em>part did not find expression in any <em>promise </em>made by her, nor did she, as claimed by plaintiff, make any confession in her testimony that any such oral promise had been made, with the effect thereby of rendering it enforceable as a parol trust notwithstanding the statute of frauds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In the absence of such a promise no trust ex maleficio could arise. There was some testimony that a social service agency thought that Mrs. Kirk would be better off in a nursing home and therefore that it would be advisable to sell the property and use the proceeds for her care in such a home. But while there was some informal discussion of such a plan it never, as the chancellor found, ripened into an agreement between the parties.</p>
