He testified that he was plant manager for a brick company which operated three plants, that he had been in the brick business for 28 years, that he had appraised other brick plants, that he had known plaintiffs’ brickyard for approximately 18 to 20 years, and that he was familiar with the result of the condemnation. Defendant did not preliminarily cross-examine him as to his qualifications but subsequently brought out the fact that he had not visited plaintiffs’ property for several years nor until about two weeks before the trial; on that occasion, however, he made a thorough inspection of the property and its equipment. The court refused defendant’s motion to strike out his testimony. It is true, of course, that in order for a witness to be qualified to testify as to the value of a property he should have a reasonable familiarity with it, the uses to which it might be applied, and the extent and condition of its improvements and productive qualities: <em>Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Rwy.

Since the witness Milliken had shown familiarity with plaintiffs’ plant over a course of years and had made a special intensive examination of it shortly before the trial the court was fully justified in refusing to strike out his testimony and leaving it to the jury to place such reliance upon it as they might see fit.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[129,737,1150,654]]]'>The testimony of the other witness challenged by defendant was that given by one Nestor Debay, a contractor who had been engaged in the construction of various types of buildings for a period of 29 years. He gave an opinion in regard to the value of the small frame structure on the property used by plaintiffs as an office building and which was destroyed as a result of the taking. Defendant moved that his testimony be stricken out on the ground that it was vague and indefinite and had not taken into account the factor of depreciation. We agree with the court below that there was no justification for such criticism.</p>

Stevenson and the witness Edward Milliken testified that in recent years there has come about a change in the brick-making industry in that, whereas in former years sales to contractors would be made of brick for the construction of merely one or two houses, contractors were now engaged in building large numbers of houses at a time and therefore were customers for greatly increased numbers of bricks, so that a brick-making plant with a restricted productivity could not profitably carry on business under modern conditions. They testified that the taking of an appreciable part of plaintiffs’ land left no space available for the construction of new kilns, for the extension of dryers, and for purposes of storage, thus cramping the brickyard to such an extent as to make any future expansion impossible; therefore the damage to plaintiffs by reason of the tak<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>ing was not confined merely to the value per unit of the land condemned but resulted also from the crippling of the plant’s productivity, thereby making it industrially of less value to any likely purchaser. This testimony was properly admissible. As stated in the strikingly similar case of <em>St. Louis, Memphis &amp; Southeastern R. R. Co. v. Continental Brick, Co., </em><a href="/mo/198/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="198 Mo. 698" data-case-ids="2234717" data-case-paths="/mo/198/0698-01">198 Mo. 698</a>, 711, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20S.W.%201011" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="96 S.W. 1011">96 S.W. 1011</a>, 1014, “The witnesses were estimating the value of the property as it was . . . when the railroad company invaded it. In estimating its then value they took into account its capacity as a brick-making concern, not only as then developed, but also as it was then capable of being further developed, and if it was true, as they said it was, that without increasing the machinery and equipment as then existed, except to build other kilns in a line to the east of those already there, the capacity of the plant could be doubled, that was a then present existing fact which gave a then present value to the property, and a destruction of it was a depreciation of its then value.”</p>
