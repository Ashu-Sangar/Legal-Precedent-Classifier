    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.8",300,[249,468,1148,430]]]'>In his lifetime the decedent, Fritsch, instituted this action of trespass for damages for injuries resulting from being run over by the bulldozer owned by one of the defendants, and operated by the other as his employe. Prior to trial he died and appellant-administrator was substituted as plaintiff. Plaintiff appeals from the refusal to take off the compulsory nonsuit entered by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.9",300,[249,920,1147,264]]]'>There being no one who actually saw the occurrence, plaintiff was left primarily and almost wholly to proving his case by calling the defendants as on cross-examination, and depends on certain inferences to establish the negligence charged.</p>
    <p id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.10",300,[250,1206,1145,89]]]'>Viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, the facts are:</p>
    <p id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.11",300,[248,1325,1147,251]]]'>On the day in question and prior thereto the decedent and others as employes of the contractor had been clearing brush, weeds and saplings from a plot of ground. His hours of employment were 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.</p>
    <p id="b300-8" data-blocks='[["BL_300.12",300,[247,1607,1147,701]],["BL_301.1",301,[156,345,1147,100]]]'>At approximately 4:45 P.M. defendants (sub-contractor and his employe) arrived at the plot with their bulldozer to do heavier work of clearing. Decedent advised them as to matters regarding the work to be performed by them, and then returned to his own duties after stating that he would be quitting in fifteen minutes. Decedent’s employer came to the site at approximately 5:00 P.M., and in answer to his inquiry defendant-employe stated that he did not know where decedent then was but assumed he had left. Defendant-employe continued with his work and a short time later, after having gone in a reverse direction, looked forward and discovered thát he had run the bulldozer <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>over decedent, who was writhing and moaning, face downward on the ground.</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[155,465,1150,321]]]'>When the police arrived at the scene the bulldozer and Fritsch’s body were approximately 25 feet from the edge of the plot — the extreme opposite edge of the field from the Jefferson Street edge upon which the ambulance was travelling. Thus the police ambulance drove across virtually the entire field.</p>

Young, </em><a href="/pa/367/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="367 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1228287" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0239-01">367 Pa. 239</a>, 244, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%2076" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 A.2d 76">80 A. 2d 76</a>, our present Chief Justice said: “The distinction that has thus been established, therefore, is that, while the possessor of the premises is not generally liable to a gratuitous licensee, in the absence of willful or wanton injury, for an accident due merely to existent conditions upon the premises, he <em>is </em>liable for injury occasioned by any affirmative or ‘active’ negligence on his part in connection with activities conducted on the premises. A large number of cases in the several jurisdictions, illustrating this distinction, are to be found in <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.L.R.%20778" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 A.L.R. 778">49 A.L.R. 778</a> et seq. and <a href="/citations/?q=156%20A.L.R.%201226" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="156 A.L.R. 1226">156 A.L.R. 1226</a> et seq. Applying this principle, it is clear that, if Jones had been injured as the result of a dangerous or unsafe condition of the highway under repair, he would not, as a mere licensee, have been entitled to recover for the injury thus sustained; but, since his injury resulted from ‘active’ negligence in the operation of a moving vehicle, and since the duty owed him under such circumstances was not merely to refrain from willful or wanton conduct but to exercise ordinary care, recovery may be had. (See Yamauchi v. O’Neill, <a href="/cal-app-2d/38/0703-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="38 Cal. App. 2d 703" data-case-ids="6040743" data-case-paths="/cal-app-2d/38/0703-01">38 Cal.

Whether the truck was in fact operated negligently was for the determination of the jury, and their resolution of that question in favor of plaintiff was justified by the evidence.” In the same case the then Justice Steen <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>cited the late Chief Justice Maxey, who stated, in <em>Caulton v.

He testified that the seat of the bulldozer, which was at the rear, was about five feet above the ground, and that his head would thus be about eight feet above the surface.
