L. 221, sec. 2, 12 PS §682, from the refusal to enter judgment in its favor following a verdict for the plaintiff in a trespass action brought under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act of April 22, 1908: <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Stat.%2065" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="35 Stat. 65">35 Stat. 65</a> (1908), as amended, 45 U.S.C.A. sec. 51 (1946) et seq. Defendant contends that plaintiff’s contributory negligence was the <em>sole proximate cause </em>of the accident. The learned court below refused defendant’s motion for judgment <em>non obstante </em>veredicto, but granted a new trial because of error in the charge, the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, and was excessive. <em>Plaintiff did not appeal from the grant of a new trial.</em>

    <p id="b620-4" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[239,1533,1147,541]]]'>The Federal Act bars assumption of risk as a defense and provides that contributory negligence is not a complete bar to recovery, but may be considered in diminution of damages. A railroad is not an absolute insurer against personal injuries suffered by its employes and there is no liability where the employer is not at fault. Evidence of negligence, howevei*, even though slight, necessitates the submission of the case to a jury: <em>Buffo v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, </em>supra.</p>

Bishop, the plaintiff, was a conductor on a freight (coal) train operated by the Montour Railroad Company. He was injured when alighting from the defendant’s moving train near a switch stand by stepping on a large lump of coal which, it is conceded, <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>lie saw immediately prior to his stepping off. There was testimony, if believed, that plaintiff could not avoid stepping on the coal because of the presence of many other pieces; that defendant habitually hauled overloaded cars; that nearby inhabitants threw coal from the cars for use in heating their own homes; and that defendant maintained an insufficient work force to remove such coal which customarily and generally littered the side of the track where employes were forced to alight. It is alleged that the foregoing rendered the area an unsafe place to work. While plaintiff’s testimony may seem most improbable, nevertheless, under the United States Supreme Court cases above cited, we are required to decide that the learned court below properly held that a judgment for defendant <em>non obstante veredicto </em>should not be granted.</p>
