Thus, Monongahela and its transferees had a right to remove the coal from the 300 acres conveyed to it by the Luses, and to use the resulting areaways to remove coal from other lands owned by it, and such right continued to exist at least until the coal under that tract was exhausted or the operations thereunder abandoned.

But, despite the provision for payment of wheelage, it conveyed title to the portion described, with the right of mining and removing it. Further, the arrangement between Frick and Emerald does not determine the rights of plaintiff — he must depend on the rights passing to him from his predecessors in title. Under those he.had no right to complain about the use of the space resulting from the mining and- removal of the coal. “If, then, the coal in place-is a-pure corporeal hereditament, the title in- fee-simple to -which passes to a purchaser by apt conveyance, there would be no more propriety in claiming a title in the grantor to. the space it occupies, than there would be in claiming, a similar right in a vendor, of the surface to, the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>space developed by tbe vendee in digging tbe cellar and foundations of a house ...

We are asked to enjoin against the removal of coal from the adjoining tract . . . through the chamber or way made by the defendant through its own property, to wit, the coal sold to them by the plaintiffs . . . The plaintiffs would gain nothing which they do not now have, if we did . . . The plaintiffs cannot possibly use any part of the space left by the removal of the coal, and hence they are not obstructed in the slightest degree. The right to use that space is exclusively in the defendant, and that use is not and cannot be questioned by the plaintiffs”: <em>Lillibridge v. Lackawanna Coal Company, </em><a href="/pa/143/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="143 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="978539" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0293-01">143 Pa. 293</a>, 302, 303, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.%201035" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="22 A. 1035">22 A. 1035</a>.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[149,1293,1151,480]]]'>In addition, in the same deed of conveyance Monongahela was given a distinct and separate grant of right to remove “through the said described premises the coal belonging to [grantee] . . ., its successors and assigns, or which may hereafter be acquired.” As stated by the court below: “The effect of this grant is to prevent any possibility of reverter to the surface owner as long as the sub-surface under the Luse tract is used to haul coal from other lands.”</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.6",427,[148,1793,1150,546]],["BL_428.1",428,[254,346,1149,862]]]'>Plaintiff would have us interpret the grants from the Luses to Monongahela as restricting the right of transportation through those lands only to coal then owned or thereafter acquired by <em>it. </em>In other words that the grant of a portion of the coal under the tract to Emerald did not give Emerald the right to transport through the tract any of its coal which was never owned by Monongahela, Prick or United States Steel. But even though the coal might be exhausted, Monongahela was left with the rights to the space thereby <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>left, to be used for hauling. And the instrument conveyed this right to remove “other coal belonging to the [Monongahela],. . . <em>its successors and assigns, or which may hereafter be </em>acquiredContrary to the contention of plaintiff, this was not restricted to Monongahela holdings, but intended to include any coal owned by its transferees at such time as the right of way should be used. To hold otherwise would be to disregard the plain intendment of the words, “its successors and assigns,” in the grant. See <em>Decker v. New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/57/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="57 Pa. Super. 432" data-case-ids="444750" data-case-paths="/pa-super/57/0432-01">57 Pa. Superior Ct. 432</a>. This right was exclusive or independent of right to the Luse coal, and necessarily must be taken to give the right to remove the coal owned at any time by Monongahela and owned at any time by any of its transferees.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[252,1230,1149,1099]],["BL_429.1",429,[167,333,1152,1482]]]'>We can find no merit in plaintiff’s contention that Emerald Coal Company violated any rights of plaintiff in going “outside of the physical limits of the Pittsburgh or River vein of coal, in constructing the haulageway through said premises for the purpose of hauling coal other than the coal owned or acquired by Monongahela, Frick or U. S. Steel.” He states. “The plaintiff does not raise this question as affecting the right of the United States Steel Company, the H. C. Frick Coke Company or the Monongahela River Consolidated Coal and Coke Company to remove through the vein of coal all the coal of the block of 2702 acres owned by the Monongahela River Consolidated Coal and Coke Company.” The court below found that: “12. The only manner in which the coal underlying the Luse Tract could economically be recovered was by being mined as a part of a larger tract . . . 37. . . . as the mining of the Corridor coal progressed ... it became apparent that the main division of the Pittsburgh seam of coal undulated to an excessive degree . . . <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>41. To attempt to haul coal over the excessively undulating bottom . . . would have been impossible and would have been unsafe. 42. . . . it was proper and necessary, by reason of the excessive undulations . . ., to construct the said haulageway to a limited extent in the strata immediately over and under said seam or vein of coal, <em>not only for the purpose of digging, mining, draining and ventilating and carrying away said </em>coal. . ., <em>hut also for the purpose of affording a haulage road of practical, uniform and safe grade </em>. . .” (Italics supplied). This deviation was a proper exercise of right and one that was necessarily contemplated by the very purposes of the grant. Cf. <em>Potter v. Rend, </em><a href="/pa/201/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="201 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="925623" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0318-01">201 Pa. 318</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.%20821" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="50 A. 821">50 A. 821</a>.

In its findings the court further declared that Emerald did no more than was “customary, proper and necessary” for the mining and removal of the coal in the tract and in the construction of a haulageway. The right to so do was specifically granted by the deed, is acknowledged by plaintiff to exist in Emerald’s grantors, and as discussed heretofore, was assignable and was given to Emerald, which could use it for the purposes of removal of coal “which may hereafter be acquired” by the “successors and assigns” of Monongahela, Frick, or United States Steel.</p>

[is] a taking of land without due course of law and contrary to Article I, Sec. 11 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania and without due process of law contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.” There is no violation of any right; defendants are using, in a proper and legal manner, exactly what was granted by plaintiff’s predecessors <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>in title. The court also found as a fact that the seam of coal “lies at an average depth of greater than 353 feet beneath” the plaintiffs property. The haulage-way is, on an average, 350 feet below plaintiffs surface, thus nullifying his contention that surface would be affected thereby.</p>

On December 21, 1951, plaintiff amended his complaint pursuant to the order of the court granting leave to do so upon plaintiff’s petition. Emerald, through error of counsel, sent its. preliminary objections to local counsel in Greene County, on January 21, 1952. When presented to plaintiff’s counsel for acceptance of service, on January 22, 1952, it was refused with plaintiff’s counsel stating that he was going to file a motion for a decree pro confesso. This he did on the same day, and a decree was so entered. On the same day, but “a few moments” after entry of the decree, defendants filed their preliminary objections. Defendants filed petition to open, followed by a petition for leave to withdraw preliminary objections and to answer on the merits. The latter was granted February 23, 1952, and the decree opened February 25, 1952. Plaintiff contends that this was error.</p>
