Scibelli and Marion Scibelli in their own right, sought to recover damages for injuries sustained by the minor plaintiff when he attempted to steal a ride on the defendant’s train. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff for $14,500 and for his parents in the sum of $7,500. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial which was withdrawn and a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto which the court granted. Plaintiffs appeal from the entry of the judgment for defendant.</p>

The defendant, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, operated a single track spur line through the City of Lebanon, Pennsylvania between its yards at Twelfth Street and the plant of the Bethlehem Steel Company east of its yards. The tract of land where the accident occurred, colloquially termed “The Willows”, is bounded on the east by Seventh Street, on the west by Eighth Street and on the south by Willow Street. A short distance west of and parallel to Seventh Street lies Chapel Street which leads into and comes to an end at Willow Street.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.9",339,[160,1833,1151,489]],["BL_340.1",340,[244,346,1150,206]]]'>The Willows is. an open area but there are residences and other buildings on both Eighth Street and Willow Street, the rear of which buildings face the open area. The Quittapahilla Creek flows in an east-west direction approximately in the center of The Willows. The defendant owned all of The Willows south of Quittapahilla Creek, and on January 16, 1951 leased all of this land with the exception of its spur line and right-of-way to parties known as Altenderfer and Mar-<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>got.

Proceeding on this course through The Willows it crossed a railroad bridge over the Quittapahilla Creek, continued in a northwesterly direction and then curved to the left to intersect Eighth Street. The track may be considered as constituting an elongated “S” with the western end at Eighth Street and the eastern end at Chapel Street where the latter intersects Willow Street, a distance of 762% feet.</p>

At about 2 P.M. the defendant’s train, consisting of eleven cars drawn by a diesel shifter engine, entered The Willows from the east, travelling about as fast “as a person could walk”. The last three cars were empty low flat cars with built-up ends and no sides, commonly designated as billet cars. All five members of the crew were in the cab of the diesel engine. As the diesel passed the children they were on the south bank of the creek west of the track picking mulberries. Nellie Croesus, age 12, a cousin of the minor plaintiff, held onto his shirt as the locomotive went by and then thinking that the children would continue picking mulberries, she released him. After most <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>of the train passed the children, it came to a momentary-stop near the Eighth Street intersection, with at least three of its cars on the same side of the creek as the children. With the train in this “S” formation, three of Frank Scibelli’s playmates boarded one of the empty flat cars. Seeing this, Frank suddenly ran toward the train. Nellie Croesus shouted to him several times to keep away from the train. Frank testified that he heard someone calling “Come back, don’t go near the train”, but nevertheless, paying no heed to the warning, he attempted to board it. While he had his two hands on the ladder of one of the cars and his left foot on one of the rungs, the train jerked as a result of which Frank’s left leg slipped under the wheel and was severely crushed, requiring amputation below the knee.</p>

The basis of liability in cases coming within that doctrine is that where an owner permits children to use his premises as a playground, a duty arises to exercise ordinary care in keeping the premises safe. In <em>Fitzpatrick v. Penfield, </em><a href="/pa/267/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="267 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1057768" data-case-paths="/pa/267/0564-01">267 Pa. 564</a>, 572, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20653" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="109 A. 653">109 A. 653</a>, Mr. Justice Kephaut said: “. . . When so used, ordinary care must be exercised to keep the premises in safe condition. Of course, this does not mean occasional or intermittent occupancy of another’s ground by children as a playground — or almost every foot of open or fenced land, would be under the exception to the general rule, and the general rule would then be the exception. The amount of use that will bring otherwise private ground within the playground rule must depend to a large extent on the circumstances of each case. It may be said that the use contemplated is such as to cause the place to be generally known in the immediate vicinity as a recreation center, and its occupancy should be shown to be of such frequency as to <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>impress it with the obligation of ordinary care on the part of the owner.” See also <em>Rahe et al. v.

    <p id="b342-4" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[254,621,1152,1080]]]'>The playing of various games by children on the land adjoining the defendant’s right-of-way was of sufficient frequency to bring it within the accepted definition of a playground. There was also some testimony, when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, tending to establish that the tracks themselves formed a part of the playground. Mrs. Lillian Manz, who had lived for 18 years in a dwelling house overlooking The Willows, said that the children would see who could walk the rail the longest without falling off. William W. Uhrich, the janitor of a building overlooking the playground, testified that during the wintertime the children would take cinders and cover them with snow and slide over the tracks. Nellie Croesus, a participant in the alleged games, stated that the children did not exactly play on the tracks but used to run across them. Ealph Smith, who lived in the vicinity for three and a half years, testified that the children played around the railroad bridge and all along the railroad and to the east of the railroad.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[251,1722,1153,596]],["BL_343.1",343,[163,355,1154,1153]]]'>However, even if the evidence be regarded as sufficient to show tacit assent by the defendant to the use of its tracks as part of the playground, the testimony will not support the claim that the defendant acquiesced in trespasses upon its trains. While there is some evidence that children had on occasions jumped on trains in the area of The Willows and had crossed over them when they were standing still for a period, the evidence was insufficient to establish this as a practice carried on with the knowledge and consent of the defendant. Considering the testimony most favorably to <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>the plaintiffs in this respect, the boarding of trains was occasional only and there was no acquiescence in such conduct. On the contrary crew members made efforts to keep children from the trains. There was no testimony of a single instance when a child had been permitted to board or “take a ride” on a train passing through the area. A witness for plaintiffs testified that he had seen crew members chase boys off the train “quite often”, and from this counsel would have the inference drawn that there was an habitual practice of climbing or jumping on the trains. There was no amplification of this vague expression. Other witnesses testified that “sometimes” boys would attempt to board the trains. None of the witnesses could approximate the number or fix the times of such occurrences. The evidence was entirely too indefinite to establish the extent of such alleged practice or to supply the frequency and regularity required to bring it within the playground rule.

Becker et al., </em><a href="/pa/345/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="345 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1213414" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0607-01">345 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%2023" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 A.2d 23">29 A. 2d 23</a>; <em>Riebel et al. v.

A necessary element of the playground doctrine is permission or acquiescence in the use of the owner’s property. The presence of this element gives to the children the status of gratuitous licensees. The license, however, does not extend beyond the use to which the express or implied permission applies: See <em>Prokop et ux. v. Becker et al., </em>supra, at p. 609; <em>Dumanski v.

Baseball had been played thereon for many years and defendant’s employes had frequently participated in the games. Freight cars which were left standing for some time were used by boys as grandstands to watch the ball games. For at least three-quarters of an hour before the accident the minor plaintiff and 14 other boys were seated on the freight car watching a ball game in full view of a number of defendant’s employes. Thus there was implied if not express permission to use the ears which customarily remained standing on the tracks for a considerable period of time. The injured boy had been in full view of the employes. Obviously the circumstances which were controlling in that case do not exist in the instant case where a train in normal operation was stopped only momentarily and the 'presence of the minor plaintiff on the train was unknown to defendant’s employes.</p>

In point of fact, of course, he was at the time of the accident involved only seven years of age.

Would it be unduly unburdensome for a 5-men crew on a train passing through a crowd of children to be on guard against running down one of the infants? The record in the case reveals that all 5 members of the train crew of this 11-car train remained within the cab of the engine when the train entered into the playground where it was well known children gathered, frolicked and played games. Was it too much to ask that 2 or 3 of these men leave their pinochle games, or whatever they may have been doing, to see to it that no children were crushed under the wheels of the steel cars?</p>

A more obvious rallying place for the spontaneous disportation of children could scarcely be imagined. “The Willows” abounded with natural and built-up phenomena which lent themselves to uninhibited fun. There were willow trees (from which the place got its name) among which the <em>á-to-lá </em>year old boys raced and ambuscaded in the game of “Cowboys and Indians!” Mulberry bushes flourished and supplied succulent fruit for the boys as they hid from their comrades in Hide and Seek. The Quittapahilla Creek, in which the lads waded and swam, rippled through the area. An improvised baseball diamond and football gridiron provided space for these two exciting sports. A small hill became a coasting incline down which the children slid on improvised sleds made from cardboard boxes thrown away by a Westinghouse store-close by. Sand in a sand-house supplied the building materials for tots constructing toy castles. The older boys fished from a bridge over the creek. They even made an acrobatic springboard from an abandoned bed spring weighted down on both sides by railroad sills. By leaping on to <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>the anchored bed spring, they were flung high into the air, jubilant as circus clowns. Even adults could not resist this aerial attraction. One Wm. W. Uhrich, janitor in an adjacent Order of Eagles building, testified that he participated in the fun because, as he expressed it, “I went back to my kid days.”</p>

This train passed twice a day: once in the morning and then again in the afternoon. It was not a fast express, but a slow moving affair that approached, stopped, lingered and then chugged on, almost with the leisurely gait of the legendary “Slow Train through Arkansas.” In passing through this children-thronged area the locomotive throttled down to the speed of a man walking. In the eyes of the children the train presented no more danger than a merry-go-round. When it stopped, they would leap aboard a car and with shouts of glee ride 5 or 10 feet and then hop off. For 18 years children had been doing this. Boys had hopped on the train, grown into manhood, and gone their respective adult ways, while the Willows playground still continued its gladsome, carnival-life existence for the young.</p>

It resounded with the shouts of carefree boys savoring the ecstasy of living that only the young can know. At 2 o’clock in the afternoon the welcoming thunder of the train was heard. Snorting like a pawing horse it came into view and then, amid the electric atmosphere which accompanies any moving object suddenly stopped, boys raced for their momentary thrill of riding the cars. Among the lads was little Frank Seibelli, seven, years old. His cousin Nellie sought to hold him still, but the gravitational excitement was too great for her clutching fingers to hold. <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>He broke away, seized hold of a rung of the ladder on one of the ears. Just as he was lifting himself into position, the train jerked. Frank lost his grasp and fell beneath the wheels. After the train passed he emerged, his left leg a bloody bundle. Amputation followed and his parents have come into court to ask why one or more of the five men aboard the train did not shield their child from the blow which has crippled him for life.</p>

It is true it has a right to proceed unimpededly, but people also have the right to live, children have the right to play, and the summer has the right to pass without tragedy and without sorrow. It is not enough to say, as the Majority does;, that this was an “unfortunate accident,” and let it rest at that. The law is the guardian of truth and justice, of life and limb of the innocent. The accident in this case is not something that was unforeseeable. And in the affairs of men what is objectively foreseeable is factually preventable.</p>

The care to be exercised in a particular case must always be proportionate to the seriousness of the consequences which are reasonably to be anticipated as a result of the conduct in question. Reason does not wait on usage; the latter must wait on reason. Ordinary common sense dictates that if in a harmless looking box there is something lurking that would kill or injure anyone touching that box, the latter must be so situated, if it is possible or reasonably practicable to do so, that persons are not likely to come in contact <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>with it.

There, a boy 9 years of age crawled under railroad cars which were halted at a crossing. While beneath the cars the train started and the boy was seriously injured. It was argued in that case by the railroad company that the imprudence of the boy denied him and his parents a recovery. This Court held otherwise: “We cannot say it was, as a legal conclusion, and the jury did not find it as a conclusion of fact. Nay, indeed, it may be well doubted whether most boys, grown familiar with trains of cars by daily observation, would not, in like circumstances, have acted as this boy acted. To many active and enterprising children, risks not absolutely appalling, are attractive; especially if others are at hand to witness the daring-achievement. . .

A child 6 years of age, eager to join up with other boys in a masquerading party, attempted to pass between two railroad cars halted at a crossing. He was injured when the cars came together. This Court affirmed the judgment returned against the railroad company on the ground that the defendant company failed to warn the child of the impending danger: “Certainly, the defendant could not, in view of this, evidence, call <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>■upon the court to instruct the jury, as a matter of law, that the company owed no duty to the public or to this child.

    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[271,1395,1148,757]]]'>In fact, no permanent guard at all is required or needed in The Willows to watch a short jerkwater train travel 375 feet twice a day. It would be enough for one of the train crew, as the train stops at The Willows, to jump off the engine and stand by the side of the track to watch the cars while the train pauses, and then hop aboard the last car after the other cars pass by. This is done at regular railroad crossings where trains stop and always at small railroad stations. If this simple procedure had been followed on June 25, 1951, the juvenile hurly-burly at The Willows would have been kept under control and Frank Scibelli would still have his own two legs on which to walk for the remainder of his journey through life.</p>

There was testimony in the ease that boys had repeatedly been ordered to stay away from the bridge. This Court said that previous admonitions could not deprive a present plaintiff from recovery where the defendant had failed in due care: “It cannot be affirmed as a matter of law that plaintiff was precluded from using the walk because of trespass signs posted over fifty feet from the bridge, <em>nor because other boys had been warned to keep away, </em>nor because Stephen might have gone for the cows by another route.”</p>

However, it allowed the fence to become delapidated and a 3% year old child fell into the water and was drowned. In allowing a recovery for the death of the child, our Court said that while the defendant had met its duty in the erection of the fence, — “It failed in its duty of ordinary care, however, when it permitted this fence to get into a condition of disrepair such as was shown by the testimony. This condition destroyed the real purpose of the fence and under this testimony the jury could properly find the defendant negligent toward the minor plaintiff.”</p>

In rejecting this contention, we said: “The attractiveness and comparative accessibility to children of a potentially dangerous instrumentality are circumstances by which the owner’s want of care is tested. If it is <em>in fact </em>inaccessible, no want of care can be imputed to its owner. But if it is only <em>apparently inaccessible </em>but <em>in fact </em>accessible to children, and the owner knows this or ought to know it he exhibits negligence if he fails to do these simple things which would make it harmless.

This is a circumstance which those owning instrumentalities potential for harm must bear in mind, for it is every individual’s duty to use toward others what due care <em>then </em>and <em>there </em>requires.

There a five-year old boy was crushed beneath a concrete-carrying car on a little railroad operated by the defendant company. For years children had played around these cars. In affirming judgment for the plaintiff this Court said: “In the case at hand the jury was well supported in finding defendant negligent toward the minor plaintiff. This diminutive railroad had by its nature and from past experience a particular fascination for boys. Cf. Reichvalder v. Borough of Taylor, <a href="/pa/322/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="322 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1167848" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0072-01">322 Pa. 72</a>.

Glen Alden Co., </em><a href="/pa/361/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="361 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="476388" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0519-01">361 Pa. 519</a>, the minor plaintiff was injured by coming into contact with electric wires on a tower up which he had climbed. The tower was within an unsecured gate on the defendant’s property. In affirming the judgment returned in favor of the plaintiff, this Court said: “The defendant was guilty of negligence when it failed to exercise ordinary care in safeguarding the tower . . . Having failed to exercise ordinary care in securing the gate, <em>it was foreseeable that children would be attracted to the tower </em>
      <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>innocent of its dangerous nature or under the misapprehension that the power was turned off.

In the <em>Bartleson </em>case we very emphatically said: (p. 528) “There is no rule which requires that the dangerous condition must be on the ground or within reach of a minor. Such a distinction is artificial, without logic or experience to support it. What this distinction really drives at is the question of whether or not a defendant shall be held reasonably to anticipate that a child will bring himself within the orbit of the danger.”</p>

That children have this urge is common knowledge. We recognized that trait in the same <em>Bartleson </em>case when we said: “That children will accept a situational invitation to climb is a matter of common knowledge . . . The jury found that plaintiff did not realize or at best imperfectly realized his exposure to danger.

No member of the train crew was called to testify. In view of the fact that 5 men rode in the Diesel engine which was faced with transparent glass and passed within 10 feet of Frank Seibelli, the natural inference is that one or more of the crew saw Frank and his companions. This is an inference quite valuable to the plaintiff because the winning party in a jury trial is entitled to have, on review, the evidence considered in the light most advantageously possible to his cause. In <em>Hall et al. v. Vanderpool, </em><a href="/pa/156/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="156 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="844905" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0152-01">156 Pa. 152</a>, this Court said: “Where evidence which would properly be part of a case, is within the control of the party whose interest it would naturally be to produce it, and, without satisfactory explanation, he fails to do so, the jury may <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>draw an inference that it would be unfavorable to him.” Because of the failure of the train crew to take the stand, the jury was completely justified in this case in concluding that had the crew testified their testimony would have been unfavorable to the company.
