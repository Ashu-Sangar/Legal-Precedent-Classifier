In their complaint the appellants also sought damages caused by such alleged interference. During the pendency of preliminary objections to the complaint filed by appellees, the latter caused a judgment in ejectment to be <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>confessed, as provided for in the lease, on the ground that appellants had breached a covenant of the lease by their failure to conduct operations for the production of oil for a space of more than 30 days. It was provided in the lease that in case of such cessation of operations the lease and all rights and privileges should immediately terminate and become null and void. Appellants ceased operations on or about November 22, 1950 and had not resumed operations at the time appellees confessed judgment in ejectment against them on November 28, 1951.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.5",388,[257,971,1146,764]]]'>Appellants petitioned the court to open the judgment, averring that their continued cessation of operations was due to appellees’ interference with their rights, and set forth in their petition the same acts by appellees relied on in their complaint in equity as constituting the alleged interference. The appellees filed an answer to the petition to open judgment and depositions of considerable length were taken. After argument the court found from the testimony that appellants’ discontinuance of operations was not caused by any acts or conduct on the part of appellees but was attributable to the failure and neglect of appellants, and discharged the rule to show cause issued on the petition.</p>
    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.6",388,[257,1746,1145,431]]]'>Appellants appealed to this Court and on their petition the entire record in the equity suit as well as the record in the proceedings to open judgment were incorporated in the record on appeal and both were considered by this Court. In affirming the order of the court below we held there had been no abuse of discretion in refusing to open the judgment: See <em>Ahrens v. Goldstein, </em><a href="/pa/376/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="376 Pa. 114" data-case-ids="1246204" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0114-01">376 Pa. 114</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.2d%20164" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 A.2d 164">102 A. 2d 164</a>.</p>

[Appellants] rely on the principle that where a court in equity has assumed jurisdiction for one purpose, it will retain it for all purposes. However, this principle is not inflexible in its application, being permissive rather than peremptory. Its exercise lies within the discretion of the court. Appellants proceeded to have the case heard on the merits in the ejectment proceeding, the disposition of which resolved the entire controversy between the parties. Only after a determination adverse to them did they question the propriety of the court’s action. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the lower court.”.</p>

On March 30, 1954 appellants presented a petition claiming that the original equity action was still pending and seeking a hearing and the taking of testimony for the determination of the issues which had been passed on and finally determined by our decision in the prior appeal. On the same day the court below filed an opinion in which it referred to our decision and held that all issues between the parties were finally resolved thereby excepting appellants’ claim for damages suffered by reason of appellees’ interference with appellants’ operations for gas and oil under the lease, and made an order fixing a hearing for the taking of testimony on the question of damages and dismissing the bill in equity as to all other matters. Under this order of March 30, 1954 a hearing was held, testimony was adduced by appellants and thereafter, on April 26, 1954, the court dismissed appellants’ petition.

It had determined at the earlier proceeding that there had been no interference by appellees with appellants’ operations. This finding of the lower court was discussed and upheld in our decision on appeal and necessarily disposed of the claim for damages by appellants which was based on such alleged interference.</p>
