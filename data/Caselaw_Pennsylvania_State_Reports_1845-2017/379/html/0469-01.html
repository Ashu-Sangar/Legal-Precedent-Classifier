Harris, to recover damages for injuries suffered by him when struck by defendant Attilo DeFelice’s automobile after alighting from the defendant Pittsburgh Railways Company’s street car. During the course of the trial a compulsory nonsuit was entered in favor of the corporate defendant. The jury failed to agree upon a verdict as to the individual defendant and was discharged. Following their discharge the plaintiff filed a motion to take off the judgment of compulsory nonsuit and the individual defendant filed a motion for judgment in his favor upon the whole record, pursuant to the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, 12 PS §684. After argument the court en bane refused plaintiff’s motion and granted the individual defendant’s motion. From the judgments thereupon entered, plaintiff appeals.</p>

The night was dark <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>and hazy and a light rain was falling. Plaintiff informed the operator of the street car that he wanted to go to the Dixie Drive Inn. Plaintiff was discharged directly across the street from the inn on the southerly side of the highway, which admittedly was not a regular car stop. At this particular point the highway is about 50 feet wide and runs generally east and west. The defendant transportation company maintains a single track generally in this area, but at the place where plaintiff was put down there is, for a short distance, a double track, allowing street cars operating in different directions to pass each other. Freeport Road is bordered on the south by a retaining wall owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. There is an elevated space running along the base of this wall, between it and the curb of the highway sufficient in width to permit a person to stand thereon.</p>

After the street car moved forward he then proceeded to cross the street. When plaintiff reached the middle of the road, he hesitated or stopped for a second, looked to his right, and having observed no traffic approaching from that direction, he walked on. After he was a couple of steps beyond the middle of the highway he saw the headlights of the individual defendant’s automobile which was approaching from the right, according to plaintiff’s estimate, 160 or 170 feet away. Plaintiff continued across the highway, testifying that he was about three-fourths of the way across, when he was struck by the defendant’s automobile and hurled a distance of from 25 to 30 feet, suffering a fracture of his right leg, his right wrist and one rib, together with abrasions and contusions. The automobile of the defendant was damaged on the left side of the hood and front grille.</p>

    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[134,1453,1155,821]]]'>The controlling question, therefore, is whether the defendant traction company discharged the plaintiff at a manifestly dangerous place. It is the plaintiff’s position that the place of discharge was obviously perilous because there was no place to stand in safety on the southerly side of the street. The only evidence before the jury concerning the safety of the space beyond the curb on that side of the street was plaintiff’s statement that “If I stayed where I was, a car might have come down the other way and hit me, because there was nothing there but a little curb.” The only evidence regarding the size of the space between the retaining wall and the curb was testimony by one of plaintiff’s witnesses, Frank A. Cefola, to the effect that just about one person could stand there.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[254,349,1153,708]]]'>
      <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Under the testimony it is difficult to conceive how liability could be imposed on the defendant corporation. The plaintiff himself had stood on this space at the foot of the retaining wall for an interval before committing himself to the cartway. Even apart from witness Cefola’s testimony, the exhibits demonstrate that plaintiff’s statement that he might have been hit was a conclusion on his part, unsubstantiated by the physical facts and purely a matter of conjecture. The only conceivable way that plaintiff would be endangered if he remained where he was standing would be the wholly fortuitous circumstance of an automobile leaving the highway at that point.</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[247,1070,1155,984]],["BL_531.1",531,[129,363,1150,266]]]'>Most of the cases relied upon by the plaintiff are factually dissimilar from the instant one in that the dangerous conditions giving rise to liability were due to the presence of mounds of earth, an excavation, a pile of building stones or other extraordinarily hazardous conditions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <em>O’Malley v. Laurel Line Bus </em>Co., supra, the case principally relied upon by the plaintiff, is clearly inapposite. In that case a motorman on a dark, stormy night discharged a passenger at a place other than the regular bus stop, in the middle of the street, 16 feet from the curb. The plaintiff was struck by an automobile immediately after he stepped from the bus. Since the passenger had no opportunity to reach a point of safety, the facts supported a finding of negligence. In the instant case the defendant carrier did all that it was required to do under the law since the plaintiff was afforded and did reach a position of safety. That he subsequently, of his own accord, <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>abandoned that site for one more perilous would not stamp tbe entire area as a manifestly dangerous place under the decisions of this Court. There being no evidence of any actionable negligence by the defendant carrier, a nonsuit was proper.</p>

Where the evidence presents a factual issue properly submissible to the jury, judgment on the whole record cannot be entered under the Act of 1911: <em>Grande v. Wooleyhan Transport Co., </em><a href="/pa/353/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="353 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="465932" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0535-01">353 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20241" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="46 A.2d 241">46 A. 2d 241</a>; <em>Shapiro v.

After a careful scrutiny of the record we are of the opinion that irrespective of the question of defendant’s negligence, the testimony of the plaintiff establishes such negligence on his part that the court was bound to declare it as a matter of law. A pedestrian who traverses a street between intersections is required to exercise a higher degree of care for his own safety, while motorists are correspondingly held to a lesser degree of care and are not obliged to have their vehicles under instant control: <em>Rucheski v.

The plaintiff admits that he was crossing between intersections, but contends that this would not convict, him of negligence as a matter of law..That this is a correct statement of the law can hardly be denied, at this laté date, but it is equally, well settled that if a pedestrian voluntarily . walks into the path of an oncoming vehicle; when: it is. dangerously near, he is barred by his negligence from any recovery: Danks v. <em>Pittsburgh Railways Company, </em><a href="/pa/328/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="328 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1179703" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0356-01">328 </a><a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a><a href="/pa/328/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="328 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="1179703" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0356-01">Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2016" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="195 A. 16">195 A. 16</a>; <em>Watson v.

Illustrative in this regard are the following excerpts from plaintiff’s testimony: “A. No, I didn’t see it then [when he was in the middle of the street]. I took a couple of steps and seen it and thought I might as well keep going the way I was going. I thought I had a chance... I was just about in the center of the rails when I seen the headlights coming the other way. I saw the car come and I thought I could make it and I kept on going. . . A.

A. That is right.”. Plaintiff’s own conduct convicts him of contributory negligence for by gambling on the risk of injury he voluntarily placed himself in a position of peril.</p>

Another passenger who would request a motorman to take him to the Grant Building in Pittsburgh would certainly be surprised if the motorman climbed the curbstone with his car or bus, crossed the sidewalk and drove directly to the building’s entrance. Street cars have regular stops and no matter what may be the car rider’s request, the custodian of the car has no authority in law or by the nature of his employment to discharge the occupants of the car at a spot which traffic conditions Aiake dangerous. Although Eugene N. Harris, the plaintiff, indicated he wished to go to the Dixie Inn, he had reason to assume that either that place was a regular and protected car stop or that the motorman would stop at a point where it was safe for him to alight. The motorman, however, stopped directly (across the street) in front of the Dixie Drive Inn which is located between car stops. There was no sidewalk at the point where the plaintiff was required to alight. This Court has held numerously that “ ‘a common carrier for hire owes to its passengers the highest degree of care and diligence in carrying them to their destination and [in] enabling them to alight safely’ (Hughes v. Pittsburgh Transportation Co., <a href="/pa/300/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="300 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1125934" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0055-01">300 Pa. 55</a>) and to avoid any possible danger while doing so.” <em>(O’Malley v.

The plaintiff could not remain at the alighting spot forever. He had to leave some time. The curb on which he stood was “just about the width of one person” standing up. He could not sleep there. He could not live there. There were no restaurant facilities there. He was on a bare ledge no more than a foot wide. To argue that he was at fault in leaving this strip of concrete at 2 o’clock in the morning is to ridicule realities. The photographs introduced in evidence showed also that a concrete moulding overhung this narrow curbing strip so that the plaintiff ' even standing on one foot could not have rested at full <em>length </em>with his back to the wall.

Even if he <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>abandoned Ms original intention to go to the Dixie Inn, he still could not remain on his tiny island refuge where he could become a target for other traffic: “Q. If you had stayed where you are, you could have avoided an accident? A. If I stayed where I was, a car might have come down the other way and hit me, because there was nothing there but a little curb.”</p>

While admitting that a pedestrian may legally cross a street between intersections, the Majority still sees fault in the plaintiff’s attempt to get away from his concrete traffic prison cell.</p>
    <p id="b535-5" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[129,1067,1154,879]]]'>There is no evidence that the automobile which collided with the plaintiff was in sight when the plaintiff stepped into the cartway. Thus, he could not be convicted of contributory negligence for this original step. When he reached the center of the road an automobile loomed into view 160 to 170 feet away. The Majority says that “if a pedestrian voluntarily walks into the path of an oncoming vehicle when it is dangerously near, he is barred by his negligence from any recovery. Is an automobile “dangerously near” when it is 170 feet away, and the pedestrian has only 25 feet to travel? The Majority has no trouble in answering that question in the affirmative. Giving the plaintiff the benefit of every doubt, as we are required to do, I can only categorically answer that question in the <em>negative.</em>

He said: “I saw the car come and I thought I could make it and I kept on going.” Was it unnatural or unreasonable for him to assume that with a car 170 feet away he could negotiate 25 feet before the car reached him? The driver of the car apparently travelled faster than the plaintiff assumed he was travelling or perhaps even increased his speed as he bore down on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff became excited. If, in that stress of circumstance, he did what he should not have done the test of contributory negligence is not what, in retrospect, might have been the wise thing to do but whether he acted as a reasonably prudent person would have acted. As the plaintiff himself stated: “I tried to run. I got excited. <em>Everybody would try that ” </em>In a split second he had to decide whether he should pass in front of the car, dash back, or stand still. Any one of these possibilities offered a danger of its own. Whether his judgment was that of a reasonable man was a question for the jury, and, as we said in <em>Brown v. Beaver Val. M. C., </em>supra, “we are bound by its determination of it.”</p>

    <p id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[157,906,1150,991]]]'>This Court has also said to the point of saturation that in reviewing cases where the plaintiff has been nonsuited or judgment has been entered on the record that the evidence must be read in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff. <em>(Jones v.

However, in the instant case that rule has been honored more in the breach than in the observance. A street car passenger is discharged in a danger zone and, by force of necessity he proceeds to a point of safety when he is struck by a car whose driver must have seen him 170 feet away. Even if this testimony were regarded with cold, impassive neutrality uncolored by the advantageous inferences which, under our law, the plaintiff is entitled to, it still could not be said that what the plaintiff did was so devoid of reflection and innate care that he can summarily be ordered out of court on the grounds of contributory negligence.</p>

Upon appeal this Court reversed, saying: “If the person in charge of a car used for the carriage of passengers for hire, knowingly permits one of them to get off the vehicle at a dangerous place, which is not the usual stopping place, and the dangerous character of which the passenger could not see and did not know, the carrier will be liable for the resulting injuries, if any, to the passenger.”</p>
