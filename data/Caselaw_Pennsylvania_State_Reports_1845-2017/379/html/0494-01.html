      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>The basic controversy is whether or not Richard G. Rogers, son of Sue G. Rogers, the testatrix, received approximately $10,900.00 from his mother, in her lifetime, with directions from her to place it in her safe deposit box to which he had joint access. Apparently this the son failed to do. As executor of his mother’s estate he has not included such sum in his inventory and appraisement. Under the will testatrix’s son, appellant, was devised and bequeathed the entire estate and was named the sole executor. Testatrix’s husband, Dr. Charles A. Rogers, appellee, survived and elected to take against the will. He filed <em>exceptions </em>to the <em>inventory and appraisement </em>upon the ground that the executor should have charged himself with the fund above mentioned. The son filed an answer denying “that he owes the said estate approximately Eleven thousand ($11,000.00) Dollars” and demanded a jury trial. After a hearing the orphans’ court granted an issue to be tried by a jury. The son has appealed.</p>

The function and object of an inventory and appraisement in a decedent’s estate is to fix <em>presumptively </em>the existence of property in the possession of the fiduciary and the value thereof. This is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership and value. Such listing does not affect the true Ownership and value: <em>Stewart’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/137/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="137 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="821437" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0175-01">137 Pa. 175</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.%20554" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="20 A. 554">20 A. 554</a>; <em>Moore’s Estate (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/211/0338-02" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="211 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="940109,940160" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0338-02,/pa/211/0338-01">211 Pa. 338</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%20987" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="60 A. 987">60 A. 987</a>; <em>Hermann’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/226/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="226 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="967905" data-case-paths="/pa/226/0543-01">226 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.%20731" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="75 A. 731">75 A. 731</a>; <em>Fleming’s Estate, </em>10 Dist. 259 (Penrose, J.). The question of ownership is of interest to creditors, federal and state taxing authorities, and others.

It is true that in <em>Leadenham’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/289/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="289 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="1103348" data-case-paths="/pa/289/0216-01">289 Pa. 216</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20247" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="137 A. 247">137 A. 247</a>, a citation on the fiduciary to file a supplemental inventory embracing the disputed property was impliedly approved as a procedure for determining the question of title.

No evidence was presented by the son denying the foregoing testimony, nor was a claim made by him of a gift or other ownership. If at the audit of the account it should appear that the appellant holds this fund merely as custodian for the estate, the court will direct that it be placed in the fiduciary’s account for distribution. Should, however, the son deny ever receiving such money or, having received it, claim that he disbursed it in accordance with testatrix’s direction or should the son claim it as a gift, the court shall proceed to ascertain if a <em>substantial dispute </em>exists.
