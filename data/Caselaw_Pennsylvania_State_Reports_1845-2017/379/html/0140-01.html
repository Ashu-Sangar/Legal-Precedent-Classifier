The officers of the Home testified that upon the conveyance the premises would be kept and maintained “as a memorial to [testatrix’s] grandparents”. The corporate executor and trustee is satisfied that the claimant is qualified to take the devise according to the terms of the will. Georgiana Bead, the co-executor and co-trustee, refuses to join in the conveyance unless the claimant agrees to accept the devise under the “. . . <em>terms, conditions and restrictions enunciated and given to the [Home] by [testatrix] during her lifetime . .</em>

It also gives names of families who are excluded as guests or employes. In addition it specifies restrictions upon personnel of corporate directors.

The learned hearing judge correctly excluded this testimony. We agree that the judge was required to interpret the <em>words </em>as written in the will: “a dignified and proper home for elderly people as a memorial to [testatrix’s] grandparents.” Doubtlessly Miss Read sincerely believes that the oral testimony of testatrix’s conversations indicating her wishes made to appellant, to officers of the Home, and to attorneys, should have been admitted as proof of testatrix’s testamentary intent. Such contention is apparently without personal benefit to her. Her appeal is clearly within the orbit of what she regards as her loyalty and obligation to testatrix. Unfortunately for appellant’s contention, however, she is met with an insurmountable principle of law which prohibits the admission of such testimony. In a host of cases this Court has consistently decided that in construing a will, it is not what, testator may have meant but the meaning of the language used: <em>Rosen</em>
