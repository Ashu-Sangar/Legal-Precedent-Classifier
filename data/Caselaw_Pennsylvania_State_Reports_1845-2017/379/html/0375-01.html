The strictures now passed by the appellant on the conduct of the trial are unwarranted. The one cited instance of irritation shown by the trial judge occurred when it became necessary for him to caution a witness, called by the plaintiff, against any repetition of the witness’s gratuitous injection into the case of highly irrelevant and prejudicial matter and was directly provoked by the witness’s insolent and contumacious attitude toward the court’s justified rebuke. The ultimate exclusion of certain evidence, which the trial judge had invited plaintiff’s counsel to produce, was not error. The proffered testimony was at all times irrelevant and immaterial and had no proper place in the case.</p>

Uram sued The American Steel &amp; Wire Company of New Jersey for damages alleged to have been caused this farm by the smoke and fumes discharged from the defendant’s mill, from 1939 to 1945. In developing his case before the jury the plaintiff called Vincent Makovich, a neighboring farmer, to testify as to conditions on and about the Uram farm. Makovich had lived in the area of the mill all his life. He was accordingly asked by plaintiff’s counsel [Mr. Hoffman] if anything unusual had happened in Rostraver Township “with respect to the mill.” The witness began to reply: “Yes, sir, we had 22 people die in — ” when the following ensued: “Mr. Pruger: [Counsel for defendant] ‘Oh, wait just a minute. I could ask for the withdrawal of a juror for that remark, but I am not going to because I am satisfied with this jury, but this man knows better than to make a remark like that, and so does Mr. Hoffman. We are not trying a smog case here now.’ The Court: ‘Well, we have no knowledge that Mr. Hoffman had any knowledge that the witness would make such a remark.’ Mr. Pruger: ‘Mr. Hoffman does know because he has had this witness on be<a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>fore.’ The Court: ‘The remark was entirely improper and it is now stricken from the record and the jury is instructed to disregard it. It has nothing to do with this case, and you are not to be prejudiced by it in any way. If this witness did know what he was saying he was being extremely unfair and very improper. And if you do anything like that again, if you knowingly do it, I will hold you in contempt of court, and that is no laughing matter because <em>I will put you in jail.’ </em>”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>

The judge is the only person in the courtroom who carries a sword of punishment and while it is true the situation may arise where its use is imperative, it is still always better if the judge can compel respect and obedience without unsheathing the blade of contempt. From the moment that the Judge threatened Makovich, Makovich could only testify staring out at prison gates yawning for his arrival; from this same moment the jury could only look upon the witness as a potential jailbird; from this moment the effectiveness of Makovich as a witness was gone.</p>

John Protz was another witness called by the plaintiff <em>to testify to conditions </em>on and about the Uram farm. He had known this farm since boyhood. Asked about the farm he said that it was a good farm since 1940. The Court intervened: “The Court: Q. How can you testify that it was a good farm? Let’s hear what your knowledge is, your background. A. Well, my own farm, I farmed years ago and I ought to know by going <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>around and looking at it. Q. Were you on the Uram farm? Did you walk over it? How often were you there? How do you know <em>so much </em>about the Uram farm? That is the question.”</p>

How often were you there? <em>4. </em>How do you know so much about the Uram farm? One can only conclude from reading the record that the Trial Judge was wrathful with this witness too. Otherwise, what is the explanation for the gratuitous sarcasm: “How do you know <em>so much </em>about the Uram farm?” It is obvious that here the Judge was belittling Protz’ testimony. After these four rapid-fire questions put by the Judge, the witness only had an opportunity to reply to the last one as follows: “Well, when I was a youngster I knew about it when I walked these roads every day.”</p>

I am not trying to quote Mr. Hoffman directly, but Mr. Hoffman wants to know how you knew about the Uram farm in 1940.” This stricture about the witness not listening was entirely uncalled-for. There is nothing to suggest that John Protz was not listening. It might seem more likely that the Judge himself was not listening meticulously ■ because .after putting four questions he waited for only one answer. And then to charge Protz with holding up the case- for three weeks was a grotesque exaggeration which, held , the witness up to <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>ridicule before the jury. Veniremen who do not want at all to serve in the jury box are not inclined to look benevolently upon a witness or his principal who will keep them on one case “for three weeks.”</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[248,579,1149,429]]]'>Witness Protz explained that he was familiar with the Uram farm because: 1. He was a farmer himself and looked at the Uram farm. 2. When he was a youngster he walked the roads on which the Uram farm adjoined. 3. He travelled along the farm in an automobile “a good many times.” 4. He saw the farm with such regularity that he could see “it just kept fading away all the time.”</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[245,1022,1148,269]]]'>But the Trial Judge was not satisfied. To plaintiff’s counsel, Mr. Hoffman, he fretted: “Mr. Hoffman, this witness has not shown how he knows anything about this farm. You know that as well as I do. Now, let’s get down to facts. <em>Let’s not be wasting time.”</em>

Mr. Hoffman was endeavoring to present his case and the witness was explaining how he knew the Uram farm. But the Trial Judge was annoyed with this witness and went on to suggest that the lawyer had conspired with the witness to keep facts away from the Court. “You know that as well as I do,” the Judge frowned to the lawyer. In addition, the Judge, without intending to, threw some discrediting powder on whatever impression the lawyer had thus far made on the jury by suggesting that the lawyer was helping “to waste time.”</p>

Will you tell the Court and jury the extent of that smoke and where it went? A. Well, whenever the wind blows, whichever way the wind blows, they get it. If the wind blows east,-west* north or south, <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>whichever way the wind blows, they get it. Q. Whafc was the extent of it? A. Well, at times after a rain it seems to hold the smoke low. Of course when it — The Court: The question was the extent of the smoke coming out of the stacks, as I understand the question. Is that the question, Mr. Hoffman? Mr. Hoffman: That’s right. The Court: All right. The rain doesn’t have anything to do with that.” Here the Judge apparently decided to testify himself. Mr. Hoffman had asked the extent of the smoke “and where it went.” The witness testified the rain held the smoke low. This was a precise objective reply. But the Court interjected a meteorological observation which could not have failed to impress the jury, which looks upon the presiding judge, as indicated above, as the depository of all wisdom. Said the Judge: “The rain doesn’t have anything to do with that.” A dozen witnesses called by the defendant corporation to refute the testimony of the plaintiff’s witness could not have been half as effective as the Judge’s all-sweeping and categorical assertion that the rain could not hold the smoke down.</p>

Mr. Hoffman asked: “It is a fact, isn’t it, that some of this splendid land of yours is on tax duplicate for eight dollars an acre and some for $15 an acre?” Defendant’s counsel objected to this question and the Court reproved plaintiff’s counsel with the remark: “Mr. Hoffman, now . . . let’s not be trying to prejudice this case.”</p>

It would certainly be on the tax duplicate for considerably more than that if it were the land he makes it out to be. The Court: Are you going to bring experts in to prove that?

On this subject the Majority Opinion comments: “The proffered testimony was at all times irrelevant and immaterial and had no proper place in the case.” From my point of view this observation is as irrelevant and immaterial as the excluded testimony. The question here is not whether the evidence was proper but whether after demanding that it be produced the Judge could in fairness refuse to explain to the jury that it was he who had now decided that the evidence was not needed. The question is whether the plaintiff was not put in the light of having seemingly ignored a direct order of the Judge.
