The premises are located in a district zoned “Industrial”, a classification which does not permit the establishment of the proposed use without the grant of a variance. The petitioner did not propose to use the premises as a slaughter house, but only for the storage of live cattle and hides.

The nearest residences are 600 to 1000 feet away, with intervening industrial buildings or plants, including the alcohol distilling plants of Continental Distilleries and Publicker Alcohol Co. and an oil plant of Wilson-Martin, and a glue and fertilizer factory. Petitioner proposed to store the live cattle in 8 separate pens located 100 to 200 feet from the perimeter of the area and surrounded by a cyclone fence of steel mesh. It likewise proposed to lock the cattle securely within pens and had elaborate detailed plans to safely, so far as humanly possible, load, unload and pen the cattle. Protestants feared that cattle would escape and en<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>danger the neighborhood; also that offensive odors would permeate the air. Witnesses for petitioner testified that no offensive odor is given off by hides when they are treated, as petitioner planned, with salt and chlorinated lime; that they cannot be smelled beyond 50 feet, and that they are not palatable to roaches or vermin because of the salt. This is in contrast to other industrial activities conducted in the immediate neighborhood, some of which give off obnoxious odors.</p>

Cattle, of course, make the largest contribution to man’s carnivorous appetite and his propensity to adorn his body, home and personal accouterments with products derived from the hides of beasts belonging to the bovine genus. In every population center in the United States, areas are marked out for the retention of cattle for the convenience of city dwellers who thus may obtain food and pelt minus the transportation costs from distant stockyards. In the City of Philadelphia 24 establishments receive and store approximately one-quarter of a million live cattle per year.</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.7",562,[250,1182,1151,475]]]'>On December 6, 1951, the appellant here, Silverco, Inc., applied to the appropriate Zoning Board of Adjustment for a use registration permit which would allow the use of some 75,000 square feet at Swanson and Wolf Streets, Philadelphia for a cattle yard and hide house. The terrain involved was located in an industrial zone which, because of numerous nonconforming uses, had declined to an area of “least restricted” uses.</p>

After a hearing held on December 26, 1951, the Board granted the variance and issued a Use Registration Permit with the conditions that “all work is to be performed inside the building; that cattle will be housed at all times and never left to roam outside the building.” It was further understood that there would be no slaughter of cattle on the premises. Silverco ac<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>cepted the conditions, paid $80,000 for the property and proceeded to enter into the business for which he had acquired the land. Less than a month later the Board which granted the variance was supplanted by another Board which, on March 18, 1952, held a new hearing and then, on May 13, 1953, revoked the certificate of variance, thus torpedoing the $80,000 investment made by Silverco on the assurances and official authorization of the old Board.</p>
    <p id="b563-4" data-blocks='[["BL_563.5",563,[129,852,1151,321]]]'>The action taken by the second Board was, in my view, unwarranted, unjust and, according to law precedent, without legal justification. The second Board stated that the “safety and welfare of the surrounding community” forbade the presence and operation of a cattle yard at the place described.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.6",563,[124,1186,1157,594]]]'>It was testified on behalf of those protesting the cattle yard that such an establishment would give off offensive odors and that cattle might escape to the peril of people in the adjacent area. In cases of this kind, it is of course necessary to ascertain the character of the neighborhood in which the establishment is to operate. The area involved, which for many years was a coal yard and accommodated horse stables as well, is bounded by two railroad tracks with the nearest residences located some 1,000 feet away. A chemical plant lies across Wolf Street from Silverco.</p>

In order to test out the possibilities of the summertime, Board Member Cohen decided to go on another smelling expedition. Accordingly, in July, 1952, he repeated his investigations. The record ■ does not . show .what he smelt in July, but’since the supplemental findings of fact handed down. by the Board’, in October, made no mention of Summer., odors, it can reasonably be assumed that the weather of July did '-not add to the essences of Spring.

    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[124,858,1154,768]]]'>Those objecting to the granting of the variance argued, in addition, that cattle might escape from the Silverco establishment. The record shows that this objection was imaginative, illusory and to a certain extent self-inspired. A cow imprisoned within a thick-walled building behind steel meshed fences has as much chance of breaking through the numerous barriers as the processed products of beef and pork have of breaking out of the tin cans into which they have been hermetically sealed. Nathan Rosenberg, traffic manager for Silverco, testified that in 22 years of experience he had not one instance of cattle escape. It must be remembered at all times that the animals involved here are <em>domitae naturae, </em>not <em>ferae naturae.</em>

Five witnesses testified to seeing the notices, two witnesses testified to not seeing the notices. The Board believed, the two witnesses and disbelieved the five.

The Board discarded this vital testimony of an obviously disinterested wit<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>ness with the statement that the witness did not see the sign subsequent to that first observation.

    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[137,631,1154,436]]]'>(3) At the first hearing of the second Board, Samuel Silverberg testified that he saw the signs daily between December 14 and December 25, 1951. A member of the Board commented on Silverberg’s testimony: “We also have had to determine whether the notice was posted in accordance with the requirements of the Act, and we now have the statement of the gentleman. <em>We have everything we need on the </em>question.”</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[138,1079,1154,711]]]'>This comment would certainly indicate that the Board was satisfied that the premises had been properly posted. In its findings, however, on October 3, 1952, the Board brushed away Samuel Silverberg’s testimony cavalierly by saying that Silverberg had not testified at the second hearing. His failure to testify at the second hearing did not nullify the testimony at the first hearing which was accepted as bona fide by the Board. Moreover, the Board itself said that it did not want any repetitious testimony. It can also be noted that the Board itself could have called Samuel Silverberg if it had entertained any doubt as to his testimony given at the first hearing.</p>

In an extraordinary demonstration of fanciful logic, the Board declared that Nathan Silverberg was not to be believed because when he testified at the first hearing he had not mentioned the notices. Thus, we find the Board disbelieving <em>Samuel </em>Silverberg because he <em>did </em>testify at the first hearing and not at the second, and then disbelieving <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>
      <em>Nathan </em>Silverberg because he did not testify about the notices at the first hearing but did testify at the second ! It must be repeated here that at the first hearing the Board, after hearing Samuel Silverberg, said: “We have everything we need on the question” (of notices).</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[248,630,1154,1423]]]'>(5) The Board did accept the testimony of Oscar S. Bortner, member of the Philadelphia Bar. Bortner testified that on December 14, 1951, he personally obtained the notices from the Zoning Board of Adjustment and, with Nathan Silverberg, proceeded to the premises and posted them. The Board conceded that Bortner was a credible witness. In fact it paid him the compliment of saying that it accepted: “The testimony of Oscar S. Bortner at its full value.” It then went on to say, however, that “it is quite possible that the signs were removed after they were initially attached.” Of course, in this world of kaleidoscopic changes anything is possible, but it is to be hoped that in a legal proceeding, a presiding tribunal will not change its standards of proof from witness to witness. The Board would not believe that the signs had gone up at all because Mrs. Plunkett who testified to this fact could not, in the Board’s reasoning, have thrust her head through a window into a storm, although no one suggested she had. However, when a reputable member of the Bar categorically testified to putting up the signs, the Board then assumed that the signs immediately melted away. And this, in spite of <em>positive </em>testimony that they were seen from December 14 up to Christmas Day, plus the testimony of a photographer who took pictures of the notices on December 17th.</p>

It would be a burlesque on society to proclaim that citizens shall be properly shod, and then deny shoe manufacturers an opportunity to obtain the hides from which shoe leather is made. Of course, some areas are not adaptable to industrialization of any character; others are. It would appear that the zone here in question is peculiarly fit for the appellant’s type of business. Although the zone has been <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>labeled “Industrial,” it has over the years, as previously stated, been converted into an area of “least restricted uses.” If there is any suitable place for a cattle yard in a built-up locality, this is it, especially when we consider that the first Board laid down conditions which completely protected the surrounding neighborhood from any possible harm.</p>

People voluntarily living next to a limburger cheese factory should not be heard to complain against the cultivation of a few garlic bushes by their neighbors. It is to be noted also in this case that much of the protestations are based on a misconception. Many of the protestants believed that Silverco intended to conduct the business of a slaughter house.

The Zoning Board there granted a variance to permit the applicant to operate an abattoir at 838-840 Carpenter Street, Philadelphia.

On the foregoing evidence and having regard to the change of classification from ‘A Commercial’ to ‘Industrial’ the Board concluded that the neighborhood was predominantly devoted to ‘Least Restricted’ and ‘Industrial Uses’; that the granting of the application would in no way violate the spirit of the Zoning Ordinance; and that, under the circumstances, an undue hardship would result upon appellee if the permit were not granted.
