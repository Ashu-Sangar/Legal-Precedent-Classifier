The agreement in that case was, as here, between the buyer and the sellers of corporate stock. Defendants sold to plaintiff 395 shares of the Liberty Brewing Company stock, agreeing, inter alia, that with certain immaterial exceptions “. . . there are no debts owing by the Liberty Brewing Co., and if any other debts [except a first mortgage] be found that have been incurred by the Liberty Brewing Co. prior to October 10, 1920, that they . . .

It would be too narrow a construction of this undertaking, having in view the intention of the parties which it discloses, to hold, as appellants would have us, that the word debts does not comprehend taxes within the terms of this agreement. . . . As the manifest purpose of the agreement was to secure to the purchasers the value of the stock which they were buying and as the necessary effect of the levying of the additional tax was to reduce its value, these taxes were among the possible obligations against which the sellers were safeguarding the buyers. The vendors were responsible for the income tax return as it was made and they cannot escape responsibility to plaintiffs for what it failed to disclose under a narrow construction of the agreement which would not include taxes justly due and properly payable under the designation of debts.</p>

In that case plaintiff and defendant each owned 50% of the stock of a motor company. Defendant sold plaintiff his stock executing a written agreement under the terms of which plaintiff and defendant each agreed to pay one-half of whatever income taxes might be determined by the Federal Government to be due from the motor company prior to December 31, 1926. An additional tax was assessed against the motor company for the year 1923, which it or plaintiff paid. Plaintiff then brought an action in assumpsit against defendant on the aforesaid written contract and was allowed to recover 50% of the additional income tax so paid. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the company or the plaintiff actually paid the tax. The Court held it was immaterial whether the plaintiff or the motor company paid the tax and said: “. . . When the plaintiff purchased from the appellant and his wife their stock in the motor company, the consideration to be paid- therefor was determined by the assets and liabilities of the motor company as they existed at- that time..

The contract being for the protection of the plaintiff, a clear implication is that, if either the plaintiff or the motor company paid the tax, appellant would pay to the plaintiff one-half thereof.

Thus, the relationship of these affiliated corporations was that Barium wholly owned Clyde, and Clyde wholly owned Equipment as well as Manufacturing, which latter corporation had also become the transferee of all of the assets of Wiley Equipment Company as already stated. The Equipment Company, having so disposed of its assets, was formally dissolved on March 11, 1947, upon tlxe filing of articles of dissolution with the Secretary of the Commonwealth at Harrisburg.</p>

There is not the slightest suggestion in the evidence, nor could there be in the circumstances, that the Wileys had any knowledge that, the day following the closing under their contract with Barium, the latter would sell all of its Equipment Company stock to Clyde Iron Works and that Clyde, in turn, would sell the same stock to Wiley Manufacturing Company. Indeed, it was only on July 24th (just one week before the closing) that Barium had caused Manufacturing to be incorporated and organized, and there is no evidence that even Manufacturing’s name, let alone an interest on its part, ever figured in the transactions between Barium and the Wileys.</p>

In that case, the contract for the sale of realty by the defendants was, to the knowledge of all parties to the agreement, for the benefit of a- third person rather than the named vendee: see p. 278. Here, the warranty and guarantee were made for Barium’s own benefit and not for the benefit of another. Hence, exception (b) to Rule 2002 Pa. R. C. P. is not presently applicable.</p>

And, that, Barium was unable to show. The court below, apparently realizing the situation, assumed to allocate to Barium credit for Manufacturing’s payment of the deficiency taxes owing by Equipment but assessed against Manufacturing, the transferee of Equipment’s assets. This, the court did by disregarding the separate corporate entities in the chain from Barium through Clyde to Manufacturing and by then treating the deficiency taxes paid by Manufacturing as an expense to Barium. The decisions in this State will be searched in vain for a single instance where a piercing of the corporate veil has been judicially sanctioned in order to confer a benefit upon the ones responsible for the presence of the veil. Certainly, the opinion for this court in the instant case cites no such decision.</p>

There is no need to make a fetish of the non-current balance sheet when the parties did not intend it to be conclusive. The contract of July 3, 1946, expressly provided, — “That the representations and warranties contained [therein] shall in all material respects be true and correct as of the closing date . . .” which the contract fixed as July 31, 1946. Barium then knew as well as, if not better than, the Wileys the probable extent of Equipment Company’s liability for taxes. For upwards of four months immediately prior to .the execution of the contract of July.3, 1946, Barium had had its auditors, examiners and accountants in the Wiley Equipment Company’s offices and plant with full and unrestricted access to the Equipment Company’s records and books of account.</p>
