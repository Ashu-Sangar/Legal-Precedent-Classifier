The crew had been instructed by the yardmaster to pull certain cars from a track located inside the doors of one of the Jones &amp; Laughlin mills. This portion of the track together with all of the immediate area was owned by Jones &amp; Laughlin, although the entire spur track was constructed by defendant. The track inside the mill runs along a loading dock or shipping platform on which Jones &amp; Laughlin employes pile steel for loading into the railroad cars. On the other side of the track is a blank wall which prevents passage on that side while cars are standing on the track. A yellow line had been painted on the floor of the shipping platform about three feet from the edge to indicate to Jones &amp; Laughlin employes what space was to be left clear for the use of railroad employes.</p>
    <p id="b121-4" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[136,1641,1150,709]],["BL_122.1",122,[265,356,1148,931]]]'>Upon receiving the instructions from the yardmaster, plaintiff, who by virtue of his position as conductor was in charge of the shifting crew, took his train up to the closed door of the mill. He then entered the mill by another door and proceeded to the shipping office where he received from Jones &amp; Laughlin employes the bills of lading for the outgoing cars. The overhead door was then opened by employes of Jones &amp; Laughlin to admit the shifting engine. Plaintiff uncoupled the last car to be pulled out from those cars Avhich were to remain in the mill, and one of the brakemen coupled to the engine the car nearest the overhead door of the mill. Plaintiff then gave the <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>starting signal which was relayed by the brakeman to the engineer, who started the engine in motion to pull the cars out of the mill. Plaintiff walked down the loading platform toward the overhead door, keeping abreast of the cars which were being pulled out at a rate of speed of about two miles an hour. As he proceeded toward the door he observed a pile of steel three to four feet high protruding beyond the yellow line to about three inches from the edge of the platform, thus obstructing his way. Plaintiff then gave a signal to stop the train. After the train had stopped plaintiff attempted to pass between the steel and the railroad car, a space of about 15 inches. The leg of his overalls caught on the edge of the steel and he fell from the platform to the track, a distance of about three and one-half feet, sustaining the injuries for which recovery is sought.</p>

The opinion then continued: “However, plaintiff’s counsel contends that our attention should not be limited solely to the pile of steel which caused the accident but should include other factors as well, viz.; the blank wall on the other side of the track affording no walking area for crewmen, the limited width of the actual track area, and the congested or as plaintiff expressed it: The littered condition’ of the platform area with piles of steel sheets occupying the regularly established aisles set apart for use in moving the steel into position for shipment ... It was solely on account of these additional conditions that the case was submitted to the jury; for the express purpose of determining from them whether the defendant had any constructive notice of existing hazards at the place plaintiff was assigned to work. The issue therefore, was narrowed to the inquiry by the jury whether such congestion behind the cleared area along the edge of the platform was such as to warn defendant that there might be encroachments or impediments within that area as to interfere with plaintiff’s performance of the duties assigned to him.”. The court then held that because of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lavender, Administrator v.

However, the Act does require that plaintiff’s injury be caused at least in part by the negligence of the defendant. In the absence of negligence of the defendant as a causal factor in plaintiff’s injury, there can be no recovery. Where plaintiff’s evidence of negligence and causation amounts to nothing more than a scintilla, the court must enter judgment for the defendant as a matter of law: <em>Brady, Administratrix v. Southern Railway Co., </em><a href="/us/320/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="320 U.S. 476" data-case-ids="6142765" data-case-paths="/us/320/0476-01">320 U. S. 476</a>. The cases of the Supreme Court of the United States cited in the opinion of the court en banc and relied upon by plaintiff do not hold otherwise. It is true that in some of those cases there is language used in dictum which would tend to diminish the power of a court to exercise its usual judicial control of a verdict where plaintiff’s evidence falls below the minimum standard accepted as a basis for the establishment of liability. For example in <em>Lavender v. Kurn, </em><a href="/us/327/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="327 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="413818" data-case-paths="/us/327/0645-01">supra,</a> the authority principally relied upon by plaintiff, the ópinion stated at p. 653: “It is no answer, to say that the jury’s verdict involved speculation and conjecture. Whenever facts are in dispute or thé evidence is such that fair-minded men may draw different inferences, a measure of speculation and conjecture is required on the part of those whose duty it is to settle the dispute by choosing what seems to them to be the most reasonable inference. <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>Only -when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached does a reversible error appear. But where, as here, there is an evidentiary basis for the jury’s verdict, the jury is free to discard or disbelieve whatever facts are inconsistent with its conclusion. And the appellate court’s function is exhausted when that evidentiary basis becomes apparent, it being immaterial that the court might draw a contrary inference or feel that another conclusion is more reasonable.”. Although this statement seemingly enlarged the function of the jury under the facts of the case, it does not have the effect ascribed to it by plaintiff. It requires that the evidence be such “that fair-minded men may draw different inferences”, and that there be an “evidentiary basis” to support the jury’s verdict. The “speculation” portion of the above quotation was clarified by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Moore, Administratrix v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., </em><a href="/us/340/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="340 U.S. 573" data-case-ids="6931943" data-case-paths="/us/340/0573-01">340 U. S. 573</a>, 578, where the court stated: “. . . Speculation cannot supply the place of proof.”.

Plaintiff’s theory of negligence was that defendant did not furnish plaintiff with a reasonably safe place in which to work. It is contended that defendant was negligent in failing to provide clearance to permit plaintiff to pass on either side of the track because of the blank wall on one side and the obstruction on the platform on the other side. It is clear that no finding of negligence may be predicated upon the construction of the track itself. A railroad company has no duty of furnishing clear space for passage on both sides of standing cars. Although we have assumed in our statement of facts that there was insufficient space between a standing car and the blank wall to permit passage,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> there was ordinarily a space for free and unobstructed passage on the platform side. This is all that is required so far as construction is concerned. The rule that neither courts nor juries may determine engineering questions of this nature has been firmly established for many years: <em>Toledo, St. Louis &amp; Western Railroad Company v.

Plaintiff admits that the steel was always handled by Jones &amp; Laughlin employes and there is no possible basis for an inference that any of defendant’s employes placed the steel in such a manner as to obstruct plaintiff’s passage. In order to render de<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>fendant negligent plaintiff had the burden of producing evidence to show either that defendant knew of the presence of the steel and failed to cause it to be removed or that defendant should have known of the presence of the obstruction. There was no attempt made to show that defendant had actual knowledge of the existence of an obstruction in the passageway. In order to establish that defendant had constructive knowledge, plaintiff had the burden of producing evidence to show either that the steel had obstructed the passageway for an unreasonable period of time or that one of defendant’s employes other than plaintiff<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> had the duty of inspecting the premises for safety conditions and failed to do so with the result that the steel continued to obstruct the passageway when the accident occurred. No evidence was offered as to how long the steel was present in the passageway. The only possible inference permissible from the evidence is that it was not present when the previous shift was made about eight hours earlier. Plaintiff made some effort to argue that the yardmaster had the duty or at least the custom of inspecting premises for safety conditions before sending a crew to shift cars. However, plaintiff himself testified that he as conductor was in charge of the train and the crew, and plaintiff produced no testimony to the effect that the yardmaster had a custom or duty to so inspect nor any rule of the defendant railroad imposing that duty on the yardmaster. On the contrary, Rule 85 of defendant’s operating rules, introduced by defendant, indicates that the conductor <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>is responsible for the safety of the train and the conduct of the crew. There is nothing in the record to justify an assumption that the yardmaster had a duty to inspect the premises for safety conditions before sending a crew to shift cars, and such assumption to be of any effect would require the further completely unwarranted assumption that if the yardmaster had inspected he would have discovered the obstruction since there is no evidence whatever as to how long the obstruction was present. Under the evidence the steel could have been placed in the passageway only a few minutes before plaintiff was injured.</p>
    <p id="b128-4" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[263,1024,1147,1095]]]'>There is one other matter to be considered with respect to any possible negligence on the part of the defendant under the evidence, and that is the so called “littered condition” of the platform area behind the portion marked off as a passageway. Again there is no evidence that defendant had any notice of the manner in which Jones &amp; Laughlin piled steel in the area behind the passageway, and, what is more important, there is no evidence that any practices followed by Jones &amp; Laughlin employes in the handling and piling of steel in the area behind the passageway (which created no danger to defendant’s employes) were such that defendant could reasonably have anticipated that obstructions would be placed in the passageway area. Further, there is no evidence that there had been at any time in the past any encroachment by Jones <em>&amp; </em>Laughlin employes in piling steel into the area set aside as a passageway for the use .of railroad employes. There is no basis in the evidence for a finding of negligence oh the part of defendant on this' theory. ■</p>

Moreover, even if we assume that defendant was negligent, plain<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>tiff still cannot recover because the presence of the steel in the passageway or elsewhere was not the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury. Plaintiff saw the obstruction and stopped his train. He then had a choice of four possible courses of action: (1) he could have required the Jones &amp; Laughlin employes to remove the steel; (2) after stopping the train, he could have left the mill by the same route by which he entered; (3) he could have ordered the engineer to pull the cars past the obstruction, descended to the track level until he cleared the obstacle, then resumed walking out on the platform; or (4) he could have attempted to squeeze between the steel and the railroad cars. A choice of any of the first three courses would have permitted plaintiff to make a safe and easy exit from the mill. Eather than use any of the safe methods, plaintiff consciously and deliberately selected the only course which contained any real possibility of danger to himself. Plaintiff’s own foolhardy choice was the sole cause of his injury and cannot furnish the basis for a recovery against the defendant. Even if negligence by defendant is assumed, plaintiff’s actions were a superseding cause, and there is no causal relationship between the assumed negligence of defendant and the injury to plaintiff. Unless defendant’s negligence is the cause of plaintiff’s injury, there can be no recovery. See <em>Brady v. Southern Railway Co., </em>supra; <em>Moore v.

In that case, the plaintiff railroad worker was injured while moving a large pipe from a freight car across the freight house floor to the consignee’s truck. The pipe, being oily and greasy, slipped from the vehicle being propelled by the plaintiff, and he was injured. In the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County he recovered a verdict of $12,000, but this Court said:' “We can see nothing in that evidence that would justify a finding that defendant’s servants were negligent in handling the freight.

And with such a pronouncement this Court entered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States which found our Court to be in error in its position that the plaintiff assumed the risk of employment. The Supreme Court pointed out that the question of negligence in this type of case was to be determined from <em>all </em>the facts: “The negligence of the employer may be determined by viewing its conduct as a whole . . . And especially is this true in a case such as this, where the several elements from which negligence might be inferred are so closely interwoven as to form a single pattern, and where each imparts character to the others . . .</p>

An employe takes what his employer gives him. It is not for him to decide the equipment of the factory in which he works. He does not lay down the tracks over which, as conductor or brakeman, he is to shepherd the train to which he is assigned. Congress had attempted to wipe away the assumption of risk theory when it first passed the FELA, but courts throughout the nation, almost nostalgically or with incredulity that such a landmark in the law should really have disappeared, continued to charge injured employes with responsibility for the dangerous environment. in which they were compelled to work. To reaffirm what they thought they had made clear in the original Act, the Federal lawmakers then in 1939 added the amendment which was intended to relegate the <em>assumption of rish </em>doctrine to a relic in the museum of the law. In transparent language Congress declared that an “employee shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment in any case where such injury or death resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.” The Supreme Court of the United States, then, <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>affirming and approving the Congressional action, declared that the assumption of risk being dead and buried was not to be disinterred and re-introduced under some other designation. In language as clear as the morning sunrise, the Supreme Court of the United States said: “We hold that every vestige of the doctrine of assumption of risk was obliterated from the law by the 1939 amendment, and that Congress, by abolishing the defense of assumption of risk in that statute, did not mean to leave open the identical defense for the master by changing its name to ‘non-negligence.’ As this Court said in facing the hazy margin between negligence and assumption of risk as involved in the Safety Appliance Act of 1893, ‘Unless great care be taken, the servant’s rights will be sacrificed by simply charging him with assumption of the risk under another nameand no such result can be permitted here.” <em>(Tiller v.

Steel plates coming from a hot steel mill are not handled with the nicety of pancakes. The steel sheets in question measured 4 feet by 10 feet. A painted line could no more exempt them from the laws of gravitation and momentum than an oral command could.

At the trial the plaintiff alleged negligent operation of the car which struck the decedent and failure to provide a reasonably safe place in which to work. After the plaintiff’s evidence had been introduced, the defendant company moved for a directed verdict on the ground that no actionable negligence had been established. The trial Court granted the motion and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the decedent had assumed the risk of standing between the tracks and that, therefore, there was no duty owing to him by the railroad company. Specifically the Circuit Court said: “ ‘The conclusion is inescapable that Congress did not intend to enlarge the obligation of carriers to look out for the safety of their men when exposed to the ordinary risks of the business, and that in circumstances other than those provided for in the amended section of the statute, the doctrine of the assumption of the risk must be given its accustomed weight.’” (<a href="/citations/?q=318%20U.S.%2057" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="318 U.S. 57">318 U.

A fair generalization of the rule is given in the Senate Committe report on the 1939 amendment: ‘In justice, the master ought to be held liable for injuries attributable to conditions under his control when they are not such as a reasonable man ought to maintain in the circumstances.’ Of course in any case <em>the standard of eare must he commensurate to the dangers of the </em>business.” (pp. 66-67)</p>

There was no other place for him to walk. The cars in the train had no inseal (a ledge some 6 inches wide on the edge of the car). Deprived of a place to stand, the plaintiff was compelled to walk alongside the car. The general yardmaster, Melvin E.

The plaintiff does <em>not </em>have to show that the defendant’s negligence “caused plaintiff’s injury.” The plaintiff is only required to show that the defendant’s negligence contributed <em>in part </em>to the happening of the accident. The plaintiff may have been 65% at fault and the defendant only 35%, and the plaintiff could recover nonetheless, the amount of his verdict being reduced according to the degree his own negligence contributed to his injuries.</p>

It says, for instance, “It is clear that no finding of negligence may be predicated upon the construction of the track itself.” But it is <em>not </em>clear that no finding of negligence may be predicated upon the construction of the track. As a matter of fact, the jury could well have found that the construction of the track was one of the main causes of the accident. It cannot be questioned that if the track had been constructed with enough space on either side for the workmen to pass, the accident could not have happened. Was it negligence for the railroad company not to have constructed the track with a margin of safety on one side or the other? This was a question of fact for the jury.</p>

      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>The answer to this observation is obvious: How could the railroad company not have known of the presence of the steel? Steel plates measuring 4 feet by 10 feet do not blow around in a mill like autumnal leaves in a forest. The fact that so huge an accumulated bulk was present proves by its very presence that it must have been there for an appreciable period of time. At any rate, it was for the jury to decide whether the presence of the gargantuan bulk could have sprung up in a matter of minutes so as to exclude the possibility of the employer’s knowledge or whether so enormous a steelscape could only have been built up over such a period of time that railroad authorities could not help but have constructive knowledge of its existence.</p>

The Majority in its Opinion honors this rule with unbroken consistency by deciding every inference <em>against </em>the verdict winner. In doing this, it does what the Supreme Court of the United States said it should not do: “It is not the function of a court to search the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>record for conflicting circumstantial evidence in order to take the case <em>away from the jury </em>on a theory that the proof gives equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences. The focal point of judicial review is the reasonableness of the particular inference or conclusion drawn by the jury. <em>It is the jury, not the court, </em>which is the fact-finding body. It weighs the contradictory evidence and inferences, judges the credibility of witnesses, receives expert instructions, and draws the ultimate conclusion as to the facts. The very essence of its function is to select from among conflicting inferences and conclusions that which it considers most reasonable, [citing cases] That conclusion, whether it relates to negligence, causation or any other factual matter, cannot be ignored. Courts are not free to reweigh the evidence and set aside the jury verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions or because judges feel that other results are more reasonable.” <em>(Tennant v.

The cases in the United States Supreme Court reports and other Federal reports are legion that if the factual situation in any railroad employe accident is such that <em>some </em>negligence may be attributed to the railroad, the jury must decide whether liability in damages attaches. After reading the record in the present case I find it impossible to say there was no possibility at all that the railroad company could not have been responsible in negligence for the happening of the Finnegan accident. The Majority says: “Moreover, even if we assume that defendant was negligent, plaintiff still cannot recover because the presence of the steel in the passageway or elsewhere was not the proximate cause <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>of plaintiff’s injury.” In tlie light of the Supreme Court decisions and all other Courts that have authoritatively spoken on this subject, this conclusion on the part of the Majority is utterly insupportable in law and logic. <em>Proximate cause is as much a jury qiiestion as negligence itself. </em>If the Majority can assume that the defendant was negligent then it cannot take away from the jury the question as to whether that negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.

That result, deplorable as it is, is not, however, as damaging as the disservice it does to the concept of the seriousness and solemnity of jury findings. Nor is it as damaging as the disservice it does to the whole sociological, philosophical, and juridical program of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. This legislation represents a great social and economic advance in the centuries-old struggle against such inhuman and unjust doctrines as fellow-servant rule, contributory negligence and assumption of risk. To say that a railroader assumes the faults and careless conduct of his thousands of fellow-employes does violence to the most elemental sense of fairness. And yet up until 1906 courts gravely imposed such barriers to recoveries in the most meritorious of causes.</p>

Although a housewife, when her husband railroader departs for work, no longer bids farewell to him as if he were a soldier going to war, she still knows that behind every telephone ring there lurks the fear of bad news. Accidents, wrecks, derailments and explosions still form part of the saga of railroads.

The Federal Employers’ Liability Act seeks under Federal jurisdiction to accomplish the humanitarian results flowing from States Workmen’s Compensation Acts. While the FELA does not go so far as to provide for recovery in every case of death and injury, regardless of circumstance, it does say, as already indicated, that where negligence on the part of the railroad company in whole or in part is responsible for casualties, the railroad company shall make whole the resulting damage to the extent that a financial award can do so. The payment of such an award is as much a part of the legitimate expense of running a railroad as the maintenance of the right-of-way because it is known that even with every good will in the world, a switchman may fail to throw a switch, a brakeman may nod in the night watches, a defective wheel may break and a supervisor may fail to keep piled-up steel away from a railroad track.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">*</a>

Defendant seeks to exculpate itself from its failure to provide a reasonably safe place to work by the argument that if plaintiff ‘. <em>. . </em>thought the presence of the rivet heads and small pieces of pipe was creating a hazard, then all [plaintiff] had to do before beginning work was to brush it out.’ Defendant argues: ‘If [plaintiff] did not think it was hazardous, how can the defendant railroad company be held liable for failing to do so?’ Such considerations are foreign to the law of negligence under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act as declared by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Defendant’s negligence cannot be determined by examining plaintiff’s .conduct. </em>To do so would be to apply contributory negligence as a defense under the guise of ‘non-negligence’ of the defendant, which the Act prohibits.
