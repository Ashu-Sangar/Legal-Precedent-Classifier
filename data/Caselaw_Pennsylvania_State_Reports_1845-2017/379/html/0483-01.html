Roadman, brought this action in trespass to recover for personal injuries and property damage arising out of a collision between his automobile and a police patrol car owned by the defendant, City of Jeannette, and operated by defendant, James Bellone, a police officer of that city. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit as to the third defendant, West Penn Power Company. After trial the jury returned a verdict in plaintiff’s favor against the City of Jeannette and Bellone in the sum of $27,000. These two defendants filed motions for judgment non obstante veredicto and for new trial and also a motion to take off the nonsuit entered in favor of their co-defendant West Penn Power Company. The plaintiff, satisfied with the outcome, filed no motions. From the judgment entered on the verdict Bellone and the City of Jeannette appeal.</p>

The plaintiff was proceeding eastwardly on a 31 foot wide road which runs from the Borough of Irwin, Pennsylvania to the City of Jeannette, Pennsylvania, through the Boroughs of Manor <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>and Penn. As he approached the dividing line between the Borough of Penn and the City of Jeannette he was driving between 25 and 35 miles per hour some 500 or 600 feet to the rear of two cars occupied by certain of his friends. The two cars in front of the plaintiff were riding almost abreast and apparently were racing each other. The plaintiff was about to enter the City of Jeannette from the Borough of Penn when he suddenly observed a police car, about 35 feet distant, entering the road upon which he was travelling, from a vacant lot on the north side of the highway. The police car entered the highway from a position in the vacant lot where it was concealed from the view of the plaintiff by a house west of the lot, built close to the road. Plaintiff testified that the police car was being operated without lights and gave no warning of its exit from the lot and entry upon the road. When the patrol car first came into his view, plaintiff immediately sounded his horn, applied his brakes and turned to the right. The police car cut diagonally across the road in the direction of plaintiffs lane of traffic. The two cars collided, whereupon the plaintiff was thrown from his car and landed a short distance south of a utility pole owned and maintained by the defendant, West Penn Power Company. His automobile was forced to its right and off the paved portion of the highway, striking the utility pole. Almost instantaneously an electrical transformer, weighing approximately 900 pounds;, fell from the pole onto the plaintiffs car, and then in turn, on the plaintiff.</p>

Bellone drove-the police car-into the vacant-lot, turned <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>it around and waited a few seconds for the two cars in order to pursue them. Both police officers testified that the lights on their car were on low beam. The defendant Bellone admitted that the first time he saw the plaintiffs car was at the time of collision, although he could see a distance of at least 500 feet to his right, the direction from which the plaintiff was approaching. He gave no explanation as to why he failed to see it, permitting the conclusion that he did not look before or as he entered the highway.</p>

L. 905, as variously amended, the last amendment being the Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1368, 75 PS §212, a municipality is jointly and severally liable for damages caused by the negligence of its employe while operating its equipment upon a highway in the course of his employment. By virtue of other sections of the Act a police car operated in the chase or apprehension of violators of the law, or persons charged with or suspected of any such violation is exempt from the statutory limitations regarding speed (§1002(f), 75 <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>PS §501); traffic signals (§1026(d), 75 PS §635); entries upon through highways (§1016(d), 75 PS §591), and, when operated upon official business they are exempt from the right-of-way rule (§1014(b), 75 PS §573), upon giving audible signal of their approach. These exemptions, however, are conditioned upon the vehicle being operated “with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway”, and they do not shield the driver or the city “from the consequences of a reckless disregard of the safety of others” or “from the consequences of an arbitrary exercise of the right of way”: <em>Mansfield et al. v.

    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[245,1245,1150,1038]]]'>The record reveals that the plaintiff met his burden. Accepting as true the evidence adduced by the plaintiff, the jury would certainly be justified in concluding that the officer in entering a through highway from a vacant lot without any audible or visible warning of his approach was operating his car in a reckless manner. See <em>Mansfield et al. v. Philadelphia et al., </em>supra. It was the jury’s prerogative to choose between the two conflicting accounts for the evidence presented issues of fact properly determinable only by that fact-finding tribunal. Furthermore it is questionable whether the police officer was engaged in the type of emergency duty that would clothe him with immunity under the provisions of The Vehicle Code.

      <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>Appellants contend next that the plaintiff, by his own admission as to his speed and the testimony adduced by the defendants regarding the distance he skidded, clearly demonstrates that he was exceeding the speed limit at the time of the accident and that this was the sole proximate cause of the accident. The difficulty with appellants’ position is that for the purpose of this appeal we must assume that the jury rejected their testimony and accepted the plaintiff’s. According to the plaintiff, when he first observed the patrol car he was still some ten feet within the confines of the Borough of Penn. The evidence discloses that signs were posted in Penn in accordance with The Vehicle Code, indicating a speed limit of 25 miles per hour. Although the City of Jeannette purportedly had the same speed limit, no signs were posted, and as a result the city’s local ordinances or regulations would not be enforceable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Assuming that this language is to be construed literally, and plaintiff under the most favorable interpretation thereof must be held to have been travelling in excess, however slightly, of the speed limit in Penn Borough, it was still for the jury, as it was instructed by the trial judge, to determine whether the speed at which plaintiff was travelling was a proximate cause of the accident. A <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>speed in excess of that legally permitted will not impose liability upon the driver of an automobile, unless it is shown that such speed was the proximate cause of the accident: <em>Wilson Freight Forwarding Co., Inc. v.

The plaintiff testified that when he first saw the police car and applied his brakes he travelled about 35 feet before the collision and about 35 feet after the impact. The eye witness Sabo corroborated the plaintiff as to the latter distance. The case in this respect is similar to <em>Wermeling v.

We do not agree. The plaintiff, who was 28 years of age at the time of the accident, was employed by the Westinghouse Air Brake Company at . a salary of $60 a week. He proved loss of earnings, from the time of the accident to the time- of trial, a- period of 102 weeks, in the amount of $6,120. The evidence shows that the <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>plaintiff will also sustain future losses because of Ms inability to continue in tbe same type of employment. He suffered multiple fractures about tbe pelvic region, severe lacerations of his forehead and left thigh, and paralysis of both legs for a period of two weeks. Plaintiff was hospitalized for approximately six weeks and was afterwards confined to his parents’ home for about two months and for many months was able to move about only on crutches. He incurred expenses totalling $2,090.75 for hospitalization and medical treatment and there was testimony that he will be required to expend additional sums in the future. His automobile was completely demolished, resulting in property damage of $1,000 after making allowance for salvage value. There can be no question that the plaintiff endured considerable pain and inconvenience, in fact he was still suffering pain at the time of the trial, almost two years after the accident. His testimony regarding extreme pain and suffering was corroborated by his father and his doctors. We are reluctant to interfere with the deliberate judgment of the jury regarding the amount of a verdict in a personal injury case which is supported by the opinion and approval of the trial judge and confirmed by the court en banc: <em>Huey et vir. v.

The bottom of the transformer rested against a kicker arm or another cross arm designed to hold the transformer in a position perpendicular with the pole.

    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.5",549,[140,516,1151,1835]]]'>However, some intervening negligent acts which operate upon a condition created by an antecedent tortfeasor do constitute superseding causes and relieve him of liability. In determining whether an intervening force is a superseding cause we said in <em>Hendricks v. Pyramid Motor Freight Corp., </em><a href="/pa/328/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="328 Pa. 570" data-case-ids="1179639" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0570-01">328 Pa. 570</a>, 574, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%20907" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="195 A. 907">195 A. 907</a>, 909: “The answer to this inquiry depends on whether the [intervening] conduct was so extraordinary as not to have been reasonably foreseeable or whether it was reasonably to be anticipated.” The Restatement, Torts, §435(2), (1948 Supplement, p. 736) says: “The actor’s conduct is not a legal cause of harm to another where after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor’s negligent conduct, it appears to tne court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.” Cf. Restatement, Torts, Penna. Annotations, §442. In view of the particular circumstances of this case, — including the recklessness with which the police car was operated, the location of the pole on private property, the force of the blow which moved the pole one inch from its base, and the fact the plaintiff was thrown out of his car and landed on the very spot on which the transformer fell, after glancing off plaintiff’s car, — we conclude that the manner in which the Power Company maintained its transformer on the pole was not a legal cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. These facts distinguish this case from <em>Nelson v. Duquesne Light Co., </em>supra, upon which appellants principally rely. As the question is one of superseding cause, and there is no dispute as to the pertinent facts, the court may decide it as a matter of law: <em>Hendricks v. Pyramid Motor Freight Corp., </em>supra; Restatement, Torts, §453.</p>
