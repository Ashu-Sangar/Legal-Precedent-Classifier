The defendant was to have the right to order from Gunnison Homes and have delivered not in excess of 60 houses in the Union Manor Plan, “it being understood . . . that you [Home Builders] . . . shall continue to be the authorized franchised dealer for Gunnison Homes, Inc. . . . for Lawrence County . . . during the entire period of this agreement.”</p>

The defendant paid the plaintiff only $900.00, which it paid at the time of the execution of the contract of May 3, 1950.</p>

[Home Builders] shall continue to be <em>the </em>authorized franchised dealer for Gunnison Homes, Inc. . . . for Lawrence County . . . during the entire period of this agreement.” This construction we cannot adopt. The parties were competent business men. On trying to read into the contract the words “sole and exclusive” this case is somewhat similar to <em>Dahath Electric Company v. Suburban Electric Development Company, </em><a href="/pa/332/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="332 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1186582" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0129-01">332 Pa. 129</a>, 133, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 A.2d 765">2 A. 2d 765</a>, in which this Court said: “As heretofore stated, parties to this contract, competent business men, had they contemplated an exclusive agency, would we think have so provided in their written agreement. It could not be properly or justly concluded that they left this most important feature of the agreement out to be read into it by inference.” If there is any doubt or ambiguity in the contract it must be construed against the defendant who is the party who wrote it. See <em>Commonwealth to use v. Henry W. Horst Company, </em><a href="/pa/364/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="364 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1223584" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0403-01">364 Pa. 403</a>, 406, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="72 A.2d 131">72 A. 2d 131</a>, in which this Court stated: “Furthermore, this contract was prepared by defendant and in the event of doubt, a writing will be construed against the party who has drawn it [citing cases].”</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[265,1696,1145,312]]]'>Apparently the defendant needed the houses immediately, and therefore provided in the agreement it drew that it should order them directly from Gunnison and have them shipped to it. It did not want to order them through the plaintiff and have the plaintiff order from Gunnison.</p>

But only Gunnison Homes can object to this, and it is not objecting here. See §176, Restatement, Contracts. See also <em>Nolan et al. v. J. &amp; M. Doyle Company, </em><a href="/pa/338/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="338 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="1199906" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0398-01">338 Pa. 398</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%2059" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="13 A.2d 59">13 A. 2d 59</a>.</p>
    <p id="b315-3" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[138,574,1150,993]]]'>The defendant next contests the authority of its vice-president to sign the agreement of March 3, 1950. This question was first raised in the oral argument before the court en banc. It was stipulated and agreed between the plaintiff and defendant at the time of trial that the letter of May 3, 1950, constituted the agreement between the parties. In addition, Ira Hurwick, who signed the contract for the defendant as vice-president, is the same person who signed the affidavit of defense in the present suit. Nor did the defendant plead this as an affirmative defense. The present contention by the appellant is therefore raised too late. The defendant procured under this contract the delivery of eight houses, two of which are admittedly unpaid for, and thus must be held to have ratified the informal execution thereof: <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. Schmidt, </em><a href="/pa/254/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="254 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1025449" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0351-01">254 Pa. 351</a>, 357, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20964" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="98 A. 964">98 A. 964</a>; <em>Yezbak v. Croce, </em><a href="/pa/370/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="370 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1234585" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0263-01">370 Pa. 263</a>, 268, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%2080" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="88 A.2d 80">88 A. 2d 80</a>.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[138,1579,1151,648]]]'>Lastly, the defendant contends that the contract provided that payment was to be made “when final settlement is made on the permanent mortgage covering each house,” and that there is no proof of this fact. The lower court allowed interest on 22 houses (two ordered and not paid for before July 12, and twenty ordered and not paid for after July 12, 1950) from the date of suit, which was filed January 29, 1951. The defendant at the trial stated: “I will agree that the houses have been permanently financed, the dates I cannot give you at the moment but if the Court desires them we will furnish them.”</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[210,2248,552,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
