Thus the statute provides for an appeal “as to alleged legal errors,” and “as to the justice thereof [the life imprisonment].” When the fourth offender statute was enacted, the Commission of the Legislature appointed to study this phase of the New York Baumes Act reported :</p>

It is as true that some men should be imprisoned for life after their first offense as unregenerate criminals as it is true that other men after the commission of their fourth offense should not be locked up for the balance of their natural lives.</blockquote>

We quote with approval from Judge Levinthal’s observations in the court below: “. . . every Pennsylvania fourth offender enjoys the right to a full hearing on the question of the propriety of a life sentence in his particular case. A judicious determination of this matter must be based upon an understanding of the defendant’s background, the extent of his education, his age, mentality, temperament and health, as well as a consideration of the several crimes of which he stands convicted, their tendency to show antisocial characteristics, their violent or non-violent nature, the presence or absence of confederates, the motive for their commission, the amount of money or other property involved, and all the other factors and circumstances bearing upon the ultimate decision whether the interests of justice and the welfare of society require that the particular individual be incarcerated for the balance of his life.”</p>
    <p id="b73-5" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[168,1520,1148,655]]]'>Judge Levinthal found specifically as a fact that: “The following remarks of the sentencing judge, appearing in the official transcript of the hearing, make it perfectly clear that he considered it as his statutory duty to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, without regard to any of the surrounding circumstances.” Judge Levinthal, therefore, found as a fact that which the Supreme Court of the United' States had not found, that is, that the sentencing judge considered the sentence mandatory. He also found as a conclusion of law that under the Act the sentence was not mandatory.</p>

He was further indicted on twelve bills Nos. 251-262, July Sessions, 1943, each charging him with receiving stolen goods. On July 26, 1943, he pleaded guilty to the charge of receiving stolen goods in each of the last mentioned twelve bills. He was represented by counsel at the time. Following an unsuccessful attempt to escape from prison for which he was also sentenced, he was later brought to trial on bills Nos. 461 and 462 June Sessions, 1943, on February 25, 1944. After trial in which he was represented by counsel he was convicted on both bills and sentenced to the Eastern Penitentiary. On May 4, 1944, a proceeding was instituted charging him with having committed a fourth felony within five years of the last prior felony conviction of the crimes specified in Section 1108 (a) of The Penal Code, 18 PS §5108 (a).</p>

In his mind an appeal to a higher court for modification of the life sentence could fall into the category of a petition to the Pardon Board for clemency, where a petition is scarcely ever filed until there is some substantial compliance with the original sentence. Certainly if Gryger had had an attorney to defend him, especially in view of the State’s assumption of the expenses involved, an appeal would have been lodged.

The caption on these notes of testimony not only affirms that the proceedings included the consideration of Bills Nos. <em>461 </em>and 462, but the testimony recites the incidents concerning the charges advanced in those bills. Furthermore, the transcript was filed and made part of the record of the burglary case at No. <em>461, </em>to which the defendant had pleaded not guilty.</p>

It would perhaps need to be conceded that if the indictment constituted the only written entry in the archives of the case, the integrity of the court records might prevail over oral testimony, or even official recollection as to what had occurred in Courtroom No. 453 on July 26, 1943. The facts, however, are otherwise. ' The notes of testimony, which are official and uncontradicted, reproduce accurately the disposition of the charge of attempted burglary (No. 461) on July 26, 1943. And then there are the items of the return of the exhibits, the withdrawal of the indictments from the pending files, and the other incontrovertible evidence, already referred to, of a <em>fait accompli.</em>
