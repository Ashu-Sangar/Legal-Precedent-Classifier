The complaint in equity was filed by two of the partners, plaintiffs. The answer and defense of the remaining two partners, the defendants, was that the transaction was illegal because three of the partners were officers and employes of the United States Government and the partnership was rendering service to contractors who were dealing, and had contracts, with the Government. As to one item defendants contended plaintiffs had no interest whatever. The court below decided that plaintiffs were not engaged in any illegal transaction against which defendants could .defend and that plaintiffs were entitled, within defined limits, to a share of profits and royalties in the article questioned. The appeal followed.</p>

The defendants are two brothers, Robert W. and Edward T. Butler. Edward was an officer in the Navy from 1942 to 1945. Robert was not associated with the armed forces in either a military or civilian status. Plaintiffs, while stationed at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, Silver Springs, Maryland, invented a chemical formulation and a method of applying it known, generally, as the “cocoon pack” process, consisting of the preparation and application of a plastic coating for the protection of aircraft, guns, turrets, machinery, etc. Plaintiffs applied for letters patent on this process.

That being its sole purpose it is impossible to discover how this agreement violates the four sections of Title 18 of 'the United States Code Annotated as appellants contend..It does not violate 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 202 (Supp. II, 1949..). which prohibits an officer of the United States from asking for or accepting a bribe. <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>There is no evidence that either plaintiff asked for or received any gratuity in the nature of a bribe in connection with the R.

There can be, then, no connection between the Hollingshead contract and the agreement of December 7, 1945. The same reasons apply to defendants’ contentions in connection with the other three sections of the United States Code Annotated: 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 216 (Supp. II, 1949), which forbids an official to receive any money or property for procuring or aiding to procure any contract from the United States; 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 281 (Supp. II, 1949), which forbids an official to receive compensation for rendering service in relation to any proceeding, contract, claim or controversy, in which the United States is a party, before any bureau, officer, or any civil, military or naval commission; and 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 434 (Supp. II, 1949) which forbids an officer or agent of any corporation, association or firm directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary profits or contracts of any corporation, association or firm, to be employed as an officer or agent of the United States for the transaction of any business with such corporation, association or firm. Neither plaintiff, the record discloses, procured a contract from the United States, received any money or property for procuring a contract, received compensation for rendering any of those enumerated services, nor were officers or agents of any corporation, etc., transacting business with the United States Government. Aside from the fact that there is no basis in this record for defendants’, assertions, all of the illegal acts in connection with the • Hollingshead contract which the defendants say nullify the December 7, 1945, <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>agreement were completed and finished <em>long before this agreement loas signed.</em>

This maneuver is then buttressed by the argument that the agreement of December 7, 1945, is either a continuation of the earlier illegal agreement or is itself illegal. The fallacy is that the defendants fail to realize that the earlier agreement is nothing but a statement of plans which failed to materialize. The only intervening acts for which it might be contended that the plaintiffs could possibly be held to be es-topped from seeking relief from defendants are those acts allegedly in connection with the procurement of the Hollingshead contract.

As to the partnership the concealment of his name was a collateral incident which did not vitiate the status of the partnership itself or so taint it as to preclude plaintiff from obtaining an accounting from defendant. One of the limitations of the doctrine of coming into equity with unclean hands is that the wrongdoing of the plaintiff must have been in reference to the very matter in controversy and not merely remotely or indirectly connected therewith: Comstock v.

The “cocoon pack” process consists of a plastic coating for the protection of metal such as aircraft, guns, machinery, etc. “Mastic” is a bitumastic application over the “cocoon pack” to render it more waterproof and durable. In resisting liability .for accounting to plaintiffs for the use of “mastic” defendants contend that the written agreement of <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>December 7, 1945, does not include the development of “mastic”, that there is no evidence which would indicate that the parties were co-owners of the “mastic” formula, that there is no evidence that the plaintiffs participated on an equality with the defendants in the management of that business, or that there was any agreement to share in the profits or losses. The Chancellor, however, made findings to the contrary. Findings of fact made by the Chancellor, affirmed by the court in banc and supported by competent evidence, have the force and effect of a jury’s verdict. The Chancellor found that the parties extended their operations in April or May of 1946 to the development of the “mastic” product and that the plaintiffs rendered chemical engineering and technical services in connection therewith similar to those performed in connection with the cocoon plastic. The defendants also had, as with the other process, handled all the business negotiations with reference to mastic. No express agreement, written or oral, was found to exist whereby the plaintiffs were to share in the profits from mastic. There is evidence that neither of the defendants performed any technical or scientific work with respect to the mastic process, but that plaintiff Holst spent about ninety per cent, of his time on this process and plaintiff Hersam spent a considerable amount of his time preparing specifications and directing demonstrations thereof. Since these services were of the same character as had been rendered in connection with the cocoon process, the conclusion of the court below that there was an extension of the partnership to the new activities is a compellable inference which will not be disturbed.</p>
