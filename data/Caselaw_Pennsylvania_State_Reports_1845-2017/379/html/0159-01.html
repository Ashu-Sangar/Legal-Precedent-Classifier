For the purpose of determining the corporation’s net income for the taxable year, Section 2 of the Act defines net income as being the net income “as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government.” And, that is exactly the basis upon which the Commonwealth taxed these corporations for the year 1944. The majority opinion, by construing the phrase “ascertained by the Federal Government” to mean the taxpayer’s ultimate <em>federal </em>tax liability after adjustments for deductions allowed by further federal legislation, thereby cuts down what was and still truly remains the taxpayer’s net income received in the year 1944.

True enough, the federal government granted them large refunds on their federal income taxes for 1944 by reason of further deductions federally allowed. But that had nothing whatsoever to do with their liability for the Pennsylvania corporate net income tax on each dollar of net income received by them in 1944.

That case involved the Pennsylvania Emergency Profits Tax Act of 1923, P. L. 876, which is substantially similar to the Act of 1935, supra. It imposed a tax “upon each dollar of the net income of such corporation, during the calendar years” 1923- ahdT924. It defined-net income as “net income for the calendar or fiscal year as returned to the Federal Government . . .” and required the taxpayer to furnish the Auditor General- with a true copy of its <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>federal tax return. In the <em>Chamber sburg </em>case the taxpayer had deducted on its State return for 1923 a net loss suffered in 1921 which was a permissible deduction under the federal income tax law then in effect. In sustaining the Auditor General’s disallowance of this deduction, we there said,- — “Appellant contends that the net income of a corporation upon which the emergency profits tax is to be paid, is the amount of net income upon which income tax is required to be paid to the United States. We do not so construe the act. It defines net income as the net income <em>returned </em>to the federal government, not that on which tax is paid to it, and assesses the tax ‘upon each dollar of the <em>net income </em>of such corporation’ during the two years 1923 and 1924. From no language of the act can the inference arise that, so far as the State of Pennsylvania is concerned, losses sustained in prior years are to be deducted from the net income for the two enumerated years. . . . But our act . . . assesses the tax on the actual net income for the named years, not the sum to be taxed as arrived at by the federal authorities after such deductions as may seem proper to them.” The majority opinion assumes to distinguish the <em>Chamber sour g </em>case by saying that the statutory imposition there was upon the net income as <em>“returned </em>to the Federal Government.” That is a wholly immaterial differentiation. The addition of the words “ascertained by” would not have altered the decision in the <em>Ghambersburg </em>case; its rationale plainly so confirms.</p>

In so holding, we said, — “This anomaly arises from the fact that the Pennsylvania Taxing Act takes the corporation’s annual return as made to and ascertained by, the Federal Government as the basis of the annual tax it imposes on corporations doing business in Pennsylvania. But this <em>bookkeeping </em>fact does not affect the <em>political </em>fact that the command to tax the net income emanates from the sovereignty of Pennsylvania and not from the sovereignty of the United States.

For, while adverting to this court’s recent germane decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

The <em>Western Maryland </em>case leaves not the slightest doubt that <em>there can be no estoppel against the sovereign </em>acting in its governmental capacity. As Chief Justice Stern said in the <em>Western Maryland </em>case, — “We find no basis whatever for the contention that the Commonwealth has been estopped by reason of the failure of officials who, acting under a mistaken impression of the applicable law, either did not impose the taxes or compromised them for lesser amounts than were properly due. ... It is a fundamental legal principle that a State or other sovereignty cannot be es-topped by any acts or conduct of its officers or agents in the performance of a governmental as distinguished from a proprietary function. No errors or misinformation of officers or agents can estop the government from collecting taxes legally due. However firmly established the rule as to private individuals or corporations that where a person has been induced to act to his detriment by the representations of an agent he <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>can hold the principal on a theory of estoppel, that rule does not apply when a government is the principal.”</p>

And we think that the ‘recent transactions’ to which this Court has declared a tax law may be retroactively applied [citing case] must be taken to include the receipt of income during the year of the legislative session preceding that of its enactment.” From that, the majority “decide that a tax may not be retroactively applied beyond the year of the general legislative session <em>immediately preceding that of its enactment; </em>to provide otherwise constitutes a denial of due process. For this additional reason the Act of 1947, as applied in this case to 1944 corporate net income denies to each of the appellants [sic] Due Process and is void.” The error in the foregoing reasoning is at once evident. The year that the Act of 1947 struck at was not 1944 but 1946, the year of the losses which the 1947 Act conclusively and unquestionably put at an end for carry-back purposes. The spread of application <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>which the federal law gives such losses does not determine the scope of the 1947 Act’s retroactivity.</p>

A taxpayer has no vested right to a deduction or exemption in determining his income subject to tax. Such allowances are a matter of legislative grace and may be taken away at any time without offending either the Federal or State Constitution. Their termination does not constitute a deprivation of property without due process. In <em>Deputy v. </em>DuPont, <a href="/us/308/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="308 U.S. 488" data-case-ids="6141883" data-case-paths="/us/308/0488-01">308 U.
