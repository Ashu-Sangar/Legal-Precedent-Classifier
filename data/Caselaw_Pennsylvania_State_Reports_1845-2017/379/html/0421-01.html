In settlement and compromise the parties agreed and stipulated the proportions in which decedent’s estate should be <em>distributed. </em>One of them subsequently repudiated the agreement alleging that she had been induced to execute the document through fraud and misrepresentation. The court below found against such allegation. The appellant contends that the Orphans’ Court does not possess jurisdiction to decide this question since the litigation is between <em>two living persons </em>and that the issue must be relegated to the court of common pleas. This contention is contrary to specific enactment of the Legislature and numerous decisions of this and the Superior Court.</p>

The undeleted facts, however, as found by the auditor appear in the original record and are approved by the court. The <em>condensed </em>facts found by the auditor are: “Alvin J. Way died testate a resident of the Borough of State College, Centre County, Pennsylvania, November 18, 1948. The decedent left a last will and testament dated May 17, 1934, wherein he gave all of his estate unto Hazel Keller, provided she took good care of him during his lifetime, and which will was probated in the office of the Register of Wills of Centre County, Pennsylvania, January 31, 1950. Hazel Keller entered into a written article of agreement dated November 22, 1948, with Robert J. Way, son of the decedent, agreeing to a distribution wherein she should receive <em>35% </em>of the estate; and, inter alia, that she would not contest the probate of a previous last will and testament of said decedent dated August 17, 1929. That the attorney' selected to settle the differences arising between Hazel Keller and Robert Way was the attorney of Miss ■ Kéller’s choice. Hazel Keller and Robert J. Way specifically sought the services of Mr. Dunaway, a- member of the Centre County Bar, to reach an amicable adjustment of their respective rights in the estate of Alvin J. Way, deceased. The said parties did enter into the written agreement of November 22, 1948, providing for distribution as between the par<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>ties which was partially carried out insofar as the items of household furniture were concerned. There was no fraud employed to induce Miss Keller to sign such agreement, and she distinctly understood her rights under such agreement. Hazel Keller, at the time of the execution of such agreement, was a person over the age of 21 years. Under the terms of such agreement Hazel Keller is to get 35% of the net estate. There was no mutual mistake of the parties either in fact or in law at the time of the execution of said agreement, the same having been entered into to compromise their differences and to avoid litigation between the parties over the respective wills of 1929 and 1934. The agreement above referred to is the result of the expressed purposes of both Miss Keller and Kobert J. Way to compromise their differences but securing the best settlement to Miss Keller that could be gotten without going into court.” These findings, including those in the original record, are abundantly supported by the testimony and should not be disturbed: <em>Harbaugh’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="320 Pa. 209" data-case-ids="1163614" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0209-01">320 Pa. 209</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.%20394" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="182 A. 394">182 A. 394</a>; <em>Istocin’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa-super/126/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="126 Pa.

Decedent was aged seventy-eight years at death; appellant was then thirty-nine; decedent had been appellant’s “boss” at a college in the borough; she came to live with decedent and his wife as a roomer or boarder; after the wife’s death appellant became decedent’s “housekeeper”; she continued as such from 1930 to decedent’s death in 1948. There is testimony that decedent suffered from a severe heart attack and also had cataracts surgically removed from both eyes. Appellant was obliged to read to decedent. She had and used a letter of attorney from decedent and transacted business for him. At sometime prior to decedent’s death appellant consulted decedent’s lawyer; she showed him the paper of 1934; the lawyer testified that he told her it looked like a good will, but that he thought she “would have a lot of trouble with it”; he testified that he said this because he had heard rumors of a meretricious relation existing between appellant and decedent and that the son would likely claim there had been undue influence. There was positive testimony, denied by appellant, of flagrant instances of actual moral misconduct; it was asserted that decedent and appellant had lived together as husband and wife. The decedent’s lawyer, selected by both parties, was em<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>ployed to settle decedent’s estate. He testified that the thirty-five per cent division of the estate to appellant was suggested by him because if appellant succeeded in establishing that she was a <em>common law wife </em>she would be entitled to one-third of decedent’s estate. The lawyer further testified that appellant said “she did not want to go into court, but what she wanted to do was to get the best settlement she could without going into court.” It is also understandable why decedent’s son would be willing to compromise. Ordinarily any child will desire to avoid publicly besmirching a parent’s reputation, especially in the small community where decedent had lived.</p>

The Orphans’ Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the deed between living persons. This Court <em>reversed. </em>Justice Green said (p. 12) : “. . . It is, of course, undisputed that the Orphans’ Court has exclusive jurisdiction to <em>distribute </em>the estates of decedents among those entitled to them. Such <em>distribution </em>necessarily includes the power and the duty to ascertain the persons to whom distribution must be made. When the share of one who is apparently entitled is claimed by another, such claim must be established in the <em>proceeding for distribution, </em>and as it must be there established, so it may be there impugned. There is no occasion to resort to any other court, or to any other proceeding, to determine the validity of the claim, as the Orphans’ Court has full power and adequate procedure to dispose of the controversy. If a deed or other instrument is set up as a muniment of title for the interest of a distributee, an attack upon its validity is in no respect an impeachment of it in a collateral proceeding. A deed is not a proceeding nor the result of one. It is not a judgment of a court, nor a decree of any species of tribunal. <em>It is but an instrument inter partes, and has no higher sanction than can be given to it by the act of the </em>parties.. As <em>such it must abide the tests of all voluntary contracts.. It is therefore as liable to impeachment as any other form of contractual relation, and is necessarily subject to be invalidated whenever it is proffered to a tribunal as a basis of a right. These considerations are fundamental, and the authorities which prove that the judgment of a Court cannot be impeached collaterally, and is therefore obligatory upon an auditor, have no </em>application.” (Italics supplied) .</p>

Ordinarily the orphans’ court has no jurisdiction to determine distribution between living parties under an agreement made by them. This can be determined only by a jury trial. Cf. <em>Murphy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/258/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="258 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="1035120" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0038-01">258 Pa. 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20935" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="101 A. 935">101 A. 935</a>. This claim of Way is not founded on any contract with the decedent. Instead it is between <em>two living parties. </em>Here a dispute exists whether Miss Keller was induced to execute the agreement by fraud or under a misapprehension of the facts. She constantly objected to the reception of the agreement in evidence: first that the orphans’ court had no power to decide the issue, and second that there was fraud. The issue is whether Miss Keller had a constitutional right to have that question submitted to a jury. In <em>DiPaola </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/350/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="350 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="461134" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0408-01">350 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20519" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="39 A.2d 519">39 A. 2d 519</a>, the appellant there cited the administrator of a decedent’s estate to deliver to her all of the decedent’s personal property claimed as a gift causa mortis from the decedent. It appeared from the evidence that the administrator and the alleged sole next of kin had entered into a binding written agreement two days after the death, whereby the decedent’s estate would be di<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>vided among the parties to the agreement. The orphans’ court found that there was no fraud, accident or mistake in the execution of such agreement. At the time of the signing of the agreement, all the personal property was in the possession of the administrator, except one diamond ring which was in the appellant’s possession. The Court held: “In the absence of fraud, accident or mistake the written and sealed agreement of persons of full age and under no legal disabilities may not be disregarded. The appellant has, by the execution of the agreement, precluded herself from the relief which she seeks. The petition was properly dismissed.” But the Court added that <em>“it is also clear that this is not the appropriate proceeding in which to distribute a decedent’s estate ” </em>which must await the audit; that the petition was without notice to creditors or other interested parties and would be without legal effect. (Italics supplied). In other words, in the <em>DiPaola Estate </em>the assets of the decedent were <em>in the hands of his </em>administrator, and the petitioner-appellant sought to get these assets <em>out </em>of the estate and into her own hands. She was barred by virtue of the agreement which she signed. Thus the orphans’ court had jurisdiction to determine whether the claim of the appellant was a bar to the distribution, and held that it was not.</p>

The second will was offered for probate only 14 days after the probate of the first will and a citation issued on Way. Hence there was no deleterious change of position by the appellant. Nor did Miss Keller’s exception to Way’s distribution and the request for the appointment of au auditor raise an estoppel. She was forced to file exceptions to the distribution, and she had a right to ask for the appointment of an auditor to pass upon the questions. She constantly raised the question that <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>the orphans’ court had no jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the agreement.
