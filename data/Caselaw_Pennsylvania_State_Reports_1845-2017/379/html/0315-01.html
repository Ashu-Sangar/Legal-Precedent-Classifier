On the same day the court granted the prayer of the petition and the special grand jury was summoned to No. 59 September Sessions, 1950., In his petition the Attorney General specifically and by name. charged, among others, the appellant, Thomas E. Kilgallen, President of the City <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>Council, with the commission of bribery, misdemeanor in office, conspiracy, misdemeanor and fraudulent conversion. In its charge to the investigatory grand jury the court recited these specific charges set forth in the petition and instructed the grand jury to resolve them and if the evidence warranted, to recommend Kilgallen’s indictment. Kilgallen was subpoenaed to testify before the special grand jury. Thereupon he personally appeared before the court, asserted that having been specifically accused of crime in the Attorney General’s petition and in the charge made by the court to the grand jury, under Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> he “. . . should not be compelled to appear, testify or produce any evidence or documents in order that I may protect my constitutional rights and privileges and not waive the same.”. The court directed him to appear and testify. The investigatory grand jury filed a presentment in which it recommended that Kilgallen be indicted for bribery, misdemeanor in office, fraudulent conversion and conspiracy, and under date of December 14, 1950 the court directed the presentment to be filed and ordered and directed the Attorney General and his assistant to submit indictments to a grand jury as recommended in the presentment. Six indictments against Kilgallen were then prepared accordingly, three of them charging bribery, and endorsed on each was the following order: “And now, to wit, this 2nd day of February, 1951, the within Indictment based upon Presentment at No. 59 September Sessions, 1950, having been presented in Open Court, same is ordered filed and Charles J.

In his motions and petitions as amended, he averred that he had testified before the investigatory grand jury at the direction of the court over his claim of immunity; that the record of his testimony so given was made available to the regular grand jury at the February Sessions, 1951 and was considered and used by it in returning the indictments. Rules were granted on appellant’s petitions to take the testimony of individual grand jurors and to make the record of the proceedings before the special investigatory grand jury and as well of the indicting grand jury available to the court in support of the motions to quash. Attached to the petitions for the rules as an exhibit was the affidavit of one Paul Normandy, a member of the indicting grand jury, in which the affiant stated that the testimony given by Kilgallen before the special investigatory grand jury was at all times available to the affiant and the other members of the indicting grand jury and that excerpts from the testimony of Kilgallen before the investigatory grand jury were read by members of the Attorney General’s staff to the indicting grand jury.</p>

    <p id="b376-4" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[228,615,1158,1369]]]'>The Commonwealth contended in the Superior Court and contends here that no appeal lies from the refusal of a motion to quash an indictment. It is certainly true, as stated by the Superior Court, that ordinarily a defendant charged with crime does not have the right of appeal before his trial and conviction nor thereafter until final judgment and sentence. However, the Superior Court held that there may be exceptions to this rule, citing Superior and Supreme Court cases, inter alia, <em>Commonwealth v. Trunk et al., </em><a href="/pa/311/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="311 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1146250" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0555-01">311 Pa. 555</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20333" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="167 A. 333">167 A. 333</a>, where at p. 565 it was stated that the rule “. . . should not be held one of universal application.”, and <em>Commonwealth v.

But this rule has, in exceptional cases and to safeguard basic human rights, been construed as not being one of unyielding inflexibility.”. The Superior Court went on to say: “In our view the question of the validity of the indictments in these cases is one which under the circumstances should be decided in limine with finality. The nature of the charges affects the public interest, and the grounds for appellant’s claim of immunity, provide the exceptional circumstance which justify us in entertaining the appeals in these cases.”. We are not disposed to disagree with this conclusion.</p>

Gross and Manko were called before the grand jury but after giving their names claimed their constitutional privilege and refused to testify. This being reported to the court, each was adjudged in contempt and upon refusal to purge himself thereof, was sentenced to fine and imprisonment. Each appealed to the Superior Court which reversed the sentences for contempt, unanimously holding in an opinion by Judge (now Justice) Arnold that where one is charged with a specific crime or crimes in a petition for the calling of an investigatory grand jury, he cannot be compelled to testify before such grand jury if he claims his constitutional privilege: <em>Manko Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/168/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="168 Pa.

The Commonwealth appealed and the Superior Court reversed and reinstated the indictments: <em>Commonwealth v.

The quarter sessions court had held that because the orders endorsed on the indictments, set forth supra, disclosed that the indictments were based upon the investigatory grand jury’s presentment and that “.. /The indicting grand jury, therefore, had direct notice that <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>the bill of indictment was recommended by the special grand jury, an item of knowledge which might have been of determining weight in the decision to return a true bill. Since the presentment and recommendations of the special grand jury could easily have been influenced by the illegal invasion of the constitutional rights of these defendants, the bill of indictment and the action of the regular grand jury, based as it was on the presentment, were tainted with the same illegality.’ ”. In the course of its opinion, the Superior Court reaffirmed its finding in the <em>Manko </em>case, saying: “Since the defendants had been named in the petition for the special investigating grand jury, they could not, upon a claim of constitutional privilege, be compelled to testify before it, Manko Appeal, supra, and they refused to testify. (The Manko opinion, supra, p. 179, reports: '[E]ach [Gross and Manko] declined to answer certain questions on the ground that the answers would incriminate [them].’) They should not have been called as Avitnesses and they should not have been adjudged in contempt, but ultimately their constitutional rights were recognized and protected by this Court, and meanwhile they had not testified to any facts upon Avhich the investigating grand jury based its recommendations. There was an attempt to invade their constitutional rights but the invasion was staunchly repelled by this Court. Perhaps the investigating grand jury was, as are petit juries sometimes, influenced by the defendants’ failure or refusal to testify, but it does not follow that the indictments found by the succeeding grand jury were tainted with illegality.”. The Superior Court then went on to hold in effect that the action of an investigatory grand jury in summoning and questioning persons accused of criminal conduct in a district attorney’s petition for the investigation <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>does not nullify indictments found by the indicting grand jury <em>where the proceedings before the latter are free of illegalities or irregularities and have not caused actual prejudicial harm. </em>We agree for the reasons stated by Judge Reno in the <em>Gross </em>case that the order endorsed on the indictments indicating that the latter were based on the investigatory grand jury’s presentment did not of itself invalidate the indictments. In arriving at its conclusion the Superior Court also pointed out that there was no evidence that testimony taken by the investigatory grand jury was introduced or referred to before the indicting grand jury nor that the indicting grand jury knew that Gross and Manko had refused to testify before the investigatory grand jury and that since the testimony taken by the two grand juries was not introduced in evidence on the motion to quash, the court below abused its discretion by inspecting and considering the testimony adduced before the investigatory grand juiy and by partially resting its judgment upon the defendants’ motions on its interpretation of that evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

We find nothing contained in the opinion of the Superior Court which resolves the question posed in the present case. There is a marked difference in the situation here presented.

However, even if appellant did not reiterate his claim to immunity when he appeared before the grand jury, he testified at the court’s order and thus under judicial compulsion. Surely it would be reversible error if at a trial the accused testified after claiming his constitutional privilege because the trial judge ordered him to testify. The Attorney General argues that the only way to test the privilege is not to testify when ordered to but to refuse to testify and test the matter by contempt proceedings or by habeas corpus and cites a statement made by the Federal District Court in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em><a href="/f-supp/76/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="76 F. Supp. 538" data-case-ids="642826" data-case-paths="/f-supp/76/0538-01">76 F. Supp. 538</a>. An examination of this case discloses not only that the language referred to was applied to a witness and not to the defendant in the proceeding, but that it was dictum unnecessary to the ruling on the question presented.

The information thus derived was, of course, hearsay and unsworn to. . .”. The averments in support of the motion were characterized as “unsubstantial and dubious”. In the present case the affidavit relied on is that of a grand juror himself who without disclosing his counsels or that of his fellows specifically swears that appellant’s testimony before the investigatory grand jury was made available and read to the indicting grand jury. The fact thus deposed was clear and unequivocal and required no further detail to disclose a clear infringement of appellant’s constitutional rights; and its truth was not denied by the officers of the Commonwealth in their answers to the motions to quash, in their petitions to dismiss the motions, nor in their brief or oral argument. It may be added there is nothing in the record justifying an assumption that the defendant solicited the grand juror’s statement.</p>
    <p id="b385-3" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[166,1623,1152,486]]]'>It is to be observed that in the <em>Smart </em>case, apart from the flimsy proof offered in support of the charges contained in the motions to quash, the charges were improper conduct by the prosecuting officers and that the presentment of the grand jury was read to the indicting grand jury. There was no charge or complaint that the testimony of the defendants was made available to and excerpts therefrom read to the indicting grand jury.</p>

However, as recognized in that case, the impenetrability of grand jury proceedings is subject to exceptions and we think that the instant case presents a justifiable exception. If appellant’s constitutional safeguards were ignored as contended, it was a flagrant transgression of the letter and spirit of our organic law.</p>
