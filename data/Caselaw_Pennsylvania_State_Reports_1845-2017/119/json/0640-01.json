        "text": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Clark;\nThe confirmation of the third account of Sallie E. Schaeffer, administratrix of the estate of Simon P. Guldin, deceased, became absolute on the 24th December, 1881, and exhibited a balance of $257.80 in the accountant\u2019s hands; whilst the fourth account became absolute on the 25th November, 1882, and exhibited a further balance of $1,065.42 in her hands. The confirmation in each case was a final decree, and if unappealed from was conclusive as to all matters contained in these respective accounts: Shindel\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 45.\nOn the 20th January, 1883, the Orphans\u2019 Court, pursuant to the 39th section of the act of 24th February, 1834, P. L. 80, entered a decree of distribution of the balance in the accountant\u2019s hands, as exhibited in her fourth account, directing the distributees named to give refunding bonds, as required by the 41st section of the same act. It is stated in the appellant's paper book and the appellees make no denial of the fact, that at the time of making this decree it was believed that the balance on the third account was sufficient to pay all the known debts or demands against the estate remaining unsatisfied, and this balance having been deducted from the aggregate funds in the accountant\u2019s hands, the residue being the balance on the fourth account, appeared to be due to the distributees. Simon P. Guldin had died in 1874, and this account was filed in 1882; full eight years had intervened, during which period creditors would be presumed to have made known their claims. Refunding bonds were thereupon duly executed, were approved by the court, and filed, as required by law, and the money was paid out pursuant to the decree. In this state of the case, it is difficult to see upon what principle of the law the accountant can, in this form of proceeding, be held to pay these moneys a second time.\nDistribution may be made, under the act of 24th February, 1834, P. L. 80, by administrators or executors at their own risk: \u00a7 58; or, under the direction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, after deducting all known demands, \u00a7 39, upon the distributees filing refunding bonds, \u00a7 41, and, where security is taken as provided by the act, executors and administrators \u201c are not liable for the assets so paid or distributed in respect to any claim or demand upon the decedent not previously made known to them\u201d: \u00a7 57. Notice to creditors in this form of distribution is' not required. So, also, distribution may be made by auditors duly appointed by the court, of the estates of decedents, among creditors, where the assets are insufficient to pay the debts, under the act of 29th March, 1832, \u00a7 19, P. L. 194; and among heirs, legatees, or other persons entitled, under the act of 13th April, 1840, \u00a7 1, P. L. 319. In this form of distribution, notice to creditors and all other persons in interest being provided for, refunding bonds are not required.\nThere can be no question, therefore, as to the power of the court to direct this distribution. The power is expressly conferred in the act of 1834, and the court having assumed the jurisdiction and entered a decree, all things will be presumed to have been rightly and regularly done. If, therefore, the money in the accountant\u2019s hands- has been paid out and applied in obedience to tbe decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, the executrix, in the absence of any fraud or unfairness, certainly cannot be required to pay it again. The refunding bonds filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court took the place of the money in the accountant\u2019s hands, and to these bonds, or to the residue of the estate yet to be accounted for, these creditors must resort for payment of their demands.\nThe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is reversed, and the record remitted for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, and it is ordered that the appellees, Adam Rhoads and William L. Rhoads, pay the costs of this appeal.",

GULDIN, DECEASED.]\nAPPEAL EROM THE DECREE OE THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT OE BERKS COUNTY.\nArgued March 2, 1888\nDecided April 16, 1888.\n1. The confirmation absolute of an administration account is a final decree, and, if unappealed from, is conclusive as to all matters therein contained.\n2. Under the act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 84, distribution may be made by accountants, at their own risk: \u00a7 58; or, under the direction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, after deducting all known demands, upon the filing of approved refunding bonds by the distributees: \u00a7\u00a7 39, 41.\n3. Where distribution is made by order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, after security is taken as provided by the act, \u00a7 41, notice to creditors is not required and accountants are not liable for the assets so paid or distributed, in respect to any claim or demand upon the decedent not previously made known to them: \u00a7 57.\n4. Wherefore, after such distribution of a balance determined by a confirmation absolute undisturbed by appeal, the refunding bonds take the place of the fund distributed, and to these bonds, or to a residue of the estate unaccounted for, creditors must resort for payment.\nBefore Gordon, C. J., Paxson, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ.; Trunkey and Williams, JJ., absent.\nNo. 353 January Term 1887, Sup. Ct.\nOn October 10,1881, Sallie E. Guldin, afterwards Sallie E. Schaeffer, administratrix of the estate of Simon P. Guldin, of Oley township, deceased, filed her third partial account showing a balance of $257.80 due tbe estate. This account was confirmed nisi by the Orphans\u2019 Court on November 26, 1881, and on December 24, 1881, the confirmation was made absolute. Among the credits taken was an item of interest paid on a note held by Wm. L. Rhoads, and another, of interest paid on certain notes held by Adam Rhoads.\nOn September 14, 1882, the accountant filed a fourth account, showing, after credits claimed for register\u2019s, clerk\u2019s and attorney\u2019s fees, and compensation to accountant, a balance due the estate of $1,065.42. This account was confirmed nisi by the Orphans\u2019 Court on October 21,1882. On November 25,1882, the confirmation was made absolute, and on November 27, 1882, the court, Hagenman, P. J., decreed the payment of the fees and allowance referred to and on January 20, 1883, made a further decree distributing said balance of $1,065.42 to the heirs of the decedent, directing the distributees to file refunding bonds according to law. The distributees having filed refunding bonds which were approved by the court, in accordance with \u00a7 41, act of February 24,1834, P. L. 81, they were paid by the administratrix their several portions of said balance.\n\u2022 The proceedings recited were under the old law.\nOn September 7, 1885, a separate Orphans\u2019 Court having been established, on motion of Adam Rhoads and William L. Rhoads, as creditors, said third and fourth accounts were called for audit, and the adjudication adjourned from time to time until October 10,1885. In the final adjudication on that date the Orphans\u2019 Court, Schwartz, P. J., found as a balance due to Adam Rhoads, $562.47, and as a balance due to William Rhoads, $286.90, and, taxing the costs of adjudication, proceeded:\nIt was contended at the hearing of this case by accountant, that the balance due the estate as shown hy the fourth account was decreed by the court to the heirs. It is true Judge Hagenman signed an ex parte decree making such a distribution. This decree, however, has no validity or binding effect upon the rights of creditors. The court have no power to make distribution of the fund without notice to the creditors, who are first entitled before distribution can be made to heirs and legatees. In this case no such notice was given and the creditors never had their day in court. They are therefore not concluded by the decree above referred to.\nIt was further contended however that the decree of the court making distribution to the heirs was made with the knowledge and assent of the attorney representing the creditors. This allegation was not sustained by proof. It was the duty of the attorney who represented the creditors to take care of their interests. Why should he then consent to the distribution of the funds to the heirs, before the claims of the creditors, his own clients, were satisfied ? If this fact had been established by testimony it would have been a fraud upon the creditors, and it would have been the duty of the court to set aside the decree distributirig the funds to the heirs. Upon neither of the grounds relied on by the accountant should this decree be sustained.\nThe fund is therefore distributed to the creditors as appears by the schedule of distribution hereto annexed.\nTo Adam Rhoads...........$562.47\nTo Williams Rhoads.......... 286.90\nThe balance in accountant\u2019s hands will not be distributed at this time. Accounts, statements, and notes of proceedings are hereto attached.\nIt is ordered and decreed that Sall\u00ede E. Schaeffer, administratrix as. aforesaid, do pay said fees, costs, and distribution made, to the parties respectively entitled thereto. It is further ordered and decreed that the foregoing adjudication and distribution be confirmed nisi.\nTo this entire adjudication, as erroneous, Sallie E. Schaeffer as administratrix and heir at law, filed exceptions, which exceptions were overruled by the court on February 8,1886, and the adjudication confirmed. Thereupon the exceptant took this appeal assigning by specific assignments the adjudication and confirmation as error.\nMr. I). E. Schroeder, for the appellant:\n1. The third and fourth accounts were partial accounts. Instead of forming an integrant part of one whole, each is a distinct member of a series of accounts, standing by itself. The confirmation absolute of each of them was the final and conclusive decree of what was therein contained: Rhoads\u2019s App., 39 Pa. 189; Shindel\u2019s App., 57 Pa. 45.\n2. Section 39, act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 81, authorizes administrators to make partial distributions under the directions of the Orphans\u2019 Court. Section 41 of the same act directs the giving of refunding bonds to be approved by the court; then distribution is to be made after deducting from the assets the aggregate amount of known demands against the estate. Having jurisdiction, the Orphans\u2019 Court was bound to decree distribution on petition of any one interested: Purviance v. Commonwealth, 17 S. & R. 31: Patterson v. Nichol, 6 W. 382.\n3. When a final administration account has been confirmed, the remedy for omissions and mistakes is by a petition for a review in the court below, and not by a citation to the administrator: Downing\u2019s Est., 5 W. 90; Weiting v. Nissley, 6 Pa. 141. An appeal from the definitive decree could have been entered within three years, under \u00a7 59, act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 213, when all matters could have been properly adjudicated. Having neglected their proper remedies, the creditors, if any, must now look to the refunding bonds.\nMr. A.' G. Green, for the appellees:\nArgued orally, but filed no brief."
