In other words, if you find that his failure or neglect to give notice in writing to the company of the entry of this incumbrance was due to the want of knowledge, and an entry of the incumbrance that was contrary to his contract with the hook and ladder company, then we do not think it would in itself prevent a recovery.</p>

For this reason the plaintiff was permitted'to show that at the time he gave tins bond, it was given upon the express condition and agreement that it should not be entered up against him, because it would injure his business; that he declined to accept the office of treasurer if the bond was to be entered up, and that thereupon the company agreed at their <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>meeting to accept the bond, place it in the hands of the trustees, and that it should not be entered up. This was shown not only by his testimony, but by the testimony of Daniel Neiswenter, a member, and German Gregory and Jos. Deiter, trustees of the hook and ladder company, and to some extent by the minute book of said company. The bond was delivered to the then trustees, and subsequently other trustees seem to have been elected, and about that time this bond was entered up. The plaintiff testified that he had no knowledge of this entry until after the fire, when he declined to longer act as treasurer, and the judgment was satisfied. Was this such a transaction as required the court to direct a verdict for the defendant, thereby holding the plaintiff responsible, just as though there never had been a contract forbidding the entry of the bond, or as though it had been legally and justly entered ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[256,1136,1181,1277]]]'>In Seybert v. Penn. M. F. Ins.

This bond was entered up, and although the assured alleged he had no knowledge of such entry, yet the court held the policy was rendered void by such entry. The ground upon which this decision is put is to be found in this language: “ It was entered upon his confession, and he is chargeable with knowledge. A man who gives a judgment or mortgage knows that it may, and probably will, be placed on record. He may not have actual knowledge of the time of its entry, but the act is his, and he must be held responsible therefor.” We think the facts of this case entirely different from the facts in the case before us. Here we have an express agreement that the bond shall not be entered, and until the treasurer (the assured) failed in his duty as treasurer, the company had no power to enter the bond without violating their express contract. Might not the assured rest upon the belief that the company would observe the contract, and that until he did some wrongful act in his official duties, or failed to perform the same, the bond could not and would not be entered? Having been entered in violation of this contract, would not the court have stricken it off, upon the plaintiff proving the same ? And, if so, was it then ever such a lien upon the property as would avoid the policy ?</p>

At the time this property was insured, there were $4,000 of liens upon it, the existence of which was disclosed to the company. Ten months before the fire occurred, and eight months before the hook and ladder Co.’s judgment was entered, $1,000 of this indebtedness was paid, and the bond satisfied of record. Therefore, there was neither at the time of the fire nor at the time the treasurer’s bond was entered as much incumbrance upon the property as at the time the policy issued. Hence, whether the treasurer’s bond be regarded as a good lien or not, there never was any increase of risk to the company, for the assured had a greater interest in his property when his liabilities were $3,600 than when they were $4,000.</p>

There was no dispute as to the judgment being a lien ; but the assured testified he did not know it was a lien upon the property insured, but believed it was a lien upon the other real estate only. Justice Paxson filed the opinion in Seybert v. Penn. M. F. Ins. Co., supra, in 1883, and the same learned justice filed the opinion in this case in 1885. In discussing the effect of the failure to disclose the existence of this judgment, Justice Paxson says: “For the purpose of this case, we must consider it an honest mistake. Does it avoid the policy ? If it does, I would be ashamed to sit here and say so. The section of the policy referred to evidently contemplates fraud or wilful misrepresentation.....A comparison of the proofs of loss with the policy, shows that all requirements have been substantially complied with, excepting in the omission to note the incumbrance. This, as before observed, was an innocent mistake; and as it has not been shown, and doubtless cannot be, that the omission has in any manner prejudiced the company, we see no reason why the proof of loss should not have been submitted to the jury.” Much of this language would seem to be applicable to the case before us. This plaintiff’s loss is undoubtedly an honest <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>one. The incumbrances upon his property never were increased after the policy issued, but upon the contrary, were decreased, and every dollar of the liens has since* been discharged. His property was never levied, upon or seized by any officer for any debt. The $500 judgment was entered without his knowledge, and in violation of his express contract that it should not be entered. Can it be that the plaintiff must lose his insurance under such circumstances? We do not believe that such is the meaning of our authorities, and, therefore, refuse a new trial.</p>

It was in the usual form and need not be here repeated. During the life of the policy a judgment of $500 was entered against the insured, which was a lien upon the premises covered by the policy, and remained a lien to the time of the fire. No notice was given to the company of this incumbrance, as was required by the terms of the policy.</p>

The second specification refers to the charge of the court and alleges error in submitting to the jury the question of plaintiff’s knowledge of the entering of the judgment.</p>

The clause in the policy is a covenant against incumbrances. It was therefore immaterial whether the plaintiff had actual knowledge of the judgment or not. He was bound to know it. He had covenanted against it. The judgment was his act; it was entered upon his warrant of attorney, and after the fire he paid it and had it satisfied. That it was given under an agreement of the hook and ladder company not to enter it up, and that the company violated said agreement is not to the purpose. It is possible he may have his remedy against that company for any loss he may sustain by reason of their breach of faith, but this act of a third party can in no way affect this contract of insurance. The covenant against incumbrances is a reasonable covenant, and the principle upon which it is found<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>ed is a sound one.

It goes upon the theory of an increased risk by reason of incumbrances. If a man may incumber his property to its full value and then insure it for its full value, it is easy to see how fires may be turned into a source of profit. That the risk was increased by the entry of this judgment is assumed by the terms of the policy. It is not, therefore, an open question. The company has not received the premium for this increase of the risk, and not being itself in default is not bound to indemnify without receiving the consideration for such indemnity. This position is fully sustained by the authorities. It is sufficient to refer to Brown v. The Ins. Co., <em>supra; </em>Insurance Co. v. Gottsman, <a href="/pa/48/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="48 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="422153" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0151-01">48 Pa. 151</a>; Seybert v. Penn. M. F. Ins.

On the contrary, when that judgment was entered, one of the previous judgments of $1,000 had been paid and the record satisfied. So that in point of fact instead of incumbrances to the amount authorized by the company, $4,000, there was only $8,500 against it. This question was raised by the plaintiff’s second point and denied by the learned judge in his general charge. The ruling being in favor of the company, could not be assigned for error upon their writ and they have not been heard upon it. The learned judge, while ruling this question adversely to the plaintiff in his charge, appears to incline to the other view of it in his opinion refusing .to grant a new trial. As the question is not before us, we will not rule it now. It can be properly raised and squarely decided upon another trial. It is an important question in the case.</p>
