Section 24 is a statute of limitation as to all debts of the decedent not in judgment or mortgage, and with respect to debts due, the five years are to be counted from the death of the decedent. To come within the meaning of the words, commenced and duly prosecuted, the plaintiff must have employed with due diligence every legal means to reduce his claim to judgment, before the expiration of ten years from the death of the decedent.

The rule to strike off, or as it is sometimes expressed, to set aside or vacate a judgment, is essentially a common law proceeding; a short and summary substitute for an audita querela, a writ of error coram nobis, or a certiorari, or writ of error from a superior court, by which the same relief was formerly administered. Being for irregularity apparent on the face of the record, it is in the nature of a demurrer to the record and is not confined to any particular kind of judgment, nor limited as to the time it may be taken advantage of, nor affected by matters dehors the record, except so far as the defendant may have put himself in position to be estopped from making objection: Mitchell, Motions and Rules, 76, and cases cited.

As the law now stands in this state, in proceedings to charge the real estate of a decedent in the hands of his widow and heirs, the latter must be proceeded against within ten years from the death of such decedent. I will not discuss so plain a proposition, and will refer only to the single case of <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>Hope v. Marshall, <a href="/pa/96/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="96 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="494623" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0395-01">96 Pa. 395</a>, where it was said by our late brother Mercur : “ This was the first proceeding instituted against the widow and heirs with a view of charging a lien on the lands which they had acquired from the decedent. It issued more than ten years after the death of the decedent debtor, and the lien of the debt as against their lands was barred by the lapse of time. The learned judge therefore erred in entering judgment against all the plaintiffs in error. It should have been entered against Hope, the administrator, only.”</p>

It is difficult to see of what possible use an affidavit would have been. All the essential facts appeared of record. The judgment was of course a judgment de terris, and the record showed that the plaintiffs, had no right to it. It was unlawfully and improvidently entered, and we see no error in striking it off. This may always be done where it appears upon the face of the record that a judgment ought not to have been entered. Thus, a judgment entered for want of an affidavit of defence will be strickén off where it appears that the instrument filed was such as not to require an affidavit: Post v.
