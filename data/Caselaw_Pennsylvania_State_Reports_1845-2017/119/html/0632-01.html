The first inquiry for you to make is what took place at ’Squire Bernhard’s office on the 15th or 16th of January, 1882. There is no dispute that the money was paid on that day. The simple question for the jury is to ascertain what was agreed between the parties on that day. It seems to be established in the case, as a proof, that on that day there was a receipt given for $60. It is claimed on the part of the plaintiff that that receipt contained what would be the terms of the agreement; in other words, that it specified when the lease began and when it ended. If the lease stated the terms, the payment being for one year, the lease would end at the expiration of that year. That receipt was not put in evidence, but the contents have been proved by the plaintiff, and I will also refer to the testimony of the defendant to see how far that contradicts it. I now refer to the testimony of Mr. Dumn. . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b660-6" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[257,1262,1179,1075]]]'>If this testimony is believed by the jury, then it was stipulated and agreed at that time that this lease was to begin on the 22d day of December, 1881. By the payment of the $60, there was a lease for one year. Rothermel had no nine years more to stay on the premises. The law gives him no such right, but by the payment of these $60 he had another year’s lease of these premises. It is for the jury to ascertain when that lease began. The defendant’s first year ended on December 4,1881. He held over on December 4,1881, and the most that he can claim is that he was there for another year from the 4th of December, 1881. And that is the claim on the part of the defendant, that his lease began on the 4 th of December, 1881, for the second year. If it began on the 4th of December, then the notice to quit given him by the defendant on the 20th of December, 1882, was too short, and the proceeding that was begun before the alderman could not be sustained. If the lease expired as claimed by the plaintiff, the notice was sufficient, the proceedings are regular, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover ; for then the lease expired as stated in the receipt (as alleged by the plaintiff), on the 22d of December, 1882, three months after the giving of the notice.</p>

The first question of fact for the consideration of the jury, therefore, was, whether or not the writing referred to was in fact what it purported to be, a lease for oue year from the 22d of December, 1881, as testified by Dumn; and, if that was determined in the negative, then, second, was the 22d of December, 1881, adopted, without prejudice, as a modification of the alleged existing contract, as to the beginning and end of the ensuing year, under the Stichter lease,'or under a new lease from Dumn as Rothermel’s rights might afterwards appear, to the rent of which year the sixty dollars was to be applied. It is not seriously denied that this date was to be inserted; indeed the testimony is wholly to this effect; the paper admittedly remained in the hands of Bernhard, by the agreement of the parties for this express purpose. If either of these questions of fact were found for <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>the plaintiff, then the term, ended December 22, 1882, and the notice to quit, dated September 20,1882, was in time. This is substantially what was affirmed in the plaintiff’s first and second points and the charge taken as a whole is to the same effect.</p>
