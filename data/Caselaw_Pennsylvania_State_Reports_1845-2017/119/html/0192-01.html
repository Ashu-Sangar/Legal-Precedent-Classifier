Allen, one of the defendants, on or about July 23, 1880, under the firm style of Carter, Allen &amp; Co. By a letter dated June 22,1886, L. H. Allen informed his partner that he had, on June 19, 1886, sold all his right, title and interest in the personal property belonging to Carter, Allen &amp; Co., to C. F. Lloyd and C. F. Allen, and had also made a lease to them .of the shops for three years. The bill of sale made by L. H. Allen to Lloyd and C. F. Allen, of June 19,1886, sets forth that he and Thomas H. Carter “compose the firm of Carter, Allen &amp; Co., founders and machinists, of Tamaqua,” and is for the undivided one half part of the property mentioned particularly therein. There is a dispute as to the amount of interest the partners respectively had in the business of the firm, but that a partnership existed is shown by the evidence on both sides, and that the sale of what L. H. Allen claimed was his interest was without the knowledge or consent of his partner, Carter, is not denied. Claiming to be the continuing partner, upon whom devolved the right to wind up the business of the said firm, the complainant filed the above stated bill, and thereupon obtained an injunction from .Judge Bechtel at Chambers, restraining the defendants till hearing, from in any manner interfering with complainant’s right of control of the partnership property.</p>

Allen, now strenuously asserts that the contract of partnership entered into between himself aud the complainant was a nullity, and that no rights as the continuing partner can be claimed by the complainant under it. The ground of this is, that the complainant at the time the partnership was formed, was, and still is, the cashier of a national bank. To support this position, the act of April 16, 1850, and its supplements, regulating banks deriving their power from the state, is relied upon. The statute provides that it shall not be lawful for the cashier of any bank to engage in any other profession, occupation or calling, either directly or indirectly, than that appertaining to his office of cashier. A violation of this provision subjects the cashier of any bank, on conviction in any court of criminal jurisdiction, to the payment of a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars. The exceptions to this legislation do not concern the case in hand. The 64th section of the penal code of 1860, enacts, that if “ any cashier of any bank of the commonwealth shall engage, directly or indirectly, in the purchase or sale of stock, or in any other profession, occupation or calling, other than that of his duty as cashier, he shall he guilty of a misdemean- or, and being thereof convicted, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars.”</p>

Robertson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Phila.%20184" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Phila. 184">6 Phila. 184</a>, made by Judge Shakswood, in the District Court of Philadelphia, in which he ruled that the fact that one member of a partnership plaintiff was a cashier of a bank, was a sufficient bar to an action for goods sold and delivered by the firm of which he was a member. The same judge afterwards delivered the opinion <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>of the Supreme Court in the case of Burkholder v.

It was an action brought to recover back money-paid for the purchase of stock in a coal company to the cashier of a bank. The court says: “ It may be that the purchase of stock in a coal company for investment only or subsequent sale, would not be within the prohibition, but when there is evidence, as there was in this case, that the cashier was engaged in speculating in stocks, the case is clearly within the letter and spirit of the act. It is true that when a contract so prohibited by statute has been executed, both parties being in pari delicto, an action cannot be maintained by either party to rescind the contract: Addison on Contracts, 149.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[163,975,1182,871]]]'>We must remember in disposing of the present controversy, that we are dealing with the case of a cashier of a national bank and not of a state bank. Our state enactments, which are much older, can have no reference to the act of congress creating national banks. The National Banking Act, § 5209, specifies the offences of which cashiers and other officers may be convicted., For none of these can they be indicted in a state court, nor is their being concerned in other occupations made a crime. The affairs of these banks are exclusively under the control of congress: Commonwealth ex rel. Torrey v. Ketner, <a href="/pa/92/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="92 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="490777" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0372-01">92 Pa. 372</a>. “We must presume,” said Mr. Justice Paxson in that case, “ that when the legislature used the words ‘ any bank,’ it referred to banks created under and by virtue of the laws of Pennsylvania.

We cannot, therefore, with the light before -us, assent to the claim made, that the purchase at the sheriff’s sale of L. H. Allen’s interest, vested in C. F. Allen and Lloyd the exclusive right to the possession and control of all the assets and partnership property of the firm of Carter, Allen &amp; Co. Supposing, however, that the law of the state can be extended to a cashier of a national bank, and thus punish him for doing what is not declared to be an offence under the act of congress relating to national banks, surely he must first be judicially convicted of <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>the crime before his rights of property can be taken away from him and handed over to, others.

    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[193,726,1186,811]]]'>It was conceded by the appellees that had congress legislated upon this subject, such legislation would have superseded our state law, so far as national banks are concerned, but that in the absence of such legislation our state law took effect, and made it an offence for the cashier of a national bank to engage in any occupation or business outside of his official duties. We are of opinion that the distinction referred to is a distinction without a difference. Torrey’s case was decided upon the broad ground that our statutes in regard to embezzling cashiers did not apply to cashiers of national banks and was not intended to. The fact that such persons were punishable under the legislation of congress was referred to argumentatively as an additional reason why an indictment would not lie under our state law. We held then and we hold now to the broader position that our statutes have no application.</p>

The National Banking Act and its supplements, create a complete system for the government of those institutions. Conceding the power of congress to create this system, I am unable to see how it can be regulated or interfered with by state legislation. The act of 1860, if applied to national banks, imposes a disqualification upon cashiers of such institutions where none has been imposed by act of congress. If the state may impose one qualification upon the cashiers, why not another? If, upon the cashier, why not upon the president or other officer? Nay, further, suppose the legislature should declare that no person should be a bank director unless he has arrived at fifty years of age, or should be the owner of one hundred shares of stock, could we apply such an act to national banks ? If so, such institutions would have a precarious existence. They would be liable to be interfered with at every step, and it <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>might not be long before the whole national banking system would have to be thrown aside as so much worthless lumber.</p>
