They have given to them full power to keep the roads in such condition as will make them reasonably safe for the public to travel upon. A municipal corporation is bound to keep the streets, roads and bridges over which it has jurisdiction in repair, and for a failure to perform that duty the district must answer in damages for any injury occasioned exclusively by the negligence of the officers. We mean, by “ exclusively,” injuries to which the plaintiff has not contributed by his own negligence. A road or street may be put out of repair by the deposit of obstructions thereon which impede and hinder travel or make it dangerous; or by partial destruction of the roadbed itself, producing the like effect. To repair means to replace, to restore, to put in sound or good condition after injury or partial destruction. Therefore, to repair a road or street, to restore it to its former condition and give it the essential properties of a suitable highway, requires the removal of all obstructions cast upon it, which impede its free passage.....</p>

If it be one on which there is but little travel and not thickly built upon, no such prompt duty to discover the obstruction would be imposed upon the public officials, as if it were one in the heart of a <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>city. Dense population and continuous travel on a street, call for more care and watchfulness on the part of the authorities than over streets not thus populated and used. We direct your attention to these matters as being important to the street placed where it is; the amount of travel over it; the railroad crossing, the place where lumber is unloaded; whether, under the circumstances the obstruction complained of in this case was permitted to remain, if you find it was an obstruction, for such a length of time as made it unreasonable, and therefore made the township guilty or liable for negligence in its officials, in not discovering that obstruction and removing it. And, to ascertain that, you are to consider all the circumstances, together with the testimony; and as our Supreme Court have said, for that is what we have read to you, the circumstances of an obstruction in a street, in a thickly populated town, are different from those ún a road in the country. You are to take all the circumstances into consideration and ascertain whether or not the officials were guilty of negligence in not removing it. Then if you find that they were, whether the plaintiff has been guilty of any negligence. We have already stated to you what his duty is. Now, in ascertaining that, you must consider that he was approaching a railroad crossing of four tracks at grade, according to his testimony, between eight and nine o’clock at night. Did he conduct himself in such manner, under these circumstances, as to exercise ordinary care and caution in driving along the public highway? If he did not, if his conduct was not such as showed that he exercised ordinary care and caution in driving along the public highway, under all the circumstances in this case, then he was negligent, and if that neligence contributed, in any degree, to the injuries that were done to the property, then the plaintiff who employed him or put him in that position cannot recover anything from this township, for the reason, as we have heretofore stated to you, that neither you nor the court can separate the injury that he, by his negligence, did, from the injury that the township did by its negligence, and, therefore, the law says there can be no recovery at all under such circumstances.....</p>

The injury occurred at Landingville, in the month of March, 1885, at a point where the public road to Orwigsburg crossed the four tracks of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. It appears that a quantity of lumber taken from the cars had been deposited in piles on each side of the public road. The piles were five or six feet high, and they so projected into the road, which was' thirty-three feet wide, that the space left open for travel was about fourteen feet and six inches. Late in the evening of the day of the occurrence, the plaintiff’s son undertook to drive this horse and sleigh over the railroad crossing, on the public road, returning from Orwigsburg, when the horse, it is alleged, took sudden fright at the lumber piles, turned on to the railroad track, upset the sleigh, ran into the railroad bridge, and was killed; and that the sleigh and harness were wholly destroyed. It is contended on part of the plaintiff, that these lumber piles were improperly permitted to remain on the public road; that they caused the fright of the horse, which resulted in the injury, and that the township is liable therefor.</p>

To the same effect, although not brought 'against the township officers, is our own very recent case of Piollet v. Simmers, <a href="/pa/106/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="106 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="455717" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0095-01">106 Pa. 95</a>, where the authorities are collected and the whole subject is very fully considered. The rule is perhaps difficult of practical application, as the frightening of a horse cannot be said to be governed by any rule of reason or experience. The fright of a horse may, perhaps, as ■often be attributable to the place in which an object is unexpectedly found, as to the frightful appearance of the object itself; still, there are objects which are well known to present such, an appearance, as may be expected to, and naturally will, <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>alarm ordinarily well broken and roadworthy horses, and it is the duty of supervisors of highways to remove all such impediments to safe travel.</p>
    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[169,523,1203,1384]]]'>It makes no difference that the lumber was not in the traveled route; the fact that it was piled upon the margin instead of the path of the highway, does not alter the rule of liabil- ■ ity, for the result produced, in either event, is that the traveled route is thereby rendered unsafe. It is the duty of road officers to forbid and prevent the use of the roadside as a place of deposit for private property, particularly if it be of a character to alarm or frighten ordinary horses. “The traveler has reason to expect that the highway will have the ordinary and reasonable incumbrances, which arise from the nature of the soil and country, and its being worked and repaired in a proper manner; but he has no reason to apprehend that the township has suffered these dangers to be increased, by allowing the land taken for public use to become unlawfully appropriated to private uses, as a place of deposit for property, which will in any manner obstruct or impede travel, whether by frightening his horse or clogging his wheels:” Morse v. Richmond, <a href="/vt/41/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="41 Vt. 435" data-case-ids="8545309" data-case-paths="/vt/41/0435-01">41 Vt. 435</a>. This is said, of course, with the qualification that the duty does not attach until the township officers know, or ought to know, of the obstruction. It was certainly proper, as affecting the question of notice, for the plaintiff to introduce evidence to show that lumber had on often repeated cases been piled on this place upon the highway; for, if this were so, the township officers, if they did not know, should have known the fact, and it was their duty to interfere to prevent this habitual and continued invasion of the highway.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.6",413,[171,1915,1185,509]],["BL_414.1",414,[259,369,1179,560]]]'>The law does not impose upon the township officers an absolute liability for every insufficiency of a road; they are required to do what is practicable to .be done and to preserve a condition of reasonable safety, with reference to the amount and kind of travel which the highway accommodates. The right of the public to the free and unobstructed use of a highway is subject, of course, to reasonable and necessary limitatations. The convenient delivery of lumber, stone, etc., for building purposes, and of fuel, merchandise, etc., often necessitates the temporary occupation of a street. This, to a reason<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>able extent, is not an invasion of the public right; it is a legitimate use of the highway. An owner of land abutting on the public highway has a right to use a portion of the highway in a reasonable manner, for special purposes, for a temporary period; that right is not subservient to the right of the traveling public,, and its exercise, without negligence, imposes no liability. The owners of this lumber might perhaps have been privileged to use the street for the temporary purpose of loading or unloading their lumber; this would, perhaps, depend upon circumstances, but it is plain that they had no right to use the highway for the purpose of a board-yard.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[258,937,1178,353]]]'>Nor does it alter the case, that the party injured may sustain an action against the persons who place a nuisance in the highway ; it is the right of the party to proceed against the township, or the individual, as he may choose. No question has been made as to the roadworthy character of the horse; we will not assume, in the absence of proof, that he was a vicious animal, or that he was not roadworthy, and well broken.</p>
