Thereupon Charles H. Miller and Elvira L., his wife, in right of Elvira, presented the present bill in equity, asking for an injunction to prevent the sale of the real estate so levied upon. The bill alleged that in 1871 Elvira Miller became the owner of the right, title and interest of Charles Miller in the land levied upon. Although the bill is neither very clear nor logical, her claim to title is set forth. The proceeding is evidently founded upon the authority of Hunter’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20Pa.%20195" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Pa. 195">40 Pa. 195</a>, and kindred cases, where it is held that a levy and sale of a wife’s real estate by a creditor of her- husband, on execution, is contrary to law and may be restrained by injunction; that wherever a clear case of title is properly made under the acts of 1848 and 1850, a court of equity will interfere; otherwise not, and the parties are left to their remedy at law.</p>

Miller and Charles H. Miller of all matters growing out of the real estate devised to them jointly by the will of their father, Henry Miller, deceased, and a proper decree be entered for the balance which may be found due to the said Charles H. Miller after deducting the Klopp judgment.” But the account could only be incidental to and as furnishing facts in aid of the prayer for an injunction. The bill alleged as an equitable reason for not permitting execution to issue, the circumstances under which the Klopp bond or judgment had been given; that Henry Miller had given his brother Charles the assurance that he would see the amount of the Klopp indebtedness paid out of the share of Charles in his father’s estate; that Henry having been in possession of the entire estate of the father should be obliged to settle and account, and that as a result of such account, it would appear that Henry had in his hands a sum of money belonging to Charles which would more than pay the judgment upon which the execution issued. The master found otherwise; that Henry had $2,782.41 more of credits than Charles, and that each owning an equal share in the estate, found that Charles owed Henry one half, or $1,391.20. This brings us to the point in controversy as to the form of decree asked for. We are not asked to review the master’s conclusions or the actions of the judge in confirming the master’s report. The injunction was granted and afterwards dissolved. We are not at all clear as to the right of Elvira, the wife, to ask a statement of an account between Charles and Henry, nor that such account could affect her rights or the merits of her bill. Its only purpose so far as she was concerned, was to show an alleged equitable payment of the Klopp judgment, as one of the reasons for the equitable interference by injunction to restrain the process of execution and sale. The master finds no indebtedness upon her part. The finding of an indebtedness against the husband cannot fix a liability upon the wife. She does not present this bill in equity as the trustee of her husband, but it is upon its face distinctly asserted to be “in right of the said Elvira L., the wife.” We therefore decline to make the decree in form as requested..</p>

The court seems to have thought that the effect of the decree would be to make the wife personally liable, but, of course, that liability would not extend beyond the estate she had acquired from her husband; it was in the nature of a proceeding in rem. The wife took the estate charged with all the liabilities attached to it at the time of the conveyance to her; only on this ground could she maintain her bill. The bill was so broadly drawn that the court was enabled to settle all controversy between the parties, on the familiar principle that when a court of equity is in possession of the case and has jurisdiction of the subject matter, it may proceed to make a proper decree to do justice between the parties: Danzeisen’s App., <a href="/pa/73/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="73 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1032279" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0065-01">73 Pa. 65</a>; Wilhelm’s App., <a href="/pa/79/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="79 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="438454" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0120-01">79 Pa. 120</a>.</p>

Miller and Elvira his wife, in the right of said Elvira, against Henry H. Miller. The bill sets forth, in substance, that one Henry Miller died May 9, 1864, devising inter alia to his two sons, the said Charles H. and Henry H. Miller, the tract of land in question, charged with legacies amounting to $10,000; that letters testamentary upon the estate of Henry Miller, deceased, were issued to Henry H.

We are not at all clear as to the right of Elvira, the wife, to ask a statement of an account between Charles and Henry, nor that such account could affect her rights or the merits of her bill. Its only purpose, so far as she was concerned, was to show an alleged equitable payment of the Klopp judgment, as one of the reasons for the equitable interference by injunction, to restrain the process of execution and sale. The master finds no indebtedness upon her part. The finding of an indebtedness against the husband cannot fix a liability upon the wife. She does not present this bill in equity as the trustee of her husband, but it is upon the face distinctly asserted to be ‘ in right of the said Elvira L. the wife.’ We, therefore, decline to make the decree in form as requested.” The exceptions were sustained, and it was ordered that the plaintiffs pay the costs.</p>

Miller his wife, in the right of said Elvira,” yet the causes of complaint embraced therein, and the measure of relief sought, show that it was intended to serve a wider purpose than merely to protect her title. The husband joined in all the averments of the bill, and in the prayer for relief; nowhere, excepting in the statement of the parties, will it appear that the suit is preferred by the wife in her own right, and for her exclusive benefit. The prayers of the bill are, first, “that an account be stated between Henry H. Miller and Charles H. Miller, of all matters growing out of the real estate devised to them jointly by the will of their father, Henry Miller, deceased; ” second, “ that a proper decree be entered for the balance which may be found due to the said Charles H. Miller, after deducting the Klopp judgment; ” third, “that <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>the writ of venditioni exponas be stayed, and execution of the said judgment enjoined; ” and fourth, “ such other and further relief as may be proper.” As the husband was joined with the. wife in the pleadings, and the prayer was for relief which, if granted, was partly in her right as his assignee and partly in his own right, covering matters, however, arising out of the same transaction, the bill may be taken as a joint bill to obtain the relief prayed for. Especially is the bill to be so considered, in view of the fact that the trial proceeded upon this assumption, the evidence introduced being wholly consistent with this manifest and obvious intention of the parties.</p>

Miller was found to be indebted to different parties to an amount exceeding $4,000; part of which, perhaps $2,000, was owing to his wife, and a loan of $2,000 was effected by judgment upon the property to pay the balance. On the 6th April, 1871, “ in order to prevent the said Charles H. Miller from wasting his estate by contracting additional debts, and to secure the same for the benefit of himself and family,” it was arranged that his entire interest in his father’s estate should be transferred to his wife, and it was “ in consideration of the premises ” the conveyance was made. The plaintiffs were therefore the proper parties to a bill for an account of the matters alleged in the bill, and the defendant conceding this, exhibited his accounts and vouchers before the master. If the accounting resulted in his favor, we see no good reason why he was not entitled to a decree, not only as against Charles, who joined in the bill with full knowledge of its contents, but also against his wife, who was the assignee of the estate bound by the legacies and liens aforesaid. The legacies were charged upon the land by the express provisions of the will, and Henry, who was held therefor jointly with Charles, upon payment thereof, was without doubt entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the legatees, as against Charles’s interest in the land in the hands of his wife, as he had previously been subrogated to the rights of the plaintiff in the IClopp judgment, in which he was surety; for, whilst he was the principal debtor as to one half of the legacies, he would be regarded as surety for Charles as to the other half. It is plain that Elvira Miller took the estate charged with all the liabili<a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>ties attaching to it at the time of the conveyance. She cannot be regarded as a purchaser for value; the conveyance was voluntary; it was made to prevent her husband “ from wasting his estate by contracting additional debts, and to secure the same for the benefit of himself and family.” Such a conveyance would not be available to defeat the claims of existing creditors, and the Klopp judgment was a lien upon the land from the date of its entry. Moreover, her title was under the will of Henry Miller, deceased, by the provisions of which the legacies were expressly charged upon the land.</p>
