The point is defective, however, in that it omits to recite a material fact, on the subject of the competency of the evidence of Mr. Stull, and tending to show that, in his character of executor of Sophia Diehl, he was such a person as could receive a promise, or acknowledgment amounting to a promise to pay, from Mr. Breisch, such as would toll the running. of the statute. Therefore a refusal to affirm the point would not have been error: City of Altoona v. Lotz, <a href="/pa/114/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="114 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="549999" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0238-01">114 Pa. 238</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[238,1006,1184,1325]]]'>Neither could the point have been answered without a reference to this fact and a consequent qualification. This material fact, inadvertently omitted from the point reserved, and which it was necessary to include in it, in order to require a direct answer and to make the question of law decisive of the case, is the bequest in the will of David D. Diehl, deceased. The will is as follows : “ I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Sophia, all my real and personal estate, &amp;c.,....... together with all my outstanding money or claims of every kind, forever.” This bequest included the note in suit. The point admits that Mr. Stull was the executor of Sophia Diehl, and represented her estate when the conversation with Mr. Breisch occurred. When the evidence of Mr. Stull was admitted, the will of David D. Diehl had not been formally offered and received in evidence, but it was put in evidence before the close of plaintiff’s case. It appears to us, its effect was to attach to the evidence of Mr. Stull a greater scope than it before possessed. It showed that when the admissions were made to him by Mr. Breisch, he was not such a stranger that an acknowledgment or promise to him, otherwise sufficient to toll the running of the statute, would not be binding upon the debtor. By the will, the note in suit belonged to the estate of Sophia Diehl, of which Mr. Stull was then the executor, and although he might not sue upon it in that capacity, he was such an owner of the note that a promise to him would be binding upon Mr. Breisch, the debtor.</p>

He could therefore receive a promise to pay, or an acknowledgment consistent with such a promise. When he took out letters, he was competent to sue upon the claim thus acknowledged: Keely v. Wright, 5 W. N. 241. The principle involved is the same in both cases. Mr. Briesch, by making an inventory of the note in Sophia Diehl’s estate, while serving as a sworn appraiser, acknowledged her ownership of the note, and is estopped from now denying it.</p>

    <p id="b123-9" data-blocks='[["BL_123.10",123,[133,1229,1187,717]]]'>It is settled law that the promise must be made to the plaintiff or his authorized agent. A promise made to a stranger who has no interest in the transaction does not bind the promising party. Gillingham v. Gillingham, <a href="/pa/17/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="17 Pa. 302" data-case-ids="967584" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0302-01">17 Pa. 302</a>; Kyle v.

The rule that the promise must be made to the plaintiff or his agent means nothing more, however, than that it must be made to a party in interest. Thus it was held in Keely v. Wright, 5 W. N. 241, that where a promise had been made to the husband, after the death of his wife, but before he had taken out letters of administration upon her estate, the promise was binding upon the party making it. The ground of this decision was that the husband was not a stranger, but was the owner of the note in question as part of his wife’s estate.</p>
    <p id="b123-10" data-blocks='[["BL_123.11",123,[130,1953,1186,454]],["BL_124.1",124,[263,357,1183,665]]]'>In the case in hand the note originally belonged to the estate of David D. Diehl. He died, leaving a will in which he bequeathed his estate to his wife and appointed her the executrix of his will. She filed an inventory, but never filed a settlement of his estate. The note in controversy was never collected, but she received the interest for some time. Mrs. Diehl then died testate, having appointed Reuben S. Stull her executor. The note was included in the inventory of her estate, of which David T. Breiseh, one of, the defendants below, <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>was an appraiser. Subsequently Stull took out letters d. b. n. o. t. a. upon the estate of David D. Diehl and brought this suit to recover the amount due on the note. The promise in question was made before he took out the letters upon David D. Diehl’s estate and while he was the executor of the estate of Mrs. Diehl. Upon this state of facts we have no hesitation in holding that he was such a party in interest as made the promise binding. He was the executor of Sophia Diehl and she was the party in interest. She was the owner of the note, subject to its liability for David D. Diehl’s debts. Her executor cannot therefore be said to be a stranger. Indeed it is difficult to see how a binding promise could have been made to any one else.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[266,1029,1182,460]]]'>Nor are we in any doubt as to the second proposition. The words of the defendant Breisch relied upon to take the case out of the statute are as follows: “ In case they (the other parties to the note) don’t pay it; let me know it, then I will pay it; I don’t want to have any trouble any further.” This is clear and distinct. There was no question about the identity of the note or its amount. The promise was unequivocal to pay if the others did not. The others did not pay and the defendant is liable.</p>
    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[1038,1494,363,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
