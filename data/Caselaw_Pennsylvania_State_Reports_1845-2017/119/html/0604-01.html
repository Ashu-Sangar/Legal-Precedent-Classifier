F. Avery entered two judgments against Ms father, Cyrus Avery, for the amounts which you have heard mentioned here ; one judgment for fifteen hundred dollars, and one for two thousand dollars with some payments indorsed upon it. On the judgments entered upon those notes, writs were issued from this court to Bradford county and placed in the hands of the sheriff to levy upon the property, a list of which has been read in your hearing, and which was sold some time in the spring of 1877. [These plaintiffs, being creditors of Cyrus Avery, alleged that those judgments were given for a fraudulent purpose ; that they were not bona fide; that <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>it was a transaction between father and son; and that the father having become embarrassed in his business transactions, in order to make a feather bed to rest himself upon, got his son to agree to cover up the property so that the creditors could not reach it.]3 Under that allegation these plaintiffs issued an execution against Cyrus Avery, alleging that because the judgments of the son were fraudulent they were therefore worthless and did not stand in the way of creditors levying upon the property which had been bought in on those fraudulent judgments. The purchasers at that sale were E. F. Avery and A. R. Brown. Mr. Brown was a relative, and whether he would be affected by the fraud of the father and son is not very important here, because he is not a party to this suit. [These plaintiffs issued their execution, levied upon that property and sold it to different parties at sheriff’s sale; other persons became purchasers and the moneys received from that sale were appropriated by the sheriff upon other claims, so that a portion only, I believe, of the executions were paid by those sales.]4 Now, that left the sheriff who made that sale, and the plaintiffs who procured him to make it, liable to A. R. Brown and E. F. Avery in an action of trespass, if that was a bona fide sale to them of the property of Cyrus Avery. It was fair to presume that Brown and E. F. Avery were making a claim, for the property was sold on the judgments of E. F. Avery and they had become the purchasers.</p>

[You will perceive that there was a lapse of time from the 9th to the 28d of February, within which it is testified by some of the witnesses there was some talk in regard to the settlement of the claims against Cyrus Avery, and that there was a release to be signed by E. F. Avery and Brown prepared, whether upon the Thursday of the week of the sentence or some other day in that week is not definitely fixed by the evidence, nor is it very material, further than this, that before anything was said, so far as the evidence shows, about what was to be done with the criminal prosecution, there came up this question of getting a release from Avery and Brown.]6 Mr. Avery says he recollects very little about the release business and it will be for you to say whether he did not take that release, go to Brown and endeavor to get it signed by him, and whether it was not understood, at the time the release was prepared, that the signature to that would be a settlement of the matters, upon his paying the claims of persons which had not been satisfied by this sheriff’s sale. There were some of these creditors that were not execution creditors and they received nothing upon those sales, so that the release did not affect them or take them into consideration at all. Mr. Brown declined to sign the release. The plaintiffs allege that it was then suggested that Mr. Avery should give a bond of indemnity to those plaint<a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>iffs who sold the property the second time, and they also allege that this bond was given in lieu of the release which Avery had supposed he could procure but did not.</p>

On the strength of that he signed the bond, and on the way to the court house he met Mr. Foyle, who also held a claim; that Foyle stated that some of the counsel said his claim must come in; that he then gave liis note for that and also for the other claims of the plaintiffs not embraced in those executions that had been satisfied by the sale.....</p>

On the other side there is evidence, all of wMch. you will no doubt distinctly remember, that Mr. Elsbree, who seemed to be rather the protecting counsel of Mr. Avery, said, when the propositions for settlement by giving a bond and paying the debt, etc., were made, “if the debts are satisfied we will run our risk as to the sentence,”.....</p>

The man who conspires with another to defraud a third person is liable in a twofold manner. The offence of conspiring is a public one; it is against the commonwealth; it is detrimental to the interests of society, and persons who put their heads together to do a wrong the law punishes criminally.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b636-4" data-blocks='[["BL_636.4",636,[283,386,1194,2042]],["BL_637.1",637,[162,353,1190,1533]]]'>
      <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>But if a private individual is injured in any manner by the conspiracy he has his remedy by a civil action. Although the commonwealth may have asserted her claim upon the party for punishment because of the offence, the private right remains still to be redressed. It would be intolerable that because a man was indicted and punished the individual whose property is taken and whose interest is jeopardized should go without compensation. Therefore, the law allows private injuries to be compensated for by the party who has caused them to be committed. So that, if by the conspiracy between Cyrus Avery and his father the plaintiffs in this case were induced to make costs in endeavoring to get their pay, and were misled by the appearance of fraud, it would be competent for E. F. Avery to secure them against any loss that might happen because of any attempt of his to defraud them. He would be doing nothing more than what was his right and his duty to the other party. [So that if this bond was given for the purpose of making good any loss which these parties might sustain because of the conspiracy, so far as that is concerned, it would be a good consideration.] 6 But, gentlemen, even such a bond as that, for such a purpose, could not be obtained and held to be valid if the party receiving it as part of the consideration entered into an arrangement to thwart the law and the commonwealth in its operations against the man. So, where there is a criminal prosecution and the party injured agrees to stop that prosecution, not to appear or in any way affect it, for a compensation or for the purpose of getting what he claims to be his due, the law holds an instrument, obtained under such circumstances, invalid. If the object and purpose in taking an instrument in writing, bond, obligation, note or anything else, be to thwart the cause of justice, and turn it aside from its proper channel, it would be invalid because illegal, and the object and purpose would be contrary to the policy of the law. Nothing should transpire to prevent justice being administered. [I can very well understand that there would be a difference between that case, where parties stopped a prosecution where it had been commenced, dropped it on receiving compensation, or on receiving an obligation that was still executory, and where he has followed it through to the end of the law and obtained a conviction. There he has so <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>far performed Ms duty to the public. If a public wrong is committed it should be prosecuted not only for the punishment of the offender, but for the protection of the community against others in like cases offending. And where a party has prosecuted a case to the end, I don’t think it would be sufficient of itself to defeat an obligation that he might take by his saying to the court, the party has satisfied me.] <em>7 </em>If a man obtain money from another by false pretences, is prosecuted for it and convicted and returns and pays the party for it, no law forbids the statement of such fact to the court. In cases of assault and battery and many other cases of that nature where a private wrong is connected with it, the prosecutor may say to the court, the party has satisfied me M the case, and let the court dispose of the matter as it may think justice to the public requires. If that is wrong it is often done in courts and, so far as I know, has never been considered a violation of law on the part of the court or as wrong on the part of the prosecutor. What I consider to be wrong, would be, if a party was compelled to do an act which he would not otherwise have done except for a threat on the one hand and an implied promise on the other; a threat that sentence should be severe if he did not settle with Mm, and a promise it should be light if he did settle with him. When the thumb-screw of a prosecution is made use of for the. purpose of wringing money from a man or wringing an obligation from Mm, and thus imposing what is called duress upon Ms mind and causing him to act through fear, such an obligation as that might be, and probably would be, void, while a voluntary one given by a party would be good, although he had been prosecuted and convicted.....</p>

The mere fact that the settlement was made shortly before the sentence was to be pronounced, would not of itself be sufficient to vitiate the bond.

If the jury find all that upon the testimony that has been given here, then I affirm that position, otherwise the point is not affirmed. If, when the defendant was refusing to sign the bond, he was induced to do it by a statement that he would go to the penitentiary if he did not sign it and the sentence of the court would be merely a nominal one if he did, and upon the strength of that he was induced to sign the bond, the bond would be void by the policy of the law.

The issue was solely as to the execution and validity of the bond; there was no question as to the breach of it. The evidence of the suit against the sheriff of Bradford county was of a suit brought long after the bond was given. The fact of another suit with one of the parties to the issue could throw no light on the giving of the bond. Moreover,’ under the second assignment of error, the offer was not to show that the bond was given to indemnify against the judgments offered in evidence, nor was the admission made good by a subsequent offer or admission of such evidencé. It was not in rebuttal of anything offered by the defendant, and had nothing to do with the giving of the bond. So, in an examination of the evidence, there will not be found a word or syllable showing that the consideration of the bond or the negotiations of the parties <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>was for the purpose of compensating the plaintiffs for any damages sustained by reason of any conspiracy.

The consideration of the bond was not anything growing out of the proceedings against Cyrus Avery under the act of 1842, for he had been discharged in December, 1877; nor the assignments of debts for which Cyrus Avery was arrested, for E. F. Avery had already paid these debts and taken the assignments before he signed the bond. The only consideration was the hope of obtaining a modified sentence and the fear of the “ law taking its course.” After conviction the defendant would undoubtedly feel himself more in the power of the prosecutors than before.

    <p id="b642-5" data-blocks='[["BL_642.6",642,[261,417,1178,608]]]'>The issue in this case was framed in order to determine the validity of a bond given by Avery to the defendants in error upon which judgment had been regularly entered in the Common Pleas of Wyoming county. The allegation of Avery was that the bond had been obtained from him by duress. The evidence given on the trial shows that the obligor and Cyrus Avery, his father, had been indicted in the Quarter Sessions of Bradford county for conspiring to cheat and defraud the creditors of Cyrus Avery, and that upon a trial before a jury they had been convicted. The verdict was rendered against them on the 9th February, 1878, and the sentence was postponed until the 23d day of the same month.</p>
    <p id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.7",642,[264,1033,1179,957]]]'>In the interval, E. F. Avery paid or secured the several creditors of Cyrus Avery against whom it was alleged the conspiracy was directed, and gave the bond in controversy. The purpose of the bond was to protect the obligees from the claims of E. F. Avery and one A. R. Brown against them for the seizure and sale of personal property which Avery and Brown had bought at sheriff’s sale as the property of Cyrus Avery, and which the obligees had again levied on and sold as the property of the same defendant, notwithstanding notice of the title of E. F. Avery and Brown. The proceeds of such second sale having gone in part payment of the debts of Cyrus Avery which E. F. Avery was paying or securing at this time, the bond was given to protect the creditors at whose instance the sale was made, and close out the prospect for further litigation. On the 23d February, 1878, when the defendants were called for sentence, the court was made aware of what Avery had done in the premises, and thereupon sentenced the defendants to pay a fine of five dollars and the costs of prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b642-7" data-blocks='[["BL_642.8",642,[266,2008,1177,397]],["BL_643.1",643,[154,348,1182,293]]]'>On the trial of this issue E. F. Avery insisted that he executed the bond under the influence of representations made to him by the creditors and their attorneys, that if he did not do so he would be sentenced to the penitentiary, while if he executed the bond his sentence would be a nominal one. The defendants in error denied that the bond was executed under duress, and alleged on the contrary that the overtures which resulted in the settlement of their debts and the execution of <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>the bond were made by Avery; that they assigned to him the several claims against his father which,he paid or secured; and that they made no threats or promises to induce the execution of the bond by him except a promise that the court should be advised of whatever he might do for their protection.</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.5",643,[155,659,1182,1014]]]'>Here was a plain question of fact for the decision of the jury. It was fairly and clearly presented to them by the court. They were instructed, if they should find from the evidence that the bond was obtained by duress, or was given in pursuance of an arrangement to turn aside the course of justice, or to prevent the prosecution or punishment of crime, it was not binding, and their verdict should be in favor of the defendant in the issue. This was as favorable an instruction as the defendant was entitled to ash. His contention is rather, as it seems to us, with the jury than with the court, for the verdict shows that they gave credit to the testimony on behalf of the obligees and rejected his version of the transaction. They found that the bond was not executed under duress, that it was not intended to prevent the due administration of the criminal law, but was given voluntarily, for the purpose of making reparation for the offence of which he had been found guilty. We cannot see that they were misled by the learned judge in his charge either as to the evidence they were to consider, or the rules of law by which they were to be governed.</p>

Avery in the issue trying. The admission of the evidence which is the subject of the second assignment, was proper for the same reason and because it was part of the history of the transaction out of which the giving of the bond in suit resulted.</p>
    <p id="b643-7" data-blocks='[["BL_643.7",643,[159,2157,1179,250]],["BL_644.1",644,[239,350,1179,353]]]'>The language of the learned judge complained of in the third assignment, was not his own characterization of the conduct of the father and son, but a statement of what the creditors of Cyrus Avery, the plaintiffs in the issue, alleged against him and E.

The real contest was over the circumstances connected with the execution and delivery of the bond; upon this subject the charge was correct both in its recitals of the evidence and its instructions. None of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
