The 1st section of the- act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 161, is in this language: “ The justices of the peace of the several counties of the commonwealth shall have <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>jurisdiction of all causes of action arising from contract, either express or implied, in all cases where the sum demanded is not above one hundred dollars ; except in cases of real contracts, 'where the title to lands or tenements may come in question, or action upon promise of marriage.” Our attention has been directed to numerous authorities, in which this section has been considered. These decisions show that the exception to this section excludes from the jurisdiction of justices, every suit on a contract concerning or in any way connected with realty, whether it be to enforce payment of purchase money, or to recover back what has been paid by the vendee after rescission of the agreement, or though it be on a note given in consideration of an easement: Lauchner v. Rex, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20Pa.%20468" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 Pa. 468">20 Pa. 468</a>. Whether or not Snell’s claim of set-off comes within the exception of this section of the act of 1810, or any of the decisions under it, does not seem entirety clear, for Snell had conveyed to Deihm the property he sold to him, and receipted for all the purchase money, and actually received 'all over the amount of the mortgage. The mortgage was a lien on the lot and Deihm’s purchase was subject to it, and Snell had no claim whatever upon Deihm, until after he had been compelled to pay the mortgage, by reason of Deihm’s default. Snell’s claim exists only by virtue of Deihm’s covenant under the agreement of April 9,1875. The case in this respect is to some extent like that of Helfenstein v. Hurst, <a href="/pa/15/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="408816" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0358-01">15 Pa. 358</a>. Helfenstein held a mortgage on the property of Hauss, and Hurst held a judgment of $200 after it; Hauss’ property was sold and bought by Hurst’s administrator, and it was agreed that Helfenstein should have it at $1,500 and pay $100 on Hurst’s judgment which was not reached by the fund; Helfenstein was substituted as the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale in place of Hurst. Hurst subsequently sued Helfenstein before a justice,-and it was claimed that the justice had no jurisdiction under the act of 1810. Though this judgment was a lien on the real estate at the time of the sale and entered into the transaction by which Helfenstein was made the purchaser and acquired the title, yet the jurisdiction was sustained, and it was treated as a contract to buy and sell a judgment, without regard to title.</p>

This really is the important question in this case. What is it that determines whether or not a justice has jurisdiction under act of 1810 ? Surely the character of set-off that a defendant may present, cannot decide whether or not the justice may take jurisdiction. It is the plaintiff’s demand that must be considered in determining this question, and it is his demand that is set forth upon the record of a justice to show the jurisdiction. In this case the justice had jurisdiction of the plaintiff’s claim, and the appeal to this court brought up a proceeding in which the justice had jurisdiction both of the person and the subject matter. We may here remark that the claim of set-off exceeds in amount the jurisdiction of the justice, being beyond three hundred dollars. Hence if free from the other difficulty, it could not have been presented to the justice on tiffs account, unless it had been divided. Dividing a defendant’s setoff, and submitting a part thereof to defeat the plaintiff and then suing for the balance, not only tends to confusion, but to multiply actions and is not favored. That a plaintiff cannot relinquish a portion of his claim, and thereby confer jurisdiction upon the justice, has been repeatedly decided. But none of our cases hold that when the justice has jurisdiction of the plaintiff’s demand, and the defendant’s set-off is beyond his jurisdiction, that such set-off may not be offered in the Common Pleas. The very reverse was held in Boone v. Boone, 17 S. &amp; R. 386. In that case the plaintiff brought suit before a justice and the defendant’s set-off exceeded the jurisdiction of the justice. In the Common Pleas the defendant offered his set-off, and not only defeated the plaintiff, but in addition obtained a judgment against the plaintiff for $115. This case then determines two propositions, first that the defendant may offer a Sehoff in the Common Pleas that was beyond the jurisdiction of the justice; and second, that he may recover a judgment for an amount greater than that of which a justice could take jurisdiction under the act of 1810. If this may be dpne when the want of jurisdiction is due to the amount of defendant’s set-off, why may it not be done when the set-off arises from a real contract? The Common Pleas is as competent to try the <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>question before a jury called in this case, as it would be, before a jury called in a suit in which this defendant had become the plaintiff. The plaintiff was accorded the same right in this trial that he would be entitled to, as the defendant in another action. Why should the court be required to try two issues when the same result can be produced by the trial of one, and without injury to either of the parties ? We can discover nothing in the act of 1810, or our decisions, that makes this necessary.</p>

This assignment cannot affect the defendant’s right of set-off, nor will the amount certified in favor of the defendant, affect the assignee. In Armstrong v. Lancaster City, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%2068" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 W. 68">5 W. 68</a>, C. J.

Tbe action originated before a justice of tbe peace and was <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>for the recovery of the balance due on a note given on the 21st August, 1878, for $83.90. The justice entered judgment against the defendant on the 28th January, 1884, for $56.87. The defendant appealed, and in the Common Pleas pleaded set-off. On the trial he gave in evidence, under objection, a contract between himself and Snell, bearing date on the 9th April, 1875, duly signed and sealed, which, after reciting that he had sold to Deihm a lot of landin Pottsville for the sum of $1,250, and that there was a mortgage upon it in favor of A. H. Halberstadt for $900 and interest, contained the covenant of Deihm to pay the said mortgage “ in part payment of the purchase-money ” of the said lot. He then gave evidence to show that the mortgage was not paid by Deihm, but was proceeded upon by the holder and the property bound by it brought to sale by the sheriff; that he became the purchaser of the mortgaged premises, which included the lot sold to Deihm and an adjoining one owned by himself, at an actual cost of $1,214. He claimed to recover the difference between this sum and the $900 which Deihm agreed to pay, together with the interest thereon. The court below held that after the appeal from the justice the trial was de novo, and therefore the limits which bounded the jurisdiction of the justice were left at the door of the Common Pleas, which was unfettered by them and could take cognizance as in an action originally brought therein. Accordingly the court admitted the alleged set-off, extinguished the plaintiff’s claim with part of it, and rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant for $254.83.</p>

The mechanical work of the trial, such as the formation of the proper issue, the production of the testimony, and the decision of the questions involved, is de novo, but the cause of action remains the same. If the justice had no jurisdiction, an appeal from his judgment does not dispose of the objection, but it may be raised at any time in the Common Pleas. Neither the laches of the defendant nor his consent can give jurisdiction: Collins v. Collins, <a href="/pa/37/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="37 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="418858" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0387-01">37 Pa. 387</a>.

The damages which Snell claimed, and was allowed to recover, were more than $300. The learned judge before whom the case was tried seemed satisfied that a justice of the peace would have had no jurisdiction of an action brought upon the bond, both because of the amount claimed to be due, and because it was given for the purchase-money of land, the title to which might therefore come in question on the trial; but he asks, “ If Snell’s set-off be regarded as a claim arising out of a real contract, does it follow that he cannot avail himself of it in the Common Pleas because it is excepted from the jurisdiction of the justice ? ” He then proceeds to answer this question in the negative, holding that after an appeal the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas, and not that of the justice, is to be considered. This was clearly wrong. The statutes limiting and defining the jurisdiction of a justice are not left behind when a case comes into the Common Pleas by appeal, but are to be applied by the judge in the same manner as by the justice. If the justice had not jurisdiction of the cause of action or the contract or demand sought to be used as a set-off, the Common Pleas will not have it after an appeal. The forum is changed by the appeal, but the cause of action remains the same: Moore v.
