It is true Judge Hagenman signed an ex parte decree making such a distribution. This decree, however, has no validity or binding effect upon the rights of creditors. The court have no power to make distribution of the fund without notice to the creditors, who are first entitled before distribution can be made to heirs and legatees. In this case no such notice was given and the <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>creditors never had their day in court.

This allegation was not sustained by proof. It was the duty of the attorney who represented the creditors to take care of their interests. Why should he then consent to the distribution of the funds to the heirs, before the claims of the creditors, his own clients, were satisfied ? If this fact had been established by testimony it would have been a fraud upon the creditors, and it would have been the duty of the court to set aside the decree distributirig the funds to the heirs. Upon neither of the grounds relied on by the accountant should this decree be sustained.</p>

It is stated in the appellant's paper book and the appellees make no denial of the fact, that at the time of making this decree it was believed that the balance on the third account was sufficient to pay all the known debts or demands against the estate remaining unsatisfied, and this balance having been deducted from the aggregate funds in the accountant’s hands, the residue being the balance on the fourth account, appeared to be due to the distributees. Simon P. Guldin had died in 1874, and this account was filed in 1882; full eight years had intervened, during which period creditors would be presumed to have made known their claims. Refunding bonds were thereupon duly executed, were approved by the court, and filed, as required by law, and the money was paid out pursuant to the decree. In this state of the case, it is difficult to see upon what principle of the law the accountant can, in this form of proceeding, be held to pay these moneys a second time.</p>
