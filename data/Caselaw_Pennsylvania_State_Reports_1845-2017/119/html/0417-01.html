We see nothing to justify the holding of the existence of any such contract relation between the defendant and the state. The defendant does not hold its corporate powers by virtue of a charter from this state, and the act of 1873 neither strengthens nor impairs its corporate powers. It in no way interferes with the charter. Nor do we see anything to indicate any contract, which a legislature may not impair. The act simply regulates the manner and conditions under which such corporations may from time to time be licensed, or permitted to do business in the state, if they so choose. It repealed the previous regulations of the act of 1868. As was said in Thorne v. Travelers Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=80%20Pa.%2028" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 Pa. 28">80 Pa. 28</a>, “ there can be no doubt of the constitutional power of the legislature to prescribe the conditions under which a foreign corporation shall transact business in this state.” The act of 1868 did this, no one contending that, by any of its provisions, it created a contract relation between such corporation and the state, although the seventh section of the act contained the similar provision of a tax of three per cent, on premiums, found in the act of 1873. The repeal shows the deliberate purpose of the state to make no surrender of its right of taxation. It created, abolished, and again imposed its regulations. The act of 1873, in all its provisions, simply prescribes the conditions under which the foreign corporation may do business, the legislature again asserting its right of taxation in section 10, imposing the three per cent, on premiums, and, whilst in section 17 prohibiting a city from levying any tax, it does not prohibit itself from so doing. Nowhere is there any surrender by the state, either of the right of taxation, or of its power to relieve or change the character of such taxation, or of its power to delegate its right to the city. No such surrender is expressed, and none can be implied. In Durach’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20494" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="62 Pa. 494">62 Pa. 494</a>, it is said, “the municipal government is really but a branch of the government of the state, and whatever powers of taxation the legislature possesses, they may lawfully grant or delegate to <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>such body.” It follows, therefore, that such power of taxation, not having been surrendered, and having been delegated to the city of Reading by the act of 1887, defendant is liable to the tax imposed by the ordinance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[176,570,1186,1746]]]'>The authorities of our Supreme Court upon the question, are clear and numerous. The Bank of Easton v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20449" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 Pa. 449">10 Pa. 449</a>, is a carefully considered case, on all fours with the present. The same constitutional question was raised. The bank, under the act of March 25,1824, was made a corporation “upon the conditions thereinafter specified.” By the twenty-fourth section, P. L. 70, a tax of eight per cent, of the whole of the dividends was imposed. By a subsequent act, this rate was increased. The latter act was held constitutional, and it was held that the former “ was intended as a restraint upon the banks to limit their power and to prescribe the mode in which their business should be conducted; and not as a pact by which the government undertook to relinquish any power inherent in it, or confer immunities beyond those expressly given; ” that the tax clause “ is nothing mare than a simple declaration of the tax then to be paid by the institution, and we there look in vain for the slightest intimation of an agreement or even understanding between the parties, that this tax should not be increased during the existence of the charter. To deduce from premises so insufficient, a consequence of such magnitude, would be a gross violation of the wholesome principle that an abandonment of the power of taxation is only to be established by clearly showing this to have been the deliberate purpose of the act.” These principles were affirmed in Bank of Pennsylvania v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/19/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="19 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="970555" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0144-01">19 Pa. 144</a>, in a vigorous opinion by Chief Justice Black; again approved in an opinion of Justice Woodward, in making a general review of the authorities, in Iron City Bank v.

    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.7",448,[246,773,1178,403]]]'>This case stated is defective in not specifying the class to which the city of Reading belongs. We learn from the opinion of the court below that it is a city of the fifth class, but we cannot incorporate -the opinion of the learned judge into the case stated. We might well affirm the judgment upon this ground alone, but inasmuch as it is admitted by counsel on both sides that Reading is a city of the fifth class, we will consider the case upon its merits.</p>
    <p id="b448-7" data-blocks='[["BL_448.8",448,[245,1185,1177,197]]]'>The act of May 24, 1887, P. L. 204, authorizes cities of the fifth class to levy and collect for general revenue purposes an annual license tax on insurance companies, or agencies, and regulates the collection of the same.</p>
    <p id="b448-8" data-blocks='[["BL_448.9",448,[242,1390,1179,764]]]'>The defendant below is a corporation chartered under the laws of the state of Connecticut. It has complied with the provisions of the act of April 4, 1873, P. L. 20, entitled “An act to establish an Insurance Department.” It has an agency in the city of Reading. Section 17, of said act of April 4, 1873, provides as follows : “ That it shall not be lawful for any city, county, or municipality to impose or collect any license fee or tax upon insurance companies, or their agents authorized to transact business under this act.” The city of Reading, by ordinance of councils, has imposed a tax of fifty dollars on every fire insurance company or agency within the city. The only question we are asked to decide is whether section 17 of said act of April 4, 1873, is repealed by the act of 1887. The court below held that it was so repealed, and entered judgment for the plaintiff upon the case stated.</p>
    <p id="b448-9" data-blocks='[["BL_448.10",448,[241,2163,1178,250]],["BL_449.1",449,[173,353,1178,553]]]'>We see no error in this. It was contended in the court below that the act of 1873 was a contract so far as foreign insurance companies were concerned, by which the state agreed not to tax them for the future. This position was abandoned here, however, and very properly, as it was unsound. The exempt<a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>ing clause of tbe act of 1878 is general in its terms, and is applicable to foreign and domestic companies alike. Tbe act of 1887 is also general in tbis respect. While tbe latter act contains no express repeal, it introduces a new rule upon tbe subject, and fully supplies tbe act of 1873. As was well observed by tbe court below, “ tbe repugnancy between tbe old and new clauses is total and manifest.” It will be noticed that tbe act of 1887, and the ordinance of tbe city in pursuance thereof, make no distinction between domestic and foreign insurance companies. Tbe license tax is imposed upon all alike.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[173,922,1178,199]]]'>The learned judge of tbe court below has disposed of tbis question in a clear and well considered opinion, citing a number of authorities to sustain his ruling, in view of which a further discussion of tbe case by tbis court is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b449-6" data-blocks='[["BL_449.6",449,[942,1128,363,45]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
