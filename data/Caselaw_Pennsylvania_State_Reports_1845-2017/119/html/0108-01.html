For example, in the third item he devises a house and lot to his son Lewis “for and during his lifetime, and at and immediately after Ms death, I give and devise the same unto the children of my said son Lewis C., their heirs and assigns forever as tenants in common;” and in the fourth item he devises a house and lot to Ms “son Samuel Shirk, and to his heirs and assigns forever.”</p>

Prima facie, however, the word means “heirs of the body,” and is to be construed as a word of limitation and not of purchase, unless there be something on the face of the will to show it was intended to have a less extended meaning, and to be applied to children only, or to a particular class, or at a particular time. Standing alone, therefore, the words “ die without leaving issue ” and other expressions of the same import mean an indefinite failure of issue: Taylor v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/63/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="63 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1019043" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0481-01">63 Pa. 481</a>; Middleswarth’s Adm. v. Blackmore, 74 Idem 414. At common law, in the absence of words making a different intent apparent, the established interpretation of such expressions in a will is that they import a general indefinite failure of issue, and not a failure at the death of the first taker; and such has undoubt<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>edly been the rule in this state since Eichelberger v.

In that case the testator directed that if his son Henry “ should die without leaving any lawful issue, that then his full share should go to his brothers and sisters,” and it was held that Henry took a fee-tail. Some of the later cases in which the rule is recognized are Lawrence v. Lawrence, <a href="/pa/105/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="105 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="454220" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0335-01">105 Pa. 335</a>; Carroll v.

If so, he created an estate, which according to all the authorities would have been an estate-tail prior to the act of April 27, 1855, but which under its operation is converted into a fee simple. Indeed it is conceded there is nothing in the will to qualify or limit the meaning of the words in question, unless it be the ■ clause wherein the testator says: “ It being my express will, and I hereby order and direct that under no circumstances shall the late divorced wife of my deceased son Lorenzo have any part or portion of my estate and effects, whether real, personal, or mixed.”</p>
