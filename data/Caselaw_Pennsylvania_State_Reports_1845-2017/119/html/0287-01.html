    <p class="summary" id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[244,565,1182,1733]]]'>From the evidence presented as aforesaid the master and examiner finds: That Albert F. Damon, the plaintiff, is the owner and occupant of a dwelling-house and country-seat situate in Darby township, Delaware county. The premises comprise about forty acres of land, and have been owned by the plaintiff for twenty-six years last past. The dwelling is mainly of brick. To the original building, which is perhaps a century old, additions have been made and improvements therein effected, from time to time, until the structure, while in no sense elegant, is yet commodious and convenient, and altogether a very desirable country home. There is also a large stone and frame barn and two-story spring-house, good buildings, in keeping with the general character of the place. The spring-house is in front of the dwelling, at the foot of the knoll upon which the latter is situated, and about two hundred and twenty feet distant, with a board walk between. From the spring, water is supplied to the dwelling by means of a hydraulic ram. The only approach to the dwelling is by a private lane or carriage-way leading in from the Darby road, which carriage-way from a distance of perhaps four hundred feet from the dwelling-house rises at a moderate grade to the house, where it turns and continues to the barn, about sixty feet away. The pipes from the hydraulic ram to the dwelling run parallel with this carriage-way, and near to it. Upon the one side of this carriage-way is the spring-house before mentioned, and a somalí inclosure, part of which is used as a tennis ground and the remainder filled with fruit trees, the two being separated by merely a terrace. Upon the other side, and also inclosed, is a garden of considerable extent, from which the families of the plaintiff and his son have been supplied with vegetables and fruit. From the barnyard a small lane led to a trough below the spring-house, supplied with water from the spring. To this trough the cattle came by the lane aforesaid for water.</p>

The said railroad is in front of the plaintiff’s dwelling, and is located upon an embankment which crosses about the center of the garden aforesaid, destroys a small corner of the terrace at the end of the lawn tennis ground, and occupies a greater part of the remainder of the same inclosure containing fruit trees. It separates the spring-house from the dwelling and the barn, passing very close to the latter. It is one hundred and ten feet from the dwelling to the nearest line of this embankment and one hundred and thirty-eight feet to the track. The carriage-way is spanned by a bridge about ten feet in height and with a width between walls of twenty feet. This carriage-way has not been changed, but it is proposed by the defendant to lower its grade by excavation at the bridge, so as to give at that point a clear height of eleven or twelve feet. This change of grade will not, in the opinion of the master, materially affect or render more difficult the approach to the dwelling. The route through the property of the plaintiff was chosen from several surveys made as being the most practicable because of its doing the least damage not only to the property of the plaintiff, but also to other properties for several miles on either side thereof; also because of favorable topographical features.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-4" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[149,1562,1192,869]],["BL_314.1",314,[252,370,1181,1489]]]'>Section 10, act of February 19, 1849, is as follows: “The president and directors of such company shall have power by themselves, their engineers, superintendents, agents, artisans, and workmen, to survey, ascertain, locate, fix, mark and determine such route for a railroad as they may deem expedient, not, however, passing through any burying ground or place of worship, or any dwelling-house in the occupancy of the owner or owners thereof, without his, her, or their consent.” Has the construction of the railroad as aforesaid been in violation of the provisions of the act just cited? This is the only question in the cause. Its proper determination rests upon a proper interpretation of the words of the act. This interpretation, the plaintiff contends, should be fullest in favor of the land owner, and that anything short of this would but defeat the manifest purpose of the legislature in imposing such a restriction. He submits, therefore, that the word “house” as used in the act should be taken to mean not merely the inclosure of the four <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>walls of a dwelling, but “such amount of land surrounding it as would afford a reasonable enjoyment and occupation of the house, together with the necessary and convenient access to the same from the public highway — in short that the curtilage is part of the house.” In support of this he cites a number of cases determined in both the English and American courts, involving the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 8 &amp; 9 Victoria, the Mechanics’ Lien Laws, and the criminal law, wherein the word “ house ” has received the construction thus contended for; claiming that under these decisions, the defendant having constructed its railroad through the curtilage of the plaintiff, has taken for its purposes that which is exempt by act of assembly. To this the defendant makes answer that the gardens and other lands of the plaintiff occupied by its railroad are in no wise a part of the house, that they lack even the essential feature of a curtilage appurtenant to a dwelling, viz., that it should be in the same inclosure with the house, and that in construing the term “ house ” it is no aid to inquire as to what passes by implication in the conveyance or devise of a dwelling-house, nor as to the width of significance of the word as it appears in the Mechanics’ Lien Laws; since in the one case the extent of the conveyance or devise depends upon the intention of the parties, and, in the other, the ground adjacent to the building and necessary for its reasonable enjoyment is expressly included within the application of the lien. The defendant also cites the acts of incorporation of various railroad companies, .wherein the terms “ dwelling-house ” and “ out-buildings ” are used distinctively and in no wise synonymously.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[252,1867,1182,556]],["BL_315.1",315,[189,357,1179,354]]]'>In the determination of this cause, however, we are happily relieved from dependence upon any of the authorities cited, which at best have but an indirect application. The Supreme Court has very recently, in Swift and Given’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/111/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="111 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="545431" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0516-01">111 Pa. 516</a>, interpreted for us that portion of the act of 1849 before cited, as follows: “ It certainly does not mean that the prohibition extends only to the preventing the railroad from actually passing ‘ through ’ the dwelling-house. When the latter is occupied by the owner thereof, the statute gives it all the protection necessary for its reasonable enjoyment as a dwelling for the OAvner and his family. , This necessarily includes some <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>curtilage connected therewith. The exact extent of that curtilage cannot be defined by any arbitrary rule as to distance. As each case arises, the right of the owner and occupier of the dwelling-house, against the hostile location, of a railroad, must be determined by a consideration of what is necessary for a reasonable and proper enjoyment of the house as a residence in view of its location and surroundings.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[190,719,1187,1638]]]'>Judged by this rule we do not think the construction of the railroad as aforesaid is in violation of the statutory provision. The facts of the case under consideration are, to be sure, very much more in favor of a different conclusion than were the circumstances of Swift and Given’s appeal. The location of the railroad in question is in front of the dwelling and near to it. It occupies a large part of the vegetable garden in cultivation. It crosses the carriage-way leading to the dwelling, separates the latter from the spring-house, crosses some ground planted with fruit trees, which are thereby destroyed, occupies a cattle lane leading from the barn to the spring-house, and passes within a few feet of the corner of the barn. That great damage has been done to the plaintiff’s property there is no doubt, and yet does the situation come within the prohibition of the act ? The railroad is at the nearest point more than one hundred feet from the dwelling, and in the opinion of the master does not materially interfere with the access thereto. The route of the carriage-way is unchanged, and when the grade is altered as proposed, the approach to the dwelling will practically be as good as heretofore. The distance to the spring-house, passing down the carriage-way, and under the railroad bridge, has not been materially increased, nor the way thereto made more difficult, nor has the use of the spring-house been otherwise interfered with. The foot of the embankment slope is within five feet of the barn wall. The track of the railroad is at the nearest point fifty feet distant from the barn. Further than this the use of the latter is not interfered with. The risk of fire from passing engines, or the possibility of horses being frightened thereby, is not, we think, such an interference with use as is prohibited by the act. The latter, in the master’s opinion, must be such an interference as amounts to almost absolute destruction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[240,2372,1133,40]],["BL_316.1",316,[218,358,1189,1477]]]'>The obstruction of the cattle lane will necessitate, either the <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>expenditure of more labor in raising water in tbe barnyard for the use of the stock, or the employment possibly of additional help to bring the. stock by the carriage-way to the trough at the spring. The use of the latter has been made inconvenient, but it is inconvenience only, and not deprivation. The vegetable garden and ground occupied by fruit trees are, as to the dwelling, separate and distinct inclosures. They are, therefore, not a part of the curtilage which Bouvier defines as “the inclosed space immediately surrounding a dwelling-house, contained within the same inclosure,” and hence, even in view of the contention of the plaintiff, are no more exempt-from occupation by a railroad than any other portion of the plaintiff’s grounds more remote from the dwelling. For the property in question, the plaintiff, by reason of the quiet and comfort afforded, as also the fact that children and grandchildren have there grown up, and are growing up about him, has very naturally formed a strong attachment, and money would therefore afford but very inadequate compensation for the very great injury sustained by the construction of the railroad as aforesaid. But, unfortunately, this is the only medium of compensation known to law. Even the violation of the most tender and sacred relations is measured by the same standard. To prevent the construction of a railroad as located upon the ground of the plaintiff, would be to exclude such public improvements practically from all populous districts. We do not think the prohibition of the act is so far-reaching as contended for by the plaintiff. For all expenses, inconvenience, and damage sustained by him he is entitled of course to compensation under the act.</p>

As a general rule of course it cannot be, and is not done. When the words employed have a meaning, in legal contemplation, which is broader than the ordinary meaning, there is at least some justification for adopting the larger meaning where it is necessary in order to subserve the plain ends of justice. Acting upon this principle we did, in the case of Swift and Given’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/111/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="111 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="545431" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0516-01">111 Pa. 516</a>, hold, that the prohibitive words of the act of 1849, which forbade railroad companies from “ passing through .... any dwelling-house in the occupancy <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>of the owner or owners thereof without his, her, or their consent,” embraced some of the curtilage connected therewith. We did not decide how much of the curtilage was exempted, but said that question must be determined as each casé arises “ by a consideration of what is necessary for a reasonable and proper enjoyment of a house as a residence, in view of its location and surroundings.” This language is perhaps open to the criticism of being somewhat indefinite, and may need a more accurate expression when the facts of some case coming before us may require it. But we certainly did mean to limit the curtilage to be exempted to that portion of it which was necessary to the enjoyment of the house, not to that which was desirable or convenient, or which depended alone upon the will of the owner.</p>
    <p id="b320-5" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[232,1079,1183,1331]],["BL_321.1",321,[163,351,1183,566]]]'>Such a construction would have abrogated the act and practically put an end to the further building of railroads in this commonwealth. The case of Swift and Given’s Appeal did not require a designation of the precise amount of curtilage to be exempted, because the part taken was about 150 feet distant from the dwelling-house, and, although within the same inclosure, was not essential to its enjoyment. But in the present case the ground taken is not within the same inclosure as the dwelling-house, and the master distinctly finds that it is not a part of the curtilage. He also finds that the route of the carriage-way to the dwelling is unchanged, that the railroad at the nearest point is more than one hundred feet from the dwelling and does not materially interfere with access thereto, nor with access to and use of the spring-house. Moreover, no outbuilding was taken, and the barn is fifty feet distant from the track of the road, and the road is not between the house and barn. The taking of out-buildings has never, in this commonwealth at least, been held a violation of the prohibitive words of the act of 1849, and we do not mean to intimate that it would or should be so held. But the fact that none are taken and communication between them and the dwelling is not interfered with in the present case, increases the difficulties of the apellant in his contention. We are aware of no principle upon which it would be possible for us to adopt the views pressed upon us on behalf of the appellant, without practically disregarding the plain provisions of the act of 1849, and inaugural <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>ing a policy -which would lead to endless litigation, to the utmost uncertainty in the law, and to such an embarrassing prohibition upon the exercise of the commonwealth’s right of eminent domain by our public improvement companies, as to greatly hinder if not quite suspend their further operations. We are entirely satisfied with the findings of the master and the action of the court in approving of them, and therefore have no basis upon which we could justify a reversal of either. An ample remedy in damages is furnished for every matter of inconvenience and injury which the appellant has sustained, and to that remedy it is his duty as a good citizen to resort.</p>
