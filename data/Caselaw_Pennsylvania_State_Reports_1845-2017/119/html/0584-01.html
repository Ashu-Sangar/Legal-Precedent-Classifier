Malice, gentlemen, is said to be malus animus, that is, a bad mind. It may not be a bad-mind directed against a particular individual; if it were, and if the object were revenge, injury and wrong to a particular individual it would be special malice; but a man may have the malus animus, the bad mind existing, and exercising it in a general way, and then it is sometimes referred to as general malice.]1 As, for instance, if a man should fire promiscuously into a crowd, not knowing a solitary individual, he has the bad mind, he has malice, and wantonly inflicts injury without even knowledge of the particular persons against whom the malice is exhibited.</p>

It should be the high ambition of those who are strong and powerful not to encroach upon the weak, but to do that which the law does, throw around the weak their protecting care. Therefore the law does not encourage any wanton assault of any one, great or small, strong or weak; least of all, will it encourage an assault by the strong upon those who are weak.</p>

The law protects cranks and punishes them, too; for if a man who is a crank commits a crime, the law visits him with the effect of his crime, even to public execution and death, unless his mind is so perverted that it was impossible for him to know what the crime was that he had committed. And so the law jealously and carefully throws around him its protecting arms, so that neither private persons, associations, individual writers, or writers for the press, have any more right to assault a man who has Ms peculiarities and is brought within what is referred to as “a crank,” than it has to assault the highest and best citizen.] 3 These are general remarks.

In § 399, he says: “ The language itself, whether oral or written, may be evidence of malice, and when the occasion renders the publication prima facie privileged the jury may take the language into consideration, to determine the intent with which the publication was made. Any expression in excess of what the occasion warrants may be evidence of malice.” And again, in § 244 b.: “ Expressions in excess of what the occasion warrants do not per se take away the privilege, but such excess may be evidence of malice.” Our own decisions, see Pittock v. O’Niell, <a href="/pa/63/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1019063" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0253-01">63 Pa. 253</a>, are in entire accord with this view of the subject. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in Miller v. Butler, <a href="/mass/60/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Cush. 71" data-case-ids="1989519" data-case-paths="/mass/60/0071-01">6 Cush. 71</a>, held “ that in judging of the malicious character of an alleged libel the jury may take into consideration the whole publication; and if it contains statements concerning other persons which are malicious, the jury may infer therefrom that what is said of the plaintiff is also malicious.” These familiar principles have been reiterated in the case of Neeb v. Hope, <a href="/pa/111/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="111 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="545487" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0145-01">111 Pa. 145</a>, recently decided by our Supreme Court and just reported. Says Mr. Justice Tkttnkey : “ It is a matter of law for the court to determine whether the occasion of writing or speaking criminatory language, which would otherwise be actionable, repels the inference of malice, constituting what is called a privileged communication; and if there is no intrinsic or extrinsic evidence of malice, it is the duty of the court to direct a nonsuit or verdict for defendant. If the communication contains expressions which exceed the limits of privilege, such expressions are .evidence of malice, and the case shall be given to the jury.”</p>

In a case of that sort the truth of the accusation is best determined by reading the article. As in the case of an alleged caricature, the exhibition of the picture best determines the intent, and it is for the jury to say, after inspection, whether it is want of skill simply or design that makes it ridiculous. And there is no better test. The question is how the publication would strike the ordinary observer. So in this case, the publication was not of a serious character, and the judge, expressing no opinion on it, left it for the jury to say what inference should properly be' drawn from it; whether it was intended to expose the citizen to ridicule, or to criticise fairly his school.</p>

They are sometimes presented to procure accuracy of ruling; more often, perhaps, to procure inaccuracy, for subsequent use on a motion for a new trial. These points are drawn with great adroitness before the trial, and a lawyer has very hard luck if, out of fifteen or twenty of them, he cannot get some expression in one, which subsequent investigation may enable him to make use of. In considering them they must in fairness be considered together and as a part of the charge, and if in that connection they are believed not to have misled the jury, but to have substantially given proper instructions, the verdict is maintained.</p>

Perhaps if the judge had been discuss<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>ing the law of libel with a lawyer, he might have so said, as the distinction undoubtedly can be taken. It must, however, be remembered, that while these points are drawn by lawyers, the answer is not addressed to them, but to the jury, and the question is whether they would ever think of such a distinction. If a person should say that he inferred from the publications of Mr. Thackeray that he designed to hold up to ridicule many classes of persons, it would surely never enter the mind of any one to suppose that he inferred it from the fact of his having published books, without reference to their contents.</p>

A publication may very accurately state the words and language used by the plaintiff, and yet by punctuation, marks of exclamation, marks of admiration or quotation marks, throw them into ridicule. A ridiculous heading, interjection of slang words or phrases and ideas suggested as passing through the mind of the reporter, would have the same effect. And it is complained in this case that wherever the plaintiff is spoken of as the proprietor of “ a school,” it is always between inverted commas, intended to convey the idea that the designation is misapplied and <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>absurd.

It was therefore error not to explain to the jury that the burden of proving express malice was upon the plaintiff; the nature and character of the evidence necessary to prove <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>express malice; the relation and position of the parties; that the action would not lie if the statements were made honestly and in a belief of their truth and that the burden was on the plaintiff to prove that they were not so made; that if there were probable cause for the publication, the action could not be sustained and that if there were not probable cause the plaintiff could not recover in the absence of proof of actual malice. If the jury were misled as to the law, or if the tendency of the charge was to mislead them, it was error and a ground for reversal: Rice v.

The only defences could be, (1) Justification on the ground that he was ridiculous; (2) Justification on the ground of privilege. Both should be specially pleaded. But the only defence made was that the interview had taken place.

The plaintiff had leased rooms in the vicinity of Thirteenth and Market streets, and fitted them up as a school for clerks, salesmen, and reporters, and he professed to be a teacher of short-hand writing, type-writing, and phono-scribing. The outside of his rooms appears to have been alluringly placarded with signs, and various devices in the way of circulars were scattered broadcast in the community calling attention to the merits of his system, and urging the young to engage with him as pupils. It must be conceded that some of these circulars were of a very extravagant nature. It so happened that the attention of the city editor of <em>The Press </em>was attracted by the peculiarity of the plaintiff’s signs, and he detailed a reporter upon the <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>staff, of that paper to visit the establishment and ascertain its character. He did so, and <em>The Press </em>next day contained the report of the interview. It is this report which forms the subject of the alleged libel. The article is of considerable length, and as it will doubtless appear in the report of the case, is omitted here. The plaintiff claims it was a libel because it exposed him to ridicule, and was calculated to injure him in his business as a teacher. It is proper to say that he had sold his establishment to other parties prior to the publication complained of, reserving, however, a certain royalty, or payment per head, for each student under the new management. The parties to whom he sold do not appear to have been impressed with the thought that their business had been or would be injured by the article in question; at least they are not complaining, and may have regarded it as a “puff” of their school.</p>
    <p id="Aa4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[257,1124,1179,396]]]'>- The defendant filed what was substantially, though not perhaps in strict technical form, a plea of justification. It alleged that the article in <em>The Press </em>was a just and true account of the interview between its reporter and the plaintiff, and asked the court to instruct the jury that “ if they believe that the publication complained of is a fair and true account of an interview had between the plaintiff and Mr. Cooke, your verdict must be for the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.6",626,[257,1538,1176,300]]]'>The court declined to affirm tins point, and herein we think the learned judge erred. While the truth would not have been a defence to an indictment, the rule is otherwise in a civil suit for damages. This is horn-book law. For this error at least the judgment must be reversed. But there is a more serious difficulty underlying the plaintiff’s case.</p>
    <p id="b626-6" data-blocks='[["BL_626.7",626,[256,1845,1177,354]]]'>A considerable number of the assignments of error raised the question in various ways whether the article was a privileged communication, and the court was asked to say that in the absence of proof of actual malice there could be no recovery. The court declined to say this, but on the contrary charged that the jury might infer malice from the article in question. _ ,</p>

I do not propose to go over the same ground again. It is sufficient to refer to the conclusions arrived at in that <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>case. It was there said that “ a communication to be privileged must be made upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, and must be based upon reasonable or probable cause. When so made, in good faith, the law does not imply malice from the communication itself as in the ordinary case of libel; actual malice must be proved before there can be a recovery. And whether a communication be privileged or not is a question for the court, not the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[156,767,1180,353]]]'>Tested by this rule we are of opinion that the article in question is privileged, not absolutely, but in a qualified sense; in that sense, however, which makes it the duty of the court to instruct the jury that it is privileged, and that because of such privilege no presumption of malice arises from the mere fact of publication, but malice must be proved as a fact in the cause before the plaintiff can recover.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.6",627,[156,1129,1181,714]]]'>If we are asked why this article is so privileged, I answer, because it was proper for public information. This plaintiff was holding himself out to the world as a teacher and guide of youth; he was seeking to attract them to his place by signs, placards, and advertisements, some of them at least of an extraordinary nature. This gave him a quasi public character. Whether he was a proper person to instruct the young, and whether his school was a proper place for them to receive instruction, were matters of importance to the public, and <em>The. Press </em>was in the strict line of its duty when it sought such information and gave it to the public. And if that information tended to show that the plaintiff was a charlatan and his system an imposture, the more need that the public, and especially parents and guardians, should be informed of it.</p>
    <p id="b627-7" data-blocks='[["BL_627.7",627,[157,1851,1179,303]]]'>Aside from this we do not regard the article as a libel. At most it is a harmless bit of pleasantry in which the reporter has succeeded in making himself somewhat ridiculous. The matter has been very much magnified and an importance attached to it which it does not deserve. An actionable libel cannot be created out of nothing.</p>
    <p id="b627-8" data-blocks='[["BL_627.8",627,[158,2161,1180,146]]]'>As the publication was privileged, and there was no proof of malice, the court below should have given the jury a binding instruction to find for the defendant.</p>
