Confining ourselves to what occurred at the time, we have the testimony of the plaintiff and his daughter that the judgment was given in settlement of an amount then due the plaintiff from the defendant as the result of their mutual dealings. The plaintiff says : “When Hager signed the note on January 24, 1885, there was no dispute between us about receipts, except about this buckwheat flour, which I allowed him credit for in order to have a settlement. There was no other conditions upon which the note was signed.” The plaintiff is corroborated by his daughter, who was present and drew up the note in the presence of the parties. The defendant testified: “ I went up <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>to Jersey Shore; Mr. English was there in the store sitting by the stove.

Then I signed the note. When I found the receipts I was to come up and then we was to settle the note.” There was a great deal of other testimony by defendant and his witnesses as to other matters both before and after the execution of the note. The greater part of it was irrelevant, and referred to transactions about which there was no dispute or which had been embraced in the settlement. Taken together, it was not sufficient to overcome the prima facie evidence furnished by the note itself, supported as it was by the testimony of the plaintiff and his daughter. There was nothing in the case to justify a chancellor in finding that there was either fraud, accident, or mistake in procuring the judgment note, and hence there was nothing by which it could be reformed or set aside.</p>

It is true, under our practice in Pennsylvania, it is accomplished through common law forms. But the fact remains that the defence set up is purely equitable, and the judge ought not to submit the case to the jury unless the evidence is such that he would feel himself bound as a chancellor to reform the instrument. With our modification of the English rule, now too firmly embedded in our system to be disturbed, and our act of assembly which makes every defendant a competent witness, the principle above stated is about all there is left to preserve the sanctity and force of an instrument of writing, whether that instrument be a deed, which is the evidence of a man’s title to his home, or an obligation for the payment of money.” There was nothing new in this. It was but a repetition of what had been frequently said before and repeatedly since. The same principle will be found declared in Nicholls v.

Where it has been procured by fraud, or there has been an accident or mistake in its creation, a chancellor will always relieve. Yet he will only do so when the evidence of the fraud, accident, or mistake is clear, precise, and indubitable. We have said this so often that it ought not to be necessary to repeat it.</p>
