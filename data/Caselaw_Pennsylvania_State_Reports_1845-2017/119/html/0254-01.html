Commonwealth, 15 S. &amp; R. 93, the indictment was for larceny.

The jury found that the defendant, by various false and fraudulent pretences set forth in the finding, did procure from the prosecutors sundry dry goods and money; that he acted with <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>the premeditated design and intent wilfully to defraud and cheat them of their property and without any intention of ever returning the same to the rightful owners.

J., after reviewing certain English cases, points out the distinction in the cases where the property, alleged to have been stolen, was obtained by trick or artifice, between the intent of the owner to part with the property and the intent only to part with the possession for a particular purpose. He declared the law to be that where the owner delivered the possession absolutely, where the intent was that the possession should never return to lfim, it was a case of cheating and not of felony; but that where the owner intended to part with the property the case was different, then there might be a conviction of larceny. The chief justice said that thus there was a line distinctly marked and that he would stop there. Applying said principle to the case, the court concluded that, while Lewer had deceived the prosecutors most shamefully, he was not guilty of larceny, because the prosecutors intended to pass the property when they delivered the possession. There has been no decision of the Supreme Court since, changing or qualifying the rule thus laid down.</p>

The casMer believed that he had received a new note for $1,600, and for that reason was willing to give up, and actually did give up absolutely, the old note.

I can see nothing in Kane v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/89/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="89 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="1063195" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0522-01">89 Pa. 522</a>, as explained in Nicholson v.

The jury found a special verdict, from which we learn that the Coopersburg Savings Bank held his promissory note, indorsed by John Eichelberger, for the sum of sixteen hundred dollars; that on July 21,1886, he called at said bank to renew the note; that he paid the discount thereon for another period of ninety days, viz.: 125.07; that he obtained his said note of sixteen hundred dollars by giving the cashier a new note for sixteen dollars with the same indorser; that when the cashier received the note for sixteen dollars, he believed he was getting a note for sixteen hundred dollars, and would not otherwise have surrendered the old note; that “ the defendant made and presented the note for sixteen dollars with the deliberate design and intention to defraud said bank by obtaining from it said note for sixteen hundred dollars by giving in its place one for sixteen dollars only, and with the design and intention that the officers of the bank should overlook the fact that the note offered was for sixteen dollars only, and that by reason of such oversight and mistake should give up the note for sixteen hundred dollars. ” The special verdict further sets forth that “ if the facts stated and the acts of the defendant above set forth are sufficient in the opinion of the court to warrant a conviction of the defendant of the crime of larceny, then the jury do say, that he, the defendant, is guilty of larceny in manner and form as he stands indicted. If not sufficient, then the jury find the- defendant not guilty.” The learned court below entered a judgment for the defendant upon the facts as found by the jury.</p>

It is rarely done, because a case seldom arises in which such a course is useful or necessary.

They were altogether peculiar, if not without precedent, and the case itself lies upon the border. The right of the court to take a special verdict in. criminal cases was decided in Commonwealth v.

It was in the application of that case to the facts of the present one that we think the learned and able judge inadvertently fell into error. Lewer v. Commonwealth was well decided and we adhere to every word there said. That was a case, however, of a sale and delivery of certain merchandise to one M. D. Lewer, who falsely represented himself as the agent of his brother. It was not pretended that the owners of the merchandise did not intend to part with both the title to and the property therein; they were simply overreached by means of the above and other false statements, and sold and delivered their goods to a knave. It was a case of cheating by false pretences, nothing more; the purchaser obtained a credit by means of false representations.</p>

In some of the old English cases, the difference is more artificial than real and rests purely upon technical grounds. Much of this nicety is doubtless owing to the fact that at the time many of the cases were decided, larceny was a capital felony in England, and the judges naturally leaned to a merciful interpretation of the law out of a tender regard for human life......The distinction between larceny and cheating by false pretences is well stated in Russel on Crimes, 5th Amer. ed., 28. After an <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>exhaustive review of the eases the learned author says : ‘ The correct distinction in cases-of this kind seems to be, that if by means of any trick or artifice, the owner of property is induced to part with the possession only, still meaning to retain the right of property, the taking by such means will amount to larceny; but if the owner part with, not only the possession, of the goods but the right of property in them also, the offence of the party obtaining them will not be larceny, but the offence of obtaining goods by false pretences.’ ”</p>

It was a promissory note, as before stated, of the value of sixteen hundred dollars. What gave it that value ? Certainly not the paper upon which it was written, for that was of so inconsiderable value as not to be the subject of larceny. It was clear that it was valuable only in so far as it was a representative of money; as the evidence of a debt which the bank held against the defendant. The bank did not intend to part with its property in this note considered as an evidence of debt. The note was not the debt; it was the mere evidence of it. That it did not intend to part with any right of property, is manifest from the fact that the cashier thought he was receiving in exchange for the note parted with, a similar evidence of such debt, of equal amount and of equal value. It would be the baldest technicality, a mere sticking in the bark, <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>to hold that the bank intended to part with any right of property by a mere delivery to the defendant of a piece of paper which, qua paper, was of no value. It did not intend to deliver the evidence of its debt to the defendant, because it supposed it was getting another of equal value and would have received it, but for the trick and fraud of the defendant. In the absence of any decision of this court fully covering the facts of the case it was natural and proper for the learned judge below to give the defendant the benefit of the doubt which he evidently entertained. Were we in doubt we would do likewise, but we are all of opinion that upon the facts found by the jury the offence is larceny.</p>

    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[189,573,1182,665]]]'>On the first day of October last, there was placed to the credit of the defendant upon the books of the city treasurer, $145,000 of the loan of the city for sale. No certificates for this loan were issued to the defendant. They were made out upon the order of the defendant, from time to time, in favor of the parties to whom he sold the loan. By an arrangement witli the city treasurer, the defendant settled with the former at the end of each month for the sales for the month. It will thus be seen that while the defendant was not the owner of this loan in any sense, he yet had the control of it for an entire month. The practical effect of it was, that when he failed upon October 16th, the whole of this loan had been converted to his own use, and the city became the loser thereof.</p>

Upon that day, the defendant called at the office of the city treasurer about 2 o’clock p. m., and informed David Jones, the chief clerk, that he had purchased $33,000 of stock for the city. The witness says, it was understood to be for the sinking fund, although the defendant did not say so in terms. But as the defendant had made prior purchases for the sinking fund, was not authorized to purchase stock for the city upon any other account, there is no reason to doubt that it was entirely understood by both that the stock referred to was for the sinking fund. Whilst the defendant was there, his messenger, a boy, came into' the treasurer’s office, with a <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>bill or memorandum of the alleged purchase, whereupon the chief clerk filled up a check, which had been signed in blank by Mr. Marcer, city treasurer, for the amount, and the same was given to the boy in the presence of the defendant, who took it to the place of business of the latter. The check was drawn against the funds of the city deposited to the credit of the sinking fund, and so appeared upon its face. It was not applied by the defendant to the payment of the stock so alleged to have been purchased. In fact no such purchase had been made by the defendant, and within an hour after obtaining the said check, it was converted to his own use by depositing it in bank, and checking it out again to pay his own debts. His bank aceount’on that day showed his entire balance drawn out, save the merest trifle, and leaves little room to doubt that but for this check, the defendant would have failed on that day.

Subsequent reflection has satisfied me that upon neither of the said counts can the verdict be sustained. My learned colleagues, who were kind enough to sit with me upon the argument of the motion for a new trial, all concur in this view. It is sufficient to say, as to the second and fourth counts, that the defendant was not in the employment of the city, in the sense in which that term is used in the Criminal Code. The term employment means a continuous employment, and exclusive in its nature; not the mere acting as a broker or agent in particular transactions, although of frequent' occurrence. Speaking for myself, it may perhaps be questioned whether the 107th section of the code applies to persons in the employment of a municipal corporation. The act reads: “ If any clerk, servant, or other person in the employ of another, shall,” etc., etc. “In the employ of another,” manifestly means in the employ of another person, and would seem to refer to a natural person, rather than to a municipal corporation. This view is strengthened by the fact, that the distinction between natural persons and corporations, municipal or <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>otherwise, is carefully preserved in many sections of the Criminal Code.

    <p id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.6",293,[167,1021,1180,870]]]'>It is to be observed that the count in question rests entirely upon statute. There was no such thing known to the common law as the larceny of a check, qua check. It is true an indictment would lie for the larceny of a check as a piece of paper, of the value of a fractional part of a penny, but as a valuable piece of property, representing the dollars which it named, a check was not the subject of larceny. To remedy this evil, our Criminal Code, § 104, has expressly made it larceny to steal checks, and other securities. A similar statute exists in England, from which the section above referred to is in the main copied. So that at the present time a check is as much property, and the subject of larceny, as a horse or a bale of muslin; and it is to be treated, not as a mere piece of paper, but as the representative of the money which it calls for, and of a corresponding value. This case is to be considered precisely as if the defendant, instead of obtaining a check, had obtained the money from the city treasury.</p>

It is difficult to see the soundness of this view. The value of a check consists in its being the representative of money, in being an order or paper, by the presentation of which at the proper place a certain sum of money can be obtained. The moment the maker has filled it up and signed it so as to enable the holder to draw the money its value attaches, and it becomes property, to steal which, is larceny. This point has been expressly ruled in England. In <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>Rex v. Metcalf, 1 Moody, E. C. C., 433, the prisoner was indicted for stealing a check. The check was drawn to bearer, and given by the drawer to the prisoner for a specific purpose, to wit: to deliver to the Messrs. Caldecott. Instead of doing so, the prisoner applied it to his own use. He was found guilty of the larceny of the check. Upon the trial the question was reserved, “ whether the check in the hands of the drawers was of any value, and could be the subject of larceny,?” The case was considered and the judgment affirmed, eight of the nine eminent judges who heard the case concurring; only one of them, Littledale, expressing a doubt. We are of opinion that the moment this check was so far completed as to enable any one obtaining it to draw the money, it was the subject of larceny in the hands of the city treasurer. We do not regard the fact that the check, after its payment by the bank, was returned to the city treasurer, affects this view of the case. It came back, it is true, so far as the piece of paper was concerned, but its value, that for which the law makes it the subject of larceny, was gone. Here again we must keep in mind the distinction between the check as a thing of value— as the equivalent of $33,000, and a worthless piece of paper. Every check stolen from the drawer must come back to him in case of its conversion by the thief, and we have seen in Rex v. Metcalf that a check is the subject of larceny in the hands of the drawer. It is immaterial what became of the check after it reached the possession of defendant, if it were obtained feloniously, as in the latter ease; the offence was complete the moment it was so obtained.</p>

In some of the old English cases the difference is more artificial than real, and rests purely upon technical grounds. Much of this nicety is doubtless owing to the fact that at the time the cases were decided larceny was a capital felony in England, and the judges naturally leaned to a merciful interpretation of the law, out of a tender regard for human life. But whatever may have been the cause, the law <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>has come down to us with such distinctions, and we propose to administer it as we find it.

After an exhaustive review of the cases, the learned author says : “ The correct distinction in eases of this kind seems to be, that if by means of any trick or artifice the owner of property is induced to part with the possession only, still meaning to retain the right of property, the taking by such means will amount to larceny; but if the owner part with, not only the possession of the goods but the right of property in them also, the offence of the party obtaining them will not be larceny, but the offence of obtaining goods by false pretences.”</p>

By that principle this case must stand or fall, so far as this branch of it is concerned. The difficulty, if any, is not in the law; that is uniform, and easily understood. But it is in applying the facts of each particular case to the law, and thus to ascertain what offence, if any, has been committed. It will be our endeavor to subject this case to this test.</p>

As if a man enter a store, and by reason of a false statement induce the owner to sell him a bill of goods upon credit; here the vendor of the goods parts with the property in said goods absolutely, and the relation of debtor-and creditor is created. The merchant may have been overreached, but it is not larceny — at most a false pretence. Did the city intend in the case now under consideration to part with its property in the check, regarding said check as we are bound to do, as the representative and equivalent of $38,000 ? Certainly not, as in favor of the defendant. The city did not owe him a dollar. The latter was the broker or agent of the city, for two purposes, viz.: to sell city loan, and to purchase, when required, loan for the sinking fund. There was no other relation existing between the city and the defend<a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>ant. Webster defines a broker to be “ an agent or negotiator, who is employed by merchants to make and conclude bargains for them, for a fee or rate per cent., or who transacts other business for his employers. Stock brokers are such as are employed to sell shares in the stocks, whether of the public fund, of banks, or of other corporations.” A higher authority, Judge Stoby, in his work on Agency, says : “ The true definition of a-broker seems to be, that he is an agent, employed to make bargains and contracts between othe^ persons, in matters of trade, commerce or navigation for a compensation, commonly called brokerage. Properly speaking, a broker is a mere negotiator between the other parties, and he never acts in his own name, but in the names of those who employ him ”: Story on Agency, § 30. There are various sorts of brokers now employed in commercial affairs, whose transactions form, or may form, a distinct and independent business. Thus, for example, there are exchange and money brokers, stock brokers, ship brokers and insurance brokers, who are respectively employed in buying and selling bills of exchange, or promissory notes, or goods or stocks, or ships and cargoes, or in procuring insurance and settling losses, or in procuring freight or charter parties: Story on Agency, § 32.</p>

If A. employ a broker, B., to purchase for his account $1,000 of city loan, or other stocks, B. thereupon becomes the agent of A. No other relation exists between them. If, in pursuance of such employment, B. purchases the stock from C., the legal effect of the transaction is, that C. is bound to deliver the stock to A., and the latter becomes the debtor of C. to the amount. And if A. deliver to B. the money to pay C. for the stock, and B., instead of doing so, converts it to his own use, he is a thief, both in law and morals. Nor does it make any difference whether B. discloses his principal to C. or not. The only effect of such nondisclosure would be, that C. would have no remedy against A. for the price of the stock. He would be compelled to look to the broker only. But in the case just put, the broker still remains the agent of A. I am aware that a rule exists at the board of brokers of holding each broker purchasing stock per<a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>sonally responsible for the amount of his purchase, whether he disclose the name of his principal or not. With this the person who employs a broker has nothing to do. It is not in the power of the latter, nor of any boardnof brokers, to alter the law, or to change a relation that is fiduciary in its character into the ordinary relation of debtor and creditor. It is objected that the application of such a rule as this would seriously embarrass the stock operations of brokers. With that we have nothing to do. We do not make, the law. We merely declare and enforce it. But it is difficult to see how a rule which rests upon the solid foundation of common honesty can be productive of any serious results. It may, perhaps, interfere with financial kite-flying and wild speculations with the money of other people, but not with any legitimate operations. It is not too much to hold, that when a broker receives the money of another to invest in a certain security, that he shall so invest it, or be responsible to the criminal law. It would be monstrous that the broker should lose it in speculation, and then turn round to his victim and say, it is true, I have converted your money to my own use ; I can neither repay you nor give you the stock; it is a mere matter of contract — I am your debtor, and you are my creditor for the amount.</p>

He alleged that he had purchased from some one — no matter who — stock to the amount of $33,000. Supposing his statement to be true, the check was given to him. Given to him for what? To pay his own debts within an hour? Certainly not. It was given him to pay for the stock. The city never intended to part with the ownership in'the check. It went out in the shape of money, for the money and the check are precisely the same thing for the purposes of this case. It was to come back in the shape of stock for the sinking fund. The city was neither to gain nor lose by the transaction. The $33,000 was still to remain the property of the city, in an altered shape it is true, but of equal value.</p>

The latter did not snatch it up and run away with it. But it is alleged by the commonwealth, and the jury have so found, that the defendant resorted to an artifice, a fraud by means of which Mr. Jones was deceived, and induced to part with the possession of the check. The rule of law is well settled, that if the possession of property is obtained by an artifice, accompanied with the felonious intent on the part of the person obtaining it to convert it to his own use, and if he does so convert it, the offence is larceny. This principle is thus recognized in Wharton, 6th ed., § 1847 : “ Larceny may be committed of goods obtained from the owner by delivery if it be done animo furandi. When the offender unlawfully acquired possession with an intent to steal them, the owner still retaining the property in them, such person will be guilty of larceny in embezzling them.” In illustration of this doctrine, the learned author cites in the section referred to, the familiar case of hiring a horse on pretence of making a journey, and immediately selling it.
