    <p class="summary" id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[287,558,1179,549]]]'>This brings you to the consideration of another point which has been raised in this case. The character of fence referred to by the act of assembly is the boundary fence between owners ; that is, where two parties own improved lands adjacent to each other, and the boundary fence between them is a common fence. If this fence in controversy had been put where the old fence was, this question would not have arisen. There would then have been simply the two questions, whether the fence as repaired by Mr. Pierce was sufficient; and, if not, the right of the plaintiff to put it in proper condition with reasonable cost.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[284,1125,1180,662]]]'>It appears, however, that the new fence was not erected by the plaintiff where the old fence stood. The testimony upon this point, which seems to be undisputed, is that at the alley where the fence terminated, the fence was some distance from the old fence. The witnesses do not agree precisely as to the distance, but it seems probable that it was from six inches, half way along the boundary between High street and the alley, to eighteen inches at the alley, further north than where the old fence was. The witnesses speak of the old post holes being on the south side of where the new fence was, and that they were visible there after the new fence was erected, thus showing that the new fence had been erected by the plaintiff, on that part of the lot at least, north of where the old fence was.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[284,1796,1176,302]]]'>If the new fence was erected upon the boundary line between the parties, even although it was not on the site of the old fence, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. She had a right to erect the fence upon what was the actual or legal line between herself and the defendant. The question is whether she erected it upon the boundary line.</p>

There is testimony that a surveyor, engaged presumably by the plaintiff in this case, examined the ground and made a mark to which the fence was built; but he was not called as a witness, and there is no evidence as to whether the mark made by him was the line between the parties.]14</p>

It is in testimony thqt the old fence and its predecessors had remained on that site for a very long series of years. In the absence of anything to the contrary, the law presumes that a fence of long standing between parties marks the line between their properties, and is to be taken as the line whether called for in their deeds or not. If the parties have lived up to and recognized a fence upon the ground as the boundary fence between their respective properties, in the absence of anything showing the contrary, that fence must be taken as the boundary fence between the parties.</p>

[I see no evidence in this case to warrant the jury in coming to the conclusion that the boundary between these parties was other than that which was marked by the fence that stood there for a long period of time],16 certainly, according to the testimony, exceeding twenty-one years.</p>

But is that fact sufficient to hold Mr. Pierce to such a new line, or to a line different from that which was upon the ground as the line between the parties? If a surveyor is called, and it is agreed that the line, he surveys shall be the line between the parties, then they are bound by his survey. [Is it the fact in this case, that a surveyor came there, at the instance of Miss Trego, and that Mr. Pierce happened to be there a part of the time, without making any measurements, examining deeds, or lines, and without having the time necessary to consent to a line different from that which would seem to be indicated by the marks upon the ground, and thus become bound by the establishment of the line. That is the question for your determination, but I submit that the facts in the case hardly warrant the conclusion that Mr. Pierce deliberately agreed that the place where this fence was subsequently erected by Miss Trego should be considered as the boundary line between the parties.]15.....</p>

    <p id="b171-8" data-blocks='[["BL_171.10",171,[151,1129,1183,755]]]'>The plaintiff, being of opinion that the line fence between her property and that of the defendant was insufficient, applied to the fence viewers to examine the same and report upon its sufficiency and the cost of rebuilding it. The fence viewers found that 100 feet of this fence had been erected by the plaintiff of new material; that the remaining 100 feet of fence was insufficient as a yard inclosure, and that it was the duty of the defendant to erect in its stead “ a suitable fence, upon which they estimate the cost at $35.” Whereupon the defendant proceeded to erect what he claimed to be a sufficient fence, and a compliance with the report of the viewers. It did not satisfy the plaintiff, however, and she proceeded to remove it and erect a new fence in lieu thereof, of a more expensive character. She then brought this suit to recover the cost of it.</p>
    <p id="b171-9" data-blocks='[["BL_171.11",171,[149,1903,1183,510]],["BL_172.1",172,[253,348,1180,766]]]'>It was alleged and the fact appears to be, that in erecting the fence the plaintiff moved it about six inches at one end and sixteen at the other end, from the line where it had stood for many years. The defendant contends that this was an encroachment upon his land, and much of the time upon the trial in the court below was occupied by this contention. This portion of the time would appear to have been wasted under the ruling in the case of Stevens v. Shriver, <a href="/pa/25/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="25 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="975843" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0078-01">25 Pa. 78</a>, where it was said by Lowbie, J.: “ It is not at all necessary that partition fences should go to ruin because of the owners being in <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>litigation about their lines: indeed, this could only add to their difficulties. If there be in fact a partition fence, the duty of contribution to maintain it exists, and neither party can excuse himself from this duty by alleging, whether sincerely or falsely, that the line is in dispute; and the law relating to fences. contemplates no such mode of suspending the remedy which it provides .....If the line needs correction, let it be made: and then it is easy to set the fence right.” In that case the plaintiff below built the fence, but removed it from the foundation on which it had stood many years, westward, about a rod more or less, into the field of Stephens, the defendant below, and took from Stephens’ field a rod of land in breadth and sixty rods in length, and a row of cherry trees. The parties differed as to the lines and corners. The claim was for the cost of one half the fence, and was sustained by the court below and here.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[255,1122,1178,508]]]'>We think it was error, therefore, to charge the jury that the plaintiff could not recover in case they found that she had moved the location of the fence, and the evidence upon this point should have been excluded. Boundary lines cannot be established in this form of proceeding. The object of the act of assembly in regard to fence views is to provide a summary remedy to keep partition fences from going into dilapidation. Disputed questions as to lines can be settled afterwards. This was manifestly a line fence in fact; whether it was erected upon precisely the true line, is a question foreign to this proceeding.</p>

Some substantial injury must have been the actual or probable result of such error to justify us in disturbing the judgment.</p>

Such is not the case. The defendant complied, as he alleges, substantially, with the report of viewers, and it is clear that the fence erected by him was sufficient, though not perhaps as ornamental or durable as the plaintiff desired. Of her own motion, and upon her own view, she took it down and erected a new one in its place. She made herself the judge of its sufficiency and demolished it. This perhaps she might do if she- preferred to build a better and more attractive looking <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>fence at her own expense, but she cannot thus arbitrarily throw the cost of it upon the defendant.</p>
