The only corroboration of either of the two statements is by Richard Jackson, who testifies that the contract was for one thousand dollars’ worth of lots, and that this was afterwards changed by him, and the testimony of T. F. Emmens, and of Hiram Westbrook, who testifies substantially that the contract was as testified to by T. F. Emmens. John S. Jackson, when asked in his cross-examination if it was not ‘agreed between himself and Hiram Westbrook that Westbrook should receive one half of the lots to be paid to him as part of the consideration price for the sale of the Welser farm, says yes ; that he had agreed to receive as his, Westbrook’s share, one half of these lots.

    <p id="b388-7" data-blocks='[["BL_388.8",388,[263,1444,1182,608]]]'>There is no merit in the argument that an action of account would have been the proper form of action and that plaintiff could not recover in assumpsit because “ the money sued for was the profits of a partnership.” The transaction out of which the liability arose was the purchase of a single item of property, and the question to be answered was, how much, if anything, has been gained, by the purchase and re-sale; Brubaker v.

There was nothing in the case but a question of fact. It was for the jury to say who they would believe; they chose to believe the plaintiff.</p>

We may remark, however, that the exceptions to the court’s ruling on the pro<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>posed evidence cannot be sustained, for if the defendant informed the plaintiff that his brother was to act during his absence, in his place, and for him, in the transaction then in hand, it is very clear that he could not limit that power, or agency, by any declarations which his brother made to him, or he to his brother, in the absence of the plaintiff. Of this proposed evidence the court admitted quite as much as the defendant had a right to expect.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[139,762,1184,616]]]'>Nor can we see why exception was taken to the judge’s charge. There can be no doubt that if Richard Jackson was to act for his brother, John S., during his absence, then the latter was bound by the acts of the former; and, if so, clearly, by the arrangement as consummated, the plaintiff became entitled to his thousand dollars. Moreover, the matter in controversy depended upon the question whether the defendant by himself or his agent assumed to pay the plaintiff the said sum, and as to this, he, Emmens, testifies that the defendant repeatedly promised to pay him as soon as the transaction was finally closed. So that the plaintiff was wanting in no legal principle for the support of his writ.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[793,1384,484,46]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
