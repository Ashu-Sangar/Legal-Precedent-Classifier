They also gave evidence to show that it might have occurred from dynamite, which might have been placed there by a person mentioned by one of the witnesses, and that they had no knowledge of these facts, and could not have had. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendants gave any testimony which established the cause of the explosion. There was no testimony from which the jury could infer that it arose from any defect in the boat or its management, or from any cause over which the defendant could have had control.

In Laing v. Colder, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Pa.%20481" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Pa. 481">8 Pa. 481</a>, the passenger’s arm was broken by reason of the closeness of the car to the walls of a bridge. That is, the construction of the road made it dangerous. It was held to be the duty of the company to give timely warning. In Sullivan v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/30/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="415545" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0234-01">30 Pa. 234</a>, the car came in collision with a cow, and was overthrown. It was held that the company should guard against such accidents. In P. &amp; C. R. Co. v. Pillow, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20Pa.%20513" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="76 Pa. 513">76 Pa. 513</a>, the passenger was injured by fighting passengers. It was held that the ears should be kept free from disorderly persons. In Del., L. etc. R. Co. v. Napheys, <a href="/citations/?q=90%20Pa.%20141" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="90 Pa. 141">90 Pa. 141</a>, Mrs. Napheys was injured in stepping from the car. Sterrett, J., said: “ The general rule is that a party who alleges negligence as the basis of a claim for damages is bound to prove the fact alleged. If a passenger is injured in a collision, or by the overthrow of the ear, or by the breaking of any part of the machinery, he-is not required to do more than prove the fact and his injury: a prima facie case is made out.” In P. &amp; R. R. Co. v. Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20Pa.%20357" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="94 Pa. 357">94 Pa. 357</a>, the accident occurred from the washing away of the embankment of the road arising from insufficient drainage. Gordon, J., considered all the previous cases, and deduced the principle, that where, for a consideration, a railroad undertakes to transport a passenger, there arises an implied contract upon the part of the company that it has for that purpose provided a sufficient' road, machinery, and cars; that where a passenger is injured by any accident arising from a collision or a defect in the road or equipment, he is required in the first place to prove no more than the fact of the accident and the extent of the injury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[157,2067,1180,351]],["BL_90.1",90,[244,351,1183,1126]]]'>In this case the plaintiff contended that whenever a passenger is injured a presumption of negligence arises against the carrier, which he must rebut by evidence. The authorities cited do not seem to carry the doctrine so far. In all of them it will be observed that the accidents arose from causes affecting the road, or its equipment, or which might have been guarded against by proper care, and therefore negligence was <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>reasonably presumed. In Naplrey’s case it was alleged that the company had not provided a sufficient exit from the car, which was the cause of the injury. There was evidence that the step was from twenty-five to twenty-nine inches from the ground. The jury might have inferred, as was doubtless the fact, that the height of the step caused the injury. Certainly the passenger is under the protection of the company from the time he enters the car until he leaves it. And yet Justipe Sterrett said: “ Taking the uncontradicted facts of this case as they were presented, there existed no reason for relaxing the general rule, that he who alleges negligence as the basis of a claim for damages is bound to prove it affirmatively.” In Anderson’s case, Justice Gordon said: “The carrier’s contract is to provide sufficient means for transportation and to guard against external causes of danger, and that when a passenger is injured by a collision, or a defect in the road or its equipment, the presumption of negligence arises.” It follows from these authorities that when the accident arises from none of these causes, or where the cause is unascertainable, the fact of the accident is not sufficient to warrant the presumption of negligence. In such cases the general rule applies, “ that where negligence is alleged it must be proved.”</p>

The rule, indeed, is universal that the plaintiff must prove a breach of duty of some kind, but it is just as universal that this being once done, the question becomes one of fact for the jury, and the burden of explanation and exculpation .lies upon the party that is shown to have failed in the duty that the law or his voluntary action has placed upon him: Railroad v.

Within a very short time and just as the boat was <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>fairly clear of the wharf, a violent explosion occurred which shattered the forward part of the boat and hurled boards and fragments of timber into the air. Mr. Spear was badly bruised and died soon after. The explosion was followed by a dense black smoke, but no fire seems to have been communicated to the shattered boat, which was immediately removed to a yard outside the state for repairs. All this appeared from the evidence of the plaintiff. If the evidence had closed here, it will not be doubted that the plaintiff would have been entitled to a verdict. The person injured was a passenger; the injury occurred after the carriage had begun; and the cause of the injury was an explosion on the boat, which was the vehicle or instrument of carriage and which was under the exclusive care and control of the defendants’ servants. The rule of law is that the “ mere happening of an injurious accident ” to a passenger while in the hands of the carrier, will raise prima facie a presumption of negligence and throw the onus of showing that it did not exist on the carrier: Laing v.

Its value depended upon the appearance and manner of the witnesses and the degree of credibility to which they were entitled, and it was- for them to say whether it was sufficient to overcome the legal presumption.</p>
    <p id="b93-5" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[177,671,1185,1437]]]'>This was distinctly ruled in Penn. R. Co. v. Weiss, <a href="/pa/87/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="87 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1057894" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0449-01">87 Pa. 449</a>. The court said in that case: “ The presumption of a fact in law which carries a case to the jury necessarily leaves them in possession of the case. True, the evidence to rebut the presumption may be very strong, yet it is a matter for the jury and not fox* the court. ” The learned judge who tried this case in the court below was persuaded that the evidence given oxx behalf of the defendants was sufficient to rebxxt the presumptioix of negligence, and he had a right to express an opinion upon that subject, but the question was not one of law for his determination. It is the right, and iix some cases it becomes the dxxty of a judge to express his opinion upoxi the character and weight of the testimony which he must submit to the jury, but it should be done in such a manner as to leave thexn iix possession of the question that belongs to them. If, notwithstanding the efforts of the judge to guide them, they disregard the evidence and the justice of the cause, he may lay his hands upoxi their verdict axid set it aside, but this is the limit of his power in all cases when there is evidence that carries a question to the jury. A binding instruction is proper where the evidence is not conflicting and presents the facts on which the case depends clearly and distinctly, but if the evidence is contradictory or if it fails to present the facts fully, so that inferences are to be drawn or the credibility of witnesses is to be settled, the evidence must go to the jury. The value or legal effect of facts not in controversy may be determined by the judge, but the facts themselves if in doubt must be found by the jury.</p>

The facts were in controversy. What caused the explosion? Who was at fault for the presence of the explosive? These were questions that the evidence did not fully solve. Whether therefore the prima facie case of the plaintiff had been fully answered was just the question which belonged to the jury and which the court could not take from them.</p>
