I therefore will allow you to prove just exactly what the nature and character of the business was, that was conducted here by the tenants, so that the jury may know what the value of that leasehold was, if they find it was destroyed or injured; and I will allow you to show how this lot is located, its adaptability as a shipping point, and what its value was before the railroad was located, and what its value was immediately after the railroad was located, in order to ascertain the damage to that lot.1</p>

The product of the quarry was transported in wagons to a siding of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad at Spring Mill, a mile or more distant from the quarry, where they had a lot of land of about four acres, which they used for storage and for loading and shipping on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to their sales-yard or depot and business place, at Ninth and Thompson streets, in the city of Philadelphia. The Spring Mill lot and the yard at Ninth and Thompson streets were the individual property of E. Channing Potts. The quarry was owned by E. Channing Potts and W. W.

The general rule, however, undoubtedly is, that disconnected properties are to be treated as distinct properties, and damages for right of way will ordinarily be assessed on this principle. Where a person resides <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>upon one of a number of contiguous town lots, but uses all of them together as his homestead, as if the whole constituted but a single inclosure, and a railroad company appropriates a portion of one only of the lots, the damages will doubtless be assessed for the injury done to the whole property. So, if one. buy a farm in separate contiguous portions from different persons, but occupy the whole in a body for farm purposes, as one farm, the damages for the appropriation of a part, or even the whole, of one of the original pieces will be assessed upon the injury done to the whole tract. Peculiar and isolated cases may perhaps exist, also, where although the lands are not in fact contiguous, yet the uses to which they are applied, respectively, are in then nature so intimate and dependent, one upon the other, that an injury to one must necessarily be taken as an injury to the whole taken together; for example, the land upon which a water mill is erected will ordinarily draw to it as an appurtenance, or rather will be regarded as embracing the ground covered by the reservoir, so that the latter will be regarded as part and parcel of the former, although they are not contiguous.</p>

The quarry was a distinct and disconnected property from the Spring Mill lot; it was devoted to a wholly different purpose, and the same may be said of the sales-yard at Ninth and Thompson streets. The first was a quarry used for quarry purposes alone, and the product was delivered at Spring Mill over the public wagon road; the second was a shipping point, having no connection with the quarry, by contact of the lines, by railway, or any other private means of transportation; and the yard at Ninth and Thompson streets was a sales-yard accessible by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad; thus they were each disconnected from the others, and each was used for a distinct and separate purpose. They were not only different properties, applied to different uses, but the fee was held and owned by different persons; neither of them could be considered as appurtenant to, or part and parcel of the other. There was no special reason, outside of the conveniences and appliances existing at Spring Mill, why the marble should be shipped from that point; and for these appliances the plaintiffs were entitled to be paid. The quarry <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>might be successfully operated without the property at Spring Mill. The railroad was accessible at other points, and for aught that appears or was offered to be shown, equally available shipping facilities might be supplied elsewhere. If the company had appropriated a part of the sales-yard in Philadelphia, could it be pretended that damages would accrue for supposed injuries to the properties in Montgomery county? If the contention of the plaintiff in error be correct, that the three properties are to be regarded as one, this result must certainly ensue; but there was no commanding necessity that the marble product of the quarry should be sold at Ninth and Thompson streets. If that yard was especially valuable for the purpose, compensation commensurate to the injury would be made, and some other market place could be provided.</p>

In order that'two properties, having no physical connection, may be regarded as one, in the assessment of damages for right of way, they must be so inseparably connected in the use to which they are applied, as that the injury or destruction of one must necessarily and permanently injure the other.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[255,1755,1180,395]]]'>It is perfectly plain that, apart from the alleged connected use to which the three several properties have hitherto been applied, the plaintiffs could have no claim arising out of the construction of the road, for any supposed consequential injury, either to the quarry or to the sales-yard; the railroad did not touch either of them, or any right or easement appurtenant thereto, and there is nothing upon which an action at the common law could be sustained in such a case.</p>

In the consideration of the case, we assume all that was offered tobe proved. We are of opinion that the plaintiffs were not entitled to damages, direct or conse<a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>quential, for any supposed injury either to the quarry or to the yard at Ninth and Thompson streets.</p>
