In the present case the prisoner was about to be arraigned, when a suggestion was filed by counsel that the prisoner was insane at the time. An elaborate and learned argument was made by the counsel of the prisoner in his hearing. Nearly two hours were, occupied in arguing and considering the motion, during which time I had the opportunity of observing the appearance and conduct of the prisoner, and the attention he gave to the proceedings. I had also the benefit of the information of the physician of the prison and others to assist me in coming to <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>that sound judgment which it was my duty to exercise.

These words are not the words of a madman or a lunatic. The prisoner did not think it necessary for him to plead. That shows that he could think, and that he expected to be tried on a collateral issue. He had previously withdrawn a plea of not guilty entered when he stood mute. As that was done in person, it shows that he knew enough to do it. He did not consider himself guilty; that is, he could consider and form an opinion. All that shows reasoning power and confirmed my judgment that he ought to be tried on the indictment. But in order to protect the prisoner from any evil consequences, in case my judgment should turn out to be erroneous, I told the jury, with emphasis, that if they thought that the prisoner is a lunatic at this time, they should add that finding to their verdict in case they should convict him; and I went further in favor of the prisoner, and told the jury that they might give him the benefit of any doubt on that subject, although the strict rule of law is otherwise: Coyle v.

It does not appear to have ever been determined or even presented in this court before.

III., c. 94, and that under that statute the English criminal courts do, not infrequently, award preliminary issues to determine the sanity of prisoners by the verdict of a jury. The same is true of the practice in several of our sister states. We have examined with much care the various authorities cited in the very able and exhaustive argument of the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error, and we find that in all of them the inquest was directed, generally by the court of its own motion, sometimes at the instance of the attorney general, but always in cases where the appearance and actions of the prisoner were such as to manifestly indicate a condition of insanity, either real or <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>simulated. In point of fact the purpose of the inquiry was to inform the conscience of the court as to the prisoner’s real condition at the time of the trial, but before the trial proceeded. There was an obvious propriety in directing an inquiry by the verdict of a jury in all such cases, because the fact itself required determination before any further proceedings were had, if there was probable ground for belief that a condition of insanity existed. If upon an examination of the prisoner there was no apparent reason to suppose him insane, but on the contrary he seemed quite capable of pleading to the indictment, there was no necessity for a preliminary trial; because every right to set up insanity, either when the offence is committed, or at the time of the trial, still remained, and could be thoroughly tried by the jury who were to try the indictment. The existence of the doubt as to the prisoner’s present insanity, is a matter which by the very necessity of the case could only be determined by the court itself. Up to the time of pleading there is no other tribunal which has the prisoner in charge, and there is no other which can say whether there is a doubt upon that subject. It is one of the functions which must be intrusted to the court, and it is not to be presumed that it will in any case be abused. If it should be, there is still the remedy available in all cases where abuse of discretion has taken place.</p>

In Whart. Crim. Law, 8th edition, vol. 1, § 58, it is thus said: “ By the common law if it be doubtful whether a criminal who, at his trial, in appearance is a lunatic, be such in truth or not, the issue shall be tried by the jury who are charged to try the indictment; or, being a collateral issue, the fact may be pleaded and replied to ore tenus and a venire awarded, returnable instanter, in the nature of an inquest of office. If it be found by the jury that the party only feigns himself a lunatic and he still refuse to answer, he was, before the act of Geo. IV., c. 28, § 2, dealt with as one who stood mute and as if he had confessed the indictment. The principal point to be considered by the jury would be whether the defendant has a sufficient intellect to comprehend the course of the proceedings on the trial so as to be able to make a proper defence. Whether the prisoner was sane or insane at the time the act was committed, is a question <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>of fact triable by the jury and depending upon the previous and contemporaneous acts of the party.” That is to say, the defence of insanity at the time the crime was committed must be tried by the jury charged with the' trial of the indictment, and if the question of sanity at the time of the trial is raised, it may be tried either by a special jury impaneled for that purpose or by the jury who are to try the indictment. This is the undoubted meaning of the text and it expresses the rule as it was at the common law, and also as it was changed by the act of Geo. IV.</p>

In determining whether a reasonable doubt exists as to his sanity before impaneling a jury, the judge is not confined alone to the case made by the counsel .....but may in his discretion investigate the whole matter and determine whether the necessity exists for the inquiry. But the inquiry should not be allowed, if from all the circumstances he has no reason to doubt his sanity.” The foregoing was said in construing a statute of the state of Iowa, which <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>provided that there should be no trial if there was a doubt whether or not the prisoner be insane.

This being so, it is manifest that neither the assertion of the prisoner or his counsel, nor the production of affidavits, nor the entering of a plea of present insanity upon the record, can of themselves alone suffice to produce the state of doubt which is a necessary prerequisite to the ordering of the inquiry. They are all necessarily addressed to the court, as there is no other tribunal to entertain them; and it is the court, after all, which must be affected by the various considerations which are supposed to, or in fact do, produce the doubt which must precede any order for an inquiry.</p>

The 67th section merely provides that if upon arraignment he shall be found to be a lunatic by a jury lawfully impaneled for the purpose, the same proceedings shall be had. Certainly this ought to be so, for if the fact of insanity be found by a jury whether before the trial or on the trial, the same power to hold him in custody during the continuance of the insanity ought to be exercised. The court cannot find the prisoner to be insane, for that is matter of fact to be found by a jury. But if the court has, upon arraignment, reason to think him insane, or even has doubt upon that subject, they may order an inquest for the purpose of trying that question; and then, if the inquest should find him insane, the order for custody may be made, and this is the whole meaning of the act.

And if, after hearing it, the judge had entertained doubt as to the present sanity of the prisoner, it would have been his duty to award an inquest for the trial of that fact before any further proceedings were had. This was not done, but the jury has now found that the prisoner was not insane, either at the time of the trial or at the commission of the of-fence. The verdict was reached after a patient hearing of all the testimony relied upon by the prisoner, and after a fair and <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>perfectly impartial charge by the judge who said nothing tending to bias, or even to lead the mind of the jury against the prisoner. After the verdict, upon a motion for a new trial, the learned judge expressed his satisfaction with the result and refused the motion. Both his own opinion, after hearing all the testimony, and the verdict of the jury concur in the conclusion that the prisoner was not insane either when-the of-fence was committed or at the time of the trial. In consideration of this state of the record, we do not see how we could with any propriety say that the learned judge abused his discretion in refusing the preliminary inquest. His action has been justified both by the verdict and his own freedom from doubt after hearing all the testimony. It would be indecorous and without warrant for us to say, now, that the judgment should be reversed in order that a preliminary inquest should still be had before the indictment can be again tried. Whether the prisoner was insane when he was arraigned before, is no longer a practical question and could not be tried if-a reversal was granted; and it would be impossible for us now to reverse in order merely that the prisoner may be again arraigned, may plead his insanity at such arraignment and have a special inquest to try that plea. He has already been tried upon that issue and it has been found against him. We would be compelled to set aside this finding as unwarranted by the testimony, in order to give the prisoner any practical relief upon his own theory; but upon our views of the testimony, we have neither the right nor the inclination to take such a step.

All the witnesses were allowed the fullest latitude in describing this change, and in doing so his former disposition was described. His mother testified that “he was always good to us and sent us several times money in Germany.” His brother testified, “He was always a good friend to me and we never fought together.” His wife testified, “His treatment was right good up to 1885,” and then described the change which took place in him in that year and continued afterwards.

He did not appear to understand, he would not say anything about the jury list. He gave a deaf ear to anything that was said and appeared not to realize the gravity of his position. I have come to the conclusion that he is insane, both from the examination and the testimony.”</p>

Mills: “ Office 1909 Chestnut street; have been practicing since .1869; practice in Episcopal Hospital, University Hospital and the Norristown Hospital for Insane; have given special attention to nervous and mental diseases; have a very large experience with nervous diseases and the insaiie; see such cases every day in hospitals and private cases. During the testimony here I have been present a large part of the time. Once I went out of court to send a telegram, and one morning I was a few minutes late in getting to court. I have made examinations of the prisoner in Moyamensing prison four or five times. I examined him in January, February, May and June, and a few days ago, last week on Wednesday.....It was impossible to get a direct, explicit reply to any question; he would make but few direct answers. His manner and tone were very peculiar.....His answers were not sensible, he would occasionálly utter a sentiment that would be sensible.....He impressed me as a man who was suspicious, restless, and whose mind was unhinged. My opinion is that this man is a very insane man, from the evidence and as a result of these examinations. In forming my opinion upon the evidence, I considered his suspicions of chloroform being given him, and of unfaithfulness of his wife. The scene about the revolver, that he broke a hole in door by which latch <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>was lifted, the change in his manner of acting towards his relatives, what he said happened in the restaurant, and of powder being put in his food to poison him, that the same parties followed him to Mr. Mueller’s house. Then, again, the change in his habits and disposition. They were different from what they ought to have been if he were sane. Then, as to having given up work; he had saved sixteen hundred dollars and then ceased to work; he gave up his habit of saving. He had been affectionate to his wife and then had ceased, and had begun to suspect her without cause. Also the change of habit in treating his parents. They testified he had given money to his parents in the old country; his brother testified to his kindness, and that he believed in him, and then had ceased to believe. I have carefully thought over it, and I have made up my mind and believe this man to be insane.”</p>

It might be either. If his mind was obscured by its general delusional condition, relative to suspicion, I do not think it would be revenge, but would be the act of an insane man. The explanation I have heard here of putting Webber out of the store would not clear it of the delusion.....In' my judgment this man was not simulating. I believé this man is a case of delusional insanity. He suffers from delusions of suspicions, persecutions, etc. I believe there is a general delusional condition. He believes he was poisoned, was chloroformed and followed; that his wife was unfaithful, etc.”</p>

This being so, it is manifest that neither the assertion of the prisoner or his counsel, nor the production of affidavits, nor the entering of a plea of present insanity upon the record, can of themselves alone suffice to produce the state of doubt which is the necessary prerequisite to the ordering of the inquiry. They are all necessarily addressed to the court, as there is no other tribunal to entertain them; and it is the court, after all, that must be affected by the various considerations which are supposed to, or in fact do, produce the doubt which must precede any order for an inquiry.....It is the judicial conscience alone which can determine this question and it is that conscience only ■which must be informed so that it may act intelligently.” He <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>therefore concludes that it rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge whether in any given case a preliminary issue shall he awarded to determine the then sanity of the prisoner.</p>

That being denied, they then asked leave to file a special plea, setting forth his then insanity in order that an issue might be formed to determine that question. That also being refused, they then signed and presented to the court a suggestion setting forth that the prisoner then in court “ is a lunatic of non-sane mind, and has not sufficient intelligence to comprehend the course of proceedings on the trial so as to make a proper defence, nor conduct it with discretion, and <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>before the court should compel him to plead to the bill of indictment a jury be lawfully impaneled to find whether such facts be true or not, so that the court may take action in the case, as in the act of March 31, 1860, is provided.” In connection therewith they offered to support their motion and “inform the discretion of the court, by producing affidavits or ■ witnesses viva voce that the prisoner is now insane and therefore incompetent to plead or conduct his defence.” That was also refused, the learned judge saying: “ I consider that it is a matter in my discretion.” Thereupon, the prisoner was arraigned and in answer to the question “whether he was guilty or not guilty*” said: “ I do not think it necessary for me to do so; I do not consider myself guilty of anything at all.” The learned judge pronounced his answer a plea of not guilty and by his' direction it was so entered of record. Counsel for the prisoner then renewed their suggestion that he “ is insane upon arraignment,” moved that that issue be first tried, and again offered “to accompany their motion with affidavits or witnesses viva voce that the prisoner is incompetent to plead or conduct his defence.” The motion being denied, a jury was impaneled and the trial proceeded.

I had also the benefit of the information of the physician of the prison and others to assist me in coming to that sound judgment which it was my duty to exercise.
