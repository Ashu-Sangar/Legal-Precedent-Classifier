By the usual terms of the deed, the lessee covenanted for himself, his heirs, executors, etc., to pay the rent. A failure to pay was a breach for which his executor was expressly stipulated to be liable. He seemed, therefore, the proper party to sue, as he unquestionably was, for the rent accruing in the testator’s lifetime. This question came before the District Court in Gardiner v. Painter, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%20365" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Phila. 365">8 Phila. 365</a>, and was elaborately considered in an opinion by Stboud, J., holding that the executor was the proper party defendant, but that the judgment should be restricted to the land charged.

But it is plain that this section was meant to protect land in the hands of heirs and devisees from being charged without notice to them with the payment of general debts of the ancestor for which the land is not primarily liable, and does not apply to cases where the land is already charged as by mortgage: Chambers v. Carson, <a href="/whart/2/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Whart. 365" data-case-ids="1830495" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0365-01">2 Wh. 365</a>; or by judgment against the ancestor in his lifetime, McMillan v.

C., No. 1859 December Term 1857, and find that a fieri facias and venditioni exponas were issued in due course and the land sold, without any scire facias to the heirs. This would seem to be conclusive that the District Court in giving judgment against the executor meant that execution de terris should follow; and I am informed by two of the most experienced and eminent conveyancing counsel at this bar that such has been the uniform practice. That this practice is not merely local is shown by the language of Judge Rogers in McMillan v.

The principles of that case apply á <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>fortiori to this. The mortgage was discharged by a sale under a prior incumbrance with which tho defendant was in no wise concerned. There is no imputation of fraud on his part, nor is it claimed that he did not buy the land in good faith with his own money. His only connection with the land prior to his purchase, was as husband of one of the tenants in common of a barren legal title, cast upon them by descent, and not reduced to possession or recognized by them in any way. In the face of these facts, to hold, in an action, not by the other co-tenants, but by an adverse incumbrancer, that the defendant must be conclusively presumed to have bought as trustee for his wife, and therefore that he is remitted to her prior title, that her title enures to the benefit of all the co-tenants, and is therefore the title of the ancestor, and subject to the incumbrances due by him, would be directly .contrary to the principle of Rauch v.

The evil to be <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>remedied by that act was that, prior thereto, real estate being assets for the payment of debts, a judgment could be obtained against or confessed by a personal representative of a decedent, and his land sold without any notice to the widow or heirs; when so sold, the title conveyed Avas such that in ejectment the heir could not deny the debt for which the judgment was recovered: Payne v.

The natural inference, therefore, is, that its provisions were intended to be as wide as the evil to be cured. The language must be read as having this breadth. The words of the act apply to all actions. The provisions as to the intent to charge the lands of the decedent must be read as equivalent to the words used in pari materia in the report of the commissioners, “ to obtain satisfaction out of the land.” The section concerns execution, not lien: Schwartz’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Pa.%2045" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="14 Pa. 45">14 Pa. 45</a>; Sample v.

It was urged, however, that the proceedings upon the ground-rent were defective because there was no scire facias to .warn the heirs as required by the act ,of February 24, 1834. The object of that act was to give the heirs notice of an attempt to charge a debt of a decedent upon his real estate in their hands, and it has no application where the testator in his lifetime has charged his real estate with the payment of the debt. In such cases the heirs take the real estate cum onere. It is true that Justice Thompson did say in McLaughlin v. McCumber, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Pa.%2022" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="36 Pa. 22">36 Pa. 22</a>, that “ the requirement of the statute of 1834, that in order to charge the lands of the decedent as against the widow and heirs, they must be made parties to the judgment, is a rule without exception,” yet this must be understood in connection with the facts involved in that case. There a judgment had been recovered against an executor upon a debt of his testator, and it was sought to charge his real estate with said debt without making his widow and heirs parties. ■ It may be said that, as to all such cases, there is no exception to the rule. A scire facias <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>upon a mortgage is not within § 34, act of February 24, 1834, requiring the widow and heirs or devisees of a decedent to be made parties to a suit against executors : Chambers v.

    <p id="b45-5" data-blocks='[["BL_45.5",45,[181,672,1182,819]]]'>The judgment upon this ground-rent was a judgment de terris, and the suit was as much a proceeding in rem as is a scire facias upon a mortgage. The administrator could not have been compelled to pay the money out of the personal estate, nor could it have been made out of any real estate other than the particular property upon which it was charged, and out of which the rent issued. It was a restricted charge. It was held in McMurray v. Hopper, <a href="/pa/43/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="43 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="483207" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0468-01">43 Pa. 468</a>, that “ an unconditional revival of a restricted judgment, during defendant’s lifetime, makes it a general lien on all his lands in the <em>county; </em>but such revival after his death against his personal representatives only, simply continues the lien as originally restricted. To incqmber his other real estate with the judgment, as against the widow and heirs, proceedings must be had against them under the provisions of the 34th section of the act of February 24, 1834.”</p>
    <p id="b45-6" data-blocks='[["BL_45.6",45,[182,1500,1181,506]]]'>It is true a judgment against a covenantor in a ground-rent deed is a general, unrestricted judgment, and the money may be made out of any of his property, real or personal, that can be found. So I apprehend a judgment against his executor or administrator for rent which accrued prior to his death could be collected out of his general assets, real or personal; yet, to charge it upon any real estate other than that out of which the rent issued, would require notice to the widow and heirs under the act of 1834, under the principle above cited in McMurray v.

The reasons are equally strong for the exemption of a judgment upon ground-rent from its ope-, ration. A ground-rent is something more than a lien or even a charge ; it is an estate, and is bound by the lien of a judgment or mortgage equally with the land. The remedies for its collection are threefold, viz.: <em>(a) </em>The action of covenant upon the deed, (5) by distress, and (c) by re-entry. The last <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>two remedies are always in rem; the first is so (as in this case) for rent falling due after the death of the covenantor. No one, I presume, will contend that where the ground landlord proceeds to collect his rent by distress, or re-entry, that he must make the widow and heirs parties under the act of 1834. Nor do I see any stronger reason why he should make them parties when he attempts to collect it out of the property itself by execution. He is charging nothing upon the land of the deceased covenantor; he is merely enforcing a charge placed upon it by the decedent himself in the very inception of his title, which binds it in the hands of his heirs, and runs with the land forever, and in every change of ownership.</p>

That the rule has no application to this case requires but a moment’s consideration. The defendant bought the premises in question at a judicial sale for arrears of a ground-rent which antedated the mortgage. The effect of this was to discharge the lien of the mortgage. The defendant paid his own money and for all practical purposes was a stranger to the title. His only connection with the land prior to his purchase, as was said by the court below, was as husband of one of the tenants in common of a barren legal title, cast upon them by descent, and not reduced to possession or recognized by them in any way. It was among the admitted facts in the case “ that when John Ketcham died his estate was insolvent, and this land was incumbered beyond its market value, and therefore the heirs did not enter into possession or take any steps to recognize their legal title.” We entirely agree with the learned judge below when he said: “ In the face of these facts, to hold, in an action, not by the other co-tenants, but by an adverse incumbrancer, that the defendant must be conclusively presumed to have bought as trustee for his wife, and therefore that he is remitted to her prior title ; that her title <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>inures to the benefit of all the co-tenants, and is therefore the title of the ancestor, and subject to the incumbrances due by him, would be directly contrary to the principle of Rauch v.
