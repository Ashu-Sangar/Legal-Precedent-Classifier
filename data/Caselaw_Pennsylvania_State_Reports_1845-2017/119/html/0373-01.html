Plaintiff accordingly claimed he was entitled to demand and receive from the county the difference, $283.15, above stated, and the court below was asked to decide whether, upon the admitted facts, he was legally entitled thereto or not. In view of the fact that the fee-bill of 1868 had never been supplied or repealed and was therefore the only one in force, the court was of opinion that plaintiff should be paid for Ms services according to the schedule of fees established by it, and hence he was entitled to judgment against the county for the amount above stated.</p>

Reitzel, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 109" data-case-ids="12169056" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0109-01">9 W. &amp; S. 109</a>, and Hutchinson v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/6/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="6 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="954575" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0124-01">6 Pa. 124</a>. In the latter case it was held that the settlement of a public officer’s accounts by the auditor general, unappealed from, was conclusive, even though on the face of the account it was apparent that an allowance, authorized by an act of assembly, was not made. Mr. Justice Bell, delivering the opinion of the court, says : “ By declining to appeal, the party concedes the correctness of the settlement in every particular, and he cannot afterwards be permitted to aver that his acquiescence was induced by misapprehension of the law. Admitting this to be true, it is beyond the power of the ordinary tribunals to afford redress. If injustice has been done, the only remedy is to be found in the exercise of the extraordinary power of the legislature.”</p>
