The case was decided in, <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>1841. The reasoning of the court below, fully concurred in by the Supreme Court, is unanswerable. As the law then stood, the commissioners had no power to do ordinary repairs to any bridge without the concurrence of the Quarter. Sessions. The case also decides that the reconstruction of a county bridge, which had been swept away by a flood, was substantially a new bridge, and required the concurrence of the grand jury and court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[250,765,1182,765]]]'>The act of 1843, above referred to, was passed to give the commissioners power, and to make it their duty, to attend to the ordinary repair of county bridges, but was not intended to invest them with power, under the name of repairs, to build entirely new bridges. When a county bridge is destroyed by fire, flood, or other accident, a new bridge can only be erected by and with the approval of the grand jury and court. The reason is obvious. The grand jury are the representatives of the tax payers. No schemes for the expenditure of public money can be permitted without the consent of the people. If the commissioners have the power to take down bridges, erected by the county at a comparatively small expense, and replace them with new ones, requiring a large expenditure of public money, all the safeguards of the law against public extravagance would soon be destroyed.</p>

It is admitted that they had no such right previous to 1848. The rule then was that bridges were to be kept in repair by the same persons whose duty it was to keep the highway, of which the bridge was a part, in order. The act of April, 1843, changed this rule and threw upon the county the duty of repairing county bridges. This, however, did not authorize the commissioners, where a bridge was destroyed by fire or floods, to erect a new one.</p>

Nearly all the bridges on Chester creek were swept away. In some cases the course of the stream was so changed as ■ to make it necessary to alter the sites of some of the bridges. To obviate the difficulty and overcome the delay of proceedings in the usual way, the act January 26, 1844, P. L. 24, special to Delaware county, was passed. It declares that the act April 13,1843, “ shall be so construed as to authorize the commissioners of said county to rebuild any bridge which may be destroyed by floods or otherwise.” The learned counsel for the commissioners contends that the word “ otherwise ” in the act just cited, covers the case of a bridge so dilapidated by wear, use and time’s decay as to render it economical to remove it and build an entirely new structure upon a new, more expensive and commodious plan. No rule for the construction of statutes will sustain this argument. It clearly means any sudden or accidental destruction, as by a tornado, fire or other casualty. It cannot mean that the commissioners may themselves “ destroy ” a bridge and without further authority than this act of assembly proceed to construct a new one uj&gt;on an entirely different plan.</p>

This act clearly specifies what the word “ otherwise ” in the act of 1844 was intended to mean, that is to say “ blown down, destroyed, partly destroyed or swept away by floods, freshets, ice, storm, fire or other casualty.”</p>

That question once settled in favor of the petitioners, he contends that they have a carte blanche as to the style and expense of the structure, and that if a new necessity arises for a more commodious and expensive one, they alone have the discretion to remove the insufficient bridge, and build such a one as in their judgment the public necessity may require. This is a mistake. The first question the original viewers have to decide is whether the proposed bridge be too expensive to be borne by the township. To properly decide this, they must ascertain the cost of the proposed bridge. The same question is then submitted to the grand jury, who are authorized to visit the site and call before them the county commissioners, with their plans, specifications and estimates. If they concur, the practice in Delaware county is for the court to submit the report to the commissioners, and if they concur, then to require them to lay before the court their plans and estimates for the work, when, if the court concurs, the order issues and the bridge is built. Should the plans be changed or the costs be unreasonably increased, or a structure be erected materially different from the one con-curred in by the court and grand jury, it would be such a fraud upon the court as to probably render the commissioners personally liable for the increased cost: Lehigh Co. v. Kleckner, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 181" data-case-ids="478935" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0181-01">5 W. &amp; S. 181</a>.</p>

It is equally clear that where a county bridge has been erected according to the provisions of the statute, and it should after-wards appear that the public convenience requires a more commodious and expensive one upon a new, improved and entirely different plan, the question of the new necessity should be inquired into and decided in the same manner as in the erection of the original structure. There is no difficulty in the way <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>of such a proceeding.

It will dam back the water upon his mill more than ever before in time of such freshets as are known to occur in the creek. It will cast an additional flow of water over his lands, outside the creek banks, flooding his houses to his injury.” The master also finds that the plaintiff has not slept upon his rights; that he not only objected, but that he filed his bill for an injunction as soon as he discovered the injury he was likely to suffer, and before the work was done.</p>

We have no reason to modify any of the views then expressed. Let it be granted, however, for the purpose of the argument, that the commissioners have the right to rebuild a county bridge without the approval of the court; still under article XVI., § 8 of the constitution, the plaintiff is entitled to his injunction. Delaware County is a public corporation invested with power to take private lands for public use. The constitution prohibits such corporations <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>from injuring private persons by the enlargement or improvement of tbeir works without first paying or securing the damages. The master finds that in the enlarging or improving of this public work, the lands of the plaintiff have been greatly injured and that no compensation has been made or secured. Since the adoption of the constitution of 1874,1 am of opinion that no municipal, or other corporation, can improve or enlarge its works to the injury of private persons without first making or securing compensation. The proper thing for the commissioners to have done would have been to petition the court for a jury to report upon the necessity for a bridge, and to assess the damages likely to be suffered by the plaintiff if a bridge should be ordered. This was the course pursued in the Shoemakerville bridge case. It seems to me that the sooner the commissioners undo their wrongful act and commence right, the better for all concerned.

It is not, however, a taxpayer’s bill. It was filed by a property owner, whose only complaint is that the commissioners are erecting the bridge in a manner that will be injurious to his property rights. The learned judge below evidently saw this difficulty when he said in his opinion: “It is contended, how<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>ever, that as this is not a taxpayer’s bill, the question of authority is not raised. While it may be true that the question of authority to build the bridge is not the direct issue between the parties, it is incidental to it. The bill prays for relief from an alleged unlawful act, and Wilhelm’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/79/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="79 Pa. 120" data-case-ids="438454" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0120-01">79 Pa. 120</a>, decides that where there is jurisdiction of the subject matter, equity may determine any incidental question necessarily involved. The plaintiff charges the commissioners with' an unlawful interference with his property. He may therefore show a want of authority to do the act complained of.”</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[247,856,1185,1228]]]'>This paragraph is evidently based upon a misconception of the nature and effect of the plaintiff’s bill. We do not understand it to pray for relief “ from an alleged unlawful act,” nor to charge the commissioners “ with an unlawful interference with his property.” On the contrary, it charges no unlawful act on the part of the commissioners. There is no averment in the bill that they are proceeding without proper authority to rebuild the bridge, and without such averment a taxpayer’s bill would be demurrable. Public officials like county commissioners can only be restrained in their official acts when it appears that they are proceeding without lawful authority. This is the principle which underlies Sharpless v. The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/21/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="21 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="411603" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0147-01">21 Pa. 147</a>, and the line of cases following it. The building of county bridges is one of the recognized duties of county commissioners. There is no averment that these commissioners are proceeding without the authority of the grand jury and Court of Quarter Sessions. We cannot therefore, as before stated, pass upon the question of their power to act without such sanction. Nor would it help the matter were we to permit the bill to be amended and by a convenient fiction treat it as a taxpayer’s bill, for it would still lack the essential averments. It would have to be reconstructed from the foundations to give it any value as a taxpayer’s bill.. This cannot be done at this stage of the case.</p>

This cannot be done either in the size of the bridge, its plan, or the location of its piers or abutments. The master finds that this bridge is located wholly on the old road-bed and within its lines. It <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>does not touch the land of the complainant. If it causes injury to the latter by interfering with his water rights, he has his remedy by an action on the case. The right to compensation for what are usually called consequential injuries, that is to say, where property is injured without being actually taken, is given by sec. 8 of article XVI. of the constitution. We do not agree, however, with the learned judge below, that a jury could be appointed to assess the damages. This can only be done where property is actually taken. We have therefore held that inasmuch as the legislature has provided no remedy for the assessment of such damages, an action on the case will lie to enforce the right conferred by the constitution: Penn. R. Co. v. Duncan, <a href="/pa/111/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="111 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="545216" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0352-01">111 Pa. 352</a>; County of Chester v.

    <p id="b195-5" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[153,1060,1183,610]]]'>Nor do we agree with the court below that the complainant is entitled to his injunction until the county shall make compensation for the injury. The' only difference between the late constitution and the present one in this respect is, that in the former, compensation was given only for property taken; in the latter, compensation is given for property taken, injured, or destroyed. In either case, compensation must be made or secured before such taking, injury, etc. It has been repeatedly held that the power of taxation in a municipal corporation is sufficient security for property taken by such corporation. Hence it logically follows that it is sufficient for property injured. These authorities are too familiar to need citation.</p>
