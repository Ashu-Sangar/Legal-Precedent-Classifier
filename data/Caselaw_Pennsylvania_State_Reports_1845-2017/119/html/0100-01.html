The executor does not give one fifth of the estate to each of his children, but he directs it to be divided into five “parts,” and one of these parts he gives to each one of his children. Until these parts were ascertained by the act of the executors, in pursuance of their duty under the will, the beneficiaries, while having a vested interest in their parts, as finally set out, could not ascertain the specific property belonging to them. If the legal estate, necessary to effectuate the testator’s intent, was vested in the executors, it seems clear that until an allotment was made, the beneficiaries took no interest which entitled them to a partition: Ruffel’s Est.
