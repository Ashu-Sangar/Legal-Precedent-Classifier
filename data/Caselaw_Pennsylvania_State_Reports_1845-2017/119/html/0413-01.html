It is not stated in the bill whether this contract for the sale of lands was in writing, and counsel for defendant says upon the argument it was not, and counsel for plaintiff declines to say that it was.

It is not, however, necessary to discuss this feature of the case. No possession or improvements followed the contract; there was a payment of a small sum of 10 per cent, as down-money, and this payment can be compensated, as also any other legitimate damages, in an action at law. The case of Weise’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/72/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="72 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="434659" data-case-paths="/pa/72/0351-01">72 Pa. 351</a>, covers the present case in every respect.
