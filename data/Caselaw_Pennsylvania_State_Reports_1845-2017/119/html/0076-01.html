      <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>The defendant. Samuel Adams, is not a party to the promissory notes for which the plaintiff seeks to recover. He did not sign them as maker, nor as indorser, and before the plaintiff can recover against Samuel Adams, he must prove a liability in law on Samuel Adams’s part to pay. The allegation is that Samuel Adams became liable to pay the claim of the plaintiff by reason of the promise, which it is alleged he made to the Weaver Brothers at the time they confessed a judgment to him, and that the promise was the inducing cause of giving the judgment......</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[259,881,1182,1587]]]'>Assuming that Adams was a creditor of the Weaver Brothers at the time, and that David Kuehn also was a creditor, the confession of the judgment due one day after date was an advantage to Samuel Adams. It enabled him at once, and without suit to obtain a judgment, which became a lien on the real estate of the Weaver Brothers, and it enabled him the day afterwards to issue execution and to seize all the goods and chattels, which they owned. It was an advantage which he obtained to the detriment of other creditors of the Weaver Brothers. If it is proved, gentlemen, that the promise to pay all the creditors, was the inducing cause of the confession of that judgment by the Weaver Brothers, and if Kuehn was at that time a creditor, he is entitled to recover. The promise bound Samuel Adams. It would not matter that the promise was not made directly to David Kuehn. If that promise was made, and he was a creditor, he could avail himself of that promise and enforce it by a suit; and if the promise set up by the plaintiff was not made, then the plaintiff cannot recover, no matter what the indebtedness of the Weaver Brothers to Adams may have been, whether it was the amount of the judgment, more or less. If that promise was made, and it was the consideration of confessing the judgment, then, as I said to you, Adams is bound by it, even although the judgment was given to him for no more than the Weaver Brothers owed him, and if he did not make the promise, David Kuehn cannot recover, although the judgment was for more than was owing. We cannot in this issue determine whether the judgment was for the amount Adams was liable for, and what the Weaver Brothers owed him, or for more or less. That cannot affect this issue. The main question in the case is whether the promise set up by. the plaintiff was made or not.</p>

      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>. [Upon this question of the indebtedness of the Weavers to Adams considerable evidence has been introduced and has been commented upon extensively. On the part of Adams it was shown to rebut the idea that the promise was made and to show possibly the improbability of its being made, that the Weaver Brothers were indebted to him for the amount of this judgment and the amount of a judgment which had previously been given of $11,500, and much more; and on the part of the plaintiff, to meet that theory of the defendant, it has been attempted to be shown that the indebtedness to Adams was not that much, nothing like it. If that is true it helps you to determine as to whether this promise was made or not. You can use it as a circumstance for that purpose; excepting its bearing upon that question it has nothing to do with the case.]5</p>

Jacob Weaver said that when they met at the office a judgment was spoken of; that it was said in substance that Adams wanted a judgment from them, and that there was some hesitancy on their part, or on the part of one of the brothers to confess the judgment. One of them spoke of an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and said he preferred that course, and Jacob says that he said under no consideration would they sign a judgment, because they did not owe him anything; that Mr. Trexler then said that the Weaver Brothers had a proposition to make, and that then he (Jacob) said “ that all the creditors must be paid,” and that it was then said by Mr. Adams that Mr. Trexler, who was sitting there and writing, should write it down, and I believe it was testified, and it is for you to remember what the testimony was, that Adams said “all right,” and then it was said the Weaver Brothers, or one of them, said that four certain creditors of theirs should be paid first: Wertman, Stevens, Rebecca Weaver and certain money which one of the Weavers had in hand of certain minor children. Milton Weaver testifying, said that the judgment was Spoken of, and that Mr. Adams wanted a judgment rather than an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and that his brother (meaning Jacob) then said that all the creditors must be paid; that Wertman, Stevens, Rebecca Weaver and the minor children’s money should be paid first, but that all the creditors <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>had to be paid before they confessed a judgment; that when the judgment had been written he (Milton) said to his brother Jacob: “Shall I sign this death warrant?” and that then it was said: “ Yes, under those conditions you can sign,” and he signed it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[257,618,1176,1326]]]'>This is denied by Mr. Adams totally. He says that there was no agreement to pay all the creditors ; that that was not demanded by the Weaver Brothers: that nothing was said. Mr. Trexler testified that nothing was said to that effect; that there was no understanding or promise to pay all the creditors, and that the Weaver Brothers did not ask it. Then it is alleged that you can find from the subsequent conduct of the parties interested, possibly from what they said, something which bears upon the question as to whether the promise was made or not. It is said that Mr. Adams’s subsequent conduct showed that he recognized the existence of a promise such as the plaintiff sets up. On the part of the defendant it is insisted that you can find from the conduct and possibly the declarations of the Weaver Brothers afterwards made, that there was no such promise; that they knew there was none. If there is any conduct of either of the parties or a subsequent declaration, which tends to throw light upon the question as to whether the contract was made before the judgment was signed, you will receive it and give it its due weight. But in order to be binding, the promise to pay the other creditors must have been made at the time that judgment was given, or immediately before, and it must appear that it was one of the conditions understood between the parties, that the other creditors should be paid; because if Mr. Adams had made a promise of that kind after he had the judgment, whether before or after the sheriff’s sale, then it could not be enforced.</p>

To repeat: We say to you that the confession of the judgment to Mr. Adams was an advantage to him, and if at the’same time there were other creditors of the Weaver Brothers, it was a detriment to them, and if the inducing cause to give the judgment, to confess it, was the promise of Adams, a demand made by the Weaver Brothers that the other creditors should be paid, and assented to by him, then if David Kuehn was at that time a creditor, he can recover; <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>and if that promise was not a consideration moving the Weaver Brothers to confess the judgment, then the plaintiff cannot recover......</p>

By the verdict the jury found, (1) that the plaintiff was a creditor of Weaver Brothers at the time of the confession of judgment and the transfer of the book accounts, and (2) that the giving of the judgment and the transfer of the accounts was the consideration of a promise by the defendant to pay the debts of Weaver Brothers. Under Roth v. Barner, <a href="/pennyp/2/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="2 Pennyp. 214" data-case-ids="218929" data-case-paths="/pennyp/2/0214-01">2 Penny. 214</a> (12 W.

The only material difference between the ease at bar and Roth v. Barner is, that in the latter the promise was explicit to pay the particular debt in suit, whilst in the case at bar the promise was to pay all the debts of Weaver Brothers. The objection that because the contract was entire the plaintiff could not sue, is met by Robertson v.

As to the only remaining question, the giving of the judgment was a benefit to the defendant as it gave him the entire stock of the firm and a lien upon all their real estate; and it was a detriment to the other creditors, including the plaintiff, because it delayed the payment of their claims until all of the defendant’s claims were satisfied.

    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[275,417,1183,1631]]]'>In 1884 and for several years prior thereto, the firm of Weaver Brothers was extensively engaged in the manufacture of cigars. Samuel Adams was an accommodation indorser for them, and in August, 1884, was upon their paper for upwards of $40,000. He became satisfied that the firm was insolvent, and asked them to secure him by giving him a judgment note in a sum sufficient to cover his indorsements, so that he could have judgment entered against them and their stock seized and sold by the sheriff. On the 12th of August, 1884, they executed and delivered to him a judgment note for $25,500, on which he caused judgment to be entered and execution to issue. The Weaver Brothers claim that this judgment note was executed by them upon the promise by Adams that he would do the following things, viz.: that he would pay all their debts without regard to their number or amount; that he would pay to them the sum of $4,000 in cash; give them a house and lot adjoining, and some vacant lots in rear of, the property then occupied by them; provide them a half interest in a grocery store and give them a “free name.” David Kuehn was a creditor of the Weaver Brothers at the time of their failure, and brings this suit against Adams to recover the debt due him from Weaver Brothers. He seeks to recover on the contract which the Weavers claim to have made with Adams when the judgment note was given him. Upon the trial two questions were raised; one of fact as to the making of the contract on which the plaintiff sued, and one of law as to his right to sue upon it, if made as alleged. The jury, under an instruction from the court that the action was well brought if they found the contract to have been made, have decided that this remarkable contract was made as testified to by the Weavers. The question now to be considered is the correctness of the instruction.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.7",108,[276,2066,1179,353]],["BL_109.1",109,[133,352,1186,819]]]'>The contract sued on is one to which the plaintiff is a stranger. It was made with the Weaver Brothers. The consideration moved wholly from them and they were the parties to be benefited by the performance of its terms. The common law rule is that “ no one can sue on a contract to which he is not a party:” Whart., Contracts, 784; Hare on Contracts, 198. The same rule is laid down in Chitty’s Pleading. It is <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>still adhered to in England. In this country it is recognized as the law in most of the states and by the Supreme Court of the United States: <a href="/citations/?q=98%20U.S.%20128" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="98 U.S. 128">98 U. S. Rep. 128</a>. In this state it was stated very clearly by Justice Sergeant in Blymire v. Boistle, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%20182" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="6 W. 182">6 W. 182</a>. That case has been followed and the authority of the rule recognized in several later cases, among which are Torrens v. Campbell, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Pa.%20472" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="74 Pa. 472">74 Pa. 472</a>, and Kountz v. Holthouse, <a href="/pa/85/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="85 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="440464" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0235-01">85 Pa. 235</a>. In the latter of these cases it was applied by Mercer, J., who said: “ As he (the plaintiff) was a stranger to the contract and to the consideration on which it rested, he could not recover.” In Guthrie v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/85/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="85 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="440525" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0303-01">85 Pa. 303</a>, where it was apparent that an action could have been maintained by the personal representatives of Alexander Guthrie, it was said that “ it would be a harsh rule of law that would throw on the defendant the additional burden of a suit by each of the legatees.” •</p>
    <p id="b109-5" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[127,1179,1188,1233]],["BL_110.1",110,[267,345,1184,815]]]'>There is, however, a line of cases in which a third party has been allowed to recover on a contract to which he was not a party, and several of these are brought to our attention by the defendant in error. An examination of these cases will show that they recognize the rule as we have stated it, and are relieved from its operation because of the nature of the consideration of the contract sued on. The distinction on which they rest is pointed out in Blymire v. Boistle, supra. Where one person enters into a contract with another to pay money to a third, or to deliver some valuable thing, and such third parly is the only party interested in the payment or the delivery, he can release the promisor from performance or compel performance by suit. If, on the otlier hand, a debt already exists from one person to another, a promise by a third person to pay such debt is for the benefit of the original debtor to whom it is made, and can only be released or enforced by him. If it could also be enforced by the original creditor the promisor would be liable to two actions for the same debt at the same time and upon the same contract. Among the exceptions, are cases where the promise to pay the debt of a third person rests upon the fact that money or property is placed in the hands of the promisor for that particular purpose. Also where one buys out the stock of a tradesman and undertakes to take the place, fill the contracts, and pay the debts of his <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>vendor. These cases as well as the case of one who receives money <em>ox </em>property on the promise to pay or deliver to a third person, are cases in which the third person, although not a party to the contract, may be fairly said to be a party to the consideration on which it rests. In good conscience the title to the money or thing which is the consideration of the promise passes to the beneficiary, and the promisor is turned in effect into a trustee. But when the promise is made to, and in relief of one to whom the promise is made, upon a consideration moving from him, no particular fund or means of payment being placed in the hands of the promisor out of which the payment is to be made, there is no trust arising in the promisor and no title passing to the third person. The beneficiary is not the original creditor who is a stranger to the contract and the consideration, but the original debtor who is a party to both, and the right of action is in him alone.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[269,1168,1184,1124]]]'>The application of this rule to the case under consideration is decisive of the plaintiff’s case. If Adams made the agreement sued on, he made it with Weaver Brothers. Its various provisions were for their benefit. No fund was provided for the payment of the plaintiff’s debt, no property was set apart for his benefit. The note, under all the evidence, was given for the purpose of covering the indorsements of Adams. This case therefore stands under the general rule and is not brought within the limit of the exceptions to its operation. The suggestion of the court below that the title might be amended by adding tjie name of the Weaver Brothers as legal plaintiffs, will not relieve against the difficulty. If the plaintiff can maintain his suit so can every creditor of the Weaver Brothers maintain his separate action for his particular debt upon the same contract, and we would then have the Weaver Brothers as legal plaintiffs in possibly one hundred or more suits for the use of so many separate creditors on the same contract; and, to close the series, an action by the Weavers to recover for the non-performance of such portions of the contract as related to payment of money or delivery of property directly to themselves. The inconvenience and injustice of such a result is too obvious to require discussion.</p>
