Michael Regen comes into court and says he has a claim against S. Long &amp; Son for ochre which was sold to them under a certain contract, which he submits to the jury. The terms of this contract, he alleges, are found partly in writing and partly by word of mouth. He says that on April 17, 1885, he entered into articles of agreement with S. Long &amp; Son, and that agreement was that Michael Regen will deliver 800 tons more or less of ochre, now lying at a certain ochre factory at Topton, ground, floated, barreled, and delivered on the cars at Topton or Hancock station inside of three months from the date hereof, and in consideration whereof the said Michael Regen was to receive $9.00 for every ton of 2000 pounds, this payment to be made thirty days after the last shipment of ochre is made to said Samuel Long &amp; Son. He tells you that after that agreement was made in writing, he had a conversation with the defendants through Nicholas Long, who represented them, and that there were certain changes made in the agreement, and he says he asked Long if he would see Fritch &amp; Brother who were carrying on an ochre factory and have them attend to the business of preparing this ochre for the market; that he saw Long; that Long told Regen that he had made an arrangement to have it done for $5 a ton; that this $5 was to cover everything that was necessary to be done to prepare this ochre for the market. Subsequent to that, Mr. Long came to the plaintiff and said that he was unable to comply with this contract, and he said he had done nothing with it. He told Mr. Long he had offers for the ore; he was offered $8 a ton for it and wanted more time. Long said he would give him an extension of time ; he said it was worth more than $8 a ton to prepare it; that thereupon he extended the terms of this, contract for three months longer, and the <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>price of tbe ocbre was reduced to $8 instead of $9 a ton. So that, under Mr. Regen’s statement and this agreement, the price that tbe Longs were to pay for this ocbre was $8 per ton; and tbe agreement, be alleges, made with Long was that tbe $5 was to pay tbe whole cost of tbe subsequent preparation for shipment. [Now, gentlemen, if that contract is tbe correct one, then if tbe ocbre was |8 a ton, including the preparation of it for the market, as specified in this agreement, and tbe cost of that preparation which Long assumed was $5, tbe plaintiff would be entitled to tbe difference between tbe $8 and tbe $5, or $3 a ton for every ton that was delivered under this agreement. If that view of tbe case be taken, tbe plaintiff says that there were delivered 272 tons of ocbre, which at $3 a ton amounts to $816. He makes up bis estimate of tbe quantity by taking tbe receipts which were given at tbe time tbe ocbre was hauled away from Regen’s ocbre place. An addition of tbe various amounts of ocbre hauled away by these different teams at $3 a ton would amount to $816, and tbe plaintiff asks you to find under bis theory of tbe case that be is entitled to a verdict for the sum of $816, with interest from tbe 24th day of November, 1885.] 3 [Now, in tbe consideration of tbe testimony as given by tbe plaintiff, you will consider what number of tons of ocbre was delivered under the agreement, and tbe evidence is that tbe weight of tbe ochre was ascertained just as tbe ocbre lay there at tbe ocbre factory of Mr. Regen. There is some testimony to tbe effect that the ochre was damp, and that by reason of this dampness or moist condition at that time, that when tbe ochre was ground, barreled and put in shape for shipment, there was a loss of weight; because tbe ocbre that was to be barreled, was necessarily to be barreled in a proper condition. Now, in this cause, so far as the court can ascertain, tbe proportion which ocbre is supposed to lose in tbe process of drying, grinding and barreling was not ascertained; and it is for the jury to find whether under this contract the weight of tbe 272 tons of ocbre was diminished, and if so, to what extent. And if the theory of tbe plaintiff be correct, for whatever number of tons of ochre the jury should find of tbe nature and character delivered under this contract or agreement, whatever that amount shall be, you multiply that amount by $3 a ton, and tbe verdict <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>will be for that amount with interest from the 24th of November, 1885.] 4</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[257,470,1185,1641]]]'>The plaintiff says that the ore or ochre was floated just as it lay at the ochre factory. You have heard the testimony given as to the nature and character of this floating; that when the clay, called ochre or ore, or whatever you choose to call it, is dug out of the ground, it is mixed with water, and the heavy particles of this ore, whatever it may consist of, stone and flint substances and so forth, in that ochre, fall down, the ochre floating on the top of the water, and that is floated off into a place where the ochre on the top of the water can settle, and the water being drawn off, that forms what I understand in this case to be the first floating of ochre.. And the plaintiff contends that all he was required to furnish was this first floated ochre. There is nothing said in this agreement as to whether the ochre shall be a first float or a second float. There is some discrepancy with regard to this agreement. If the written agreement stood by itself, it would, call on Michael Regen to deliver 300 tons of the ochre lying there at the ochre factory at Topton, to be ground, floated and barreled and delivered. According to Regen’s interpretation of this agreement it was otherwise; he says there was nothing said about the floating. When Long was upon the stand he contended that it had been represented as floated already. Now, if these representations were made, or if this was floated already, and the parties understood it to mean that kind of floating, then the jury will ascertain the quantity or number of tons. I may also say here that this ochre in any theory of the case was to bg delivered on the cars, and the evidence is that the weight was to be determined as of the weight at the cars. You will take that into consideration and ascertain under the rules I have given what the weight of the ochre delivered at the cars, under the plaintiff’s interpretation of the agreement, was, that he is contending for in his testimony, and render your verdict accordingly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[257,2118,1179,301]],["BL_433.1",433,[149,357,1185,1699]]]'>Now the defendants.come into court, and say that they were deceived in the matter of floating; that it was represented to them that the ochre had already been floated, and that it became necessary subsequently to refloat it; he says it had not been floated at all. I believe Mr. Weiler said it had not been floated at all, but Mr. Romig, who was called by the defendant, <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>says it had been floated, and he designated this as the first floating of ochre. Now, if this ochre was to be refloated, and its weight was subsequently determined at the cars, the weight of that ochre thus refloated, according to the evidence in this cause, as given by Long and one of the other witnesses, was about 138 tons, or 132 tons and 1,970 pounds weight; we call it 133 tons; and if that was the real weight, and should be accepted as such, as the real weight at the place of shipment under the plaintiff’s interpretation of his contract, then the net price he would be entitled to would be 133 times $3.00, or $399.00 with interest from November 24th, 1885. But the defence go further than that; they claim that it was necessary to refloat it; that that was a part of the contract; that, instead of. being limited to $5.00 as the cost per ton under this agreement, the actual agreement made between Regen and Long was that Long should assume the preparation, and the barreling, and the hauling, and the delivery for shipment, and whatever it cost, that that Regen was to pay. And the defendants contend that the cost of re-preparing this ochre for market, hauling and refloating and so forth, amounted to $1,392.06, and that, inasmuch as under their contract they were to pay to the plaintiff only $8.00 a ton, or the sum of $1,063.88, that it actually cost them $328.18 more than they contracted to pay Regen. In other words, that the defendants were out of pocket in the transaction, and that the defendants would, in strict point of law, be entitled to a verdict for $328.18. But they do not in this suit ask for a verdict of $328.18, but simply for the defendants generally. If that were the contract, then your verdict would be for the defendants generally. In the consideration of this case you will take into account everything that has been said by these parties, by these witnesses. There is considerable contradiction in the evidence; that the jury will endeavor to reconcile as best they can.....</p>

The plaintiff testifies that the ochre had already been floated, that he sold it as it was — “just as it stood” — and that it simply remained for him to grind, barrel and deliver it on the cars.

To this the plaintiff replied, however, that in the respect of its purity, he sold the ochre “ just as it stood; ” that in refloating it, much of the material was lost; that the defendants, by this process, had obtained a finer and a purer article than he agreed to sell; and that therefore the weight at the time of shipment furnished no proof of the weight of the ochre covered by his contract.</p>

On this branch of the case, the learned court instructed the jury, in the plainest manner, that there was evidence that the ochre was damp and moist, when delivered at Topton, and that, as it was of course to be barreled in proper condition, it was for the jury to determine to what extent its weight would be diminished when dry; on the other hand, if they accepted the defendants’ theory of the case, then as the ochre had to be refloated, its weight at the place of shipment must be taken, and they should find their verdict accordingly. The testimony was contradictory.
