Upon the death of the widow partition was made of these three tracts, and the <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>tract containing the ore-bed above mentioned fell to the lot of John. John subsequently died leaving a widow and three children, who succeeded to his title to the ore-bed, and are the real defendants in the present bill. The purpose of the bill is to obtain a decree that the defendants pay to the plaintiff, who is the “ daughter Catherine ” mentioned in the will, $1,100, with interest, the $1,100 representing eleven years of alleged arrearages from 1876 to 1886 inclusive, in the payment of the $100, which the testator directs to be “ paid annually ” out of the proceeds of the rent of the ore-bed. The learned master has recommended such a decree, and in so doing, we think, has committed error.</p>

It is not for us to question the wisdom of such a bequest as this, nor does it lie in the mouth of the plaintiff to complain of its terms. True, both Abraham and Rachel might die,' as Abraham did die, without forming any opinion on the subject; or they might, if living, arbitrarily refuse to form an opinion, and in either case the bequest would fall. But the testator’s bounty was his own and he could annex his own conditions to it. He might have withheld it altogether and plaintiff would have had no just ground of complaint, and she has just as little ground to complain that the bequest was given on a condition that might never happen.</p>

That is as plain as words can make it. The bequest is to vest only in case the previous devise should, in the opinion of testator’s son Abraham and testator’s daughter Rachel, be insufficient. Such being the condition on which the bequest is given, it is somewhat remarkable that the present bill, whose sole purpose is to enforce payment of the bequest, contains no averment that the condition has happened. The learned master passes over this serious omission very lightly, simply saying that it is amendable, and in so doing has adopted an opinion quite prevalent in the profession, that in equity amendments of the <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>pleadings are of right at any stage in the proceedings. This is a mistake. The rule as to bills is, that “ after witnesses have been examined the court will not, unless under very special circumstances, or in consequence of some subsequent event, allow the bill to be altered or amendedStory’s Eq. PL, § 887. We do not understand that this rule has been changed by the act of May 4,1864, § 2, P. L. 775. The rule is a proper one and should be enforced. An opposite rule would but foster carelessness and tend to confusion and delay, without any corresponding good. We cheerfully concede that it is human to err. We also concede that even under our greatly simplified system of equity pleadings, mistakes may occur, even with the most careful pleaders, but when they do occur application to amend should be made at the earliest opportunity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b676-5" data-blocks='[["BL_676.5",676,[279,1146,1177,651]]]'>But, even if bills were amendable as a matter of course at any stage in the proceedings, it would not help the plaintiff, for in the case in hand there is nothing to amend by. There is no evidence to indicate that either Rachel or Abraham ever in fact formed an opinion as to the insufficiency of the devise. The only evidence on the subject is to be found in the testimony of Rachel herself, delivered four years after bill brought, and all that she says is, that she “knew that Catherine needs the $100 named in the will.” Upon this testimony alone, although Rachel does not say when she acquired her knowledge, and although there is no pretence that it was ever communicated to defendants, the learned master recommends the decree referred to above.</p>

Piad a demand in legal form been made on the defendants in 1876, it is fair to presume that they could have easily paid the $100, as the will directs, that is “annually;” whilst, if we adopt the decree recommended by the master, it might result in sweeping away their entire inheritance, and this through no fault of theirs. In the face of such a result, it is idle to talk about the plaintiff’s legal rights, if she has any, as we think she has not. But concede, for the sake of the argument, that the plaintiff was under no legal duty to make a prior demand. It is <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>enough, for our present purpose that she was under a moral duty so to do, and not having done so we think she has no standing in court. Plaintiff must remember that" she is in a court of equity seeking equitable relief, and that whoever comes into a court of equity must come with clean hands. “ It is not alone fraud or illegality which will prevent a suitor from entering a court of equity; any really unconscientious conduct, connected with thfe controversy to which he is a party, will repel him from the forum whose very foundation is good conscience : ” 1 Pomeroy’s Eq. Jur. § 404. She must also remember, that although equity follows the law, “ a court of equity will in no case allow itself to be made the instrument of injustice : ” Kerr on Injunctions, 6.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b677-5" data-blocks='[["BL_677.5",677,[129,1013,1186,1386]],["BL_678.1",678,[275,347,1175,200]]]'>In its purely legal aspect the present case presents two questions of considerable difficulty. The first has already been hinted at, whether even at law a prior demand is not necessary. The second is, whether from a fair interpretation of the whole will, it was not the intention of the testator that the $100 bequest should cease at the death of the widow. In the view taken above, it becomes unnecessary to decide these questions. I will say, however, that as to both of them the inclination of my mind is in favor of the theory of the defendants. I also agree with the learned counsel for the defendants that the $100 bequest is made a charge on lands, but I cannot agree with him that this court, sitting as a court of equity, has no jurisdiction to enforce payment of such legacies. The original jurisdiction of courts of equity over legacies charged on land is undoubted. Indeed, until the rule was changed by legislation, the jurisdiction was exclusive: Story’s Eq. Jur., § 602. By our own act, February 24, 1834, § 59, P. L. 84, similar jurisdiction is conferred on the Orphans’ Courts, and a mode is provided for enforcing the payment of such legacies. By operation of act March 21, 1806, § 13, 4 Sm. L. 332, this mode must be pursued to the exclusion of all common law remedies. The latter act, however, has no application to equitable remedies, and an examination of the cases relied on to prove that the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court to enforce legacies charged upon land is exclusive, will show that they are all cases where an attempt has heen made to enforce payment of such legacies by a common law action.

    <p id="b679-9" data-blocks='[["BL_679.10",679,[138,1687,1180,660]]]'>By the 59th section of the act of 24th February, 1834, P.

The 59th section of the act of 1834 gives a complete remedy in the Orphans’ Court, and was evidently intended to exclude every other remedy and jurisdiction. That this is so as to common law remedies is admitted. Such result necessarily follows from the act of March 21, 1806, 4 Sm. L. 332, which provides that “ in all cases where a remedy is provided, or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any act or acts of assembly of this commonwealth, the directions of said act shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted, or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases, further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.” The learned judge below, however, held that this did not interfere with the jurisdiction of equity, and that a bill may still, be filed in the Common Pleas to enforce the payment of a legacy charged upon land.</p>
    <p id="b680-5" data-blocks='[["BL_680.5",680,[262,1380,1181,968]]]'>This is a narrow view of the act of 1806. Of what possible use is a bill in equity where an act of assembly has given a convenient and adequate remedy ? The very corner-stone of equity jurisdiction is that a wrong exists for which no adequate remedy has been provided, and which the law fails to correct by reason of its universality. Our books are full of cases in which it has been held that where a remedy has been provided by act of assembly, equity has no jurisdiction. Thus it has been held that a bill in equity will not lie against an incorporated company where the act incorporating such company gives a remedy by a proceeding for the assessment of damages, and that such remedy must be pursued: Stump’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20Leg.%20Int.%20205" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="38 Leg. Int. 205">38 Leg. Int. 205</a>. "VVe have innumerable decisions to the effect that in all such cases the remedy must be pursued. So, indeed, we have an act of assembly to that effect, the act of 1806: Spangler’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/64/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="64 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1021242" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0387-01">64 Pa. 387</a>.

The books are full of such cases, and the practice continued long after the act of 1834 was passed. As was remarked by Justice Coulter in Strickler v. Sheaffer, <a href="/pa/5/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="953522" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0240-01">5 Pa. 240</a>: “ Such is the tenacity, however, of customs and forms, in their hold upon the mind, that the old practice still lingered and lingers in some parts of the state.” These cases were invariably reversed when they reached this court. Some little of this tenacity for old forms and customs must still exist, if we may judge from the frequency with which uncertain remedies are resorted to where a certain, convenient, and adequate one is given by an act of assembly. The filing of this bill, however, cannot be said to be a result of clinging to old forms, as I have no knowledge of such a bill having been filed in this state before; certainly none such has been called to our attention. The learned master below, in his labored argument to sustain the jurisdiction of the equity side of the Common Pleas, cites no such case. He places his opinion mainly upon the ground that this is a testamentary trust. The will undoubtedly creates a charge upon the land. A ground-rent and a mortgage are respectively a charge upon real estate. Whether the will of the testator creates a testamentary trust is a subject foreign to this inquiry. The jurisdiction of the Common Pleas cannot be sustained upon this ground.</p>
