Testator contemplated each would leave children surviving, for he provides that upon the death of either, his or her children should share with the survivor in one half part of the income. His intention is also clear that the trust should continue until the death of the survivor of his brother, for she is entitled to the one half share of its income and profits, not to the income and profits of one half of the fund. Therefore, no distribution can be made of the trust fund.</p>

There is, therefore, no alternative but to hold, as to this one half of the income, the testator died intestate, and it must hereafter be paid to his heirs at law. And as it appears he died without issue,.one half is payable to Ms widow or her executor, she being now deceased, and one half to testator’s heirs and next of kin, according to our intestate law.

      <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>Because there is a present intestacy as to one half of the income arising from the fund embraced in the account, and because there will be an intestacy as to one half of the principal, it does not follow that distribution to this extent can now be made of the principal. The testator has in express terms deferred the time -for such distribution until the death of the survivor of the two persons to whom he gave the income for life ; at the death of either, one half the income going to the survivor and the other half to the children and issue of the one so dying. The survivor is entitled to the benefit of the investment of the whole fund in order that she may be secure in the receipt of half of the income. The gift is not of the income of one half, but of one half of the whole, and the case falls within the principle of Wilen’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="454244" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0121-01">105 Pa. 121</a>. This right on the part of the survivor is not affected by the fact that the death of her co-tenant for life without issue has left one half the income to pass under the intestate laws. The persons claiming by reason of the intestacy have no more right to demand distribution before the time fixed by the testator than the children of the deceased cestui que trust would have had. The will of the testator cannot be disregarded so long as it violates no rule of law, and the trust which it creates has a manifest and legitimate purpose.</p>
