Barnes by his employees, was engaged in opening a trench for a drainpipe from the street across the pavement to the front of Lyon’s store, at No. 2226 on the west side of North Front street. About 10:30 A. M. the trench was dug from the car-track to the curb, and from the curb to within 3 ft. 7 in. of the store. At that hour Mrs. Sowden with her sister, Mrs. Burns, were walking southwards on the west side of Front street, and stopped at the north bulk window of the store. Mrs. Burns after a moment passed on to the south window and calling Mrs. Sowden’s attention, the latter stepped rather backwards, continuing to look in at the window she left, and fell into the end of the trench and was injured.

It is not the duty of such a person, either public or private in his relations to the work, to build a wall around the excavation so that it would be impossible for a person to stumble or <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>fall into it or to climb over it. All that any person engaged in such 'work is bound to do under such circumstances, is to do that which in view of the ordinary uses of the highway would be sufficient, that is, provide a sufficient warning to those who are using the highway.</p>

He has just as good a ground to appeal to you, in case you believe upon the whole case that the evidence shows he was not negligent, or shows that the plaintiff was negligent, and ask you to find a verdict in his favor as the plaintiff has, if the facts are otherwise upon the evidence, to ask you to find a verdict in her favor.....</p>

If he did, that is an end of the case, and your verdict must be for the defendant. What more ought he to have done? ■ It is said here that he should have put up a rail alongside of that trench. Now, if you are of the opinion or belief, upon the evidence, that he put a pile of dirt there in the neighborhood of three feet high, of what use would a rail have been? If you believe that he did that, that he put along the whole length of the north side of that trench, practically, or very near to the end of it, by reason of the excavation and throwing out of the dirt from the pit, a pile of dirt in the neighborhood of three feet high, what more ought he to have done? Was not that all that was reasonably requisite to warn any person who was using the highway in a proper manner? Was he bound to consider that any other obligation than that was resting upon him? Was there any disregard of the rights of the public, of persons using the highway, if he did so much? . . .</p>

Persons who walk along the footways or cross the streets of our city are bound to use their own faculties. They are bound to use their eyes and their hearing. You and I would have no right to walk along the footways of the city with our eyes closed, and then, if we stumbled into a trench, attempt to hold the city, or any person who might be doing such work, responsible for a broken leg.

The plaintiff says she stepped off from the cellar door, which was elevated only slightly above the level of the pavement, two or three inches, according to the testimony, took one step, and then stepped off the end of this trench into it, and received the injury which followed.

The evidence of some of the defendant’s witnesses is that when she was first taken out she said with an exclamation as to the nature of her injury, “ Oh! it was all my own fault; I was not looking where I was. going.” She says she does not remember saying that, and her sister says she does not remember that she said it, but there is the evidence of several witnesses who were and are apparently disinterested to the effect that she did say that.</p>

She probably was in such a state of excitement, but if she made the remark, would the state of excitement account for such a remark, if that was not the conviction of her own mind at the time ? It has been argued to you if she had come here and said upon the stand, “ That was my own fault; I did not look where I was going, and I met my injury in consequence,” that would be and ought to be the end of the case, and the court would dispose of the case very quickly on such testimony ; but it is my duty in this trial to leave the evidence to you, and I do it with full confidence that you will apply the principles of law which I have stated, and which you ought and are bound to do under your oaths.

    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[157,712,1193,1285]]]'>On the 30th of November, 1886, Barnes, with three laborers, began at eight o’clock A. M. to dig a trench from the sewer in the street to the premises at No. 2226 North Front street, Philadelphia, for the purpose of making connection with the sewer. At half-past ten the trench had been opened from the car track in the street to the curb, and from the curb across the footwalk towards the store about eight feet, leaving a passage of about four feet wide between the end of the excavation and the house line. The earth was thrown up on the north side of the trench, making a bank of loose dirt three feet high and five feet broad at its base, extending its whole length, except that the bank sloped down to the walk at the inner end. On the outside of this bank a hand-cart and some of the tools used in digging had been left. Mrs. Sowden and her sister Mrs. Burns were coming down the footwalk towards No. 2226. The bank of earth, extending for eight feet into the walk, and more than half as high as their heads, was directly before them. They passed up to the store windows on the unbroken strip of walk next the building, and Mrs. Burns passed beyond the ditch to the southernmost window. Mrs. Sowden stopped in front of the northernmost window opposite the end of the trench. When she left the window, instead of going forward to where Mrs. Burns stood, she took two or three steps backward and fell into the trench. This action is brought to recover damages for an injury sustained from this fall.</p>

There was not a particle of conflict in the testimony or of uncertainty as to the actual facts. The plaintiff’s case depended on whether upon the ascertained facts she had a right under the law to charge her injuries over to-the defendant. This raised two questions: first, Had the <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>defendant used sufficient care to protect the public from the excavation? and, next, Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence ?</p>

Whatever want of care might be charged to him so far as the unprotected side of the trench is concerned, he had certainly fortified the side on which Mrs. Sowden was approaching very thoroughly. She was coming directly towards the bank of earth which had been thrown up in the process of digging. In the language employed by this court in the City of Erie v. Magill, <a href="/pa/101/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="101 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="500870" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0616-01">101 Pa. 616</a>, “ it was conspicuous both as to its extent and character, and necessarily obtruded itself upon the attention of every passer along the walk.” It was impossible to overlook it, for it stretched across the walk to within four feet of the building, and it was necessary to go close to the inner edge of the walk in order to get around it. The plaintiff had accomplished this, and stopped at the store window opposite the end of the trench. The exercise of the slightest care would have prevented the fall of which she complains. Upon these facts the court was called upon to say whether the defendant had taken sufficient precautions to protect one coming from the north against falling into the trench, and if this was in any doubt, whether the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. There was no legal presumption of negligence to take the place of proof and carry this case to the jury, but the plaintiff had to establish her right to recover. If on the uncontradicted evidence she failed to show negligence on the part of defendant, or showed herself guilty of contributory negligence, it was the duty of the judge to give a binding instruction: Hoag v.

The result may be that a defendant is compelled to pay for the folly of the plaintiff for no better reason than that he is able to pay and the plaintiff needs the money. True kindness, even to impecunious and unfortunate suitors, requires an impartial and uniform application of legal rules in the trial of causes. This case is one in which a binding instruction should have been given. The plaintiff came in open daylight down the walk in full view of an obstruction three or four feet high stretching across the pavement almost to the house line. She could not fail to see it. She went around it safely, became interested in some goods displayed in a window, and backed into the trench. A clearer case of contributory negligence it would be hard to find.</p>
