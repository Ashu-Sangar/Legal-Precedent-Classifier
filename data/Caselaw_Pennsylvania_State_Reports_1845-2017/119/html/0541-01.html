That is not the test of • liability. Who-are to be liable is fixed by the phrase, “ municipal and other corporations invested with the privilege of taking private property for public use.” The clause was directed against every individual or corporation possessing this power of the commonwealth to take private property for public use. Neither a corporation nor an individual should ever thereafter claim the commonwealth’s immunity from liability as a protection from making just compensation to parties injured by their acts. The mere acquisition of property could do no damage. The law already sufficiently protected the citizen against the taking of his property.

This was an immunity enjoyed by corporations and not by individuals. Cases of great hardship soon arose. O’Connor v.

I have selected this one as an illustration of the principle, and as perhaps one of the. most striking. In all of them, however, there was an injury to the property of the plaintiff in consequence of the erection or construction of the works of the corporation, as by the change of <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>grade in O’Connor v.

The constitution, since 1790, had declared that the property of the citizen should not be taken or applied to public use without just compensation. The constitution of 1874 went further, and declared not only that it shall not be taken but also that it shall not be injured or destroyed by corporations in the construction or enlargement of their works, without making compensation, etc. etc. There is no ambiguity in this language. We have applied it several times to cases arising under it without the least difficulty.

By the act of April 14, 1853, applying to the Reading Water Company, it was provided that where the corporation permanently appropriated to its use such springs or streams as it might select for water purposes, compensation should be made to the owners for damages sustained. In an action against the city by a riparian owner whose stream had been diverted, we held, not only that the action could be sustained under the above act of 1853, but also that it could be maintained under section 8 of article XVI. of the constitution.

As was well observed by our brother Gordon, in the Penn. R. Co. v.

For establishments which involve danger, such as powder-mills; injuries to health, such as lead-works, and manufactories of various kinds, which involve noise and disturbance to neighbors, a man must seek a secluded place, where as few persons may be inconvenienced as possible.

Then followed the constitutional guaranty of the people themselves, substantially re-ordained in 1838, prohibiting their representatives from investing “ any corporate body or individual with the privilege of taking private property for public use without requiring such corporation or individual to make compensation to the owner or owners of said property, or give adequate security therefor, before such property shall be taken: ” Const. 1838, article VII., section 4. In the absence of special charter obligation or legislative provision more comprehensive and stringent than the section just quoted, corporations were not liable for anything short of an actual taking. In other words, without such taldng they were never liable, under that section, for what are termed consequential damages. Cases of extreme hardship arose in which private property, no portion of which was taken, was greatly damaged in consequence of the lawful exercise of corporate authority delegated for public purposes. Monongahela Navigation Co. v. Coons, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 101" data-case-ids="480106" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0101-01">6 W. &amp; S. 101</a>, and O’Connor v.

In the former, the company, under legislative authority, constructed dams in the Monongahela river, one of which caused backwater for several miles, in a tributary of that river, and greatly injured Coons’ mill located thereon. This court, reversing the judgment obtained by him for the damages, said: “The plaintiff’s mill was not taken or applied, in any legitimate sense, by the state or by the company invested with its power, nor can it be said that he was deprived of it......The state is not bound beyond her will to pay for property which she has not taken to herself for public use.” Subsequently, however, the legislature provided a remedy under which the owner of the mill was compensated for the damages resulting from the construction and maintenance¡of the dam: Mon.

Chief Justice Gibson declaring “ it is inequitable to injure the property of an individual for the benefit of the many,” and suggesting that the legislature should provide a remedy, said: “ To attain complete justice every damage to private property ought to be compensated by the state or corporation that occasions it, and a general statutory remedy ought to be provided to assess the value. The constitutional provision for the case of private property taken for public use extends not to the case of property .injured or destroyed; but it follows not that the omission may not be supplied by ordinary legislation. No property is taken in this instance ; but the cutting down of the street consequent on the reduction of its grade left the building useless and the ground on which it stood worth no more than the expense of sinking the surface of it to a common level. The loss to the congregation is a total one, while the gain to the property-holders in the neighborhood is immense.

It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their motto should be, obsta principiis.”</p>

In Buckwalter v. Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/38/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="38 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="994082" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0281-01">38 Pa. 281</a>, the company’s charter provided that if the bridge was located “ within half a mile ” of Buckwalter’s ferry, referees should be chosen “to assess the damages which said Buckwalter may sustain by reason of the erection of said bridge.” The referees found that the ferry would “be depreciated by reason of the erection of said bridge, as proposed, within half a mile of said ferry, by diversion of the travel thereupon,” and they accordingly assessed the damages at $1,200. The award was excepted to and set aside because “ diversion and loss of travel” were not such an injury as is contemplated •by the words of the charter; but, this court sustained the construction given by the referees to' the words, “ by reason of the erection of said bridge,” and reinstated the award, holding that these words comprehended the purpose for which the <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>bridge was erected and the nse intended to be made of it, and hence the owner of the ferry was entitled to compensation for the depreciation of his ferry resulting from the diversion of travel from it to the bridge.</p>
    <p id="b599-4" data-blocks='[["BL_599.5",599,[157,540,1181,405]]]'>If the court had been disposed to stick in the bark and adopt a narrow but perhaps literal construction of the bridge company’s charter, it might have impaled the ferryman on a very sharp point, by holding that the words of the charter meant damages resulting solely from the erection of the bridge, and not from the use of it after it was erected, but such a construction would have been manifestly erroneous and unjust.</p>
    <p id="b599-5" data-blocks='[["BL_599.6",599,[158,953,1180,1438]],["BL_600.1",600,[263,345,1177,187]]]'>Again, in Lycoming Gas and Water Co. v. Moyer, <a href="/pa/99/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="99 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="446037" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0615-01">99 Pa. 615</a>, the charter provided that, “if in the location of said works an injury shall be done to private property and the parties cannot agree,” viewers shall be appointed, etc. The company having located its works with the view of utilizing, in part, the water of a certain stream, whereby, when the works were put in operation, the flow of water from the stream through a mill-race below was considerably diminished, it was held that the owner of the mill-race, though not injured by the location of the works, strictly considered, was nevertheless within the protection of the obligation of the company to make compensation for injury to private property done “in the location of” its works, and therefore entitled to damages for the injury he had suffered, and would thereafter sustain, by the diminution of flow in his race, estimated on the footing of the continuing and permanent use to which part of the water of the stream was intended to be applied. Authorities, of like import, might be multiplied almost indefinitely, showing conclusively that remedial statutes intended to protect private rights, are never narrowly and literally, but always liberally construed, so as to effectuate the object intended; but those already cited must suffice. The rule of construction for which I contend is distinctly recognized by our brother Paxson in the very recent case of Chester County v. Brower, <a href="/pa/117/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="117 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="555836" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0647-01">117 Pa. 647</a>, wherein, referring to the same section now under consideration, he says: “ The language of the constitution is to be construed liberally, so as to carry out and not defeat the purpose for which it was adopted.” If the slightest degree of that liber<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>ality had been exercised in this case, the plaintiff below, damaged to the extent of nearly 15,000 as established by the verdict of the jury, could not have been turned out of court without a cent.</p>
    <p id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[260,551,1181,1121]]]'>In the opinion of the majority, in this case, the question is suggested: “ Whether in case a natural person were the owner of this road and were operating it in the manner that the defendant company are now doing, he would be responsible to plaintiff for damages?” and it is promptly answered in the negative, “ for the reason.....that he would have a right to the reasonable use and enjoyment of his property, and if in such use, without negligence or malice, a loss unavoidably falls upon his neighbor, he is not liable in damages therefor.” This is a broad and sweeping proposition; and, in view of the established facts of this case, I venture, with great respect and deference, to suggest that it is as unsound' as it is broad. If a private person can acquire control of property on one side of a populous street, in the heart of a city, and so use it, for an extraordinary purpose, as to permanently damage property on the opposite side of the street to the extent of 30 to 40 per cent, of its market value, and not be liable, the maxim, Sic utere tuo ut alieno non laedas, is practically obsolete and the law of nuisances must be modified accordingly: Pollock on Torts, 330; Wood on Nuisances, 577, 584, 603, 679, 693; Pottstown Gas Co. v. Murphy, <a href="/pa/39/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="39 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="996262" data-case-paths="/pa/39/0257-01">39 Pa. 257</a>; Bridge Co. v. Guisse et al., <a href="/njl/35/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="35 N.J.L. 558" data-case-ids="386206" data-case-paths="/njl/35/0558-01">35 N. J. L. 558</a>, 564.</p>
    <p id="b600-8" data-blocks='[["BL_600.6",600,[256,1683,1183,713]]]'>Conceding, for argument’s sake, that the word injury, or <em>“ </em>injured,” as used in the constitution, means “ such a legal injury as would be the subject of an action for damages at common law,” and that “ for such injuries both corporations and individuals now stand upon the same plane of responsibility,” it is very clear that the facts of this case, as established by the verdict, unquestionably furnish the grounds for such an action ; and if it were not for the authority, vested in the railroad company by the legislature, to do the acts complained of, for the public benefit, such action would undoubtedly lie against it. But, as we have seen, the company’s warrant to do these acts is coupled with the obligation to make compensation for the injuries resulting therefrom; and hence it should be required to do so.</p>
    <p id="b601-4" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[161,356,1182,923]]]'>
      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>The argumentan ab' inconvenienti, that if the Filbert street property owners were permitted to recover, the door would be thrown wide open to every property owner, at every point of the compass, and “as far as the whistle of the locomotive can be heard or its smoke can be carried,” to bring suit for damages, is more imaginary than real; and it may be answered by the fact that the road has been completed and in operation for about seven years, and no such suits have ever been heard of, nor is it likely that they ever will be, because under our recent ruling in O’Brien v. Railroad Co., supra., all such actions are now barred by lapse of time. But, if it were otherwise, what have such considerations to do with the construction of a clause in the constitution ? Surely it is not to be so construed as to exclude meritorious claimants who are within its protection, because possibly the number of claimants might happen to be undesirably large. It is well settled, moreover, that there never can be any recovery for remote, uncertain, and speculative damages.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[160,1287,1180,302]]]'>This contention involves other matters worthy of special notice, but want of time precludes their consideration at present. Enough has been said, however, to show that the departure, as I regard it, in Penn. R. Co. v. Lippincott and others, was a mistake that ought to be promptly corrected ; and I would therefore unhesitatingly affirm this judgment.'</p>
