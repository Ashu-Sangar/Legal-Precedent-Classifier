They do not decide that where a will is contested and set aside on an issue devisavit vel non, the final decree hi such issue is conclusive evidence of the invalidity of the instrument.

To sustain the verdict in this case, it must be held, not only that the judgment on the issue was conclusive as to all parties in being, but, further, that it was final and conclusive as to persons not in being so as effectually to destroy their contingent remainders. This would be a broad construction of an act which it is very doubtful whether it was intended to be more than a mere act of limitation.</p>

There are devisees for life under the alleged will of John B. McCay, with remainder to their unborn children. John and Emma, plaintiffs in error and the life tenants, are unmarried and without issue. The remainder is contingent upon their marriage and leaving issue surviving them. Such a remainder can only exist where it has a particular estate to support it. With the destruction of the particular estate the contingent remainder necessarily falls. It would be as easy to support a house by its roof as to support a contingent remainder without a particular estate. We need go no further than Blackstone for this. He says, and every student at law will remember it: “It is a well settled principle of law, that no contingent remainder can exist without a particular estate to support it.” The umbilical cord from which a contingent remainder draws its feeble life is very slight, and when this is taken away it drops into the grave. Something like this was said in Lyle v. Richards, 9 S. &amp; R. 322.</p>
