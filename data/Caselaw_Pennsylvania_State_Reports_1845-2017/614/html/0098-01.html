The trial court observed that the first category of NIED, involving a preexisting fiduciary or contractual relationship, has only been recognized in two Pennsylvania appellate court cases. The court first reviewed <em>Crivellaro, </em>in which a plaintiff claimed that she was wrongly subjected to thirty-three days of an intensive and abusive alcohol and drug detoxification program on threat of termination from her employer. Crivellaro claimed that she suffered physical symptoms resulting from emotional distress allegedly caused by the negligent operation of the detoxification program that the defendant-employer ordered her to attend. The trial court in the case at bar noted that the Superior Court in <em>Crivellaro </em>found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged a duty, a breach, and a causal connection between the alleged breach and the plaintiffs injuries, and reversed the prior order sustaining the preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer.</p>

The court concluded that “[it is] entirely foreseeable that under the circumstances as alleged, [Plaintiff] would suffer traumatic emotional distress during the birth of her son.” <em>Id. </em>at 199. Relying on prior Superior Court caselaw, the court also concluded that Plaintiff could meet the physical injury element of <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>NIED without demonstrating physical impact, so long as the emotional distress caused physical symptoms, as Plaintiff averred in this case.

The Superior Court in <em>Brown </em>remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment notwithstanding the jury’s verdict, concluding that the erroneous syphilis report was not a substantial factor causing the harm suffered by the plaintiffs.

Likewise, under the zone of danger theory of NIED liability, we have recognized that others who are almost injured by the same car accident may also suffer real and compensable emotional distress even if they are not physically struck. Similarly, it is beyond cavil that parents who witness the severe injury to their child in this hypothetical accident also suffer genuine emotional distress, as acknowledged by the bystander theory of liability. However, parents who do not witness the accident will also suffer emotional distress when they learn of their child’s injuries, as will family friends, teachers, and neighbors; yet we have decided that such emotional distress is not compensable, in part because we must draw lines to prevent unlimited liability to an unlimited number of plaintiffs, notwithstanding the commission of negligent acts.</p>

We recognize that the lower courts have used the phrase "contractual or fiduciary duty" as a term of art to describe this category of NIED cases. We find this nomenclature problematic as it uses an essential element of a negligence action, duty, as a designation for the limiting requirement of a distinct category of NIED claims. As will be extensively discussed herein, we initially required the tortfeasor to impact the victim physically to justify recovery for NIED ("impact rule”). Thereafter, the requirements to state a NIED claim expanded to allow the victim to be in close proximity of physical impact ("zone of impact liability”), and then to permit recovery if the victim personally witnessed a tortfeasor physically impact a close relative ("bystander liability”). These represent three distinct variations of NIED claims; the phrase "contractual or fiduciary duty” presents a potential fourth variation. As developed more fully in this opinion, we would hold that if an actor has a particular contractual or fiduciary relationship with a victim and it is foreseeable that the actor’s carelessness could cause severe emotional harm to the victim, and that harm occurs, a cognizable tort arises which is, in short-form, referred to as a breach of a "contractual or fiduciary duty” not to inflict foreseeable emotional distress upon a victim. For purposes of this opinion, we will substitute the term “relationship” for "duty,” where possible, in our description of the development of the cause of action, but will otherwise adhere to what we view as an imprecise description of this fourth category of NIED torts.</p>
