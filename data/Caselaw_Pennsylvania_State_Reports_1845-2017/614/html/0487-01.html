Appellant raises a single claim of error related to the penalty phase of his trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction and judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b532-9" data-blocks='[["BL_532.8",532,[271,1173,1150,563]]]'>Appellant was charged with a single count of criminal homicide, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of burglary, criminal trespass, receiving stolen property, and theft by unlawful taking, in connection with the stabbing death of Beverly Yohn. The Commonwealth issued a notice to appellant that it would be seeking the death penalty based on the aggravating factors that the killing occurred while in the perpetration of a felony (criminal trespass), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and at the time of the killing, appellant was subject to a court order restricting his behavior towards the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(18).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

In the Fall of 2003, one of Ms. Yohn’s friends observed injuries to Ms. Yohn. In late January of 2004, Ms. Yohn called the police alleging that appellant had struck her. After the incident, Ms. Yohn filed a Protection From Abuse (“PFA”) petition against appellant and on January 27, 2004 a temporary PFA order was entered against him. Subsequently, a <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>PFA hearing was held on February 19, 2004 (before Judge Doyle).

Appellant also told the bartender that he gave Ms. Yohn “forty thousand dollars ($40,000) for a house and now he can’t live in the house,” but stated it “will be taken care of.” N.T., 4/27/2006, at 134-136.</p>

At that time Ms. Yohn was staying at her mother’s residence with her three sons. Ms. Yohn’s son, Justin, was outside the residence starting a car in order for his mother to drive him to school. Penny Lantz, Justin’s grandmother, had earlier left the house for work. Justin saw appellant run up to the residence. Appellant put his finger to his lips, indicating that Justin was to be quiet. Appellant then entered a rear porch and kicked in the back door. Justin saw appellant come out a short time later, whereupon appellant threw Justin from the car and drove away in it.

Jeremy saw his mother lock the back door and, shortly thereafter, saw appellant kick in the back door and enter the kitchen. Jeremy testified that appellant opened his jacket and pulled out a knife with his left hand. Immediately after pulling out the knife, appellant began stabbing Ms. Yohn until she fell to the floor.

He admitted that he stabbed Ms. Yohn, and caused her death, but denied that he had gone to the residence with the intent to harm her. Instead, he claimed that it was Ms. Yohn who had the knife in her hand and began “swinging at him”; the next thing he remembered was seeing Ms. Yohn with blood coming out of her mouth.

Following the penalty phase of trial, the jury found both aggravating circumstances and found four mitigating circumstances under the “catchall” mitigator at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8) — appellant’s childhood circumstances, his polysubstance abuse, his medical history, and his potential for good. The jury further found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and returned a sentence of death. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). The sentence of death was formally imposed by Judge Doyle on June 1, 2006. The trial court sentenced appellant further to forty-eight to ninety-six months of imprisonment for burglary and a consecutive term of twelve to twenty-four months for theft by unlawful taking.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In order to prove first-degree murder, the Commonwealth must establish that: (1) a human being was killed; (2) the accused caused the death; and (3) the accused <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>acted with malice and specific intent to kill.

The murder was witnessed by Ms. Yohn’s son Jeremy; at trial, appellant admitted to stabbing Ms. Yohn; and the Commonwealth’s forensic expert testified that her death resulted from the stabbing and that the manner of her death was homicide. N.T., 4/27/2006, at 127. Thus, the only remaining question is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with malice and specific intent to kill.</p>
    <p id="b536-6" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[269,1095,1151,957]]]'>Jeremy Yohn testified that he saw appellant pull a knife from his coat, a fact that supports an inference that appellant went to the residence with the intent to harm Ms. Yohn, which is precisely what he did, as Jeremy bore witness to seeing appellant stab his mother multiple times. A DNA expert testified that a broken knife handle found in the kitchen contained a mixture of Ms. Yohn’s and appellant’s DNA. N.T., 4/29/06, 124-26. When Ms. Yohn was taken to the hospital, a large knife was still protruding from her back. The forensic expert called by the Commonwealth testified that Ms. Yohn was stabbed in the heart and the left jugular vein, causing her death. Based on the circumstances surrounding this killing, including appellant’s uninvited entry into the victim’s home while armed with a deadly weapon, which he proceeded to use multiple times on the victim, the jury was fully warranted in concluding that the killing was with malice and with the specific intent to kill. The record supports appellant’s conviction for first-degree murder.</p>

Appellant claims that the above evidence merely establishes that he was given notice of the order prior to the February 19th hearing. Appellant further contends that the evidence showed that he continued to meet and/or speak with Ms. Yohn.

Likewise, appellant avers that Ms. McDonough’s testimony was consistent with the fact that he was removed from their house on January 26, 2004 (during the domestic disturbance call), rather than being removed by court order. Instead, according to appellant, he continued to live in the First Avenue house and was never told to leave it.

The Commonwealth recounts much of the same testimony set forth by appellant, but draws a different conclusion from that testimony. The Commonwealth asserts that the evidence showed that appellant knew that Ms. Yohn had obtained a PFA order against him, since she told him on two separate occasions that she had done so, citing the testimony of Case and Moeller. The Commonwealth also points to the fact that appellant admitted that he hid from the Sheriff, who was attempting to serve him with the PFA order. Furthermore, the Commonwealth looks to Ms. Winfield’s testimony as evidence that appellant knew there was an order against him. Winfield’s testimony also demonstrated that appellant was told that the PFA court could refuse to withdraw the order irrespective of Ms. Yohn’s wishes. The Commonwealth avers that appellant’s conduct in fleeing from Ms. Lantz’s porch when she pretended to call the police was guilty conduct reflecting that appellant knew there was a PFA order against him. Finally, the Commonwealth points to the testimony of Ms. McDonough, the bartender of the 10th Street Café, as evidence that appellant knew of the PFA order.</p>

This Court found that the phrase was not clear and free from ambiguity, but was capable of several different meanings.

However, the evidence demonstrated that the sheriff attempted to serve appellant with the temporary PFA order, but appellant avoided that service.

In our view, the evidence, summarized above, clearly supported a jury finding that appellant had the equivalent knowledge or anecdotal knowledge of the temporary PFA order.

Finally, appellant’s conduct when the victim’s mother feigned calling the police corroborated his knowledge, or the jury could so find. Appellant was free to forward his claim of studied ignorance, but the jury was not required to accept it; and appellant’s demeanor and credibility in forwarding his claim, which the jury could assess (and an appellate court cannot recreate or second-guess), properly could factor into its conclusion.

Although appellant sets forth his argument in terms of a question of law under <em>Stallworth, </em>nothing in <em>Stallworth </em>supports such a distinction, nor are we inclined to craft one. Instead, <em>Stallworth </em>set forth the legal standard as simply being whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had actual knowledge or its equivalent of the PFA order and then applied that standard to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to present the (d)(18) <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>aggravator to the jury. As found by the trial court below, appellant’s argument here is really a challenge to the weight the jury gave his testimony regarding his belief that no final PFA order had been entered.
