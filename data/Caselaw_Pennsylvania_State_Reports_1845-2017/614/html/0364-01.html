In an attempt to conduct meaningful appellate review with the prospect of minimal disruption of the 2012 primary election process, this Court ordered accelerated briefing and oral argument. Expedition was required, as in all redistricting appeals, in part due to the compressed time frame in which to accomplish the task before the next election — particularly in an election year involving a presidential primary. However, the Court was aware at the outset that its <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>efforts at expedition were incapable of avoiding interference with the primary election season because, for reasons not addressed by the LRC, the LRC failed to adopt a Final Plan in a timeframe that offered the remote prospect of appellate review before the primary season began. The LRC’s inexplicable delay ensured that primary candidates who relied upon the 2011 Final Plan did so at their peril. As we discuss in detail <em>infra, </em>the Pennsylvania Constitution makes clear that a reapportionment plan can never have force of law until all appeals are decided, and even then, only if all challenges are dismissed. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art II, § 17(e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

The LRC’s argument that our scope of review is confined to the four corners of the Final Plan rests upon two pillars. First, the LRC argues a supposed deference due to it because reapportionment is a legislative task, and consideration of alternate plans, for any purpose, “would not only usurp the Commission’s constitutional authority to undertake the .reapportionment but, more <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>seriously, make it impossible for the Commission to ever know for certain that its plan will pass constitutional muster.” LRC Brief at 30.

It necessarily follows that the LRC cannot claim justifiable reliance upon a truncated scope of review which arises from a misreading of prior decisional law. We are also not persuaded by the LRC’s claim that its existence and task requires that we deem alternative plans to be irrelevant and beyond our scope of review. The Constitution confers upon aggrieved citizens a right of appeal, measured by substantive standards specified in the charter. Such appeals must be meaningful, not illusory.

The retention of legislative expertise is accomplished by the fact that the Constitution prescribes remand to the LRC if a Final Plan is found to be contrary to law.

Thus, school districts, religious communities, ethnic communities, geographic communities which share common bonds due to locations of rivers, mountains and highways, and a host of other “communities of interest” are routinely considered by districting bodies in order to construct fair and effective maps. Shared racial background, along with political affiliation, ethnic identity, religious affiliation, occupational background, all can converge to create bona fide communities of interest, to the extent that the redistrieting body makes an honest effort to draw lines around geographically compact groups in order to give them a voice in the governmental process.</blockquote>

Reapportionment bodies and lower courts must be cautious when it comes to this concept, particularly where it serves as a basis for creating legislative districts tied to race, because it has the potential for abuse. Specifically, it can be used as a ruse to engage in improper maximization of majority-minority districts where no real communities exist. At the same time, states have historically considered a broad range of such imprecise communities of interest (many of which are naturally intertwined) in exercising their sound discretion. They do so to satisfy constituents. They do so to sweep together a host of generally identifiable interest groups that wish to be given a unified voice. This is perfectly healthy and permissible.

We have always recognized the independent vitality of the requirements of contiguity, compactness, and the integrity of political subdivisions.

First, is the fact that this Court is the sole voice passing upon state law challenges to redistricting appeals, but our consideration has been limited to a single, mass appeal, once every ten years, and under severe time constraints which affect the litigants no less than the Court. Second, is the fact that each redistricting plan seems to generate similar citizen complaints concerning the alleged disrespect of political subdivisions, and the formation of odd and non-compact districts of disparate political subdivisions. Third, is the advent of computer technology. As is reflected in Dean Gormley’s account of the 1991 reapportionment, and as demonstrated in practice in the alternate plans produced by the <em>Holt </em>and <em>Costa </em>appel<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>lants here, this development suggests that this Court’s early establishment of the primacy of equalization of population in formulating redistricting plans (a far more difficult task before technological advancements, as the Court itself experienced in the <em>Butcher </em>appeals) may warrant reconsideration — at least respecting the degree to which population equality must be pursued, or must be deferred to as an explanation for allegations of unnecessary violence to other constitutional precepts. Fourth, and finally, our own review of our governing precedent in deciding these appeals has led us to conclude that it should be recalibrated to allow the LRC more flexibility in formulating plans, and particularly with respect to population deviation. This adjustment should allow more breathing space for concerns of contiguity, compactness, and the integrity of political subdivisions to be respected. Our prior precedent sounds in constitutional law; to the extent it is erroneous or unclear, or falls in tension with intervening developments, this Court has primary responsibility to address the circumstance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_38" id="ref_footnote_2_38">38</a>

Sims. </em>Our earliest redistricting opinions reflected an acute awareness of Pennsylvania’s obligations to respect federal law — at the same time we were construing our own organic constitutional commands. Our first decisions grappling with <em>Reynolds, </em>in the <em>Butcher </em>cases and in <em>Specter, </em>occurred when this area of federal constitutional law was both new and dynamic. Indeed, it appears that it was the very dynamism of the federal decisional law that led this Court in <em>Specter </em>to emphasize the special primacy of population equality. As we have detailed in Part V above, it appears that this Court’s approach was <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>powered by its prediction of where the U.S. Supreme Court was heading in its interpretation of <em>Reynolds. </em>Thus, the Court derived from the congressional reapportionment decisions in <em>Kirkpatrick </em>and <em>Wells </em>“that deviations from equality of population that were formerly regarded as insubstantial and permissible will now be regarded as impermissible, necessitating a closer adherence to equality of population, even in the area of state legislative reapportionment.” <em>Specter, </em><a href="/citations/?q=293%20A.2d%2015" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="293 A.2d 15">293 A.2d at 20</a>.

Notwithstanding this development, and the fact that it was argued to this Court as a basis for permitting greater deviations of population in later redistricting cases, we did not grapple with the implications of our initial prediction, and our effective “constitutionalization” of a prediction of federal law frozen in time. Instead, we continued to suggest an inflexibility respecting population deviation that was no longer required by federal law. The necessary corollary implication was that the Court was devaluing the remaining Section 16 requirements of compactness, contiguity, and political subdivision integrity. It is not necessary to recount the claims, circumstances and results; they are detailed in our summary of the governing law in Part V.</p>

To be sure, federal law remains, and that overlay still requires, as <em>Reynolds </em>taught, that equality of population is the “overriding objective.” But, as later cases from the High Court have made clear, that overriding objective does not require that reapportionment plans pursue the narrowest possible deviation, at the expense of other, legitimate state objectives, such as are reflected in our charter of government. <em>See, e.g., Gaffney, </em><a href="/us/412/0735-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="412 U.S. 735" data-case-ids="6175416" data-case-paths="/us/412/0735-01">412 U.S. at 748-49</a>, <a href="/us/412/0735-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="412 U.S. 735" data-case-ids="6175416" data-case-paths="/us/412/0735-01">93 S.Ct. 2321</a> (“Fair and effective representation ... does not depend solely on mathematical equality among district populations.

Like the U.S. Supreme Court, we do not direct a specific range for the deviation from population equality, or purport to pre-approve redistricting plans that fall within that range. Nor do we direct the LRC to develop a reapportionment plan that tests the outer limits of acceptable deviations. <em>See In re 1981 Plan, </em><a href="/pa/497/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="217" data-cite="442 A.2d 661" data-case-ids="1775284,1775330" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0524-01,/pa/497/0525-01">442 A.2d at 667</a>.

Of course, the Court was cognizant that the LRC’s timeline in adopting a Final Plan had ensured that the appeals would carry into the <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>period when nomination petitions could begin to be circulated, and that any mandate other than outright denial or dismissal of the appeals could cause disruption of that process. Therefore, the <em>per curiam </em>order also was careful to adjust the primary election schedule and, consistently with the order we entered on February 14, 1992, the last time a presidential primary occurred in a reapportionment year, we directed that petition signatures collected before our mandate issued would be deemed valid as to timeliness. <em>See </em>Order, 1/25/12 <em>(per </em>curiam). Our adjustment of the primary election calendar does not alter the discretion vested in the Commonwealth Court, which will be tasked in its original jurisdiction with hearing any objections to nominating petitions. The Election Code provides a very restrictive time schedule, specifically including a ten day cut-off for hearings and a fifteen day deadline for decisions. 25 P.S. § 2937. However, this Court recognized that appeals of this nature entail the “exercise of purely judicial functions.” <em>In re Nomination Petition of </em>Moore, <a href="/pa/447/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="220" data-cite="447 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1942999" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0526-01">447 Pa. 526</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=291%20A.2d%20531" class="citation" data-index="221" data-cite="291 A.2d 531">291 A.2d 531</a>, 534 (Pa.1972).

Rather than embrace an aggressive, bent-on-prevailing-on-every-issue approach which would have been the norm for modern litigation, the Chairman and Chief Counsel chose to provide the Court with as much information as possible so that the Court could make rational decisions----Not only was this approach meant to foster the trust of the Court, but it also reflected the belief of the Chairman himself that the Commission was acting not as a litigant in the typical sense, but as a representative of all citizens of the Commonwealth.

Notably, prior to the Constitution of 1968, the task of redistricting Pennsylvania’s legislative districts indeed fell to the General Assembly as a whole. <em>See </em>Gormley, Legislative Reapportionment, at 4-7. In practice, however, that body often failed to discharge its responsibility; indeed, it had failed to conduct a successful redistricting in over four decades. Some of this inertia may be attributed to partisan deadlock, but there is also an extent to which it simply reflected the reality that redistricting could mean some members would lose their seats. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9, 11; <a href="/pa/567/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="230" data-cite="790 A.2d 989" data-case-ids="404594,9395602" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0670-01,/a2d/790/0989-01">790 A.2d 989</a>. This legislative failure, combined with then-recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court newly interpreting the Equal Protection Clause as requiring states to address apportionment concerns along lines of population equality, and the recognition that courts were empowered to rule on such reapportionment arrangements, led the 1968 Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention to adopt a new scheme. The result was the creation of the LRC, comprised of the four leaders of the Pennsylvania House and Senate and a "neutral chairman.” The decision to constitute that hybrid body, rather than enlisting the General Assembly itself, was a deliberate one. ”[T]he [Reapportionment Committee of the Convention] avoided the creation of a purely political body. The proposed commission represented a compromise between allowing the legislature as a body to reapportion itself ..., and taking the process entirely out of the hands of that body ... which possessed the greatest expertise for this task. If this new hybrid commission failed to enact a lawful reapportionment plan within the prescribed time limits, the ultimate 'tie-breaker' would be the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, just as it had been in 1964-1966.” <em>Id. </em>at 10-11; <a href="/pa/567/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="231" data-cite="790 A.2d 989" data-case-ids="404594,9395602" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0670-01,/a2d/790/0989-01">790 A.2d 989</a>.</p>

The allocation of the burdens and the affordance of deference in the judicial review reflect the complex nature of a commission’s task and the constraints inherent in its oversight.

The complaints of the various appellants notwithstanding, it is clear that there is no perfect plan. The Majority “recalibrates” the interplay of the constitutional requirements found in Section 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In so doing, it invalidates the 2011 Final Plan, which was carefully constructed by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission (LRC) in accordance with our prior pronouncements concerning redistricting in the Commonwealth. In light of the significant public interest and exigencies of the electoral process, I believe that the Majority’s disposition is both unprecedented and unnecessary. Accordingly, I must dissent.</p>
