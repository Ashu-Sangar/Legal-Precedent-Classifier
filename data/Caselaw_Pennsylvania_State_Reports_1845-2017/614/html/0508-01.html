The court elaborated that, under the presumption, a party who denies paternity of a child born during an intact marriage has the burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the presumptive father lacked access to the mother or was incapable of procreation. <em>See id. </em>at 248, <a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">701 A.2d at 179</a>. Additionally, the court explained that the policy rationale supporting the presumption is the concern that intact marriages should not be undermined by disputes over parentage. <em>See <a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">at 249</a>, <a href="/a2d/701/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="701 A.2d 176" data-case-ids="11891736,17551" data-case-paths="/a2d/701/0176-01,/pa/549/0241-01">701 A.2d at 180</a>.</p>

We are not convinced that the marriage between [Appellant] and [H.M.M.] is irretrievably broken. We believe reconciliation is possible, particularly in light of the fact there is no divorce proceeding pending. Because the couple is merely separated, the family remains somewhat intact and equitable principles are applicable. While still applicable, the presumption of paternity has been destroyed in the minds of the parties by the knowledge of the true biological father. There is no dispute that [H.M.M.] did not father the child. [Appellant] testified at hearing that during the pregnancy, she suspected the child was not her husband’s, as she was intimate with [Appellee] around the time of conception. Subsequently, she had a DNA test done. The DNA test showed unequivocally, that husband was not the child’s father. While presumption of paternity is applicable, we also determine that [Appellant] is equitably estopped from pursuing support/paternity against [Appellee], the biological father.</blockquote>

The representation of parentage inevitably obscures the identity and whereabouts of the natural father, so that the child will be denied the love, affection and support of the natural father.

Paternity testing should then be requested at the hospital at the time of the birth of the child. The technology has advanced to the point that those types of tests should become routine and timely. If the mother’s husband makes an informed decision to be named as the father on the birth certificate, then he has, in essence, adopted the child as his own regardless of DNA, and that decision cannot be disturbed by any putative fathers outside the marriage. An informed decision to list the husband as the father on the birth certificate gives the couple a definitive way to promote the rationale currently supported by the current "intact marriage” doctrine while discouraging mothers from engaging in fraud. If however, the husband chooses not to be listed as the father on the birth certificate, then mother and her husband should have a limited period of time, perhaps a year from the birth of the child, to initiate any action against a third party putative father. Similarly, a putative father would have the same period of time from when he knew or should have known that he was a putative father in order to assert his rights in any case where the mother's husband is not listed as the father on the child's birth certificate. If no party takes legal action in the specified time frame, then, in essence, a de facto adoption has occurred by Mother's husband, and paternity by estoppel applies.</blockquote>

It has been my observation that the focus in paternity cases should be on the child, not the adults, who obviously are making choices irrespective of anyone else’s best interests, least of all the child conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair. I write to comment on two matters. First, while the Majority acknowledges the absence of “definitive legislative involvement,” Majority Opinion, at 524, 38 A.3d at 807; <em>see also id. </em>at 525-528, 38 A.3d at 808-09, I believe the General Assembly should consider creation of relevant legislation.

Following a hearing on August 5, 2010, the trial court issued an order on August 25, 2010, granting Appellee’s motion. The court reasoned that Mother was precluded from seeking child support from Appellee due to the applicability of both the presumption of paternity and the doctrine of paternity by estoppel. The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished memorandum. <em>K.E.M. v. P.C.S., </em>No. 1566 MDA 2010 (Pa.Super., filed Apr. 21, 2011). Although it concluded that the trial court erred in applying the presumption of paternity, it deemed the error harmless because the trial court also determined that Mother was es-topped from pursuing a support action against Appellee.

In 2012, in light of the accuracy of genetic testing, it is especially difficult to accept this legal fiction. Protection of the best interests of the child, however, is the ultimate goal, and the Majority clearly emphasizes this <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>fact. It is not difficult to envision the various scenarios where application of the doctrine seemingly protects children; indeed, our case law is replete with such vignettes. In reality, though, at times, the child ultimately has no father legally required to support him. <em>See, e.g., Barr v. Bartolo, </em><a href="/a2d/927/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="927 A.2d 635" data-case-ids="8398373" data-case-paths="/a2d/927/0635-01">927 A.2d 635</a> (Pa.Super.2007) (legal father evaded support obligation by proving he was not the child’s biological father, and biological father was permitted to avoid support obligation by successfully arguing the legal father was estopped from denying paternity). It is infrequent, if not rare, that a child born into such a scenario claims protection from the emotional impact of learning that the man he “knew” as his father actually is a “legal” stranger. Relatives, neighbors, and parents tell the child the truth about his parentage, the very truth that the doctrine claims to protect. The doctrine is a fiction in the law that has been in place for decades, with a sound purpose, for all of the reasons asserted by the Majority. Indeed, the Dissent’s suggestion that application of the doctrine in the instant case leads to an inequitable result by “punishing the husband for the laudable conduct of affording emotional and financial support to the child of his wife, even after he discovered that the child was not his issue,” Dissenting Opinion, (J. Baer), at 535, 38 A.3d at 814, ignores the very purpose behind paternity by estoppel. It is that very conduct by H.M.M. that the estoppel doctrine acknowledges, supports, and upholds for the sake of the child. It is that very conduct by H.M.M. that the doctrine prevents H.M.M. from avoiding since he assumed it for four years knowing that the child was not his issue. Protection of the child is paramount, and I lend my voice to those calling for the Legislature to specify factors to consider in making paternity determinations. “Such legislation ... would foster transparency and public confidence and would make trial court adjudication more flexible and more disciplined at the same time.” David N.

The August 5, 2010 hearing was brief, consuming only forty pages of notes of testimony. Mother and her minister were the only two witnesses; neither H.M.M. nor Appellee testified. Appellee argues in his brief that his relationship with Child was minimal, he was alone with Child only once, and he discouraged Mother’s efforts to have Child call him “daddy.” Thus, he contends that any relationship with Child existed only in Mother’s imagination. The meager testimony Mother presented regarding Child’s relationship with H.M.M. suggests that she and H.M.M. publicly held H.M.M. out as Child’s father despite both knowing that it was untrue. Conversely, while there indeed was some contact between Appellee and Child, it was not public acknowledgment, but private, secretive interaction.</p>

Thus, realistically speaking, the idea that the child will not discover the identity of his father seems absurd. Equally unavailing is the idea that the child will be more victimized by calling upon his biological father to support him, than he would be by forcing his mother’s husband to carry out such obligations. In my view, the only time these realities will not occur is when the mother’s husband desires to maintain and develop the parental relationship. Thus, I would adhere to the retention of paternity by estoppel in that lone circumstance.</p>

The mother’s husband, attempting to save his marriage and perhaps his family, welcomes the child into the family home, and treats the child as his own. He calls the child by endearments, and the child calls him “Daddy.” He supports the child financially and emotionally. Nevertheless, the marriage cannot be saved. For his efforts, the doctrine of paternity by estoppel imposes upon mother’s husband the obligation to support the child until he reaches adulthood. The message that is being sent to the husband who finds himself in such a predicament is clear — do not allow the child to call you “Daddy,” do not lavish any affection on the child, do not spend money on the child, and tell everyone you know that the child <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>is not yours. How does such conduct help the child, or, for that matter, assist the husband and mother in attempting to save a troubled marriage?
