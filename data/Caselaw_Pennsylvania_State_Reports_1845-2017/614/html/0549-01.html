Members of the cooperative, who are billed on a bi-monthly basis for the materials they purchase, are shareholders and part owners of the cooperative. On May 26, 1994, Morgan’s Tool &amp; Supply Co., Inc. (“MTS”), a Louisiana corporation owned and operated by John L. and Gail N. Morgan (the “Morgans”), executed a “Retailer’s Application for Membership and Membership Agreement” (“Membership Agreement”) with TruServ’s predecessor, ServiStar Corporation (“ServiStar”). The application was approved, and, on June 30, 1994, MTS was accepted as a member in the cooperative. That same year, the Morgans executed an “Unlimited Guaranty of Credit” (hereinafter “Guarantee”), by which they agreed to guarantee the debts of MTS. The Guarantee further obligated the Morgans to pay any expenses, including counsel fees and legal expenses, incurred by ServiStar in an effort to collect amounts owed by MTS and to enforce the Guarantee.</p>

On May 21, 2001, a joint motion was filed to postpone the trial due to John Morgan’s health issues. Approximately one year later, on May 13, 2002, TruServ’s counsel withdrew from the case.

Contractual interest serves the role of prejudgment interest where it has been made part and parcel of the underlying agreement; whereas a default rule of prejudgment interest is merely supplied by the judicial rules in the absence of contractual prescription.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.5",613,[163,1354,1154,685]]]'>While the decisional law favors the award of interest, in the interest of fairness, I believe the statutory rate should be applied in the absence of a clear expression of intention, in the parties’ written agreements, to specify a higher rate. <em>See generally </em>25 Williston on Contracts § 66:116 (4th ed.2011) (“Where the contract between the parties makes no provision for interest, if any is allowed, it will normally be given at the statutory or ‘legal’ rate; and the same is true where the contract ... provides for interest but does not specify the interest rate.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Presently, I do not regard the Retail Member Agreement as clearly extending the eighteen percent rate of interest into the period following its termination.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, I would hold that the statutory rate pertains in that time period.</p>

Notably, the policies favoring interest awards and the disfavor for mitigation gain some additional justification, since the defendant retains the use of the principal monies in question through the date of judgment.</p>
