We accepted review to determine whether Appellant’s sentences for these two inchoate crimes are illegal under 18 Pa.C.S. § 906, which bars multiple “convictions” for inchoate crimes “for conduct designed to ... culminate in the commission of the same crime.” After careful review of the record, we conclude that under the facts of this case, the two inchoate crimes were intended to culminate in the commission of two different crimes, and therefore Appellant’s sentence did not run afoul of Section 906.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Consequently,-we affirm the Superi- or Court.</p>

Appellant’s cell was adjacent to the cell occupied by another inmate, Frank Seretich, who was moved to this cell on December 20, 2005. The eighth floor, which is sixteen stories and 186 feet above the ground, houses the disciplinary unit, in which inmates are confined to their individual cells for twenty-three hours a day. Appellant’s and Seretich’s jail cells were designed to share an exterior panel of glass, which was missing because of an escape attempt ten years before. Moreover, Appellant’s and Seretich’s cells each contained an individual interior Lexan<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> window, with a screen exterior to it, and two metal bars running from the top to the bottom of each window.</p>

Although Seretich’s rope was long enough to reach the ground, he apparently lost his grip while descending. Upon discovering his body at 6:00 a.m., authorities instituted a lock-down and unit search to investigate his death. During the ensuing investigation, authorities looked first into Seretich’s cell, where they discovered the makeshift rope, with one end attached to the bed. They further discovered that the interior Lexan window in Seretich’s cell had been removed and was on the floor, that the screen had been cut and pushed aside, that the metal window bar was missing and could not be located in the cell, and a one-by-four inch hole in the wall between Appellant’s and Seretich’s cells.</p>

They also discovered a metal pry bar that was apparently used to remove Seretich’s and Appellant’s windows, Appellant’s removed window, two metal bars, one from Seretich’s and one from Appellant’s windows, and strips of cloth similar to those used to construct Seretich’s rope.

Specifically, after arguing at trial that he had no knowledge of any escape, Appellant contended for purposes of appeal that the object of the attempt was his own escape. Further, he asserted that the object of the conspiracy was also his escape alone, not Seretieh’s escape. Therefore, he argued that it was possible for the jury to have concluded that the object of both the attempted escape and the conspiracy to commit escape was his escape alone, and not Seretich’s, and to the extent the jury could have reached this conclusion, his sentence ran afoul of Section 906. Appellant did not argue that his sentence violated Section 906 if the object of the conspiracy had two purposes, his escape and Seretich’s escape.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellant agreed with the trial court’s assessment of his Section 906 challenge and requested a remand to allow the trial court to correct this perceived sentencing error. Regarding Section 906, the Commonwealth responded that Appellant’s sentences were proper because each inchoate crime had a separate criminal objective. Specifically, the Commonwealth argued that Appellant’s sentence for attempted escape pertained to his actions in attempting his own escape, whereas his sentence for conspiracy to commit escape involved his effort to assist in Seretich’s escape from jail. Consequently, according to the Commonwealth, the bar on multiple sentences for inchoate crimes in Section 906 was not implicated because each inchoate crime was designed to culminate in the commission of a separate and distinct crime.</p>

In determining whether inchoate crimes are directed to the commission of the same crime, we have taken a narrow view of the object crime. In <em>Graves, </em>for example, the defendant was convicted and sentenced for criminal conspiracy and criminal solicitation for his part in an incident in which he conspired with fellow gang members to assault three police officers, and individually solicited one gang member to murder one police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 1199 (Zappala, J., dissenting). Consecutive sentences were imposed for the conspiracy and solicitation. On appeal, this Court approved of the two sentences. We held that our review of the record revealed that even though the two inchoate crimes arose out of the “same incident,” they were <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>directed at different ends, and therefore did not merge at sentencing: the defendant conspired to assault three police officers and discreetly solicited the murder one of the officers. <a href="/pa/510/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="510 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1796945" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0423-01">508 A.2d at 1198</a>.

If, on the other hand, the attempt and conspiracy did not share the same criminal objective, the two sentences did not run afoul of Section 906’s prohibition. Because Appellant asserts and the Commonwealth agrees that the attempt sentence was premised on Appellant’s own attempted escape, the question is whether the record demonstrates that the conspiracy to commit escape was designed to culminate in Appellant’s escape, Seretich’s escape, or both. To the extent the conspiracy was designed to culminate solely in Appellant’s escape, then it shared the objective of the attempt and the two sentences cannot stand. If, however, the conspiracy was designed to culminate in Seretich’s escape alone, it did not share the same criminal objective as the attempt, and Section 906 does not bar the two sentences. If the goal of the conspiracy was the escape of both men, then the conspiracy had two separate criminal objectives, and the two sentences were proper. Indeed, Appellant, for his part, does not assert that Section 906 is violated if the conspiracy had two objectives, one of which was his escape. Rather, his argument is that the attempt and conspiracy had only one objective: his escape alone. With this framework in mind, we address the parties’ arguments.</p>

Both men had removed the Lexan glass and pushed aside the screen in the same manner, using the same tools. Strips of cloth similar to those used in Seretich’s rope were found in Appellant’s cell.

Appellant’s recently formed hypothesis has no support in the record.

Given the evidence that was placed before the jury, the only issue for them to decide with regard to the conspiracy charge was whether Appellant was involved in Seretich’s escape, or whether he was simply an innocent bystander who had the misfortune to be assigned the cell next to Seretich. By finding Appellant guilty of conspiracy, the jury clearly agreed with the Commonwealth that at least one of the criminal purposes of the conspiracy was Seretich’s escape. Consequently, although the criminal information and jury charge did not expressly identify the object of the conspiracy, and theoretically allowed for the possibility that the conspiracy was solely for Appellant’s escape, it was made clear to the jury in <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>accord with the parties’ arguments that the conspiracy’s objective included Seretich’s escape.</p>

Because the statutory maximum sentence for conspiracy is based on the object crime, a sentence for conspiracy to commit burglary would have far exceeded a sentence for conspiracy to commit theft by unlawful taking or disposition. Although it was not clear which object crime the jury’s verdict was premised on, the sentencing court believed it was appropriate to sentence him consistent with conspiracy to commit burglary. On appeal, the Superior Court agreed with the defendant that grading his conspiracy conviction as the more serious offense of conspiracy to commit burglary was erroneous. The court held that “in the absence of clear evidence of the jury’s intent to the contrary, a general conspiracy verdict must be resolved in favor of the defendant, and may be construed only as a conviction of conspiracy to commit the least serious underlying offense for which the jury could properly have found the defendant to have conspired to commit.” <a href="/a2d/811/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="811 A.2d 610" data-case-ids="9315087" data-case-paths="/a2d/811/0610-01">811 A.2d at 620</a>. <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>The critical distinction between this case and <em>Riley </em>is that the holding in <em>Riley </em>was premised on the absence of clear evidence of the jury’s intent.

The trial court agreed, recognizing that the maximum sentence for the attempted escape and conspiracy to commit escape is twenty-four months, and the maximum sentence for possessing implements of escape is sixty months. The Superior Court likewise agreed, and remanded for resentencing within the statutory maximum. This issue is not relevant to the present appeal.</p>

Again, as the trial court did not opine that it had made a sentencing error until after Appellant filed his notice of appeal, Appellant remained aggrieved by the trial court's sentencing order. Thus, he continued to have standing to appeal the issue now before us, and the Commonwealth maintained the right to argue against Appellant’s position.</p>

For my own part, I am unable to glean such clear intent from a general verdict rendered on instructions permitting convictions based on divergent circumstances. If I were to guess, based on the record presented, I would surmise the jury grounded the attempt and conspiracy verdicts upon the conclusion that both crimes related to the planned escape of both Appellant and Seretich. Of course, for purposes of this appeal, we are foreclosed from doing so, since Appellant, for reasons of his own, has limited his argument to the position that the attempt conviction pertained to his escape alone. <em>See id. </em>at 670, 674-675, 39 A.3d at 981, 983-84.

In this and other respects, I find that the decision to accord Supreme Court error review here may yield more trouble than it is worth. If the determination of whether and what offenses should be preserved in light of Section 906’s proscription against multiple convictions for inchoate crimes is truly one connected with the sentencing stage (as we are presuming under the lead Justices’ approach, see <em>id. </em>at 672-673, 39 A.3d at 982-83), I see little reason why the trial judge should not make it at sentencing upon his own view of the <a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>record and/or the sentencing presentations. <em>Cf.

Indeed, this seems to be what the trial court attempted to suggest, albeit belatedly, in its opinion under Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925. <em>See Commonwealth v. Jacobs, </em>CC 200602109, <em>slip op. </em>at 5 (C.P.Allegheny, Oct. 28, 2008) (“This Court recognizes that it erred by sentencing the defendant for both criminal attempt and criminal conspiracy in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. § 906, which states that a person may not be convicted of more than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy, for conduct directed towards the commission of the same crime.”).</p>

As Justice Saylor aptly points out, this was “a general verdict rendered on instructions permitting convictions based on divergent circumstances” which makes the jury’s intent much less clear than the majority suggests. Concurring Op., at 682-688, 39 A.3d at 987-88 (Saylor, J., concurring).</p>
    <p id="b726-6" data-blocks='[["BL_726.6",726,[274,707,1153,517]]]'>The charges in the informations here were two: (1) criminal attempt by appellant to escape; and (2) conspiracy between appellant and Seretich that <em>they or one of them </em>would escape. Appellant cannot be sentenced on both counts unless the object crimes of the attempt and the conspiracy were different. That is, if the conspiracy encompassed appellant’s escape, he cannot be sentenced separately for attempting that same escape; conversely, if the conspiracy encompassed only the escape of Seretich, a separate sentence for the attempt count, dealing with his own escape, is permissible.</p>
    <p id="b726-7" data-blocks='[["BL_726.7",726,[273,1247,1153,876]]]'>The conspiracy allegation does not differentiate as to whether the conspiracy was for appellant, Seretich, or both to escape. Such a count may certainly be framed broadly, and a finding of any of three objects (appellant’s escape, Seretich’s escape, or the escape of both) would justify conviction of conspiracy. However, if it is framed so broadly, the jury verdict is necessarily as broad and sweeping — one cannot but guess which object of the conspiracy was accepted by the jury. Indeed, it may have found all three objects to be within general conspiracy, or just one — no one can tell. One thing for certain is that the jury did convict for a conspiracy that excluded appellant’s escape. If the jury was allowed to convict appellant of conspiracy to accomplish his own escape — and clearly it was — then the attempt and the conspiracy have the same object crime, the escape of appellant. As such, § 906 precludes sentencing for more than one inchoate crime in that circumstance.</p>

That may be the theory, but that was not what the prosecution charged, nor did the judge instruct the jury that way. Every element of conspiracy mentioned by the court involved “one or more of them” or “the defendant or the/ other person,” but never was the jury told the conspiracy was limited to Seretich alone. More significantly, it was never told it could not convict appellant of conspiracy to escape by himself.</p>
    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[172,819,1151,366]]]'>Here, the conspiracy was charged broadly, and it allowed the jury to convict for an agreement that appellant would escape. To say the jury did not do so is to guess and speculate, which we may not do. The prosecution could have charged appellant with attempt for his escape and conspiracy for Seretich’s escape. It did not. Accordingly, appellant’s separate sentences are prohibited by 18 Pa.C.'S. § 906.</p>
