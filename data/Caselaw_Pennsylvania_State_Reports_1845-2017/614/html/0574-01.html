Although abatements continued to be granted through 2007, and revenues continued to accumulate in the HCPR Account, the Budget Secretary made no more transfers to the MCARE Fund after 2005. It is important to note, however, that post&gt;-2005, the measures taken by the Legislature and the Judiciary to reduce medical malpractice claims proved to be effective, and MCARE claims began to decline. Accordingly, notwithstanding that the Budget Secretary made no further transfers from the HCPR Account to the MCARE Fund post-2005, the MCARE Fund contained sufficient monies to pay all MCARE claims, as well as permit all abatements guaranteed to health care providers by the Abatement Law to occur. Because funds continued to accumulate in the HCPR Account, but were not being transferred to the MCARE Fund, the HCPR Account had a balance exceeding $700 million as of July 31, 2009.</p>

We consider first the provisions addressing the purpose of the legislation and the mandatory nature of the abatements. It is readily apparent, based on the plain language of the statute, that the Abatement Program was created to alleviate the health care providers’ burden of paying MCARE assessments for a temporary period of time by granting abatements of assessments to all eligible providers. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.1102(a) (establishing the Health Care Provider Retention Program, which “shall provide assistance in the form of assessment abatement to health care providers for calendar years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007”); <em>see also </em>40 P.S. § 1303.1104(b) (providing that the “Insurance Department shall review the applicant’s information and grant the applicable abatement of the assessment for the previous calendar year” based on enumerated criteria). These provisions, however, require only that abatements be granted to all eligible health care providers, which indisputably occurred here. They shed little, if any, light on whether the Commonwealth was required to transfer monies from the HCPR Account to the MCARE Fund under circumstances where the MCARE Fund had sufficient resources to <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>pay all claims. Stated differently, Appellees, as well as the Commonwealth Court below, conflate the mandatory nature of the grant of abatements and the Commonwealth’s purported obligation to transfer monies to the MCARE Fund. Contrary to Appellees’ contentions, Sections 1102(a) and 1104(b) of the Abatement Law speak exclusively to the former, and do not address the latter.</p>
    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[169,716,1153,1017]]]'>Similarly, we find minimal significance in the General Assembly’s creation of a special account within the General Fund, designated as the Health Care Provider Retention Account, <em><a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20277" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="213 A.2d 277">id.</a> </em>§ 1303.1112(a), and its funding of such account via an increase in the cigarette tax pursuant to the 2003 Tax Reform Code Amendments. While this implicitly suggests that the Legislature intended for some HCPR Account monies to be utilized to pay for abatements, which, in turn, served to retain health care providers in the Commonwealth, it does not demonstrate, as Appellees submit, that the Commonwealth had an obligation to transfer funds from the HCPR Account to the MCARE Fund in an amount equal to all abatements granted. We reiterate that the Budget Secretary transferred $330 million from the HCPR account to the MCARE Fund to pay for abatements.

Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/575/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="575 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="630455" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0542-01">575 Pa. 542</a>, 559-60, <a href="/pa/575/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="838 A.2d 566" data-case-ids="630377,630455,9298628,9298712" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0541-01,/pa/575/0542-01,/a2d/838/0566-01,/a2d/838/0566-02">838 A.2d 566</a>, 577 (2003) (“The [standing] doctrine’s core conception [is] that a party who is not negatively affected by the matter he seeks to challenge is not aggrieved, and thus, has no right to obtain judicial resolution of his challenge.”). As the Commonwealth demonstrates, the statutory formula for assessment calculation, as applied by Pennsylvania’s Insurance Commissioner since the MCARE Fund’s creation in 2002, does not take the Fund’s balance into account. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1303.712(d). Thus, Appellees’ assertion of harm in the form of increased assessments they will have pay in the future, which the majority accepts, is not only premised on a mere allegation, but is, in fact, unsupportable, given the manner by which assessments are currently calculated and collected.
