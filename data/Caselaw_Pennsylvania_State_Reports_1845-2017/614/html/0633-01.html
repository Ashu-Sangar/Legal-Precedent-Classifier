At an adjudicatory hearing on August 14, 2007, before the Honorable Brenda Frazier-Clemons, the juvenile court found that M.W. committed the delinquent acts of robbery,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> conspiracy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and related charges. The juvenile court deferred adjudication, however, placing M.W. on interim probation and continuing the matter to September 5, 2007. Later that same day, M.W. was adjudicated delinquent by another juvenile court judge on a separate delinquency petition, which alleged a misdemeanor theft from a motor vehicle,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and M.W. was committed to St. Gabriel’s Hall for treatment, rehabilitation, and supervision. Thereafter, at the September 5 hearing on the first petition, Judge Frazier-Clemons discharged the delinquency petition stemming from the robbery offense, noting that M.W. “will be adjudicated on the [theft] petition. He will still receive treatment and supervision.” N.T. Hearing, 9/5/07, at 9.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth indicates that it “does not oppose clarification” that “the Juvenile Act does not mandate a finding that a [child] who is found to have committed a delinquent act must, for that reason alone, be found to be a delinquent child.” <em>Id. </em>at 14 (emphasis omitted). Notwithstanding the Commonwealth’s agreement that the Superior Court’s language requires clarification, the Commonwealth maintains that “the substance of the Superior Court’s ruling need not be disturbed,” Commonwealth’s Brief at 14, because the juvenile court believed that M.W. was, in fact, in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 12 (“[T]he juvenile court discharged the petition without an adjudication of delinquency, not because it believed [M.W.] could do without treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, but <em>because another judge had already determined that he was delinquent and committed him to a residential placement appropriate to the facts in that case.” </em>(emphasis original)).</p>

First, the court must determine whether, on the petition then before it, a child actually committed a delinquent act. <em>See </em>Pa.R.J.C.P. 408(A); 42 Pa.C.S. § 6341(a). This finding must specify “which, if any, offenses, including grading and counts, alleged in the petition were committed by the juvenile.” Pa.R.J.C.P. 408(A); <em>see also </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6341(b). “If the court finds that the juvenile committed any delinquent act, the court shall proceed as provided in Rule 409.” Pa. R.J.C.P. 408(C). Only after this initial finding that a juvenile committed a delinquent act, shall a court “conduct a hearing to determine if the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation” (hereinafter “treatment”). <em>Id. </em>409(A). This evaluation regarding a child’s need for treatment is distinguishable from the inquiry made at a Section 6352/Rule 512 disposition hearing, which is discussed below. The issue before the court at the Section 6341/Rule 408-409 adjudication of delinquency phase is only whether the child is in need of treatment, in the abstract; rather than what treatment should be provided or is already being provided through a separate source.</p>

If so, in accord with the Act and the Rules, the child is to be adjudicated delinquent. These provisions do not concern whether the child is already receiving treatment, as was the case in the matter before us.</p>

This hearing, which is distinct from the adjudication proceeding, is where a “court shall enter its findings and conclusions of law into the record” regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>the disposition of the child, the reasons for that disposition, the “terms, conditions, and limitations of the disposition,” and “whether any evaluations, tests, counseling, or treatments are necessary.” Pa.R.J.C.P. 512(D)(l)-(3), (5). Such disposition may include any number of conditions, including probation, commitment to a juvenile detention facility, or maintenance of the child’s status quo. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6352(a). Accordingly, it is at this stage, and this stage only, where a juvenile court may look to treatment a delinquent child is already undergoing and determine if that treatment is suffi<a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>dent to ameliorate the conditions leading to the current offense.</p>
    <p id="b691-4" data-blocks='[["BL_691.4",691,[170,431,1152,680]]]'>The importance of keeping adjudication and disposition distinct is exemplified by legislation recently enacted by the General Assembly. Under the provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, newly passed by the legislature, <em>see </em>Pub.L. No. 2011-111 (Dec. 20, 2011) (effective Feb. 20, 2012), a juvenile adjudicated delinquent for various sex crimes may be forced to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sex offender. <em>See e.g. </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.15(a) (effective Feb. 20, 2012). Like-wise, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for felony sex offenses are required to submit blood samples for the State DNA Data Base and Data Bank. <em>See </em>44 Pa.C.S. § 2316. In both cases, a court’s peculiar disposition is of no relevance to these requirements.</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[169,1136,1151,515]]]'>These examples of collateral consequences are provided to emphasize the importance of separating adjudication of delinquency, in accord with Section 6341 and Rules 408 and 409, and disposition, pursuant to Section 6352 and Rule 512. While it may appear cumbersome to consider the abstract need for treatment as part of the adjudication of delinquency process under Section 6341(b)/Rule 409(A), and then consider the actual need for treatment when determining disposition under Section 6352(a)/Rule 512, this is exactly what the law and rules envision.</p>
    <p id="b691-6" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[166,1684,1152,515]]]'>Although it is entirely understandable how the very busy juvenile court in this case truncated the procedure by considering both the abstract need for treatment component of an adjudication of delinquency and the actual need for treatment component of a disposition, this conflation has the potential to impact the collateral consequences of delinquency, as explained above. I, therefore, respectfully caution our juvenile trial courts to maintain this distinction which, I believe the Majority envisioned, and which is set out with particularity herein.</p>

The Juvenile Act itself contains a latent disconnect in that, unlike Rule 409, the Act contains no specific provision directing juvenile courts to conduct a dispositional hearing following the adjudication of delinquency. Rule 409(A)(2)(a) bridges the gap, however, such that the precise procedure to be followed is clear to the courts.</p>
