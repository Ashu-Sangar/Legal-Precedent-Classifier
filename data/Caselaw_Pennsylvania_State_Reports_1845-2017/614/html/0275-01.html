(“Father”), who is currently incarcerated in a State Correctional Institution in Erie County with a minimum release date in June 2012, and a maximum release date in June 2016, is the biological father of two minor children: A.I.S. (d.o.b. 7/5/07), and R.I.S. (d.o.b. 10/23/08) (collectively “the children”). He appeals the Superior Court’s reversal of the York County trial court’s orders denying petitions for the involuntary termination of his parental rights and for changes in the placement goals for the children from reunification to adoption. We reverse and take this opportunity to reiterate a principle that this Court has never abandoned: that a parent’s incarceration, standing alone, cannot constitute proper grounds for the termination of his or her parental rights.</p>

In January 2009, York County Children and Youth Services (“CYS”) filed an application for protective custody of the children, based in part on a request for emergency placement made by the biological mother of the children, K.H. (“Mother”). The children were adjudicated dependent in February 2009, and were placed together in a temporary foster home. A pre-adoptive resource was identified by CYS, and in December 2009, CYS filed petitions for changes in the placement goals for the children from reunifica<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>tion to adoption, and for the involuntary termination of the parental rights of Father and Mother.

The goals set for Father included cooperating with service planning, signing necessary releases, remaining in contact with CYS through written correspondence, providing documentation upon completion of therapeutic prison programs, and maintaining a record of good prison conduct. Evidence was presented to show that Father had met each of these goals: he had cooperated with service planning, he had signed all necessary releases, he had remained in written and telephonic contact with CYS, he had provided CYS with documentation of his completion of therapeutic prison programs, and he had not had any incidents of misconduct while incarcerated.</p>

It was shown that Father had requested visitation with the children, but the request was denied due to the time and distance that would be involved (an eleven-hour round trip by personal vehicle between the cities of York and Erie, Pennsylvania). Father’s alternative request for “virtual visitation” was denied because CYS had no video-conferencing capability. It was further shown that Father purchased a pre<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>paid phone card and attempted several times to call the children, but the foster parents refused the calls.</p>

The Superior Court determined that the trial court’s conclusions were not adequately supported by the record and that the court had abused its discretion, on the basis of Father’s incarceration, and because the length of his incarceration is conclusive evidence of his parental incapacity. Importantly, the Superior Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trier of fact. The trial court determined that the length of Father’s sentence was not so great as to foreclose the possibility of the successful maintenance of the parent-child relationship, and that termination of Father’s parental rights would not serve the best interests of the children. The Superior Court viewed the same facts, and drew the opposite conclusion; to wit, “[t]he length of Father’s prison sentence supports the conclusion that he cannot remedy the parental deficiencies that led to the Children’s placement.” Memorandum Opinion, dated 12/22/10, at 17. We state emphatically that this Court has never adopted or countenanced a view that incarceration alone is <em>per se </em>evidence of parental incapacity or that it represents appropriate and sufficient grounds for the involuntary termination of parental rights. Indeed, the law in Pennsylvania is quite the opposite, and we reiterate the definitive principle that when a parent uses the opportunities that are available in prison to make sincere efforts to maintain a place of importance in the lives of his or her children, incarceration alone will not serve as grounds for the involuntary termination of his or her parental rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court with respect to its determination regarding the involuntary termination of Father’s parental rights.</p>

Moreover, the fact of incarceration during an ongoing dependency action will not disqualify a parent from resuming parental responsibility so long as the parent will be released quickly enough to permit the court to provide the child with timely permanency upon reunification. If, however, the length of parent’s incarceration will preclude the court from unifying the (former) prisoner and the child on a timely basis in order to provide the child with the permanent home to which he or she is entitled, then the length of sentence, standing alone, should and does meet the legal criteria for involuntary termi<a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>nation of the incarcerated parent’s parental rights under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a), as discussed below.</p>

Prior to the mid-1990s, our national policy toward dependent children was to await reunification of parents and children. While undoubtedly a laudable goal, this single-minded focus on reunification led to 560,000 children in foster care as of September 1998, one-third of whom had been languishing in the foster care system for over three-years and drifting from placement to placement, while their parents were unable to remedy the problems that led to the children’s placement. <em>See </em>U.S. Dept, of Health and Human Services, Admin, for Children and Families, Child Welfare Outcomes 1998: Annual Report, <em>available at </em>http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/pubs/ ewo98/secl.htm# faces. In reaction to this dire situation, the United States Congress enacted ASFA, thereby altering the focus of dependency proceedings to include consideration of the need to move children toward adoption in a timely manner when reunification proved unworkable. <em>See In re Adoption of S.E.G., </em><a href="/pa/587/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="587 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="3466630" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0568-01">587 Pa. 568</a>, <a href="/pa/587/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="901 A.2d 1017" data-case-ids="3466630,8419176" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0568-01,/a2d/901/1017-01">901 A.2d 1017</a>, 1019 (2006). One year after ASFA, in 1998, the Pennsylvania General Assembly amended our Juvenile Act in response to the federal legislation. Our statutory scheme was modified to shift the statute’s focus from a singular concern with reunification of the family to the dual purposes of preserving family unity when possible, and providing an alternative permanent family for a child when reunification of the biological parent and child could not be timely achieved. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6301(b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

Significantly, the Act does not provide specific protection to incarcerated parents, even though it specifically instructs that termination cannot result “solely from environmental factors such as inadequate housing, furnishings, income, clothing and medical care if found to be beyond the control of the parent.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(b); <em>cf. </em>Neb.

For example, under Section 2511(a)(2), parental rights may be terminated where “[t]he repeated and continued incapacity ... of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity ... cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.” It is beyond cavil that in many cases, including the one at bar, an incarcerated parent is confined twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week; obviously resulting in his being incapable of providing the essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for a child’s physical and mental well-being. <em><a href="/pa/587/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="901 A.2d 1017" data-case-ids="3466630,8419176" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0568-01,/a2d/901/1017-01">Id.</a></em>

To exemplify, I submit the easy case. If the parent is in jail for life with no possibility of parole, it is obvious that, notwithstanding all of his sincerity or activism, he is unable to alter the reality that he lacks the capacity to provide the child with the essential parental care required for his healthy upbringing. Thus, under 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(2), the length of incarceration standing alone meets the statutory criteria for termination. Similarly, under subsection (5), a trial court may find grounds for termination of parental rights where a child “has been removed from the care of the parent <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>by the court ... for a period of at least six months” and “the parent cannot ... remedy those conditions within a reasonable period of time.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a)(5). Again, a lengthy prison sentence may be determinative of the question, as suggested by the Majority Opinion, <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 287 n. 4, 36 A.3d at 574 n. 4. If the child has been removed from the parent’s care for at least six months because, <em>inter alia, </em>the parent is incarcerated and the incarceration is going to last for years into the future, it is self-evident that the condition which led to the child’s removal will continue to exist, and the parent will not be able to remedy it within a reasonable period of time. Under these circumstances, Pennsylvania law allows for termination. Finally, the length of a parent’s incarceration is also relevant to the issues raised in Section 2511(a)(8), which directs the court to determine whether the conditions that led to removal continue to exist after twelve months. 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a)(8) (“The child has been removed from the care of the parent by the court, ... 12 months or more have elapsed from the date of removal or placement, the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child continue to exist....”).</p>

Section 2511(b) instructs: “The court in terminating the rights of a parent shall give primary consideration to the developmental, physical and emotional needs and welfare of the child.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> This statutory imperative requires that the trial court carefully review the individual circumstances for every child to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>how a parent’s incarceration will factor into an assessment of that child’s best interest. For example, assume that a parent has provided a twelve-year old with all of his essential care from birth, that the parent now finds himself incarcerated for two to four years, and that incarceration is the sole reason the child is declared dependent. In such a case, the child will certainly have substantial emotional bonds to his parent, and <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>an excellent case could be made that termination would not be in the child’s best interest, even though the parent’s incapacity to care for the child will continue for several years.

    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[179,601,1155,1326]]]'>However, as noted by the trial court in this case, a parent of a very young child who is serving a lengthy term of incarceration presents a very different calculation, involving minimal emotional bonding and substantial delay prior to any hope of reunification. Notes of Testimony (N.T.), March 2, 2010 at 84 (“If it was a longer period of time, if he was going to be in jail for ten years ... I would say, well, the kids are going to be 15 years old before they know him. That’s way too late. They deserve to have permanency.”) I agree "with the trial court. It is incumbent upon the judicial system to be child-focused. Regardless of the heartbreak to a parent, children are entitled to every opportunity for a successful life, and a permanent, loving parental relationship greatly fosters that opportunity. <em>See e.g. In re B.N.M., </em><a href="/a2d/856/0847-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="856 A.2d 847" data-case-ids="9212452" data-case-paths="/a2d/856/0847-01">856 A.2d 847</a>, 856 (Pa.Super.2004) (holding that a parent’s rights must yield “to the child’s right to have proper parenting and fulfillment of his or her potential in a permanent, healthy, safe environment. A parent cannot protect his parental rights by merely stating that he does not wish to have his rights terminated.” (internal citations omitted)). Accordingly, I write to emphasize my conclusion that incarceration, and particularly the length of a sentence may provide the proof sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that termination can occur in accord with 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(a), and should be considered when the best interest of the child is analyzed in accord with Section 2511(b).</p>

For example, North Dakota has defined its aggravating circumstances, which excuse the provision of reasonable efforts aimed at reunification, to include where a parent “[h]as been incarcerated under a sentence where the latest release date is: (1) [i]n the case of a child age nine or older, after the child’s majority; or (2) [i]n the case of a child, after the child is twice the child’s current age, measured in days.” N.D. Cent.Code § 27-20-02(3)(f). While our legislature has not provided guidance on the relevance of incarceration to termination, I conclude that a parent’s incarceration, and the potentially resulting incapacity, can be considered in determining whether the facts create grounds for termination under Section 2511(a) and whether termination is in the best interest of the children under Section 2511(b).</p>

The Superior Court opined that the family service plan goal should have been changed to adoption because Father simply was incapable of caring for his children while in prison. At the earliest, Father would be able to begin performing those duties in June 2012, which is Father’s earliest release date. The Superior Court cited the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA), Pub.L. 105-89, <a href="/citations/?q=111%20Stat.%202115" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="111 Stat. 2115">111 Stat. 2115</a> (codified as amended in scattered sections of 42 U.S.C.), which is designed to grant permanency to a child’s life by resolving the child’s placement needs within eighteen months of an adjudication of dependency.

The court concluded that, in light of Father’s incarceration and the children’s immediate needs, “adoption is the appropriate goal.” <em>In re R.I.S., <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">supra </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">at 9</a>.</p>

The Superior Court considered the trial court’s conclusion that Father’s possible imminent release, combined with the fact that he cared for A.I.S. before his incarceration, suggested he will do so once again. The court determined that Father’s incarceration for four to eight years rendered him incapable of caring for Children in the near future. Moreover, it found that Father’s imprisonment should not toll the ASFA in his favor because a parent cannot toll his parental rights while waiting for a more convenient time to perform parental duties. <em>In re R.I.S., <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">supra </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">at 16</a> (“This Court refuses to affirm a decision of the trial court that would, prospectively, remove Children from the only parents they have known, and place them in the custody of a biological father they do not know and with whom they have not bonded- and whose ability to parent Children remains speculative.”).</p>

Consequently, there is nothing in the record to support the trial court’s denial of the goal change request. Moreover, the trial court’s resolution of the termination petition was tainted by its misperception of the holdings in <em>Adoption of McCray </em>and <em>Baby Boy A. </em>and its failure to consider the paramount interests of the children.

Neither A.I.S. nor R.I.S. has any recollection of Father; indeed, R.I.S. was not yet born when Father was imprisoned, and A.I.S. was less than one year old. The Superior Court cited ASF A, which is designed to grant permanency to a child’s life by resolving his placement needs within eighteen months. The Superior Court found an abuse of discretion, reasoning the trial court ignored Children’s need for permanency and security and concluding, in light of the length of Father’s incarceration and the Children’s immediate needs, that “adoption is the appropriate goal.” <em>In re R.I.S., <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">supra </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20591" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="23 A.3d 591">at 9</a>.
