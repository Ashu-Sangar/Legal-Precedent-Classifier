For the reasons stated below, we hold that Appellees’ claim is preempted, and, accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court’s order affirming the trial court’s denial of summary judgment in favor of SKF.</p>

The Company also employed hourly unionized employees (“union workers”) at the plant. In January 1991, SKF announced its decision to shut down the plant and terminate the employment of all those working there in relatively short order. Over the course of the ensuing year, the effect of the closing on employee retirement rights and benefits became a subject of collective bargaining between SKF and its union workers, and a matter of discussion between Appellees and their supervisors.</p>

For the Philadelphia plant, a Section 4.02(b) retirement required 20 years of service and 45 years of age as of the date of the cessation of a member’s service. Article 6 covered “Termination of Service” and set forth the benefit rights of a member whose service with the Company terminated for any reason other than death or retirement. Under Section 6.01, a member with at least 10 years of service was entitled to a deferred vested retirement benefit, payable for life, commencing upon his or her normal retirement date at 65 years of age or any month following his or her 55th birthday. If a member elected to receive benefits at any point upon reaching age 55, but before reaching age 65, the benefit amount to be paid was his or her deferred vested retirement benefit multiplied by a factor, ranging from .5000 for a retirement age of 55 to .9333 for a retirement age of 64.</p>

This entitlement was referred to as the “creep provision” or “creep benefit” because it <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>permitted certain employees to “creep” into retirement rights and pension benefits that a separate ERISA pension plan SKF maintained and administered for its union workers did not provide.

After advising them of the pension amount they would receive in monthly payments for their lifetimes if they elected to have their pensions start at age 65, the letter stated: “If you elect to have your pension start at age 55, you [will] receive 50% of [that amount]. If you elect to have your pension start between age 55 and age 65, your pension amount [will] be greater than 50%, but less than 100% of [that amount] depending upon your age.” Deposition Exhibit Defeo-7 (Letter dated January 23, 1992); Exhibit Barnett-4 of Deposition of Lawrence J.

Subsequently, in 2002, Appellees Defeo and Barnett, both 55 years of age, each submitted an “Application for Pension” with SKF. The Applications were consistent with the letters received in 1992 from SKF’s Compensation and Benefits Manager and did not contemplate the receipt of a full pension, but, rather, set forth a pension amount that was multiplied by an “actuarial factor of 50%.” Appellees’ Expert Report (Attachments 1 and 2, Exhibit I to SKF’s Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment).</p>

Complaint at ¶¶ 9-10. Appellees further alleged that SKF promised that they, like certain union employees, “would be allowed to ‘creep’ [into] full pension benefits upon termination of employment from the plant closing, even though they would not have reached age 45” by that point in time, as long as they remained in the Company’s employ. <em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1144">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1144">at ¶ 11</a>.

SKF contends that Appellees’ cause of action <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>seeks “enhanced pension benefits based upon early pension vesting rights.” Brief of Appellant at 20. Thus, according to SKF, Appellees’ claim, brought under Pennsylvania contract law, relates to an ERISA plan within the meaning of Section 514(a) because it undercuts the statute’s aim to secure a national regulatory framework for determining the question of a retiree’s entitlement to ERISA benefits. Furthermore, SKF argues, Appellees’ claim is preempted because it directly contradicts ERISA’s command that benefits be administered in accordance with the written plan. Moreover, SKF posits, since Appellees’ claim involves the pursuit of pension benefits outside of ERISA’s framework, the Third Circuit’s decision in <em>Hooven, </em>which categorically disallowed such a claim, should be followed. Finally, SKF asserts that the Superior Court’s decision below, in implying that a state common law claim is not subject to preemption as long as the plaintiff does not assert a federal ERISA claim, cannot stand, as it creates a new and unsupportable test for ERISA preemption.</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[171,1299,1159,1058]]]'>For their part, Appellees counter that the lawsuit they brought is premised on an oral promise that they would be paid “the value of the same severance benefits offered to other employees if they remained employed with [the] company until the plant closed.” Appellees’ Brief at 13. Thus, they assert, their cause of action does not concern pension benefit rights, but rather a promised severance payment, in which Plan benefit amounts are merely a measure of that promised payment. As such, Appellees argue, their claim has, at most, a remote connection to the Plan, and accordingly, does not relate to an ERISA plan for purposes of preemption under Section 514(a). Appellees also contend that their lawsuit will not affect the administration of an employee benefit plan because the severance payment SKF is obligated to pay them is not based on the Plan. In addition, Appellees urge that we, like the Superior Court panel majority, follow the <em>Greenblatt </em>case, and that we heed the decision in <em>Stevenson v.

In our view, the record does not support, as Appellees assert, that the promise they claim to have received from the Company was for the payment of a severance, the monetary value of which would be measured by the pension benefits they would have been paid had they been entitled to rights of immediate retirement under the Plan at the time their service with the Company ended. Rather, the record consistently reveals that the commitment Appellees believe they were given, and, in this action, seek to enforce, is the receipt of the so-called creep benefit — that is, the right to retire early, in 1991, and the right to be paid a full pension from that point forward. The record further reveals that whatever rights to retirement and retirement income Appellees are owed, the Plan is their source.</p>

Thus, the court held the record did not support ERISA preemption on the basis that: the defendants’ asserted liability did not derive from the particular rights and obligations established by any benefit plan; the plaintiffs rights emanated from a separate promise that merely referenced benefit plans, none of which directly applied to him; the benefit plans simply provided a benchmark for assessing damages; the claims did not implicate a determination of ERISA benefits or undermine uniformity of plan administration; and the claims, if successful, would not have required a plan administrator to follow rules inconsistent with those provided by ERISA. <em><a href="/f3d/609/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="609 F.3d 56" data-case-ids="3692751" data-case-paths="/f3d/609/0056-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/609/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="609 F.3d 56" data-case-ids="3692751" data-case-paths="/f3d/609/0056-01">at 60-62</a>. In the instant case, by contrast, we are concerned with preemption under Section 514(a). Moreover, as we have already noted: the alleged promise upon which Appellees’ claim is founded was for ERISA retirement and pension rights; the Plan is the source of the those rights and is not a mere measure of compensatory damages; and granting relief on Appellees’ claim would adversely affect the uniform administration of key ERISA concerns and would require a plan administrator to act contrary to ERISA standards. Thus, Appellees’ reliance on <em>Stevenson </em>to argue against ERISA preemption under Section 514(a) as to their state law claim is misplaced.</p>

Rather, the court was asked to consider whether the plaintiffs were permitted to pursue ERISA welfare benefits outlined in a summary plan description, but not repeated in their ERISA plan, under a federal common law contract-based theory. The Third Circuit decided that contract principles do not create "extra-ERISA causes of action” for plan benefits. <em>Hooven, </em><a href="/f3d/465/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="465 F.3d 566" data-case-ids="3260592" data-case-paths="/f3d/465/0566-01">465 F.3d at 573</a>. Ultimately, the court evaluated the merits of the plaintiffs' claim as though it was brought under ERISA’s civil enforcement provision at Section 502(a), and determined that no relief was due. <em><a href="/f3d/465/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="465 F.3d 566" data-case-ids="3260592" data-case-paths="/f3d/465/0566-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/465/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="147" data-cite="465 F.3d 566" data-case-ids="3260592" data-case-paths="/f3d/465/0566-01">at 577-78</a>. However, in arriving at its ruling, the court referred to several federal decisions that stand for the proposition that common law contract theories cannot be used to recover ERISA benefits not included in the written terms of ERISA plan documents, a point which is certainly consistent with the determination we have reached in the instant case under <em>Travelers </em>and its progeny. <em><a href="/f3d/465/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="148" data-cite="465 F.3d 566" data-case-ids="3260592" data-case-paths="/f3d/465/0566-01">Id.</a> </em>at 573-74 (citing, <em>e.g., Reichelt v.

To determine whether Appellees’ claim “relates to” an ERISA pension plan, it is important to look at the harm complained of and the request for relief.

Appellees allege they were promised equality with the union members’ benefits in order to induce them to stay with the sinking ship until it submerged; those benefits were never given. This is simply a common breach of contract claim requiring Appellees to prove a contract existed, it was breached, and they suffered damages as a result of that breach. <em>See Liss &amp; Marion, P.C. v.
