If the claimant refuses to attend a requested medical examination or interview, the employer must file a petition and a WCJ must determine whether the employer is entitled to relief. If the WCJ orders the examination or interview, the claimant shall be deprived of his or her right to “compensation” during any period of refusal to attend the examination or interview, if such refusal lacks reasonable cause or excuse, and the period of such neglect or refusal shall be deducted from the period during which compensation would otherwise be payable. 77 P.S. § 651(a).</p>

Further, the powers granted to the WCJ to address the issue of the claimant’s refusal to attend the examination or interview is evidently commensurate with what is required to induce the claimant to comply. A deprivation of wage loss benefits may certainly be sufficient to achieve the purpose and intent behind Section 314(a).

Therefore, as we have observed <em>swpra, </em>there is a textual basis for WCJs to exercise the appropriate discretionary authority. As the WCAB asserts in its <em>amicus curiae </em>brief, the Commonwealth Court’s determination that WCJs are vested with the discretion to deprive the claimant of wage loss benefits or both wage loss benefits and medical benefits “vindicates the purpose of’ Section 314(a), “while advancing the Act’s humanitarian objectives.” WCAB’s Brief at 5.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Section 314 does not set forth a statute of repose or limitations relevant to inchoate employee claims; rather, the relevant portion of Section 314(a) concerns the employer’s right to request from an established claimant that he or she submit to a physical examination and the measured temporary punishment imposable should he or she refuse. Section 315 concerns employees who have not established any right to wage loss or medical benefits; Section 314 concerns claimants who have established these rights. Further, while Section 314(a) is important in the scheme devised by the General Assembly under the Act, as is every section of the Act, it is not “vital to the welfare of society” in the manner of a statute of repose or limitations. Moreover, Section 314(a) does not extinguish a liability imposed under the same article, it simply provides an inducement for a claimant to submit to an examination and a temporary punishment of some dimension should the claimant not submit. Section 315 addresses the right to “all claims” for compensation. 77 P.S. § 602 (emphasis added). Section 314(a) does not bar a claimant from receiving “all claims” for compensation, as does Section 315, but it imposes an anticipated temporary deprivation of the less encompassing “right to compensation” under Article III. 77 P.S. § 651(a).</p>

Indeed, even had the temporary forfeiture of "compensation” under Section 314(a) been plainly confined by the legislature to wage loss, the salutary purposes of Act 57, together with its many other significant provisions, would have fulfilled the legislative intent. In this regard, we must respectfully note that Justice Saylor's observation that "to allow ‘compensation’ to be construed as only encompassing wage loss benefits would not promote” the purposes of Act 57 (Saylor, J., D.O., at 302), is a misconstruing of our holding, which does not so limit the meaning of “compensation,” as used in Section 314(a).</p>

The OAJC devotes significant time demonstrating how the term “compensation” is utilized differently throughout the Workers’ Compensation Act, which is true, but this discussion further muddles the meaning; suffice it to say, “compensation” in this context is ambiguous. Furthermore, concluding “ ‘compensation’ ... need <em>not always </em>include medical expenses,” OAJC, at 298 (emphasis in original), might directly answer the question presented for our review; however, it fails to answer the manifest question, “Now what?” To answer that question and bring the issue full-circle, I would reiterate and emphasize that because compensation does not always include medical expenses, a Workers’ Compensation Judge has the discretion to suspend medical benefits along with wage loss benefits for failure to attend a medical examination.</p>

Moreover, the text of a statute cannot be both clear and ambiguous, as those are mutually exclusive propositions. <em>Compare </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”), <em>with id. </em>§ 1921(c) (“When the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters.... ”).</p>
    <p id="b668-5" data-blocks='[["BL_668.6",668,[269,1396,1152,572]]]'>Insofar as the lead Justices find that the meaning of the term is unclear from the face of Section 314(a), I agree. Nonetheless, I am not of the opinion that “compensation” has two definitions when used in that provision. The lead opinion concludes that, while the word will generally pertain to wage loss benefits, it may also denote wage loss and medical benefits “in the proper circumstances.” OAJC, at 294. Thus, the lead Justices find that the Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) is vested with the discretion to determine whether to deprive a non-compliant claimant of wage loss benefits or wage loss and medical benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 295-96.</p>

As noted in the lead opinion, that provision requires the WCJ to deprive the claimant of the “right to compensation, under this <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>article” when — without reasonable cause or excuse — the claimant refuses or neglects to comply with the WCJ’s order to submit to a physical examination or expert interview. 77 P.S. § 651(a). Neither the WCAB nor Section 314(a) define the term “compensation,” and although the provision’s “right to compensation, under this article” language would seem to suggest that “compensation” has a uniform meaning throughout Article III of the Act, this is not the case. Indeed, and as developed in the lead opinion, the term has, at times, been construed to implicate wage loss benefits, but, in other provisions, it has been interpreted to pertain to wage loss and medical benefits. <em>See </em>OAJC at 291-94 (citations omitted). As such, the meaning of “compensation” is not clear from the face of Section 314(a), thereby resulting in an ambiguity. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>

To my knowledge, until this case, no appellate court of this Commonwealth had ever concluded that “compensation” had two meanings when used within the same provision in Article III. Rather, it had always been thought that the word denoted either wage loss benefits or wage loss and medical benefits, depending on the discrete statutory context in which the term was employed. <em>Cf.

According to a number of lawmakers, the General Assembly enacted the legislation based on the belief that its predecessor, Act 44,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> failed to reduce workers’ compensation insurance rates for employers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Indeed, several <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>legislators expressed their concern that — without reform— Pennsylvania businesses would re-locate to surrounding states to avoid the “spiraling costs of workers’ compensation insurance.” Legislative Journal, Senate, <em>supra, </em>at 2159; <em>see, e.g., </em>Legislative Journal, House 1602 (June 19,1996) (“How do we compete for new jobs — or keep the ones we have — when companies tell us that, next to taxes, our outrageously high workers’ compensation costs are the biggest issue businesses face?”).</p>
    <p id="b672-4" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[267,807,1151,1054]]]'>Turning to the consequences of a particular interpretation, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(6), construing “compensation” to only refer to wage loss benefits would not further the objectives of Act 57 and Section 314(a) in a range of circumstances. For instance, suspension would be ineffectual where the claimant was receiving negligible or no wage loss benefits, but continuing to receive medical benefits, <em>e.g., </em>where the claimant has returned to work. In those cases, suspending wage loss benefits would not likely engender compliance with the WCJ’s directive to submit to a physical examination or expert interview, as the claimant would incur little or no penalty for failing to comply with that order, thus rendering the statute’s enforcement mechanism meaningless. This, in turn, would inhibit the employer from exercising its rights under the WCA, as the employer would be unable to evaluate the existence and/or the extent of a change in the claimant’s vocational capacity or medical condition. In sum, to allow “compensation” to be construed as only encompassing wage loss benefits would not promote the cost-containment overlay of Act 57, and therefore, fail to effectuate the purpose behind the legislation.</p>

First, a claimant only loses wage loss <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>and medical benefits after a series of steps. The employer must initially petition the WCJ to have the claimant submit to a physical examination or interview, and the WCJ must then grant that petition, which it need not do. The claimant must thereafter refuse or neglect to comply with the WCJ’s order, subject to exceptions. Only then is the claimant deprived of wage loss and medical benefits. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 651(a). The claimant is thus afforded considerable opportunities to prevent the suspension of his or her benefits.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[168,823,1150,582]]]'>Second, a claimant is not deprived of those benefits in every instance in which the claimant does not comply with the WCJ’s directive, but rather, only when the claimant does so “without reasonable cause or excuse.” <em>Id. </em>Presumably, this language accounts for those instances where the claimant reasonably fails to attend a WCJ-mandated physical examination or expert interview, for example, due to an illness. Therefore, the WCJ is allowed to consider the circumstances surrounding the claimant’s absence before directing the suspension of wage loss and medical benefits, as Section 314(a) requires.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[166,1440,1151,355]]]'>Lastly, those benefits are not permanently suspended, but instead, are only removed “during the continuance of such refusal or neglect.” <em>Id. </em>Thus, even after the WCJ suspends wage loss and medical benefits, the claimant is not forever barred from receiving those benefits. The claimant only has to comply with the WCJ’s order to again obtain wage loss and medical benefits.</p>
