According to the robbery victim, as he was standing at an intersection, a young boy pointed a gun at him, and robbed him of $10. The victim gave police a description of his assailant, and the police developed a list of individuals they knew matched the description; D.S. was one of those individuals. Detective John Rouse<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Officer Daniel Lang, both of whom were in plainclothes,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> then “went out <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>actively looking for [D.S.] in essence to field contact him.” N.T. Hearing, 6/1/09, at 9. The officers, who were traveling in a gold car with tinted windows, observed D.S. and two other individuals, Jamale Terry and Damon Goodwin, at a park outside an elementary school. The officers exited their vehicle with their weapons in hand, and approached D.S., Terry, and Goodwin, instructing them to put their hands in the air and “get up against the gate” in front of the school. <em>Id. </em>at 42. A third officer, Officer Fleske, arrived on the scene in a separate vehicle. The officers conducted a pat-down of D.S., Terry, and Goodwin, and asked them for their information, including their names, ages, and addresses. The officers did not identify themselves as police officers, nor did they state their purpose for stopping D.S. Terry testified that he, D.S., and Goodwin began asking the officers what they had done and why they were being searched. <em>Id. </em>at 43. Terry further testified that, after D.S. stated that his name was “D.B.,” Terry heard one of the officers telling D.S. that the officer knew D.B.’s real name was D.S. According to the officers, D.S. began to swear at them, and he subsequently was handcuffed. Terry testified that he saw Detective Rouse throw D.S. on the ground and kick him after D.S. had been handcuffed. <em>Id. </em>at 47. By this time, a crowd of approximately 15 people was watching the incident. The officers called for back-up, and D.S. was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and providing false identification to law enforcement under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 4914.</p>

In support of this argument, counsel presented the testimony of D.S.’s mother (“Mother”), who offered a printout from the Social Security Administration purporting to show that D.S. also went by the name D.B. D.S. <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>further argued that lying about one’s birth date is not the same as providing false identification, in that a birth date is merely biographical information, not information about identity.

Specifically, the court noted that D.S. directed profanity at the officers, and stated that he did not have to tell them anything. The court also cited the testimony of D.S.’s cousin, who testified that she recognized the officers’ gold car.</p>

Hence, this is not a case where Appellant is challenging the sufficiency of the evidence for the first time on appeal.

First, under Rule 520(A) of the Juvenile Court Rules, a post-adjudication motion is optional, implying that the failure to raise issues in such a motion may not be sanctioned. This is similar to the optional nature of a post-sentence motion in a criminal proceeding under Rule 720(B) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, unlike a defendant in a criminal proceeding, if a juvenile fails to raise a sufficiency challenge before the juvenile court, and the claim is found to be waived on appeal, the juvenile cannot raise such a challenge under the Post Conviction Relief Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> because that act does not, by its terms, apply to juvenile proceedings. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543 (petitioner must be convicted of a crime); <em>see also In the Interest of Smith, </em><a href="/pa-super/396/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="396 Pa.

The Majority holds an officer must be the source of the information, which I take it means an officer not in uniform must specifically state aloud that he or she is a police officer and that the individual is the subject of an official investigation of a violation of law. My colleagues base this on the fact that “there is no language in the statute to suggest that the General Assembly intended that an individual’s knowledge could be derived from the surrounding circumstances.” Majority Op., at 660, 39 A.3d at 975. Respectfully, this rationale is misguided.</p>

    <p id="b704-4" data-blocks='[["BL_704.4",704,[271,544,1151,365]]]'>The Majority’s statement is also amiss in that the individual’s knowledge is not an element of the crime in the first place. The required element is what I will for sake of expedience refer to as pronouncement of authority and purpose.

    <p id="b704-5" data-blocks='[["BL_704.5",704,[270,935,1151,574]]]'>Pronouncement of authority and purpose is required by notions of due process — you cannot be convicted of lying to a policeman if you are not on notice that it is a policeman. The purpose of the pronouncement element is to ensure that knowledge, but where knowledge already exists, it becomes at most a perfunctory act. Here, the officers’ identity and purpose were known in fact, pronounced, and made obvious to all from their appearance and their actions.

The officers ordered D.S. and his companions to put their hands up. They patted them down. They ordered them against the fence while questioning them. They asked D.S. about his identity and his mother’s whereabouts — D.S. responded by shouting profanities and telling them he did not have to answer, which is not only true but reflective of his knowledge of who he was talking to.

The only way this was not sufficient is for us to inject a requirement that there be a verbalized proclamation, something that the legislature did not put in the statute— verbalization simply is not an element set forth therein. Of course a verbal announcement would satisfy this element, but in the reality of the moment, it would have been a superfluous and needless pronouncement. What is required by the statute is that the officer identifies himself and his purpose — there is no requirement how that identification must be made.</p>

However, when identity and purpose are clearly recognized by any reasonable sentient person, and in fact were manifestly understood by this less-than-naive subject and the attendant crowd of jeering onlookers, the circumstances afford sufficient proof that the officers identified themselves and their purpose.
