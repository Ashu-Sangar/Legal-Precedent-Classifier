When they first arrived, police found Mrs. Hammon alone on the front porch. Despite appearing "somewhat frightened,” Mrs. Hammon told police that nothing was wrong, but gave them permission to enter the house. Upon entering the house, police observed broken glass on the floor, and Mr. Hammon indicated that he and his wife had been in an argument. When Mrs. Hammon came back inside, one of the officers stayed with Mr. Hammon in the kitchen, and another officer went into the living room with Mrs. Hammon and again asked her what had happened. Appellant contends that the circumstances surrounding Geist’s interview with A.A. were more formal than those in <em>Hammon </em>because, <em>inter alia, </em>A.A. had not been in Appellant's custody for a week, and A.A. and Appellant "were geographically separated by a distance greater than the room next door.” Appellant’s Supplemental Brief at 58. We do not agree. As discussed above, Geist interviewed A.A. on the same day that Appellant suggested she was responsible for harming J.A. Moreover, in the <em>Hammon </em>appeal in <em>Davis, </em>the police officer "insisted that [the husband] stay separated from Mrs. Hammon so that [the police could] investigate what had happened.” <em>Davis, </em><a href="/us/547/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="547 U.S. 813" data-case-ids="3275498" data-case-paths="/us/547/0813-01">547 U.S. at 820</a>, <a href="/us/547/0813-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="547 U.S. 813" data-case-ids="3275498" data-case-paths="/us/547/0813-01">126 S.Ct. 2266</a>.

In the prior version of the TYHA, however, the phrase "performed with or on the child by another” arguably could be read to apply only to sexual offenses; under such a reading, the portion of the TYHA relevant to the instant case would have been the same under both versions of the TYHA, since both versions would have permitted out-of-court statements made by a child witness, age 12 or younger, describing physical abuse.

My difficulty, in this regard, is that I agree with Justice Scalia that such perspectives are, in fact, irreconcilable. <em>See <a href="/l-ed-2d/179/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="131 S.
