Curley unwittingly agreed. On April 18, 1995, at 4:00 a.m., Appellant arrived at the Mack/Hunsinger residence, accompanied by Regina Clark, with whom Appellant had a romantic relationship, and Clark’s nine year-old son, Austin Hopper. Melissa Mack had the opportunity to observe Clark and her son while they stayed in Mack’s home. It is unclear why Appellant chose Clark to be the victim of Curley’s first killing.</p>

Curley again told Appellant that he did not want to kill Clark, to which Appellant responded, “kill or be killed.” N.T. Mar. 28, 1996, Vol. VII at 47.

Curley drove to that location with Clark and Hopper, and pointed a gun to the back of Clark’s head. Neither Clark nor Hopper observed the gun. Curley, however, could not pull the trigger, and, instead drove Clark and Hopper back to the restaurant to join Appellant.</p>

Hours later, Curley proceeded to the Schraders’ residence, accompanied by Appellant, Clark, and Hopper. Everyone entered the Schraders’ home, with the exception of Curley, who remained in the garage. Appellant and Kirk Schrader later joined Curley in the garage to discuss ways to kill Clark. When Curley told Appellant that he did not think he could execute the plan, Appellant responded that Curley had to kill Clark. Ultimately, Curley waited in the garage alone, and when Clark entered, shot her three times in the head. Curley then placed Clark in the trunk of his car. Appellant came to the garage to check Clark’s pulse, and believed she was still alive. Appellant' then suggested that Curley slit Clark’s throat. Curley grabbed a knife, and then he and Kirk Schrader entered the car and drove off, hearing a thumping noise emanating from the trunk.</p>

When he arrived, Appellant told Curley that Clark’s nine year-old son, Austin Hopper, was a “loose link,” and had to be killed. Shortly thereafter, Curley accompanied Hopper to the garage, and shot Hopper three times in the head and twice in the body. Curley then drove to “Snake Road,” and placed the child’s body in a sluice pipe.</p>

Melissa Mack, with whom Appellant, Curley, and Clark had stayed prior to the killings, heard a news broadcast, which indicated that a woman’s body wearing particular clothing had been discovered one-half mile from Mack’s home. Mack recognized the clothing as that worn by Clark on the day of the shooting, and called police. Mack later identified the body discovered in the refrigerator as Clark’s, and told police that Clark had been travelling with a child. Mack further consented to a search of her home, which revealed, <em>inter alia, </em>a lock and bullets.</p>

He also revealed Appellant’s involvement in the crimes, and disclosed where they had discarded the murder weapon. At 11:00 p.m. that evening, the police found Austin Hopper’s body, and later recovered from Twin Ponds the gun and knife used in the murders. The police thereafter arrested Curley and charged him with the first degree murders of Clark and Hopper, various counts of criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, and aggravated assault, and one count each of endangering the welfare of a child and possession of an instrument of crime. The police also subsequently arrested Appellant for the first degree murders of Clark and Hopper, and charged him with related offenses.

To demonstrate Appellant’s criminal liability for the first degree murders of Clark and Hopper based on a conspiracy and accomplice theory, the Commonwealth presented Curley’s testimony, which described in detail Appellant’s participation in the crimes. Curley informed the jury that in exchange for his testimony against Appellant, the Commonwealth would stipulate in Curley’s upcoming penalty proceeding that his cooperation served as mitigating evidence. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of Kirk Schrader, whose involvement in this matter has its own prolix history, which is explained fully <em>infra </em>at 135-38. Schrader testified that he observed Curley and Appellant discuss plans to kill Clark on the day of the murders. He explained that later that day, he heard gunshots being fired in his garage and saw Curley in the garage with his arm extended. The cars in the garage purportedly blocked Schrader’s view of Curley’s gun and Clark.

The court reasoned that it was not inconsistent to argue in Appellant’s trial that he solicited Curley to commit murder, and argue in Curley’s trial that Curley was not under duress and acted with free will.

Thus, the PCRA court concluded that there was no undisclosed agreement that might have served to impeach Schrader, and no undisclosed exculpatory evidence.

On direct appeal, counsel reasserted the claim and argued that the trial court erred by failing to remove Juror Smith. This Court disagreed, finding that the trial court acted within its discretion by refusing to remove Smith because the relationship between Juror Smith and Curley was attenuated, and Smith came forward to disclose the relationship and to assure the court that it would not affect her ability to act impartially. <em>Koehler, </em><a href="/a2d/737/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="737 A.2d 225" data-case-ids="11567965,838553" data-case-paths="/a2d/737/0225-01,/pa/558/0334-01">737 A.2d at 238-39</a>.</p>

The Commonwealth effectively cross-examined Dr. Dougherty by reiterating Appellant’s meticulous planning, execution, and cover-up of the murders, and questioning the mental health expert regarding whether such acts were consistent with characteristics of a person who suffers from ADHD, and thereby has difficulty staying on task and <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>completing an assignment. <em>See </em>N.T.

While the scant testimony of Appellant’s mother at Appellant’s penalty trial touched upon these issues, the testimony presented at the PCRA hearing by Glover and Budinas contained much more detail and painted a clearer picture of Appellant’s unfortunate childhood. Such evidence, however, pales in comparison with the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. As noted, in relation to Appellant’s conviction of the first degree murder of Clark, the jury found the aggravating circumstance of conviction of another murder either before or at the time of the offense at issue, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll).

The fact that the second victim was a defenseless child weighs far heavier in aggravation. Accordingly, we reach the inescapable conclusion that there is no reasonable probability that one juror would have struck a different balance and voted not to impose the death penalty for Hopper’s murder if he or she had heard the more detailed life history mitigation evidence set forth at the PCRA hearing.

The federal constitutional standard pertaining to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel places appellate courts in a difficult position where a trial attorney did not do his job. We are to essentially speculate whether each one (and every one) of twelve individuals, having twelve unique mindsets which we cannot know, would have supported a death sentence, had an appropriate defense presentation been made. <em>See Wiggins v.

An appellate no-prejudice finding can mean that a capital defendant will never receive a single trial in which he is represented by competent counsel. Indeed, such a finding is tantamount to a determination that adequate representation is merely beside the point, since the defendant never stood a reasonable chance of avoiding a death verdict in any event. The decision is further complicated by the fact that juries do not return such verdicts in every capital case in which the defendant has committed a heinous murder, or even multiple killings.</p>
