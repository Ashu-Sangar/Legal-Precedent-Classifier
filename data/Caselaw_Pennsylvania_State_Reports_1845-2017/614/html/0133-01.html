Furthermore, and as noted, the Consolidated CDL itself also delineates the consequences of a failure to follow the prescribed procedures in terms of invalidity. <em>See </em>45 Pa.C.S. § 722(c). Accordingly, the Authority’s argument that Section 508’s requirement of an express exemption does not extend beyond the terms of the Consolidated CDL cannot insulate the Authority from the CDL’s core regulatory requirements. At best, the Authority’s main argument turns on the tenuous proposition that Appellees and/or the Commonwealth Court failed to select the correct passages from within an inextricably interrelated statutory scheme in support of their positions <em>(i.e., </em>a passage such as Section 722(c), as to which Section 508’s requirement of an express exemption would apply most directly).</p>

As reflected in the discussion above, in the process of legislative drafting, the General Assembly is faced with a complex landscape of existing statutes, many of which are amenable to differing interpretations by litigants and have yet to be finally interpreted or construed by the courts. Against such a background, the notwithstanding-other-law language serves to emphasize the priority the Legislature places on a contemporaneous pronouncement. In the PPA’s case, in terms of statutes with which the Legislature may have been <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>concerned, one need look no further than the Parking Authorities Law, which appears on its face to center the regulatory decision-making of most municipal parking authorities around “fix[ing], altering], chargting], and collect[ing] rates and other charges.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 5505(d)(9). As such, the Authority simply is asking too much in seeking a construction of the Assembly’s unprecedented decision to vest a parking authority with broad regulatory powers over certain carriers and imbue it with concomitant rulemaking authority “notwithstanding any other provision or law” as necessarily subsuming material corollaries beyond what is manifested in the enabling language.</p>

Since, however, an ambiguity is not tantamount to an express exemption, we reject the PPA’s invitation to discern a derivative exemption from the salient requirements of the CDL. <em>See </em>45 Pa.C.S. § 508.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_28" id="ref_footnote_1_28">28</a>

To the extent that a regulatory void has unfolded, this reasonably may be viewed as a result of the PPA’s failure to take protective measures to maintain the integrity of the regulatory framework it inherited from the PUC throughout the years during which it has been contesting its Commonwealth agency status, <em>see Blount, </em>600 Pa. at 277, 965 A.2d at 226, then litigating the fallback position that it was otherwise exempted from the rulemaking requirements applicable to Commonwealth agencies.

Section 22(1) dovetails with Section 22(2)'s extension of the validity of PUC regulations, orders, programs, and policies indefinitely into the Authority's tenure. In light of these explicit transfer-related provisions, it is difficult to afford any credence to the PPA's repeated refrain that it "was not explicitly empowered to enforce any of the PUC’s regulations[,] orders, programs and policies or the Public Utility Code itself.” Brief for the PPA at 39.</p>

The circuitousness arises from the interdependence of the Authority’s argument with its success on its central claim that it is not otherwise subject to the CDL. To the degree the Authority must, in fact, comply with the CDL, its invalidly promulgated regulations are not to be given any effect for any purpose. <em>See </em>45 P.S. § 1208. Thus, if the CDL applies, the Authority’s invalidly promulgated regulations cannot, in and of themselves, be deemed to have supplanted the PUC’s regulations, which were transferred into the Authority’s regulatory province along with the power to enforce them. <em>See </em>Act 94, §§ 21, 22.</p>
