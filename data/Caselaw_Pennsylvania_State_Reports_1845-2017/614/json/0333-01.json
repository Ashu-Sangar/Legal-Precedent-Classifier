Perry, 32 A.3d 232 (Pa.2011) (sentence can be overturned only if it results from manifest unreasonableness, partiality, bias, ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly erroneous).

Walls, 592 Pa. 557, 926 A.2d 957, 961 (2007), the decision to disturb the intermediate court\u2019s resolution of discretionary sentencing challenges leaves the impression that this Court has disregarded the jurisdictional boundaries imposed by the General Assembly. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9781(f). While I acknowledge that the majority of Justices did not share the similar concern that I expressed in Commonwealth v. Perry, 32 A.3d 232, 242-43 (Pa.2011) (Saylor, J., dissenting), the reliance on that case to vacate the Superior Court\u2019s order in the present matter only reinforces such impression. By their very nature, sentencing decisions are informed by the individual facts of each case, and this Court\u2019s inclination to summarily vitiate the Superior Court\u2019s reasonableness assessment of a sentence under a distinct factual paradigm, in my opinion, resembles a circumvention of the limitations of Section 9781(f).",
