Is conspiracy to commit third-degree murder a cognizable offense under Pennsylvania law?\n2. In the alternative, if conspiracy to commit third-degree murder is not a cognizable offense under Pennsylvania law, did the Superior Court contradict this Court\u2019s precedent by failing to modify the judgment to a cognizable offense, ie., conspiracy to commit aggravated assault?\nIt is further ordered that this appeal is consolidated with the appeals at 142 EAL 2011 and 277 EAL 2011.\nIt is also ordered that Petitioner\u2019s Application for Permission to File Post-Submission Communication Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2501(a) is DISMISSED as moot.\nIt is further ordered that the \u201cWithdraw [sic] of Appearance,\u201d treated as a Motion to Withdraw, filed by Respondent\u2019s counsel is GRANTED and that this matter is REMANDED to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County solely for the trial court to appoint new counsel for Respondent within 30 days. The trial court is directed to notify the Prothonotary of this Court of such appointment, at which time the Prothonotary shall issue a briefing schedule for these consolidated appeals.\nJurisdiction is retained.",
