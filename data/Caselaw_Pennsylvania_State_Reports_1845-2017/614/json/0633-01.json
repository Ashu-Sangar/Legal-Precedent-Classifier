        "text": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nIn this discretionary appeal, we consider whether, under Pennsylvania\u2019s Juvenile Act, a juvenile court is required to enter on the record an adjudication of delinquency once it has determined the juvenile committed the acts alleged in the delinquency petition, or whether the court must make an additional finding that the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, prior to entering an adjudication of delinquency. Upon review, we hold that the Juvenile Act requires a juvenile court to find both (1) that the juvenile has committed a delinquent act; and (2) that the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, before the juvenile court may enter an adjudication of delinquency. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.\nOn July 28, 2007, the Commonwealth filed a delinquency petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County against M.W., alleging that he and another youth robbed an individual who had just left a local bar. At an adjudicatory hearing on August 14, 2007, before the Honorable Brenda Frazier-Clemons, the juvenile court found that M.W. committed the delinquent acts of robbery, conspiracy, and related charges. The juvenile court deferred adjudication, however, placing M.W. on interim probation and continuing the matter to September 5, 2007. Later that same day, M.W. was adjudicated delinquent by another juvenile court judge on a separate delinquency petition, which alleged a misdemeanor theft from a motor vehicle, and M.W. was committed to St. Gabriel\u2019s Hall for treatment, rehabilitation, and supervision. Thereafter, at the September 5 hearing on the first petition, Judge Frazier-Clemons discharged the delinquency petition stemming from the robbery offense, noting that M.W. \u201cwill be adjudicated on the [theft] petition. He will still receive treatment and supervision.\u201d N.T. Hearing, 9/5/07, at 9.\nThe Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied, and the Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, wherein it argued that the juvenile court abused its discretion and violated the requirements of the Juvenile Act by failing to adjudicate M.W. delinquent once it found that M.W. had committed the acts alleged in the delinquency petition. On April 23, 2009, a three-judge panel of the Superior Court reversed. M.W. filed a petition for reargument en banc, which was granted on July 1, 2009, and the Superior Court withdrew its original decision that same day. On April 28, 2010, in a published opinion, the en banc panel of the Superior Court reversed and remanded for entry of an adjudication of delinquency against M.W. In doing so, the Superior Court first considered the language of the Juvenile Act, stating:\nUnder the Juvenile Act, a juvenile proceeding may commence when a petition is filed indicating a juvenile has committed delinquent acts. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6321(a)(3).... After the filing of a petition, the juvenile court holds an adjudicatory hearing at which evidence on the petition for delinquency is heard. \u201cAfter hearing the evidence on the petition [for delinquency,] the court shall make and file its findings as to whether ... the acts ascribed to the child were committed by him.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(a). \u201cIf the court finds that ... the allegations of delinquency have not been established!,] it shall dismiss the petition and order the child discharged from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered in the proceeding.\u201d Id. Conversely, \u201c[i]f the court finds on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed the acts by reason of which he is alleged to be delinquent!,] it shall enter such finding on the record and shall specify the particular offenses, including the grading and counts thereof which the child is found to have committed.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6341(b).\nAfter the juvenile court has entered an adjudication of delinquency on the record, the court must hold a hearing to determine a disposition which is \u201cconsistent with the protection of the public interest and best suited to the child\u2019s treatment, supervision, rehabilitation, and welfare!.]\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6352(a).\nCommonwealth v. In Interest of M.W., 994 A.2d 620, 622 (Pa.Super.2010) (en banc) (emphasis and alterations original) (case citations omitted).\nThe court below also considered its prior holdings in the companion cases of In the Interest of M.M., 870 A.2d 385 (Pa.Super.2005), and Commonwealth v. In the Interest of D.M., 870 A.2d 383 (Pa.Super.2005). In those cases, two juveniles committed a series of ear thefts which resulted in eight separate delinquency petitions against them. The juvenile court entered adjudications of delinquency on two of the petitions, finding that the juveniles were in need of supervision, treatment, and rehabilitation. The juvenile court deferred adjudication on the remaining six petitions to allow the juveniles to perform community service and make restitution on the first two petitions. Two months later, the juvenile court dismissed the six outstanding petitions, finding the juveniles did not need additional supervision, treatment, or rehabilitation because they had already received the necessary treatment The Commonwealth appealed, and the Superior Court determined that the juvenile court erred in dismissing the six petitions because \u201cthe Juvenile Act requires the court to adjudicate a child delinquent when it is proven that the child ... committed the acts which formed the basis of the petition for delinquency.\u201d M.M., 870 A.2d at 388; D.M., 870 A.2d at 385.\nIn the instant case, the Superior Court concluded:\nBased upon the plain language of the Juvenile Act and this Court\u2019s holdings in M.M. and DM., we hold that after a petition for delinquency has been filed, the juvenile court must determine whether the juvenile committed the acts alleged in the petition. If the court finds that the juvenile has committed the acts which underlie the petition, it must enter an adjudication of delinquency on the record. After the entry of an adjudication of delinquency, the juvenile court must then determine whether the child requires treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation so as to protect the public interest.\nM.W., 994 A.2d at 623-24 (emphasis original). Thus, the court vacated the juvenile court\u2019s dismissal of the delinquency petition and remanded the case to the juvenile court with the instruction that the juvenile court first enter an adjudication of delinquency against M.W. on the record, and then consider M.W.\u2019s need for treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, and enter a separate dispositional order with respect thereto.\nIn a Concurring Opinion, Judge Christine Donohue agreed that, in light of the juvenile court\u2019s determination that M.W. committed the crime charged and was in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, the court \u201cerred in failing to adjudicate M.W. delinquent.\u201d Id. at 625 (Donohue, J., concurring). Judge Donohue disagreed, however, with the majority\u2019s determination \u201cthat the Juvenile Act requires an adjudication of delinquency based solely upon a finding by the trial court that the juvenile committed the acts underlying the petition.\u201d Id. Judge Donohue noted that Section 6302 of the Juvenile Act defines a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d as \u201c[a] child ten years of age or older whom the court has found to have committed a delinquent act and is need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation,\u201d id. (emphasis original), and, in accordance with that definition, concluded an adjudication of delinquency requires both a finding that the child has committed the delinquent act alleged in the petition for delinquency, and a finding that the child is in need of treatment or rehabilitation.\nJudge Donohue further observed that the majority quoted only the first sentence of Section 6341(b) of the Juvenile Act in support of its determination that the juvenile court is required to enter an adjudication of delinquency upon a finding that the juvenile committed the acts alleged in the petition:\n[TJhis [sentence describes] only one part of the procedure set forth by our Legislature to determine the proper treatment (if any) for children who commit acts that would be considered crimes if they were adults. After determining that the child committed the act complained of beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial court must then, either immediately or at a postponed hearing, receive evidence regarding whether the child is need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation. If the juvenile court finds that the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation, it must adjudicate the child delinquent and order the appropriate care and treatment in accordance with the purposes of the Juvenile Act. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(b). \u201cIf the court finds that the child is not in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation it shall dismiss the proceeding and discharge the child from any detention or any other restriction theretofore ordered.\u201d Id. This statutory language belies the contention that only a finding of guilt is required for an adjudication of delinquency.\nId. at 625-26.\nFinally, Judge Donohue observed that, even where a juvenile is found to have committed an act that would be considered a felony if committed by an adult, the juvenile court is not required to impose treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation in all cases. Rather, she noted Section 6341(b) provides that \u201cin the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts which constitute a felony shall be sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation,\u201d id. at 622-23, suggesting that, where there is evidence that the juvenile does not need treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, a finding that the child committed the alleged offenses does not require an adjudication of delinquency.\nM.W. filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, and we granted review limited to the following issue:\nDoes the Juvenile Act require a juvenile court to enter on the record an adjudication of delinquency once the court finds that the juvenile has committed the acts alleged in the delinquency petition, or is an additional finding that the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation necessary to enter an adjudication of delinquency?\nCommonwealth v. In Interest of M.W., 608 Pa. 140, 10 A.3d 899 (2010) (order).\nThis appeal requires us to interpret the Juvenile Act; thus, our review is plenary and non-deferential. See Common wealth v. Zortman, 611 Pa. 22, 23 A.3d 519, 523-24 (2011) (questions of statutory construction present pure questions of law, over which our review is de novo). Upon review, we conclude the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of the Juvenile Act was erroneous, and, consistent with the position expressed by Judge Donohue and Judge Bowes below, we hold that a juvenile court must determine (1) that the juvenile committed the delinquent acts alleged; and (2) that the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, before it may enter an adjudication of delinquency.\nUnder the Juvenile Act, a juvenile proceeding may be commenced, inter alia, by the filing of a petition alleging that the juvenile has committed delinquent acts. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6321(a)(3). Once a petition has been filed, the juvenile court conducts an adjudicatory hearing at which evidence on the delinquency petition is heard. Pa.R.J.C.P. 401. Within seven days of hearing evidence on the delinquency petition, the juvenile court must determine whether the juvenile committed the acts ascribed to the child. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(a). If the juvenile court finds that the allegations of delinquency have not been established, it must dismiss the delinquency petition. Id. If, however, the court concludes the juvenile committed the delinquent acts alleged in the delinquency petition, it must enter such finding on the record, specifying the particular offense, including the grading and counts thereof, which the juvenile is found to have committed. Upon finding the juvenile committed the delinquent acts ascribed to him, the court must then determine whether the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation; it is this requirement, and the implications thereof, which we address further below.\nM.W. contends that the Superior Court\u2019s determination is inconsistent with the plain language of Section 6341(b) and the definition of delinquent child set forth in Section 6302 of the Juvenile Act. According to M.W., these sections, when read together, require that two conditions be satisfied before a juvenile court may enter an adjudication of delinquency. First, \u201cthere must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child has committed a delinquent act,\u201d and second, \u201cthe child must be in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12 (internal quotations omitted). In support of his argument, M.W. relies on the Superior Court\u2019s decision in In the Interest of Dreslinski, 254 Pa.Super. 539, 386 A.2d 81 (1978), wherein the court held that both of those conditions must be satisfied. Id. at 82.\nThe Commonwealth, in its brief, does not challenge M.W.\u2019s interpretation of the Juvenile Act. Indeed, the Commonwealth concedes, \u201c[t]he Superior Court\u2019s opinion is potentially confusing\u201d due to the manner in which it used the term \u201cadjudication of delinquency,\u201d and further acknowledges that the Superior Court\u2019s opinion \u201ccould lead to misapplication of the law.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 13-14. Thus, the Commonwealth indicates that it \u201cdoes not oppose clarification\u201d that \u201cthe Juvenile Act does not mandate a finding that a [child] who is found to have committed a delinquent act must, for that reason alone, be found to be a delinquent child.\u201d Id. at 14 (emphasis omitted). Notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement that the Superior Court\u2019s language requires clarification, the Commonwealth maintains that \u201cthe substance of the Superior Court\u2019s ruling need not be disturbed,\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 14, because the juvenile court believed that M.W. was, in fact, in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. Id. at 12 (\u201c[T]he juvenile court discharged the petition without an adjudication of delinquency, not because it believed [M.W.] could do without treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, but because another judge had already determined that he was delinquent and committed him to a residential placement appropriate to the facts in that case.\u201d (emphasis original)).\nWhen interpreting the language of a statute, we are guided by the polestar principle that we must ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the statute. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). In so doing, we must give effect to all of the provisions. Id. Further, \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1921(b). Generally, the best indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting a statute may be found in its plain language. Martin v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 588 Pa. 429, 438, 905 A.2d 438, 443 (2006).\nRegrettably, the Juvenile Act is not a model of clarity. However, when considered in accordance with these well-established principles of statutory construction, we conclude the Juvenile Act requires a juvenile court to find that a child has committed a delinquent act and that the child is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, before the court may enter an adjudication of delinquency.\nSection 6341 provides, in relevant part:\n\u00a7 6341. Adjudication\n(a) General rule. \u2014 After hearing the evidence on the petition the court shall make and file its findings as to whether the child is a dependent child. If the petition alleges that the child is delinquent, within seven days of hearing the evidence on the petition, the court shall make and file its findings whether the acts ascribed to the child were committed by him---- If the court finds that the child is not a dependent child or that the allegations of delinquency have not been established it shall dismiss the petition and order the child discharged from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered in the proceeding....\n(b) Finding of delinquency. \u2014 If the court finds on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed the acts by reason of which he is alleged to be delinquent it shall enter such finding on the record and shall specify the particular offenses, including the grading and counts thereof which the child is found to have committed. The court shall then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing, which shall occur not later than 20 days after such findingt[] if the child is in detention or not more than 60 days after such finding if the child is not in detention, to hear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation and to make and file its findings thereon.[] This time limitation may only be extended pursuant to the agreement of the child and the attorney for the Commonwealth. The court\u2019s failure to comply with the time limitations stated in this section shall not be grounds for discharging the child or dismissing the proceeding. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts which constitute a felony shall be sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation. If the court finds that the child is not in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation it shall dismiss the proceeding and discharge the child from any detention or other restriction theretofore ordered.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341.\nAs detailed above, Section 6341 is comprised of several subsections, including subsection (a), captioned \u201cGeneral Rule,\u201d and subsection (b), captioned \u201cFinding of delinquency.\u201d The first sentence of subsection (b) provides: \u201cIf the court finds on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the child committed the acts by reason of which he is alleged to be delinquent it shall enter such finding on the record and shall specify the particular offenses.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(b). Thus, the court must first make a specific finding as to whether the child committed the acts alleged, and enter that finding on the record.\nPursuant to the second sentence of subsection (b), if the court determines that the child committed the acts alleged in the delinquency petition, the court must, within 20 days if the child is in detention or within 60 days if the child is not in detention, \u201chear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation and [ ] make and file its findings thereon.\u201d Id. This is a separate and distinct finding from whether the child committed the acts alleged.\nThe fact that subsection (b) identifies two separate inquiries relevant to a \u201cfinding of delinquency\u201d suggests that the juvenile court may adjudicate a child delinquent only if it finds that the child committed the acts alleged and that the child is need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. Indeed, the Official Comment to Section 6341 confirms this construction:\nThis section is derived from Section 29 of the [Uniform Law Commissioners\u2019 Model Juvenile Court Act], where it is noted that, \u201c... when delinquency ... is alleged, the court must find further that the child is need of treatment or rehabilitation before the dispositions authorized by the Act can be resorted to.\u201d\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341 official cmt. (emphasis added).\nMoreover, this construction is mandated by the Juvenile Act\u2019s definition of \u201cdelinquent child\u201d in Section 6302 as \u201c[a] child ten years of age or older whom the court has found to have committed a delinquent act and is need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6302 (emphasis added). This definition of \u201cdelinquent child\u201d clearly is implicated in Section 6341(b.l), which pertains to the requirements for school notification \u201c[u]pon finding a child to be a delinquent child.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(b.l).\nFinally, our juvenile rules, which are to be construed to effectuate the purposes of the Juvenile Act, see Pa.R.J.C.P. 101(C), implement this same two-prong evaluation that a juvenile court must undertake before entering an adjudication of delinquency. Specifically, Rule 408 (Ruling on Offenses) of the Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure, provides in part:\nA. Entered finding. Within seven days of hearing the evidence on the petition or accepting an admission under Rule 407, the court shall enter a finding by specifying which, if any, offenses, including grading and counts, alleged in the petition were committed by the juvenile.\nB. Did not commit acts.\n(1) If the court finds the juvenile did not commit all of the alleged delinquent acts, the court shall dismiss the petition and release the juvenile, if detained, unless there are other grounds for the juvenile\u2019s detention.\nC. Committed act. If the court finds that the juvenile committed any delinquent act, the court shall proceed as provided in Rule 409.\nPa.R.J.C.P. 408. Rule 409 of the Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure, titled \u201cAdjudication of Delinquency,\u201d then provides, in part:\nA. Adjudicating the juvenile delinquent. Once the court has ruled on the offenses as provided in Rule 408, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine if the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation.\n(1) Not in need. If the court determines that the juvenile is not in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, the court shall enter an order providing that:\n(a) Jurisdiction shall be terminated and the juvenile shall be released, if detained, unless there are other reasons for the juvenile\u2019s detention; and\n(b) Any fingerprints and photographs taken shall be destroyed.\n(2) In need.\n(a) If the court determines that the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, the court shall enter an order adjudicating the juvenile delinquent and proceed in determining a proper disposition under Rule 512.\n(b) The court also shall order the law enforcement agency that submitted the written allegation [to take certain steps].\nPa.R.J.C.P. 409(A). The comment to Rule 409 clarifies that \u201c[t]his rule addresses adjudicating the juvenile delinquent or releasing the juvenile from the court\u2019s jurisdiction. This determination is different from finding the juvenile committed a delinquent act under Rule 408.\u201d Pa.R.J.C.P. 409 cmt.\nOur Rules of Juvenile Court Procedure 408 and 409 thus align with and fully support our conclusion that, under the Juvenile Act, in order to adjudicate a child delinquent, the juvenile court must (1) determine that the juvenile has committed a delinquent act, and (2) determine that the juvenile requires treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. A determination that a child has committed a delinquent act does not, on its own, warrant an adjudication of delinquency.\nIn light of the above, we are constrained to conclude the Superior Court erred in its interpretation of the Juvenile Act and the requirements for an adjudication of delinquency thereunder. To the extent the Superior Court\u2019s decisions in M.M. and D.M. are inconsistent with our holding, they are hereby disapproved.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order directing the juvenile court, upon remand, to enter an adjudication of delinquency against M.W. Instead, the juvenile court should, on remand, first determine whether M.W. is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. If the juvenile court finds that M.W. is so in need, only then should the court enter an adjudication of delinquency. If, however, the court concludes that M.W. is not in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation, it should dismiss the proceeding, terminate jurisdiction, and discharge M.W.\nOrder reversed. Case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices SAYLOR, EAKIN and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Chief Justice CASTILLE and Justice McCAFFERY join.\n. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6365.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3701.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 903.\n. The Superior Court, in its opinion below, indicates that M.W. was adjudicated delinquent based on \u201cthe theft of a motor vehicle.\u201d Commonwealth v. In Interest of M.W., 994 A.2d 620, 621 (Pa.Super.2010) (emphasis added). According to the record, however, the underlying charge against M.W. was theft from a motor vehicle, not the theft of the vehicle itself.\n. Judge Donohue\u2019s conclusion that the juvenile court found M.W. in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation appears to be based on the juvenile court\u2019s statement that M.W. \"was ordered to undergo treatment, supervision and rehabilitation on [the theft] petition which would address his needs and requirements,\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 4/25/08, at 3, as the juvenile court did not make an express finding in this regard on the robbery delinquency petition.\n. Judge Mary Jane Bowes concurred in the result of the Majority Opinion and joined Judge Donohue\u2019s Concurring Opinion.\n. Prior to 2002, Section 6341(b) provided: \"If the court finds ... the child committed the acts ... it shall enter such finding on the record and it shall then proceed immediately or at a postponed hearing, which shall occur not later than 20 days after adjudication if the child is in detention, to hear evidence as to whether the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation and to make and file its findings thereon.\" 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(b) (2000) (emphasis added). In 2002, the Legislature, inter alia, replaced the reference to \"adjudication\u201d with \"such finding\u201d in 2002. See Act of Dec. 9, 2002, P.L. 1705, No. 215, \u00a7 3.\n. Neither party in this case suggests that the hearings in this matter were not conducted within the requisite time period.\n. This is so even where the delinquent act constitutes a felony because, while the commission of such an act presumptively supports a finding that the juvenile is in need of treatment and supervision (and thus can be adjudicated delinquent), the juvenile court must still make that finding after allowing for other evidence. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6341(b) (\"In the absence of evidence to the contrary, evidence of the commission of acts which constitute a felony shall be sufficient to sustain a finding that the child is in need of treatment, supervision or rehabilitation.\u201d).",

        "text": "Justice BAER,\nconcurring.\nTo the extent the Majority reasons that the Juvenile Act and the Rules of Juvenile Procedure employ a two-step process regarding a child\u2019s adjudication of delinquency, I join its opinion in full. I write to express my position that the juvenile court below, and, respectfully, the Majority to a lesser extent, have conflated the procedural mechanism by which juveniles are adjudicated delinquent and then subsequently subject to disposition, and ordered, if necessary, to undergo treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation. My reasoning follows.\nAs the Majority notes, Rules 408 and 409 of the Rules of Juvenile Procedure explicitly outline that a juvenile court must make two specific findings before adjudicating a child delinquent. First, the court must determine whether, on the petition then before it, a child actually committed a delinquent act. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 408(A); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(a). This finding must specify \u201cwhich, if any, offenses, including grading and counts, alleged in the petition were committed by the juvenile.\u201d Pa.R.J.C.P. 408(A); see also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(b). \u201cIf the court finds that the juvenile committed any delinquent act, the court shall proceed as provided in Rule 409.\u201d Pa. R.J.C.P. 408(C). Only after this initial finding that a juvenile committed a delinquent act, shall a court \u201cconduct a hearing to determine if the juvenile is in need of treatment, supervision, or rehabilitation\u201d (hereinafter \u201ctreatment\u201d). Id. 409(A). This evaluation regarding a child\u2019s need for treatment is distinguishable from the inquiry made at a Section 6352/Rule 512 disposition hearing, which is discussed below. The issue before the court at the Section 6341/Rule 408-409 adjudication of delinquency phase is only whether the child is in need of treatment, in the abstract; rather than what treatment should be provided or is already being provided through a separate source.\nThus, upon the conclusion of the adjudication hearing, the court has two options. If it finds that a child committed a delinquent act but is not in need of treatment, the court should dismiss the delinquency petition, release the juvenile, and destroy all fingerprints and photographs. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 409(A)(l)(a)-(b); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6841(b). If the court finds that the child committed a delinquent act and is in need of treatment, regardless of how or where it might be provided, it shall adjudicate the child delinquent. See Pa.R.J.C.P. 409(A)(2); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(b). If the court makes such a finding of delinquency, Rule 409(A)(2)(a) specifically directs that it is to proceed to determine the proper disposition under Section 6352/Rule 512.\nThe importance of this discussion is that Section 6341, and Rules 408 and 409 concern only a juvenile court\u2019s inquiry into whether a child committed a delinquent act and whether that act necessitates a theoretical need for treatment. If so, in accord with the Act and the Rules, the child is to be adjudicated delinquent. These provisions do not concern whether the child is already receiving treatment, as was the case in the matter before us.\nIf the court finds the child delinquent, Rule 409(A)(2)(a) directs it to conduct a \u201cdispositional hearing\u201d pursuant to Section 6352/Rule 512. This hearing, which is distinct from the adjudication proceeding, is where a \u201ccourt shall enter its findings and conclusions of law into the record\u201d regarding, inter alia, the disposition of the child, the reasons for that disposition, the \u201cterms, conditions, and limitations of the disposition,\u201d and \u201cwhether any evaluations, tests, counseling, or treatments are necessary.\u201d Pa.R.J.C.P. 512(D)(l)-(3), (5). Such disposition may include any number of conditions, including probation, commitment to a juvenile detention facility, or maintenance of the child\u2019s status quo. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6352(a). Accordingly, it is at this stage, and this stage only, where a juvenile court may look to treatment a delinquent child is already undergoing and determine if that treatment is suffident to ameliorate the conditions leading to the current offense.\nThe importance of keeping adjudication and disposition distinct is exemplified by legislation recently enacted by the General Assembly. Under the provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, newly passed by the legislature, see Pub.L. No. 2011-111 (Dec. 20, 2011) (effective Feb. 20, 2012), a juvenile adjudicated delinquent for various sex crimes may be forced to register with the Pennsylvania State Police as a sex offender. See e.g. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.15(a) (effective Feb. 20, 2012). Like-wise, juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent for felony sex offenses are required to submit blood samples for the State DNA Data Base and Data Bank. See 44 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2316. In both cases, a court\u2019s peculiar disposition is of no relevance to these requirements.\nThese examples of collateral consequences are provided to emphasize the importance of separating adjudication of delinquency, in accord with Section 6341 and Rules 408 and 409, and disposition, pursuant to Section 6352 and Rule 512. While it may appear cumbersome to consider the abstract need for treatment as part of the adjudication of delinquency process under Section 6341(b)/Rule 409(A), and then consider the actual need for treatment when determining disposition under Section 6352(a)/Rule 512, this is exactly what the law and rules envision.\nAlthough it is entirely understandable how the very busy juvenile court in this case truncated the procedure by considering both the abstract need for treatment component of an adjudication of delinquency and the actual need for treatment component of a disposition, this conflation has the potential to impact the collateral consequences of delinquency, as explained above. I, therefore, respectfully caution our juvenile trial courts to maintain this distinction which, I believe the Majority envisioned, and which is set out with particularity herein.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justice McCAFFERY join this opinion.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6365.\n. The Juvenile Act itself contains a latent disconnect in that, unlike Rule 409, the Act contains no specific provision directing juvenile courts to conduct a dispositional hearing following the adjudication of delinquency. Rule 409(A)(2)(a) bridges the gap, however, such that the precise procedure to be followed is clear to the courts.",
