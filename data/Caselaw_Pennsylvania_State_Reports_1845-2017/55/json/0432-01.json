        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, October 31st 1867, by\nAgnew, J.\n\u2014 This is not a case of contract. A conscript, unlike a volunteer, enters the service compulsorily. There is no point in the progress of the draft where he can stop and say, I will not serve unless I obtain a bounty. In the absence of an express agreement, there is no ground upon which the law can imply his consent to serve for the offered reward. The decided cases applicable to volunteers do not govern this. If sustainable at all, it must be supported only on the ground of a debt or duty virtute statuti. But the Act of 15th March 1865, Pamph. L. 24, leaves it wholly discretionary as to the payment of bounties to drafted men. It may be paid to the family instead of the conscript, and at such time and in such sums as the authorities deem it proper. The resolution of the school board of Guilford, passed upon the 25th of March 1865, after Zumbro was drawn, was not a resolution to pay a bounty to any one, but a determination only to proceed to levy a tax sufficient to pay bounties to drafted men. But the authorities stopped there \u2014 made no levy and collected no tax for this purpose. They dropped the proceeding, and who was there to compel them to go on ? No one had acquired an interest by appropriation to himself or to a class of which he was one. No court would award a mandamus against the directors, and certainly it could find no elements to support a contract or raise a duty.\nBy the terms of the stated case, judgment for the plaintiff can be entered only in the event of the court being of opinion that he is entitled to recover. Pie must satisfy us, therefore, that the facts stated raise a contract or a duty to pay. The facts do not warrant this conclusion, and judgment must, therefore, be reversed.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment for the defendant below upon the case stated.",

On the 25th of March 1865 the school directors of the district passed this resolution: \u201c That the board agree to levy another tax sufficiently large enough to give each drafted man who furnishes a substitute or who enters the service himself the amount of $350.\u201d On the 4th of April Zumbro'reported to the provost-marshal, was regularly mustered into the service on the 5th of April and continued therein till honorably discharged, July 22d 1865. The township obtained a credit for the plaintiff in filling her quota.\nOn these facts the plaintiff claimed the bounty of $350, and the court gave judgment in his favor for that sum.\nThe defendant removed the case to the Supreme Court. The judgment entered by the court was the error assigned.\nF. M. Kimmell, for plaintiff in error,\ncited Act of March 15th 1865, Pamph. L. 24.\nG. W. Brewer, J. McD. Sharpe, J..R.
