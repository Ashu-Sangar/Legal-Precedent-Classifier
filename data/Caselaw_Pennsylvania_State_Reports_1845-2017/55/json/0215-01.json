        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 7th 1868, by\nAsnew, J.\n\u2014 These writs of error have both been taken in the same case, and will be considered together. We agree with the court below that the facts constituted an equitable estoppel, but disagree with them in limiting its extent to those parts of the tract which were settled and improved. Hiram Payne was the owner of tract 4881, which by mistake he supposed to lie upon No. 4880, one range north of the true location of 4881. When he sold 4881 to Morris, he directed him to 4880. Morris was shown 4880 as Payne\u2019s land, and bought it and continued to regard it as his own until he sold to Millingar, the plaintiff, who also was shown 4880 as Morris\u2019s land, and bought it. After discovering the error in location be brought this ejectment.\nWhile Payne was the owner of 4881 he was the agent of Messrs. Benzinger & Eschbach, who owned a large tract of adjoining land. Moses McKee was the owner of 711 acres of 4884, whose true location is one tract south of 4881. B. C. Mauer was the owner of the remaining 311 acres of 4884. Payne, as the agent of Benzinger & Eschbach, supposing that 4884 was located on the ground occupied by his own tract 4881, advised them to buy McKee\u2019s part of 4884; and accordingly entered into a contract of purchase himself with McKee; upon which a deed was afterwards made to Benzinger & Eschbach, who paid the money, and the contract was surrendered to McKee\u2019s agent. The deed actually describes the 711 acres as lying in 4881, beginning at the sugar-tree, the south-east corner of 4881, but states the number as 4884. Benzinger & Eschbach, believing themselves to be the owners of this part of 4881, divided it into parcels and sold it, viz., 500 acres on the western side to Yan Marsonville, who conveyed to the Mitchells, two of the defendants, 50 acres, and 36 acres to Haberberger, a defendant, 50 acres to Weiner, a defendant, and 50 acres to Schoebel, a defendant. These sales were all made, deeds delivered and purchase-money received without notice or knowledge of the mistake in the location, and Morris, the owner of 4881, still remaining in the belief that it was located where 4880 lies. Morris bought of Payne in August 1849, and when on his way to visit tract 4880, accompanied by Nelson, the agent of Payne, who was going with him to show it to him as 4881, he was shown, by Nelson, Weiner\u2019s improvement on 4881, which he pointed out as 4884. He was then also informed by Nelson, while passing through 4881 on their way to 4880, that Benzinger & Eschbach were the owners of that tract, and Weiner had bought of them. Nelson was then acting as Payne\u2019s agent, and was going with Morris to show him Payne\u2019s tract, which Morris intended to and did purchase immediately afterwards. According to Nelson\u2019s testimony, Weiner\u2019s improvement consisted of about an acre of land, and he put up a small log-house soon afterwards in the same fall. But according to Payne\u2019s testimony, the improvements on the tract were commenced as early as 1845 or 1846, and had grown to considerable size in 1849. It is thought Payne is contradicted by the date of the deed to Benzinger & Eschbach, in August 1847: But as there was a precedent contract of purchase, this is not satisfactory. Some of the vendees of Benzinger & Eschbach were in possession at least as early as 1849, and before Morris bought. Since that time Schoebel\u2019s improvements have been increased so largely, that they were valued at $6000. He bought out Weiner, and his improvements are upon his own purchase and that of Weiner. Haberberger\u2019s improvements were valued at $4000 or $4500. The 500 acres owned by the Mitchells are unimproved. It is very clear that all the parties have acted in utter ignorance of the true location of their lands. Payne, and Morris, his vendee, believed that 4880 was 4881; and Benzinger and their vendees believed that 4881 was 4884; and all have continued to act accordingly. But Payne\u2019s act was a positive one, and misled all the others, he advised his principals to buy his own tract, he made the contract with McKee for it, he took the deed for it to his principals, and they paid the money for it. They actually purchased 4881, though denominating it as 4884. They did not intend to buy 4884 but 4881 as it lay on the ground. It was 4881 with all its natural advantages they intended to obtain, and their deed describes it in fact except in the number. Not only did they buy 4881 in fact, but they afterwards divided and sold it out in parcels, making conveyances and receiving payment. Their condition is such they cannot retrace their steps if they would. They are bound by their conveyances, and some of their vendees have expended large sums of money on the faith of their title. Under these circumstances Payne would be estopped as to the whole purchase of Benzinger & Eschbach. He misled them to their injury not only in expending their own money upon the purchase of 4881, but in placing themselves in a false- position towards their own vendees. To permit him now-to prove the truth of his title to 4881 would involve them not only in the loss of the land itself they were induced to purchase and pay for, but would subject them to strife and litigation with their vendees. For these reasons we think the court below erred in confining the estoppel to those parts of the tract in the hands of their vendees who had made valuable improvements upon them. It is impossible to restore Benzinger & Eschbach to the same position they were in -when they were induced by Payne to buy the land. The cases bearing upon the question of equitable estoppel are so numerous I shall only refer to the following as fully sustaining our application of the principle to the facts of the present case: Diamond Coal Co. v. Fisher, 7 Harris 267; Beaupland v. McKeen, 4 Casey 124; McKelvey v. Truby, 4 W. & S. 323 ; Buchanan v. Moore, 13 S. & R. 304; Carr v. Wallace, 7 Watts 394; Lewis v. Carstairs, 6 Whart. 193; Id., 5 W. & S. 209; Commonwealth v. Moltz, 10 Barr 530-31; Hill v. Epley, 7 Casey 333-4; Woods v. Wilson, 1 Wright 379.\nThere is no doubt of the estoppel as against Payne, but is Morris estopped ? He bought with a full knowledge tha.t Benzinger & Eschbach were claiming title to this tract, derived from Payne\u2019s agent while on their way to visit the land he intended to purchase, and then saw himself the improvements of Weiner, their vendee. More than this, he did not intend, in fact, to purchase this tract, for he was shown and actually bought 4880, and continued to claim it as his own until he sold it to Millingar. He stands also in privity with Payne as his alienee, who sold him the land now known as 4880. It is true he was ignorant that his conveyance applied to the land which Payne induced Benzinger & Eschbach to buy, but this does not alter the fact that he did not buy that land, but bought and paid for the land covered by 4880 ; held himself out to the world as its owner, and so sold it to the plaintiff. His acts, as the alienee, united with Payne\u2019s act in keeping up the delusion originated by Payne. Under these circumstances his purchase and continued claim of the tract known now as 4880 were positive acts connected with Payne\u2019s act, characterizing his own continued silence, and this gave it also a positive effect in misleading those who were the professed owners-of 4881. It was not mere silence, but an operative quietude injuriously affecting those in possession of 4881; and its effect is displayed in the extent and value of the improvements which sprang up during his undisturbed and long continued repose. The case is uncommon \u2014 one of mutual error and of great hardship \u2014 but it is a mistake proceeding from one and the same person who misled all the rest, and which cannot now be remedied without great injustice to those who were first misled by Payne. It seems to be a case, therefore, to which we must apply the maxims, prior in tempore potior est in jure \u2014 melior est conditio possidentis. As to the 311 acres in possession of M. & W. Konle and F. X. Long, the case is different. The title to this part came from B. E. Mauer to Horace Little, who sold to the Konles. Payne had nothing to do with this sale, and the doctrine of estoppel, therefore, does not apply.\nIn the writ of error taken by Henry Millingar the judgment is affirmed ; but in that taken by the Mitchells and other defendants, judgment is reversed and a venire de novo is awarded",

X. Sorg for the eastern part of the above lot, containing 202 acres. The foregoing deeds, with the powers of attorney under which some of them were made, were all duly recorded.\nIt was also shown that warrant No. 4880 was located immediately north of 4881, and No. 4884 immediately south of it. It was admitted at the trial that the lots described in the foregoing deeds were in fact located on No. 4881, instead of No. 4884, and that the locations correspond with the descriptions in the deeds, except as to the'number of the warrant. The defendants called Payne, who testified that Benzinger, who owned 10,000 or 12,000 acres there, employed him, in 1844, as his attorney to locate the warrants ; McKee\u2019s tract adjoined Benzinger\u2019s. Under the advice of Payne, Benzinger consented that Payne should purchase MeKee\u2019s lot for him, which he did by a contract to himself, in pursuance of which a deed was made to Benzinger, and the contract delivered up to McKee. Payne afterwards located 4881 and some other lots; and as he \u201c fixed the McKee tract, 4884, West creek crossed it. In 1844 no one resided on this lot.\u201d The improvement on it commenced in 1845. Werner lived on this improvement ; he had in 1852 a log-house and barn. William Nelson, also for defendants, testified that he had been employed by Payne to run out and sell Benzinger\u2019s lands; that he and Morris went to the tract called 4881; that Werner\u2019s improvement was on the tract called No. 4884; that they went through what they called 4884, and in going to what they called 4881 they passed Werner\u2019s improvement, which was about one acre, with a garden. Payne had previously shown- him the lines of what they called 4881 \u2014 the north and south lines on the west end of the warrant; that as he and Morris passed along, Morris made inquiry about the' lands, and Nelson told him they belonged to Benzinger and Eschbach, that Werner had bought them, and that he, Nelson was acting as agent in looking for purchasers ; that he had told Payne he had shown this lot to Morris, and that he was suited with it; he had been sent to show Morris this identical lot; that he had a draft of the lot, which had been given him by Payne; there was no improvement on the lot he had shown to Morris; that Werner had no house on his improvement at that time ; he put a log-house on it in th\u00e9 fall of 1849 ; that the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad passed through what he called 4884; that the south line of the lot which he showed to Morris was north of .West creek; that Gamer, an agent of Benzinger and Eschbach, showed him a draft of these lands. Charles Lahr, a witness for defendants, acted as agent for Morris for about five years, under a power of attorney; Morris was never on the land with him, but from information given him by Morris he found the land just where he had told him, north of the railroad and West creek. Millingar brought a letter to him requesting him to show Millingar the lot, he did not show it, but explained the situation to Millingar as Morris had done to him ; Millingar thought that it was noA the right lot; he told Millingar that the lot did not include any of the defendants\u2019 improvements, and that 4881 was north of the improvements; Morris went to see the land three times whilst he owned it. When Millingar purchased, Schoebel, Haberberger, Sorg and Konle were on the land. Werner had moved away before Millingar bought and Schoebel occupied the Werner improvements. The buildings on Schoebel\u2019s land would cost $6000, on Haberberger\u2019s, $4000, on Sorg\u2019s, $500. Up to the time of trial no one had occupied what the witness called the Morris tract. Werner\u2019s improvement, according to this witness, commenced about 1847, and his brother commenced on the next lot in about two years afterwards. Other witnesses testified as to going past the Werner improvement in about 1856 or 1857 with Morris to what they called 4881, and that the improvement was shown to him. Morris lived in Pitts-burg.\nThe plaintiff, amongst others, submitted the following points: \u2014\n1. Silence will postpone a title when it misleads, and thus becomes fraud, but it will not postpone where the party seeking the postponement on the ground of silence is himself aware of the title nor where it results from ignorance on the part of the owner, nor where with knowledge of his title he is aware that others are making improvements in ignorance of it.\n5. That the location by Payne and Nelson of tract No. 4881 having been made by mistake upon tract No. 4880, the vendee of Payne and his vendee can hold and recover the land where it is admitted to be by the defendants, to wit, in their possession being the land described by plaintiff in his writ in this suit.\n6. Estoppel will only act upon a title when the person to be affected by it has been misled or encouraged to expend money and make improvements by the act of the party setting up the opposite title.\nThe defendants, amongst others, submitted the following points:\u2014\n1. That as Payne purchased the McKee tract for Benzinger and Eschbaeh and located it for them at their request, or as their agent at the time he was owner of No. 4881, and they acquiesced in that location, subdivided and sold the parts thereof to settlers, he and all parties claiming No. 4881 under him are concluded thereby and estopped from disputing the location so made.\n2. That Payne while owner of No. 4881 located it north of and adjoining the McKee tract and the tract so located was designated to Morris by Payne or his agent before his purchase, and Morris did purchase according to such designation and location, took the possession and exercised acts of ownership over the land, and has not been disturbed in his possession, neither Morris nor his vendee, the plaintiff, can gainsay that location to the prejudice of the defendants.\n3. The location of the McKee and Morris lands having been admitted on the trial of this case to be upon tract No. 4881, and Payne, when the owner thereof, having designated, represented and adopted that location and Benzinger and Eschbaeh having obtained the title to the McKee tract through Payne, and acting on the faith of his acts and representations as to the location, sold the lands in dispute to the defendants, Payne would be estopped from asserting an independent title thereto and his vendees would he concluded thereby.\n5. That if Morris knew that the defendants or those under whom they claim were making valuable improvements on the land as located by Payne after the purchase by Morris, and did not make known his claim for, or title to the land being improved by them, he and his vendee, the plaintiff in this case, are now estopped from setting up title thereto.\n6. That the long acquiescence of Morris from 1849 to 1865 in the location of both tracts as made by Payne, silently permitting defendants and those under whom they claim to expend large sums of money in improving that portion now claimed by plaintiff, neither Morris nor the plaintiff can change that location in such a manner as to interfere with or prejudice the rights of the defendants.\n7. That if Morris passed through the Werner improvement with Nelson, the agent of Payne, when he went to ascertain the location of the tract he was negotiating to purchase, saw the improvement, asked Nelson particularly who owned the land on which the improvement was, and was informed by Nelson, in answer to inquiry, that Benzinger and Eschbaeh were the owners of the tract and had sold a portion thereof to Werner, he (Morris) had notice before his purchase from Payne of the claim of Benzinger and Eschbaeh to said tract as also of the claim of Werner to his improvement.\nThe court (H. W. Williams, P. J.) affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s 1st and 6th points, and in answer to the 5th point said: \u2014 \u201c If there was nothing more in the case than the mere mistake in locating 4881, the law would be correctly stated in this point and the plaintiff could recover. But upon the facts of this case we decline to charge as requested in this point.\u201d\nHe also affirmed the defendants\u2019 7th point, and denied their 2d point.\nHe answered the other points and further charged as follows:\u2014\n\u201c Upon the facts stated in defendants\u2019 3d point Payne would be estopped from asserting an independent title to the land whether he held it at the time he procured the title for his principals or acquired it afterwards. But this question does not seem to us to be raised in this case. Payne located both these warrants 4884 and 4881, one tier of warrants too far north by mistake. Payne or his vendees are now seeking not to set up an independent title to 4884, but to correct the mistake in location and restore 4881 to its actual place upon the ground.\n\u201c To the 1st, 5th and 6th points by defendants,' we reply as follows : The purchase by Payne while he was the owner of 4881, of 4884 for Benzinger & Eschbaeh, his location of it for them, and at their request, and his subdivision of it into lots, would not alone prevent the correction of the mistake in location which had been honestly made. But if before the discovery of the mistake Benzinger & Eschbach sold these lots or subdivisions to actual settlers who went upon and improved the lands, expending money and labor thereon, with the knowledge and acquiescence of Payne, such actual settlers could acquire by virtue of their improvement upon the land a right to set up Payne\u2019s acts against any subsequent claim by him, to the lands so bought and improved by them. Being upon the land their possession was actual notice of their situation to the vendees of Payne; and the estoppel is operative in their favor as against such vendees.\n\u201c Mere knowledge of the fact that settlers were upon these lands without more, Payne being in ignorance of his title, or the true location, would not estop him though valuable improvements had-been made by such settlers. That upon which we base our general instruction in answer to these points, is the peculiar situation of Payne and his relation to defendants\u2019 vendors. He was in their employment. While surveying for them he advises them to purchase 4884, for them he makes the negotiation which results in their obtaining a deed for it. Still in their service he locates the warrant and mistakenly puts it upon ground of which he is owner. He subdivides it into lots, sees a settlement made upon it by vendees of his principals. These settlements increased in number and value from 1846 to 1849, when Werner made his improvement up to the time when the present plaintiff purchased in 1865. The location made by Payne had been acquiesced in by himself, adopted and acted upon by his principals and the settlers under them, and improvements of great value made upon the lands. Upon all these facts and circumstances it would be inequitable and unjust that he whose mistake occasioned the mischief should reap the benefit of the improvements made upon the lands, and the settlers who are the victims of the mistake should lose the value of their labor and expenditures.\n\u201c The result of these instructions is that the plaintiff is entitled to recover so much of the land described in his writ as was, on the 16th day of January 1865, unoccupied by actual settlers. [As to those portions of the land which had been sold to actual settlers and improved by them prior to January 16th 1865, when the present plaintiff acquired his title, his situation is entirely different. If you believe from the evidence that Payne procured, located .and divided 4884 for Benzinger & Eschbach, as their attorney and surveyor in the manner he has stated in his evidence, that such location was adopted by Benzinger & Eschbach, and sales made to actual settlers who took possession and made improvements, that such settlements and improvements were known to Payne & Morris under whom the plaintiffs claim title and were permitted to proceed without objection or notice, then although no fraud was meditated or intended by Payne, yet he and his vendees with notice are estopped, and as to so much of the land as you shall find so situated the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.]\u201d\nThe jury found \u201c for the plaintiff the land described in the writ, excepting the following described tract, to wit: beginning at a point 31.4 rods west of the south-east corner of warrant 4881, thence north 166 rods to the north-east corner of Clemens Haberberger\u2019s 36 acre lot, thence west 179.6 rods more or less to the north-west comer of Michael Schoebel\u2019s lot, thence south 166 rods to the south line of warrant No. 4881, thence east along the warrant line to the place of beginning.\u201d\nBoth the plaintiff and defendants took writs of error.\nThe plaintiff below (Millingar) assigned for error the answers of the court to his 5th point and to the defendants\u2019 3d, 1st, 5th, 6th and 7th points and that part of the charge included in brackets.\nThe defendants below (Mitchell and others), assigned for error the answers of the court to the plaintiff\u2019s 1st and 6th points and to the defendants\u2019 1st, 2d and 3d points.\nSouther, for Millingar,\ncited Kerns v.
