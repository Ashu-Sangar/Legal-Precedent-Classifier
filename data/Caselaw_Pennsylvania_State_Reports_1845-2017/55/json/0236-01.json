        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, February 14th 1867, by\nRead, J.\n\u2014 Every administrator is required to give a bond with two or more sureties, the condition of which is prescribed by the 24th section of the Act of 15th March, 1832. This bond relates only to the personal estate, and does not include the proceeds of real estate, for which the sureties are not in any manner liable.\nWhen a sale is made by an executor or administrator under the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, of the real estate of the decedent for the payment of debts, he must give security to be approved of by the Orphans\u2019 Court having jurisdiction of his accounts, for the faithful application of the proceeds of such real estate, according to law.\nThe security given in this case was the bond of the administrator with two sureties, and upon this bond this suit is brought against the obligors, who are bound only to account for and pay over the proceeds of the real estate according to law.\n\u201c The security exacted from the administrator,\u201d says Judge Rogers in McCoy v. Scott, 2 Rawle 222, \u201c has reference to the value of the personalty, as was decided at Sunbury, when we held that the surety in an administration-bond was not liable for the real estate. When lands are wanted for the payment of debts there is a mode pointed out by the Act of Assembly, which the administrator is bound to pursue, for the real fund is not absolutely but sub modo assets in his hands.\u201d \u201c The distinction,\u201d say the court, \u201c between these and the real assets, is recognised even by a statute which requires a separate bond for the latter, the administration of which, to avoid the -uncertainty which springs from confusion, ought to appear also by a separate account.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gilson, 8 Watts 214.\nIn order, therefore, to ascertain the liability of the sureties in the bond in suit, there should have been a separate and distinct account of the proceeds of the real estate, and of the payments and disbursements made out of it by the administrator, and the balance if any against the accountant would have been the amount of the sureties\u2019 liability: Commonwealth v. Stub, 1 Jones 150; Boyd v. Commonwealth, 12 Casey 359. Instead of this an account is produced composed of real and personal estate, and rents and profits of real estate, not showing any specific appropriation of any part of the assets, to any particular debts. This is not such an account as the act contemplates, and the court therefore properly rejected it. Great injustice might be done to the real estate sureties, for all the real estate proceeds may have been applied to pay debts, which the personal estate should have paid if it had not been squandered by the administrators.\nThe statements of counsel point to such a state of things, and it would have worked great injustice if this lumped account had been laid before the jury. It is clearly not such an account as would ascertain and fix the liability of the sureties.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Commonwealth versus Hilgert et al.\n1. The sureties in an administration-bond are not in any way liable for the proceeds of the real estate.\n2. An administrator having sold the real estate of his decedent under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the payment of debts, settled an account, in which he charged himself with the amount of the inventory, the proceeds of the real estate, rents and profits, &e., not showing any specific appropriation of any part of the assets to any particular debts. Held, That this not being such an account as the act contemplates, it could not be received in evidence in an action against the sureties in the bond for the sale of the real estate.\nJanuary 31st 1867.\nBefore Woodward, C. J., Thompson, Strong, Read and Agnbw, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of 1Northumberland county. \u2022\nThis was an action of debt to November Term 1862, by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, with the suggestion of Elizabeth Everett and others, as plaintiffs, against Philip W. Hilgert, administrator, &c., of Philip Hilgert, deceased, James S. Dougal and Thomas Swenlc, on the official bond of Philip W. Hilgert, with the other defendants as his sureties in the penalty of $16,000, conditioned that the administrator should faithfully execute an order issued by the Orphans\u2019 Court, to sell the real estate of the decedent and \u201c truly account for and pay over the proceeds thereof in such manner, as the said court shall decree and according to law.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs in the suit were the heirs and representatives of the decedent, entitled to the proceeds of his real estate after the payment of his debts.\nThe plaintiffs gave in evidence the petition of the administrator for the sale, showing the amount of the inventory of the personal estate to be $3738.47, and the debts $6245; the order of sale of the decedent\u2019s land, the administrator to enter into bonds in the penalty of $16,000 with Dougal and Swenk, as sureties, the bond, dated November 3d 1858, and the return of the administrator, that he had sold the land for $14,250, with the confirmation of 'the sale, January 4th 1859.\nThey then offered in evidence the account of the administrator, charging himself with the inventory, the proceeds of sale of the real estate, rents and profits of the land and other small items of charge, and crediting himself with the debts and expenses of the estate.\nAlso, the report of an auditor, finding the balance in the administrator\u2019s hands to be $7332.62, and reporting a distribution of that sum amongst the plaintiffs. All of which were objected to by the defendants for several reasons, two of which were, that\n\u201c The account filed and offered does not show that any part of the real estate is not accounted for by Philip W. Hilgert,\u201d and\n\u201c That said account contains promiscuously charges on the dehit side of the personal estate \u2014 the rents and profits of the land, and the proceeds, of the sale of the real estate; and on credit side makes no distinction as to their application.\u201d\nThe evidence was rejected and a bill was sealed. The plaintiffs then renewed the offer with the addition of the inventory and the vouchers accompanying the account. This offer also was rejected and a bill sealed.\nThe court (Jordan P. J.) directed the jury to find for the defendants, and they so found.\nThe rejection of the evidence and directing a verdict for the defendants, were the errors assigned in the Supreme Court.\nG. F. Miller and J. Porter, for plaintiffs in error,\ncited Commonwealth v. Bryan, 8 S. & R. 132 ; Commonwealth v. Gibson, 8 Watts 214; Walker\u2019s Estate, 3 Rawle 237; Hanna\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 53.\nW. S. Lawson and J. Pollock, for defendants in error."
