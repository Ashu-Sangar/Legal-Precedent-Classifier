This act contains carefully compiled rules, intended to regulate the descent and transmission of property in all ordinary cases of intestacy; if then the provisions of the act, in the case before us, apply to it, they must control our present decision. The act is so drawn up as to endeavor to meet progressively the various questions of transmission and descent, as in our present formation <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>of society, and the customs and habits of our people, they are commonly found to arise.

They further say in their report as to the 6th section, that ‘ it provides for the transmission of real estate to brothers and sisters of the <em>half </em>Hood, in the event of there being no person to take, as enumerated,in the preceding sectionsthat is to say, as we,understand, among,collaterals, when there is neither father or mother, brothers or sisters of the <em>whole blood </em>or their descendants; they also declare that this 6th section is copied from the 11th section of the Act of 1794, and the 7th section, Act of 1797. As then, the law is now to be considered the same as under the previous statutes. We quote the words of the 7th section, Act of 1797, as explanatory of the meaning of the portion of the Act of 1833, at this time under consideration. See Smith’s Laws, vol. 3, 299. <em>‘ </em>If the intestate shall die seised or possessed of real or personal estate as aforesaid, leaving neither widow nor lawful issue, father or mother, but brothers and sisters of the whole and half blood, or their representatives, the brothers and sisters of the whole blood, and the legal representatives of such of the whole blood as are dead, shall inherit the real estate in fee simple, and the personal estate shall be distributed equally between the brothers and sisters of both the whole and half blood, or their representatives; but if there are no lawful issue, widow, father or mother, brothers or sisters, or their representatives, of the whole blood, then brothers and sisters of the half blood shall inherit the real estate in fee simple, and the personal estate absolutely,’ &amp;c., &amp;c. When we read this quoted section, is there any difficulty in understanding it ? Clearly, when there are brothers and sisters of both the whole and half blood, or their descendants, the former will first take the real estate, and the latter can have no claim to it. They can only inherit in default of the <em>whole </em>

    <p class="summary" id="b65-7" data-blocks='[["BL_65.7",65,[155,829,1169,1545]],["BL_66.1",66,[363,396,1150,118]]]'>“ It is said that no direct decision can be found in our books upon this now disputed claim of the Act of 1833. The case must frequently have occurred in upwards of thirty years since the adoption of that statute, and in our opinion the reason why we find no express ruling of our Supreme Court upon the point is, that the language of the act, when fairly examined, cannot be misunderstood, .and that particularly the ruling has ever followed without change, in the same way for upwards of seventy years, since the Acts of 1794 and 1797. Indirectly, however, meeting the question, we do find more than one decision. The case of of Danner <em>v. </em>Shissler, 7 Casey 289, has been cited by the counsel of the plaintiff in the argument, as giving rise to some doubt upon the subject. We do not, however, take this view of the reported case; in our opinion it plainly recognises the doctrine we have stated above. The case there arose under the 7th section, Act of 1833, when there was neither father nor mother, brother nor sister, nor their descendants, either of the whole or half blood, but other collaterals or next of kin. Under that section, applying to collaterals more distant than brothers and sisters, the law makes no distinction between the whole or half blood, if they descend from a common ancestor. The courts, however, then, expressly say, ‘ It is sufficient where brothers and sisters inherit from each other, for then the whole blood are preferred.’ To whom do they' mean they are preferred ? Surely to the half blood, and that is the case before us. Do not all these parties claim <em>to inherit </em>from their deceased sister, Mrs. Flagg ? The judge of the Common Pleas, in his opinion reported, page 290, draws the same distinction. Again, in Lane’s Appeal, 4 Casey 487, Mr. Justice Woodward, arguendo, as to a question under a supplementary act, thus speaks of the purport of the Act of 1833: ‘ The words, “ when by existing laws entitled to inherit,” are introduced to preserve the distinction between collaterals of the whole and half blood, which is so anxiously maintained throughout the Act of 1833.’ And again, ‘ As if they had said we will have grandchildren of deceased brothers and sisters admitted to inheritance <em>per </em>stirpes, like children of deceased brothers and sisters, but they shall be <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>grandchildren of deceased brothers and sisters of the whole or half blood, according to “ existing laws.” The whole blood first, the half blood afterwards.’</p>
