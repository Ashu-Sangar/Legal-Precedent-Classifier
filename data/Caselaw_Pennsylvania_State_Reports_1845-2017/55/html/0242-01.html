At this visit Mr. Barr, at his request, drew a will for him, which he executed in Barr’s presence, and in that of two witnesses, Michael Reader and George Kisner, who proved the same before the register in the usual form on the 14th December 1863. There were therefore three witnesses to its execution, the writer of it, and the two called upon to witness it. In support of the will, therefore, was the original probate, and opposed to it was the evidence of George Kisner, one of the subscribing witnesses. He testified that he went with the decedent to Barr, who told Barr he wanted to make another will. “I had,” said he, “the will in my pocket and gave it to Barr.

Barr was writing the will.” “The will was finished before Wallize went for Reader.” “I said before that Wallize told Barr in English what to write.

To use the language of Ch. J. Best, in the case before cited, some witness would constantly be brought forward to set aside the most solemn instrument: 5 Bing. 435.” After further discussing the question the court say, p. 266, “ In contracts mistakes have indeed been <em>rectified </em>in a Court of Chancery, but no case is recollected, where they have been holden <em>void, </em>on account of a mistake.” “And it would seem that in this case if any remedy existed, it would be one that would not destroy the whole will, but one which would correct the mistake. This has been attempted in a recent case; and it was decided that parol testimony could not be admitted to prove the mistake. It would be to make a will by witnesses, and not by writing; to make a will anything: Avery <em>et ux., v. </em>Chappel <em>et al., </em><a href="/conn/6/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Conn. 270" data-case-ids="6754640" data-case-paths="/conn/6/0270-01">6 Conn.

Can courts of law dispense with rules of evidence more readily than Courts of Chancery, or is the obligation imposed upon them by statute less imperative ?” In the case in 6 Coun. the court affirm the doctrine, that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove a mistake in drafting a will. At p. 276 they say: “ It was decided by the highest court in South Carolina, after much discussion and deliberation, that parol evidence even of the person who drew the will, and who was of unimpeachable character, when offered to support the allegation of a mistake in the will and to prove that the testator intended to dispose of the property in a manner not apparent on the face of the will, was not admissible : Rothmaler <em>v. </em>Myers <em>et al., </em>4 Dessaus. 215.

In that case the appellant contended that the omission of the word <em>‘ </em>Gloucester’ in the will of the late Lord Newburgh proceeded upon a mere mistake, and was contrary to the intention of the testator at the time of making his will, and insisted that she ought to be allowed to prove as well from the context of the will itself, as from other extrinsic evidence, that the testator intended to devise to her an estate for life, as well in the estates in Gloucester, which was not inserted in the will, as in the county of Sussex, -which was mentioned therein.</p>
