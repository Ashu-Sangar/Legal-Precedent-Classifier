The register issued letters of administration on his estate to Thomas Gillan, the defendant. Matthew Gillan was seised in his demesne as of fee of a house and a lot of ground in the borough of Ohambersburg, at the time of his decease. Prior to the 30th of July, A. d. 1864, an order was issued by the Orphans’ Court, authorizing his administrator to sell said house and lot of ground for the payment of debts. It remained unsold on the 30th of July 1864, on which day a detachment of marauders, led by a man called McCausland, entered Ohambersburg and burned the greater part of the town, including the house belonging to the estate of Matthew Gillan. On the 15th day of April 1866 the legislature of Pennsylvania passed an act entitled An act for the relief of certain citizens of Ohambersburg and vicinity, whose property was destroyed by fire by the rebels, on the 30th day of July, a. d. 1864,’ by which it is provided that the sum of $500,000 be appropriated to the people of Ohambersburg and vicinity, whose property was burned by the rebels on the 30th of July 1864, to be paid to such sufferers, <em>pro </em>rata, upon the valuation of their losses, as hereinafter provided for.’ A dividend amounting to $1842.12 was made on account of the loss of the aforesaid house, belonging to the estate of the said Matthew Gillan, and said sum was paid by the state of Pennsylvania to the administrator of the said deceased, who has now in his possession the said sum of money. At the death of <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>the said Matthew Gillan there were judgments and other encumbrances of record, in the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin county, which were liens upon said real estate, and he was insolvent. The defendant, as administrator, claims the right to pay out the aforesaid sum of money, on account of the claims of the said lien-creditors, which will exhaust the fund. If upon this state of facts the court be of opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to said sum of money, then judgment to be entered in favor of the widow for $614.04, and in favor of the guardian for $1228.08, if in the opinion of said court the said money is to be distributed as personalty as between said widow and child; but if as realty, then judgment to be entered that the widow shall have the interest on $614.04 annually during her natural life, and the minor shall have now the sum of $1228.08, and the further sum of $614.04 at the widow’s death. If the court be of opinion that the money belongs to the lien-creditors of the decedent, judgment to be entered for the defendant.”</p>

The case stated presented to the court below, the single question, whether the money awarded to the estate of Matthew Gillan, deceased, on account of the destruction of a brick dwelling-house, situate in the town of Chambersburg, should be Applied by the administrator in discharge of liens on the property, or be paid to the widow, and the guardian of her <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>minor child, or be invested for their benefit under the intestate laws. The learned judge, holding the money to be a pure gratuity on part of the state, directed judgment to be entered in favor of the widow and guardian, as in cases of distribution of personal assets under the intestate laws.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[325,610,1150,984]]]'>Considering the occasion and object of the grant on part of the state, we think he was right in this conclusion. It was not a case in which the state was bound to indemnify the sufferers. Losses by public enemies — the casualties of war — are risks that every one in society assumes and must bear. Property destroyed by such agencies, is not like property taken by the state. There the money becomes the substitute of the property, and the lien attaches to the substitute. This results from well-established equitable principles. But no such principles are applicable to the case of a mere gratuity. It can only be claimed in accordance with the terms of the gift and by the party.to whom it is given. In the case of a great public calamity, public and private contributions always result from a generous regard for the immediate sufferers. It would be a novel mode of administering relief to starving and freezing people to appropriate the means intended for their relief to the payment of precedent debts. The direction in the act before us is to pay to <em>“ </em>such sufferers ” as shall be shown to have lost their property by the burning referred to. As lien-holders are not owners of property, they are not within the description of the beneficiaries of the act; and as there is no equitable principle of substitution to be invoked by them, in such a case as this, we think they are not entitled to any portion of the money in question, and the Judgment is affirmed.</p>
