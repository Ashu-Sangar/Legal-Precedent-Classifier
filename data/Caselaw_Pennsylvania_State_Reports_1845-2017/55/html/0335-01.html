Bickham conveyed all her estate to the defendants in trust for certain purposes, amongst others the support of the trustees and their families for life. Afterwards, on the 17th of May 1862, S. G. Bickham was found to be a lunatic, a committee was appointed, and Bickham removed to the state asylum. The committee having received the trust funds, a proceeding in equity was commenced by the trustees to restrain him from converting them; a traverse to the inquisition of lunacy was also filed by S. G. Bickham. Messrs. Amwake &amp; Alricks were the original counsel in these proceedings. By contract with the trustees, they were to receive $50 each as a retaining fee, and $200 if successful in the proceedings. The plaintiff was afterwards employed by the defendants, and received $50 as a “ retaining fee,” as appeared by his receipt given in evidence by the defendants. The proceedings were successful, and Messrs. Amwake &amp; Alricks were paid the amounts agreed upon with them.</p>

      <em>“ </em>In the absence of testimony, you are called upon to say what the plaintiff is entitled to for his services ; and you will determine the question according to such evidence as you have. It may be regarded as a question of probabilities. Two counsel had been-already employed before the plaintiff was engaged. It is in evidence that the defendants agreed to give him, and did pay him <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>the same retainer that they had paid each of the other counsel. It appears then altogether probable that on the occasion of their calling upon Mr. Smith to employ him', they told him what they had paid the others as a retainer, and therefore agreed to pay him the same. Now with respect to his services in the several proceedings in which they employed him to assist, they either agreed to pay him the same contingent fee or something less — or nothing was said about it at all. What is the probability ? We must suppose the plaintiff, when his services were required as counsel, to assist the two other counsel already employed, to have asked what compensation the defendants had agreed to give the others. This probability is strengthened by the fact that they subsequently paid him the same retainer as the others, of which they must therefore have told him. If they informed him of this retainer, would he have failed to inquire what further compensation they were to receive on the completion of the business ? Is it probable that he should have dropped the inquiry at that point ? or is it not more probable he should have said, ‘ Well, you give these gentlemen $50 each as a retainer, what are you to give them at the conclusion of these cases ? What if they succeed ?’ These are the questions on which you will deliberate, and judge as to the probability deducible from the facts in evidence.</p>

But if there were no express contract, the services having been rendered by the plaintiff at the instance and request of the defendants, they would be equally bound to pay him the reasonable value of his services, and such value would be the proper measure of your finding; and the evidence of what the defendants contracted to give the others, with the evidence of all the facts and circumstances relative, to his employment and his performances in this business, would be the proper means of forming your judgment as to what the plaintiff should receive.”</p>

Amwake &amp; Alricks, without any <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>evidence whatever of the fact. The probabilities of motive and conduct no doubt may become proper subjects of inference, on the part of a jury, from the circumstances surrounding parties at the time when called upon to decide upon their acts. But when, as here, the question is whether an express contract was made to pay a specific sum of money, to begin its proof by a mere supposition of what it was probable the defendants might have thought of, and to deduce from this supposition the fact that they did agree to give this specific fee, is carrying the doctrine of possibilities into a region of subtle conjecture from which nought but practical error can proceed. The probabilities, as the learned judge termed them (unfounded conjectures, rather), were but the merest guesses at what might have happened, but of-which there is no evidence that it did take place. It was the business of the plaintiff to prove his contract, and if he had none express, then the value of the services rendered.</p>

His lunacy was a personal matter, and did not involve the execution of the trust except indirectly, in so far as it might lead to his discharge as a trustee in the event of his being found a lunatic.</p>
