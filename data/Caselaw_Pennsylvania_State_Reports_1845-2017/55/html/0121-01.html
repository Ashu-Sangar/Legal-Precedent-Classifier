The house was old and in quite a dilapidated condition; the lot with the building being then estimated as worth about $300. Knapp proceeded to put repairs upon it; made some thorough alterations to the porch ; altered and renewed windows and doors ; made an additional room; extended the roof; renewed the weather-boarding, partly with old boards previously in the house, and partly with new lumber, so that in its front the house appeared new, but on the side it appeared an old house repaired. Yohe, the appellant, furnished the new lumber between March 1st and May 26th 1865.</p>

Whichever it be regarded, of law or fact, or though it be, as perhaps most frequently it is, a mixed question, there is no more satisfactory, mode of deciding it than by referring it to a competent commissioner — a commissioner competent to deal with both questions of law and of fact, and questions also that are compounded of those two elements. Such was the course pursued here. The commissioner was on the spot to examine the building, and was attended by the parties and their counsel. His report exhibits a full consideration of the evidence, and a skilful application of the principles of law.</p>
