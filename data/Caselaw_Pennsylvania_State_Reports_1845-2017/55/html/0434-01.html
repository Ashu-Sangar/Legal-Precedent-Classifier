The pleas were payment, and the Statute of Limitations. A suit was brought February 15th 1855 in the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset county, in which Joseph Lichty was one of the defendants. Hugus was his counsel in the case. A verdict and judgment were recovered against Lichty, November 14th 1856, and he removed the case to the Supreme Court. Mr. Hugus was Lichty’s counsel in that court. On the 16th of November 1857 the judgment was reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded. In 1857 or 1858 the suit'was settled by the parties and ended.</p>

The Statute of Limitations operates as well against attorneys at law as others, and if you are satisfied that the relation of attorney and client, in regard to the services for which compensation in this case .is claimed ceased for more than six years before the commencement of this action, the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

We affirm this point, if you believe that Mr.'Hugus had full notice of the settlement. Parties cannot settle their cases in <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the absence, or without the knowledge of their attorneys for the purpose of depriving them of their costs or fees.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[302,498,1142,214]]]'>“ 4. The position here assumed is not sound, if we understand it correctly. The decision by the Supreme Court did not terminate the professional relation. It simply remitted the cause to the. Court of Common Pleas. The statute only begins to run from the time the professional relation was dissolved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-7" data-blocks='[["BL_436.7",436,[302,711,1145,219]]]'>“ 5. In answer to this point we can only repeat what we have already said to you, that if you believe from the evidence that the relation of attorney and client between these parties was terminated more than six years before this suit was commenced, the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-8" data-blocks='[["BL_436.8",436,[301,927,1144,429]]]'>“6. To this last point we reply that no attempt of the attorney to revive a case which has been definitely settled between the parties with the knowledge of the attorney can avoid the effect of the Statute of Limitations. ■ If it was Mr. Hugus’s purpose, by entering the rule of reference, to re-establish the relation of attorney and client between himself and the defendant which had long ceased, and by this means evade the operation of the statute, it was an abortive and useless effort. This question depends on whether you may find from the evidence that Mr. Hugus had knowledge of the settlement made in 1858 and assented to it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-9" data-blocks='[["BL_436.9",436,[300,1354,1144,597]]]'>“ In addition to what we have said in reply to the defendant’s points it may not be amiss to remark that very erroneous opinions prevail in many parts of the country, in reference to the value of professional services rendered by members of the bar. It requires a great deal of time and oftentimes very heavy expense to become properly qualified to discharge the responsible duties they are called upon to perform; and when these duties are faithfully performed they deserve to be properly remunerated. The evidence in this case is that $100 would be a moderate compensation for the plaintiff’s services in a case that was tried not only in this court, but also in the Supreme Court, and, if the plaintiff has not excluded himself from your verdict by waiting too long before he commenced his action, you ought to find for him what the witnesses have proved he is entitled to.”</p>

It surely was not erroneous to say that the Statute of Limitations would not begin to run against a hill of attorney’s fees until the dissolution of the relation betwixt him and his client. If the law were not so, every attorney to assert the statute would have to sue his clients once in six years, which would be destructive to the confidence which is essential to the relation. The point was ruled in Foster <em>v. </em>Jack, <a href="/watts/4/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 334" data-case-ids="1842747" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0334-01">4 Watts 334</a>, and is not open for further discussion.</p>

And though it is always competent for parties to compromise their litigation, the learned judge said they could not do it <em>“ </em>without the knowledge of their attorneys for the purpose of depriving them of their costs or fees.”</p>
    <p id="b437-7" data-blocks='[["BL_437.7",437,[203,1146,1147,728]]]'>The morality of the relation demanded this qualification, for as counsel owe good fidelity to clients, so the client is bound to make fair and reasonable compensation to his counsel, and it is a fraud upon the counsel for the client to settle the suit without his knowledge, to withhold his fees, and then to set up the Statute of Limitations against him. Whether Hugus had notice of the settlement, and whether the relations terminated within six years before suit brought were fairly submitted as questions of fact to the jury. If the court did not instruct the jury as to what would determine the relation, it is a sufficient answer they were not requested to instruct upon this .point. They did, however, sufficiently instruct upon this point when they said that services rendered since the bringing of this suit if not required by the defendant, nor for his benefit, would not revive the relation nor avert the bar of the statute, the jury found under the rulings that the relation of counsel and client had not ceased six years before suit brought, and that was decisive against the bar of the statute.</p>
