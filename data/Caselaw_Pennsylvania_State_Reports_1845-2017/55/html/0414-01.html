The intimate relation between husband and wife is such that there is generally a community of possession in all their goods, including their papers and obligations, nor was it the intention of the Act of 1848 to destroy that community or unity of possession. They were expected to enjoy them together, not separately. If the wife received a present of a horse during coverture, or owned it before marriage, the husband would be expected to feed, use and work it, to have the general control and custody of the animal, yet it would belong to the wife, and could not be seized for the husband’s debt, nor could he lawfully sell or give it to one who knows of the wife’s interest or ownership. She could reclaim it. If she held her husband’s bond for a debt due in her own right, the bare fact that after his death it was found in a drawer which they mutually used, or in which he kept his papers, would not preclude her from recovering the amount from his estate. A court should have some other evidence of a gift of the money. [We ought to know the circumstances under which it was given, that wm might see and judge whether it was fairly done, or the possession obtained through coercion, or by overreaching. So <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>far does the law go that where it is shown that a husband, has reduced his wife’s debt to possession, the presumption is that he received it in trust for her, a stronger circumstance evidencing a claim of ownership on his part than the bare custody of the bond due her. If actually handed over to him, it might be fairly presumed that he was the mere custodian for her use.] We have no other evidence on which to build up the theoi-y of a gift of this bond by the wife to her husband, than that after he had become a confirmed drunkard, and wasted all of his OAvn, and the money portion of his wife’s estate, was a maniac and chained under the direction of his father, to prevent his doing damage, the wife was endeavoring to find her bond. The husband suggested different places to send for it; in the drawer of his secretary ; in his portfolios, where it was at length found. Neither appeared to have known where it was, but when found, he held it up, exclaiming, <em>‘ </em>What does she want more: that is worth $3000 to my wife any time.’ [He does not pretend to claim it as his own, or assert that it had been given to him. After this, could he or his representatives successfully contend against the obligation ? If he is bound, how shall the security be discharged, unless on some equity peculiar to themselves, which is not pretended here ?] The declarations of a husband operating in favor of his wife, must be received with great caution, but the weakness of the defence consists in the want of proof. [The jury is asked to infer a gift on what we consider very weak, and, perhaps, insufficient evidence.] We do not say that a jury might not draw an inference of gift, but it certainly would be on very slight and unsatisfactory evidence. Does this bond bear interest from its date ? As a general rule the obligation of a husband to his wife will not. If the husband receives the interest due on his wife’s money, the inference is that it is for their mutual support, and that of their family. In several reported cases it has been held that the husband’s notes or acknowledgment of indebtedness to his wife did not bear interest; in one reported case that it will where such appears to have been the contract. This bond is drawn <em>with interest, </em>but that was because the guardian might be called on to pay interest to his ward. After the bond went into her hands it would cease as against the husband. Had he died, and the wife sued his representatives, she could not have recovered interest during his lifetime, but would from his death. Her claims are the same against his sureties. If, therefore, you find a verdict for the plaintiff, it will be without interest. We will now proceed to answer the defendants’ points.</p>

The defendants insist that the husband’s possession of such a bond was evidence that the wife had given it to him. There was no direct evidence of the gift — no assignment or transfer in writing either formal or 'informal, and no witness to the gift. The court were asked to <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>instruct the jury that they ought to infer the gift from the fact of possession, taken in connection with the other two facts that the parties lived together amicably until Bowman fell into gross intemperance, and that she had given him and he had squandered all the money she had received from her father’s estate.</p>
    <p id="b418-6" data-blocks='[["BL_418.6",418,[326,618,1148,855]]]'>We think the cause was put to the jury quite as favorably to the defendants below as they had any right to expect. The possession of the bond was not a conclusive circumstance. We have often said that the intimacy of the marriage relation is such, and that husband and wife do so habitually act as the agent for each other, that her possession of his moneys, securities and property is of itself very slight evidence of a transfer of the ownership, and when it is remembered that the husband is the master of the house his ■ possession of her chattels ought perhaps to he considered still less evidence of title in him. Nor is the inference of ownership strengthened by the circumstance of amicable relations, for these would be promoted by leaving her patrimony in her own hands, and would be endangered by his attempts to get it away from her. Still less is the inference of a gift strengthened by the circumstance that the husband had squandered her cash on his intemperance, for whilst she may have been persuaded to give him her ready money, or he may have obtained it by virtue of his power over her, every dollar of it that he wasted would make it less likely that she would give him the bond that represented all she had left.</p>
    <p id="b418-7" data-blocks='[["BL_418.7",418,[325,1474,1147,471]]]'>Besides all this, the possession which the husband had of this bond was very equivocal. Even in the lucid intervals of the madness to which his intemperance had driven him he could not tell where the bond was, he could only suggest the places in which it might be found, and it was at last found in a portfolio of which the wife must have had some sort of possession, for she produced it to be searched. Too much was attempted to he deduced from such a possession. The court submitted all the evidence to the jury, with intimations of opinion upon its effect as they had a right to give, and the jury having found against the gift, there is no just ground of complaint.</p>
    <p id="b418-8" data-blocks='[["BL_418.8",418,[326,1945,1147,418]]]'>The declarations of the husband were properly admitted, for they were evidence against himself, and they were submitted to the jury with a salutary caution. Even if erroneously admitted they were harmless, for independently of them the affirmative proofs failed to establish a gift. And this was what the defendants had undertaken to prove. It is argued that the bond being in possession of the husband the burthen of proof was on the wife, but we think rather that the bond being confessedly the separate property of the wife, the burthen of proving title to it in the husband was on the defendants.</p>
