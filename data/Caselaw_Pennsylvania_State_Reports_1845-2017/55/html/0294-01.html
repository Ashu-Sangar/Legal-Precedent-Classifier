Doubtless the contract and four notes were the component parts of a stock-gambling transaction, in which Kauffman in effect betted that in twenty-five days Harlem stock would sell at less than $60 per share ; but viewed in the light of legal principles and precedents, the contract was one which the parties were free to make, and the obligations created by it, and the subsequent notes are in law untainted by any fraud, deceit or want of consideration.

It became a material inquiry to the creditors of Kauffman, as to what was the nature and character of the consideration moving the drawer to execute and deliver the three notes to the buyer of the stock, and on this point the auditors, after stating the facts in substance as above, say in their original report, “ it may be, that the contract” (for the sale of stock referred to) “ and note” .(of the same date) “ formed portions of an operation by Kauffman, known in stock circles as <em>selling short;’ </em>but the vice was simply a <em>moral one, </em>and the auditors are unable to detect in the note anything like a failure or deficiency of consideration.”</p>

But their law is more than doubtful. In one sense it is true that a wager about the prospective price of stocks, is a contract which it may be said parties are “free to make,” there being no express prohibition of it; but the obligation created although free from <em>“fraud or deceit,” </em>is not enforcible at law on account of the consideration. Betting and gambling contracts have in this commonwealth been uniformly held to <em>be contra bonos mores, </em>and incapable of enforcement at law. Feigned issues in the shape of wagers are the only exceptions, and in these the alleged wager is mere form to ascertain a fact, but not to recover money.</p>

It is evident, even if the fact were not so found, that the actual transfer of stock between these parties was not contemplated by them. The interesting question to them was the rise or fall of the stock, which, being secured by an adequate “ margin” was what they looked to. Kauffman had no stock when he contracted to sell, nor did Hollinger pay for any. Doubtless, pursuant to the understood practice in such cases, he also put up a “ margin”' to meet the contingency of a fall in the stock. These were simply the stakes of the parties on each side, and were at the end of the game, or rather when the contract was out, what the winning party was to take, and what Hollinger did take. The absence of the thing contracted for would be of the same consequence exactly in such a contract, and no more than in a gambling policy of insurance. It would show its nature, and avoid the obligation created by it.</p>
