The plaintiff deduced his title through George Yeakle, between whom and Jacob Zimmerman, the testator (whose land adjoined Yeakle’s), there had been disputes about the title to this tract. On the trial the plaintiff proved that in 1848 the surveyor, at the request of both Zimmerman, the testator, and Yeakle ran a line between their lands, which was consented to by them, and by which Yeakle would have taken the land in controversy.</p>

Such a judgment is not like a judgment by default, or on an award of arbitrators, which have been held not to be conclusive of title, but it is an admission of the plaintiff’s title in such a form as ought to put an end to all controversy.”</p>

      <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>The Act of 1807 was an act of limitation. At common law parties might harass each other with ejectments without limit, but the legislature fixed this limit to their litigation. And it was so purely a limitation of the common-law a'ction, that this court refused, in Seitzinger <em>v. </em>Ridgway, <a href="/watts/9/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Watts 496" data-case-ids="1850034" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0496-01">9 Watts 496</a>, to apply it to an equitable action of ejectment, and held, upon great consideration, one verdict and judgment conclusive in such an action. The legislature afterward changed this rule of decision, and then repealed their enactment and restored the rule as laid down in Seitzinger <em>v. </em>Ridgway. See the subject exfoliated in Peterman <em>v. </em>Huling, 7 Casey 432.</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[312,886,1154,854]]]'>But a confession of judgment does not stand upon the statute at all, which relates only to those judgments that are entered upon verdicts. A judgment confessed in ejectment must be treated upon the same general principles of law that belong to what Mr. Greenleaf calls solemn or judicial confessions in other cases. The effect of these is to conclude the right and to estop the party. The most important interests, not only property and liberty, but life itself, are habitually concluded, judicially, by solemn confession made by the party in interest in the face of a court of justice. And why should ejectment be an exception ? In the nature of things the interests involved in an ejectment suit are no more beyond the power of a party to control by his confession than any other rights of person or property. If he may confess his guilt in a capital case, he may surely confess his want of title in ejectment. And a judgment confessed concludes and estops him and all his privies. This- not upon the effect of the statute, but by the general principles of the common law. It is a voluntary waiver of all defences, and of all rights under the statute or at common law — a total and unconditional surrender of the field of controversy which concludes him for ever.</p>
