Lee and Jay Gould were tenants in common in the real estate constituting the Gouldsboro Tannery,’ and jointly owned the personal property belonging to and connected with it. If the declarations of the living parties are believed, they were doing business there under the firm name of ‘Jay Gould.’ The fact of their being tenants in common of the real estate did not of itself make them partners in the business carried on at the tannery. If they were partners as alleged, it did not necessarily carry into that firm the partnership firm of ‘ Charles M. Leupp &amp; Co.,’ of New York. The firms would remain distinct in character as they were in business. One was composed of two members and the other of three. One situated in Pennsylvania and the other in New York. One engaged in manufacturing leather and the other in buying and selling the manufactured article. But regarding them as partners in the <em>general </em>business of the tannery, does it prevent Jay Gould from becoming the bailee of Charles M. Leupp &amp; Co. for the hides contracted for ? We think not. [The contract as between the parties is to be construed as they understood it. They evidently regarded it as a contract of bailment and so acted under it for months. The furnishing of hides, tanning and returning the leather and the accounts made up and furnished to the defendant, show how they regarded the contract. It is not, therefore, material to this issue whether the name of Jay Gould represented an individual or a firm.] The contract must be enforced as the parties have written it. The intention undoubtedly was that Charles M. Leupp &amp; Co. should be the owners of the hides and the leather manufactured from them.</p>

Leupp &amp; Co. were simply the bailors of Jay Gould, and as such the rights of the firm survived to David W. Lee. Jay Gould, the bailee, agreed to tan the hides and return the leather to the bailors within a reasonable time. The possession for that special purpose was in Jay Gould. If the jury <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>believe that Jay Gould retained the leather an <em>unreasonable time, </em>or if he so acted in the <em>removal of it, </em>as to show his determination not to return it to the bailors, then by his acts of negligence or malfeasance he parted with the right of possession, and replevin maybe maintained. In either case the rightful owner of the property was entitled to the possession. The question of time and of the intention of the defendant are purely questions of fact for the jury. Does the conduct of Gould in removing the leather to the barn of Case, satisfy the jury that he did not intend to return it to New York within a reasonable time ? Was it in violation of the terms of his contract ? If so, then he forfeited his right to the possession. The defendant had no lien upon the leather for the labor bestowed upon it. By his agreement he waived that right when he stipulated for a future day of payment. [Nor had he the right to call upon the bailors for security before delivering the leather. Even if he might have claimed that right in consequence of the death of C. M. Leupp he did not do so. Security was not refused because it was not demanded.]</p>

The parties were then litigating their rights in Luzerne county in a court of equity. On the 21st day of August 1860, an agreement was made and signed by the parties intended to be filed in that case, which was done. It embraced a settlement between the parties including <em>“ all the leather in or about the Grouldsboro Tannery on the 2d day of May </em>I860.” The defendant contends that the leather in controversy in this suit was included in that agreement of settlement. It was at Case’s bairn on the 2d of May, 14 miles distant from the tannery, if it had not already been sent to Philadelphia. The parties well knew where it was and that this suit was pending for it. Other things of less value and wholly disconnected with the suit in Luzerne county were named in that agreement. [Why attempt then to include so important an item in the vague terms of ‘ in or about the tannery?’ Is it likely that the parties intended to include $4000 worth of leather 14 miles distant in another county by such expressions?] But we are not left to construe this written agreement alone by the language employed. Parol evidence has been offered to explain it. The evidence of H. D. IL Snyder, if believed by the jury, is to the very point. Not only was the leather in dispute not intended to be included, but it was expressly excluded by a written agreement bearing even date with the one filed. True that written agreement was afterwards rescinded and <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>destroyed by consent of both parties, because, as Snyder says, it contained other stipulations besides the one named. Although destroyed, the contents of the paper are evidence for the purpose of ascertaining the meaning of the parties to the contract already in evidence. It is important only for the purpose of explaining the term<em>s </em>in or about the tannery.’ If the jury believe the evidence of Snyder, then the leather embraced in this suit was not settled for.”</p>

Lee, as surviving partner of the firm of Leupp &amp; Co., was bailor of the hides in question, and, as such, entitled to maintain replevin for them.</p>

    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[378,562,1148,430]]]'>Let us see how this question stands upon the evidence. On the 7th of April 1860 the replevin issued out of the Common Pleas of Monroe county was laid upon 1200 hides in Case’s barn, to which Gould had carried them from Goldsborough, under circumstances that indicated a disposition to convert them to his own benefit. On the 14th of April 1860, Lee filed a bill in equity in the Common Pleas of Luzerne county for an injunction to protect other personal property at Goldsborough in which he claimed an interest as owner, and as bailee of one John B. Alley, of Boston, who had furnished hides to be tanned at that tannery.</p>
    <p id="b108-7" data-blocks='[["BL_108.7",108,[380,990,1146,131]]]'>On the 21st of August following, Lee and Gould made a written agreement, which is entitled of the.equity suit, and which manifestly had for its object the settlement of that suit.</p>
    <p id="b108-8" data-blocks='[["BL_108.8",108,[376,1119,1153,1186]]]'>The leather to which this agreement related is described as the leather which, in pursuance of a previous order of the court, had been consigned to Bullard &amp; Co., New York, in the name of Walter G. Sterling, of Wilkesbarre, and the leather still at Goldsborough, which was to go forward to Bullard &amp; Co. in the same manner, excepting the leather belonging to John B. Alley or his firm. Yery manifestly this description of the subject-matter, both of the equity suit and of the agreement to settle it, did not embrace nor refer to the 1200 hides which had been replevied in Monroe county. But the agreement contained also mutual releases of the parties from all claims or demands of any name or nature, excepting as above stated. Had the premises included the replevied hides, these general words might be construed to embrace the replevin suit; that suit and its hides do not seem to have been before the minds of the contracting parties, and if the defence of accord had stood upon this paper alone, it may well be doubted whether it could be sustained. But all doubt on this head was removed by the parol testimony of Snyder, who swore that the leather for which the replevin suit was brought was expressly excepted from the agreement, and that another agreement of the same date, which was afterwards destroyed by him with the consent of the parties, related to this leather and some other matters. If this evidence were believed, the general terms of release employed in the agreement which settled the equity suit could with no propriety be held to embrace the present suit or its subject-matter. But the admission of the parol evidence is very earnestly complained of. Was there any error in that ?</p>
    <p id="b108-9" data-blocks='[["BL_108.9",108,[377,2314,1144,132]],["BL_109.1",109,[140,398,1150,87]]]'>Parol evidence is not admissible to alter or contradict what is written, upon the very obvious principle that the writing is the best evidence of the intentions of the parties; but parol evidence <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>has many times been received to explain and define the subject-matter of written agreements.

Snyder was the scrivener, the subscribing witness, the depositary and the destroyer of the second agreement of August 21st, and was therefore the best possible witness to its contents. The proof of the contents of the paper that was burned limited the operation of the paper that survived, and showed that none of its terms could properly be permitted to release the replevin suit. This evidence therefore extricated the case from the only doubt that attended it when it was here before.</p>
    <p id="b109-7" data-blocks='[["BL_109.7",109,[146,914,1153,806]]]'>Several assignments of error, founded on bills of -exception to evidence and on parts of the charge, involve a misconstruction of that clause of the original agreement of February 1st 1859, which relates to a guaranty of the sales of the leather. It is not a covenant of guaranty, but a fixing of the' rate of commission for selling and guaranteeing in the ordinary course of the commission business. In commercial transactions the house that receives and sells any commodity for another party guarantees the price, less the agreed commissions, but gives no security to make this guaranty good. The responsibility of the house and of every member of it is pledged to the consignor, and their credit is accepted as satisfactory when the consignment is made. So far as Gould had any property in the leather tanned at Goldsboro’, he made Leupp &amp; Co. his factors for the sale of it by his agreement; and though he might perhaps have refused to ship to them or have stopped the goods in transitu in case of their evident insolvency, yet there was nothing in the evidence offered to justify him' in secreting a large quantity of leather in Case’s barn.</p>
