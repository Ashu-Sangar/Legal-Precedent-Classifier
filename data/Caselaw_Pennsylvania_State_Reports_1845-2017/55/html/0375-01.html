The case stated is badly made up, but from the record and testimony of the divorce, we ascertain the following facts: James and Susanna Taylor, at the time of their marriage, in May 1857, were citizens of Pennsylvania. Shortly after their marriage they made a visit to Iowa and returned, Mrs. Taylor not being pleased with the country. After their return, she declared to him her intention not to live with him, and refunded to him $40, his bill for the expenses of her journey to Iowa. She remained at her brother’s, in Allegheny City, and he went back to Bedford county, in October, and remained there till May 1858, when he sold his farm to the defendant, and removed to Iowa, leaving his wife in Pennsylvania.</p>

Susanna Taylor had ho actual notice, and at the time was a resident citizen of this state, never having left it.</p>
    <p id="b378-9" data-blocks='[["BL_378.11",378,[359,1604,1141,168]]]'>The question on this state of facts is, whether the Iowa court had jurisdiction to declare the divorce of Mrs. Taylor so as to discharge the lands of her husband in Pennsylvania from her right of dower ?</p>

The governing principle is well stated by Mr. Story in his Conflict of Laws, § 20, chap. 2; and in Steel <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 447" data-case-ids="481847" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0447-01">7 W. &amp; S. 447</a>, C. J. Gibson shows that this principle is not affected by the provision in the Constitution of the United States for giving full faith and credit to the judicial records of the several states. The same principle is recognised by C. J. Lewis, in Rogers <em>v. </em>Burns, 3 Casey 527. In a question of jurisdiction, therefore, there is no difference between the interstate and a foreign relation; and the only question is how far the subject of divorce forms an exception to the general principles requiring personal notice of the proceeding. The marriage relation being one of civil <em>status, </em>as well as of con<a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>tract, different views have been entertained. The right of every nation or state to regulate the civil relations of its citizens, being one pertaining to the good order and proper economy of the body politic, cannot be doubted. Yet, how far in regulating the <em>status </em>of one within its borders, it may thereby affect the interest of another not answerable to its jurisdiction, is not so easily perceived. In the absence of a common domicil of the husband and wife, the doctrine of their marital unity is pressed in order to strengthen the jurisdiction which a husband attempts to import into <em>the forum </em>of the new domicil he has sought.</p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[168,825,1147,430]]]'>If by legal unity the wife may be considered a citizen of Iowa, contrary to the truth, and thereby subjected to the jurisdiction of its tribunals, the case must be ended, for the provision in the Federal Constitution giving effect to the record compels us to recognise it as equal in validity with our own. But the unity of person created by the marriage is a legal fiction, to be followed for all useful and just purposes, and not to be used to destroy the rights of either, contrary to the principles of natural justice, in proceedings which, from their nature, make them opposite parties.</p>
    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[166,1256,1151,434]]]'>It required their mutual consent to establish the relation from which the unity arises; and the same law of right demands them to be viewed in their separate natural condition when either proceeds against the other to destroy this relation. It is the necessary effect of their being opposite parties in the same proceeding. Upon a dissolution of the marriage, therefore, each has a right to be heard as a natural person. This sends us back to the inquiry how far a state having a right to regulate the civil <em>status </em>of one of the parties, may, in doing so, alter the <em>status </em>of another, over whom it never has had any power ?</p>

But the law of domicil implies that it is the actual domicil of both of the parties, or was, when the offending party left it. In a proceeding to dissolve a marriage the parties stand upon a level of rights. When the injured party seeks a new domicil, and the domicils are, therefore, actually different, there is no greater reason why the husband’s new domicil should prevail over the wife’s, than that hers should prevail over his. In this aspect justice requires that neither should draw the other within the folds of a foreign jurisdiction.</p>

Clearly no state right to regulate the <em>status </em>of its own citizens can justify this. The publication of the notice makes no difference, for back of it lies the want of power of the distant state to subject her to its jurisdiction. Nothing short of possession of the person before or at the time of the proceeding can warrant this. Even in questions of property, the <em>situs </em>must be within the state to subject it to jurisdiction, and beyond the particular property so situated, no right can be affected by a foreign jurisdiction: Steel <em>v. </em>Smith, <em>supra.</em>

In seeking a new domicil he abandoned these <em>rights; </em>and there is no justice in his complaint that he is deprived of the full effect of the Iowa decree, because he could not procure service there upon his wife. The cases which have furnished the grounds of seemingly opposite conclusions, and the arguments of writers upon this vexed question, have generally been those in which the <em>offending </em>party left the common domicil and put it out of the power of the injured party to proceed, except at the place of the common domicil, on the principle that jurisdiction once vested is not lost by his departure. Thus, the argument of inconvenience is of no weight. It is probably this amenability to the original jurisdiction that has led to confounding with it those cases where the injured party leaves the common domicil, and attempts to draw the jurisdiction after him into the court of a new domicil. But the case before us shows that there is a just limit to the alleged inconvenience, as well as to the state power.</p>
