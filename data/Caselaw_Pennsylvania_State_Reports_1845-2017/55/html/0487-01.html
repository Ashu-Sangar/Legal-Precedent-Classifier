      <em>“ </em>But the construction would be contrary to the general rule of construction both in England and in our own state, which is, that where an estate is given to survivors, they take a fee simple, unless it should appear from the whole will to be the manifest intention of the testator that they should take a less estate. The plaintiffs’ counsel in this case, admitting the rule of construction as stated, has made a most elaborate argument to show that testator intended that upon the death of any or all of his three daughters without issue, his estate was finally to vest in his lineal descendants, his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who are the plaintiffs in this case.</p>

After a careful perusal of this very long testament and last will, we have failed to discover such intention. On the contrary, the intention is very clearly expressed, that upon the death of any of his daughters without issue, the surviving daughters and his grandchildren, children of his deceased son and daughter, should take the same interest by survivorship, and that his grandchildren should take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>His will is that in case of any of his daughters die without heirs of their bodies, ‘ it is my will that their part as above bequeathed to them, be equally divided among the survivors of them and my <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>grandchildren, counting James Walker’s four children one, and Elizabeth Stewart’s four children one.’ There is certainly no rule of construction that would justify us, under this clause in the will, in giving a less estate to the surviving daughters than to the grandchildren.</p>
