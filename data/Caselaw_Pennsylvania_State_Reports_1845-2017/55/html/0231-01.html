That the issue is to be something other than that resulting from the libel and answer, is implied by the act itself. The facts that will constitute the matter in dispute cannot be known until the answer to the libel is in, “ then if either party,” says the ac<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>t, shall desire any matter of fact that is affirmed by one and denied by the other, to be tried by a jury, an issue shall be framed so that the same shall be tried accordingly.” The act does not say that the parties shall, on request for a trial by jury, proceed to try on the issue made by the libel and answer. We need not enlarge on this, for we think it is too plain to admit of doubt that no error was committed in ordering the issues as they appear, and in requiring the respondent to join in them.</p>

And so is the act of ordering the case for trial, against the objection that the allowance has not been paid. The remedy for a failure in this particular is by attachment. The aggrieved party must always address him or herself to the appropriate remedy, if they expect to be aided by courts. The complaint that the court suspended the allowance ordered, <em>pendente </em>lite, on the 15th of March 1865, is a matter we cannot notice on error. It has no foundation in fact, however. No order existed at the time for an allowance. The period had elapsed, embraced by the former order, and the amount paid; but not adverting to this, the court declared the allowance suspended, being of opinion that no further sum ought to be required to be paid by the libellant, owing to the delays and backwardness of the respondent to join issue and go to trial. We think the court was right in its conclusion as to this ; but if we did not think so, we are of opinion it was so much a matter in the discretion of the court, that we could not correct it.</p>
