A co-tenant put up a saw-mill, at his own expense, on the premises, at which lumber had been sawed after his fellow's title to a part of the land had accrued; the latter sued for mesne profits, amongst the rest, for timber cut. The court charged that if the jury believed that no timber had been taken from the land after the plaintiff's title accrued they should find for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to a share of the profits of the mill; whether they had been absorbed by its cost was for the jury, and the charge was error.</p>

We have often held this, and I will not stop to cite the authorities to show that a mere omission to charge on a particular aspect of a case is not error, where the attention of the judge has not been called to it with a request to charge on it. This error is therefore not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b408-15" data-blocks='[["BL_408.19",408,[290,2020,1152,340]]]'>2. The court was right, on authority, in ruling that the payment of rent by the defendant’s tenants, in permanent improvements on the land, such as clearing, fencing, &amp;c., which would necessarily enure to the plaintiff on his recovery in ejectment, ought not to be charged as profits received by the defendant. Improvements may be defalked against the claim for mesne profits: Ewalt <em>v. </em>Gray, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20428" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 428">6 Watts 428</a>; Morrison <em>v. </em>Robinson, 7 Casey 456.

But we are reluctantly compelled to reverse on account of the matter specified in the 3d assignment of error. The judge <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>charged in substance, that if no timber was cut on the land in 1858, and, if certain witnesses were believed, none was cut, the plaintiff could not recover. This was a binding instruction, and left out of view the fact that there was a saw-mill on the premises which it was proved cut a considerable amount of lumber after the plaintiff’s title accrued, and before his recovery in ejectment. A share of the profits of that was claimed ; and no matter where the timber was obtained, the plaintiff was entitled to have it, unless the value of the improvements, the mill, &amp;c., put on the premises by defendant, absorbed it. It is possible they will; the jury, however, only could adjust that; but the judge prevented them by the binding direction or instruction noticed above. On account of this extraordinary oversight on part of the court, this little case must be tried a third time.</p>
