The rule of law is as contended for by the defendant, that in the absence of proof to the contrary, by marked lines, monuments or other competent evidence, the lines of the official survey must prevail, and this would apply to the survey made on the warrant for the Bucher tract of land, and the lines of that survey in the absence of other proof would have to be extended, as called for by such survey. But in this case there is other evidence, for the official survey refers to Calhoun’s settlement which is said to be the land now claimed by Groff, and Mr. Strohm, as stated by me before, who made a survey of this property, says that the land now in dispute is included in the official survey of Groff’s land, and besides there is proof that those under whom Groff claims had been in possession of this property forty years ago and that the woodland was used as belonging to it. If therefore the evidence shows to <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>you that the land was not included in the survey of the land now claimed by the defendant, or that the plaintiff or those under whom he claims had the peaceable possession of the same for more than twenty-one years, then the courses and distances marked on such survey ought not to control your finding. As to the consentable line I would again remark: If such a line was established and consented to by the parties, the plaintiff or those under whom he claims being one of them, such agreement for a consentable line will be binding upon the parties and they will have to be governed by it, and this is a matter for your determination from all the evidence; and if such consentable line has been established and proved to your satisfaction and the wood was cut within such consentable line of the defendant, the plaintiff cannot recover, for if the alleged trespass was on the premises of the defendant of course plaintiff cannot recover.”</p>

The errors assigned complain chiefly of the statements of the testimony made by the court, but these do not appear in any binding form; and seem to have been referred to merely for the purpose of directing the attention of the jury to the real issues before them. We see nothing in these statements calculated to mislead, while the points of controversy were fairly submitted. It is not improper in a court to draw the attention of the jury to the material facts proved, in order to exhibit the true points of controversy ; provided it is not so done as to mislead them, or in a manner so onesided as to become unfair.</p>

    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[235,602,1147,1077]]]'>It was not error to charge, as is complained of in the 5th error assigned, that twenty-one years’ peaceable possession of the interference would prevent the courses and distances of the elder survey from controlling the title. While it is generally true that in the absence of marks of the original survey being found upon the ground, the courses and distances in the return of the survey will govern, and in the case of interfering surveys, will give title to the older survey, this is not an invariable rule. In the case of very ancient surveys, such as these (which were more than one hundred years old and lay in an old settled county), it cannot be expected that the ancient landmarks will always be found. Their places must therefore be supplied by secondary evidence. The peaceable possession of land for a very long time under an ancient survey is strong evidence of its location, when the ancient landmarks are not to be found; especially in such a case where two or three generations of men have passed away since the survey was made, and the testimony of living witnesses cannot be produced to point out where those landmarks stood. Every one familiar with the subject of old surveys made by men often not very skilful and oftentimes in haste to pass over the ground, knows how frequently mistakes creep in from bad chaining, and also from transferring the work to the field-notes, and thence into the return of survey. The return of survey which is so far removed by transfer from the original work upon the ground is permitted to govern only when the evidence of location is no longer accessible.</p>
