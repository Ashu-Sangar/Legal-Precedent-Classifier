It was admitted at the trial that the lots described in the foregoing deeds were <em>in fact </em>located on No. 4881, instead of No. 4884, and that the locations correspond with the descriptions in the deeds, except as to the'number of the warrant. The defendants called Payne, who testified that Benzinger, who owned 10,000 or 12,000 acres there, employed him, in 1844, as his attorney to <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>locate the warrants ; McKee’s tract adjoined Benzinger’s. Under the advice of Payne, Benzinger consented that Payne should purchase MeKee’s lot for him, which he did by a contract to himself, in pursuance of which a deed was made to Benzinger, and the contract delivered up to McKee. Payne afterwards located 4881 and some other lots; and as he “ fixed the McKee tract, 4884, West creek crossed it. In 1844 no one resided on this lot.” The improvement on it commenced in 1845. Werner lived on this improvement ; he had in 1852 a log-house and barn. William Nelson, also for defendants, testified that he had been employed by Payne to run out and sell Benzinger’s lands; that he and Morris went to the tract called 4881; that Werner’s improvement was on the tract called No. 4884; that they went through what they called 4884, and in going to what they called 4881 they passed Werner’s improvement, which was about one acre, with a garden. Payne had previously shown- him the lines of what they called 4881 — the north and south lines on the west end of the warrant; that as he and Morris passed along, Morris made inquiry about the' lands, and Nelson told him they belonged to Benzinger and Eschbach, that Werner had bought them, and that he, Nelson was acting as agent in looking for purchasers ; that he had told Payne he had shown this lot to Morris, and that he was suited with it; he had been sent to show Morris this identical lot; that he had a draft of the lot, which had been given him by Payne; there was no improvement on the lot he had shown to Morris; that Werner had no house on his improvement at that time ; he put a log-house on it in thé fall of 1849 ; that the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad passed through what he called 4884; that the south line of the lot which he showed to Morris was north of .West creek; that Gamer, an agent of Benzinger and Eschbach, showed him a draft of these lands. Charles Lahr, a witness for defendants, acted as agent for Morris for about five years, under a power of attorney; Morris was never on the land with him, but from information given him by Morris he found the land just where he had told him, north of the railroad and West creek. Millingar brought a letter to him requesting him to show Millingar the lot, he did not show it, but explained the situation to Millingar as Morris had done to him ; Millingar thought that it was noA the right lot; he told Millingar that the lot did not include any of the defendants’ improvements, and that 4881 was north of the improvements; Morris went to see the land three times whilst he owned it. When Millingar purchased, Schoebel, Haberberger, Sorg and Konle were on the land. Werner had moved away before Millingar bought and Schoebel occupied the Werner improvements. The buildings on Schoebel’s land would cost $6000, on Haberberger’s, $4000, on Sorg’s, $500. Up to the time of trial no one had occupied what the witness called the Morris tract. Werner’s improvement, <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>according to this witness, commenced about 1847, and his brother commenced on the next lot in about two years afterwards. Other witnesses testified as to going past the Werner improvement in about 1856 or 1857 with Morris to what they called 4881, and that the improvement was shown to him. Morris lived in Pitts-burg.</p>

While surveying for them he advises them to purchase 4884, for them he makes the negotiation which results in their obtaining a deed for it. Still in their service he locates the warrant and mistakenly puts it upon ground of which he is owner. He subdivides it into lots, sees a settlement made upon it by vendees of his principals. These settlements increased in number and value from 1846 to 1849, when Werner made his improvement up to the time when the present plaintiff purchased in 1865. The location made by Payne had been acquiesced in by himself, adopted and acted upon by his principals and the settlers under them, and improvements of great value made upon the lands.

We agree with the court below that the facts constituted an equitable estoppel, but disagree with them in limiting its extent to those parts of the tract which were settled and improved. Hiram Payne was the owner of tract 4881, which by mistake he supposed to lie upon No. 4880, one range north of the true location of 4881. When he sold 4881 to Morris, he directed him to 4880. Morris was shown 4880 as Payne’s land, and bought it and continued to regard it as his own until he sold to Millingar, the plaintiff, who also was shown 4880 as Morris’s land, and bought it.

Benzinger &amp; Eschbach, who owned a large tract of adjoining land. Moses McKee was the owner of 711 acres of 4884, whose true location is one tract south of 4881. B. C. Mauer was the owner of the remaining 311 acres of 4884. Payne, as the agent of Benzinger &amp; Eschbach, supposing that 4884 was located on the ground occupied by his own tract 4881, advised them to buy McKee’s part of 4884; and accordingly entered into a contract of purchase himself with McKee; upon which a deed was afterwards made to Benzinger &amp; Eschbach, who paid the money, and the contract was surrendered to McKee’s agent. The deed actually describes the 711 acres as lying in 4881, beginning at the sugar-tree, the south-east corner of 4881, but states the number as 4884. Benzinger &amp; Eschbach, believing themselves to be the owners of this part of 4881, divided it into parcels and sold it, viz., 500 acres on the western side to Yan Marsonville, who conveyed to the Mitchells, two of the defendants, 50 acres, and 36 acres to Haberberger, a defendant, 50 acres to Weiner, a defendant, and 50 acres to Schoebel, a defendant. These sales were all made, deeds delivered and purchase-money received without notice or knowledge of the mistake in the location, and Morris, the owner of 4881, still remaining in the belief that it was located where 4880 lies. Morris bought of Payne in August 1849, and when on his way to visit tract 4880, accompanied by Nelson, the agent of Payne, who was going with him to show it to him as 4881, he was shown, by Nelson, Weiner’s improvement on 4881, which he pointed out as 4884. He was then also informed by Nelson, while passing through 4881 on their way to 4880, that Benzinger &amp; Eschbach were the owners of that tract, and Weiner had bought of them. Nelson was then acting as Payne’s agent, and was going with Morris to show him Payne’s tract, which Morris intended to and did purchase immediately afterwards. According to Nelson’s testimony, Weiner’s improvement consisted of about an acre of land, and he put up a small log-house soon afterwards in the same fall. But according <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>to Payne’s testimony, the improvements on the tract were commenced as early as 1845 or 1846, and had grown to considerable size in 1849. It is thought Payne is contradicted by the date of the deed to Benzinger &amp; Eschbach, in August 1847: But as there was a precedent contract of purchase, this is not satisfactory. Some of the vendees of Benzinger &amp; Eschbach were in possession at least as early as 1849, and before Morris bought. Since that time Schoebel’s improvements have been increased so largely, that they were valued at $6000. He bought out Weiner, and his improvements are upon his own purchase and that of Weiner. Haberberger’s improvements were valued at $4000 or $4500. The 500 acres owned by the Mitchells are unimproved. It is very clear that all the parties have acted in utter ignorance of the true location of their lands. Payne, and Morris, his vendee, believed that 4880 was 4881; and Benzinger and their vendees believed that 4881 was 4884; and all have continued to act accordingly. But Payne’s act was a positive one, and misled all the others, he advised his principals to buy his own tract, he made the contract with McKee for it, he took the deed for it to his principals, and they paid the money for it. They actually purchased 4881, though denominating it as 4884. They did not intend to buy 4884 but 4881 as it lay on the ground. It was 4881 with all its natural advantages they intended to obtain, and their deed describes it in fact except in the number. Not only did they buy 4881 in fact, but they afterwards divided and sold it out in parcels, making conveyances and receiving payment. Their condition is such they cannot retrace their steps if they would. They are bound by their conveyances, and some of their vendees have expended large sums of money on the faith of their title. Under these circumstances Payne would be estopped as to the whole purchase of Benzinger &amp; Eschbach. He misled them to their injury not only in expending their own money upon the purchase of 4881, but in placing themselves in a false- position towards their own vendees. To permit him now-to prove the truth of his title to 4881 would involve them not only in the loss of the land itself they were induced to purchase and pay for, but would subject them to strife and litigation with their vendees. For these reasons we think the court below erred in confining the estoppel to those parts of the tract in the hands of their vendees who had made valuable improvements upon them. It is impossible to restore Benzinger &amp; Eschbach to the same position they were in -when they were induced by Payne to buy the land. The cases bearing upon the question of equitable estoppel are so numerous I shall only refer to the following as fully sustaining our application of the principle to the facts of the present case: Diamond Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Fisher, 7 Harris 267; Beaupland <em>v. </em>McKeen, 4 Casey 124; McKelvey <em>v. </em>Truby, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 323" data-case-ids="1856560" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0323-01">4 W. &amp; S. 323</a> ; <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Buchanan <em>v. </em>Moore, 13 S. &amp; R. 304; Carr <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/watts/7/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="7 Watts 394" data-case-ids="1846870" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0394-01">7 Watts 394</a>; Lewis <em>v. </em>Carstairs, <a href="/whart/6/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="6 Whart. 193" data-case-ids="1836944" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0193-01">6 Whart. 193</a>; <a href="/whart/6/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="6 Whart. 193" data-case-ids="1836944" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0193-01">Id.,</a> <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">5 W. &amp; S. 209</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moltz, 10 Barr 530-31; Hill <em>v. </em>Epley, 7 Casey 333-4; Woods <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20379" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Wright 379">1 Wright 379</a>.</p>

He bought with a full knowledge tha.t Benzinger &amp; Eschbach were claiming title to this tract, derived from Payne’s agent while on their way to visit the land he intended to purchase, and then saw himself the improvements of Weiner, their vendee. More than this, he did not intend, in fact, to purchase this tract, for he was shown and actually bought 4880, and continued to claim it as his own until he sold it to Millingar. He stands also in privity with Payne as his alienee, who sold him the land now known as 4880. It is true he was ignorant that his conveyance applied to the land which Payne induced Benzinger &amp; Eschbach to buy, but this does not alter the fact that he did not buy that land, but bought and paid for the land covered by 4880 ; held himself out to the world as its owner, and so sold it to the plaintiff. His acts, as the alienee, united with Payne’s act in keeping up the delusion originated by Payne. Under these circumstances his purchase and continued claim of the tract known now as 4880 were positive acts connected with Payne’s act, characterizing his own continued silence, and this gave it also a positive effect in misleading those who were the professed owners-of 4881. It was not mere silence, but an operative quietude injuriously affecting those in possession of 4881; and its effect is displayed in the extent and value of the improvements which sprang up during his undisturbed and long continued repose. The case is uncommon — one of mutual error and of great hardship — but it is a mistake proceeding from one and the same person who misled all the rest, and which cannot now be remedied without great injustice to those who were first misled by Payne. It seems to be a case, therefore, to which we must apply the maxims, <em>prior in tempore potior est in jure </em>— melior <em>est conditio possidentis. </em>As to the 311 acres in possession of M. &amp; W. Konle and F. X. Long, the case is different. The title to this part came from B. E. Mauer to Horace Little, who sold to the Konles. Payne had nothing to do with this sale, and the doctrine of estoppel, therefore, does not apply.</p>
