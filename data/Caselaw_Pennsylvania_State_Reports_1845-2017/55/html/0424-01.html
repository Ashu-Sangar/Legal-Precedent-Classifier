I told him that I might change two of them, but that there was not space to change the other. I wanted him to let me write a codicil and he asked me if he would have to write his name to it, and I told him he would. He said he didn’t want to do that. I told him it would give room to the other heirs to make trouble, and give them a better chance to contest the will. He said he didn’t think they would. I requested <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>him to let me take the will home and write a new one and he declined to permit it, as he did not want to write. I hesitated at first, bnt afterward made the alterations as they appear now in the will. I changed the legacy to Mrs. Walker from $1500 to $1200 ; to Mrs. Dixon from $1500 to $1200 ; and Mary Gillan’s from $1800 to $1500. I told Mr. Gillan we must have a witness if the alterations were made, and Mr. Dyarman was then sent for. He came. The date was then changed to the 15th of February. Mr. Gillan said it would not be his will on that day as he had not signed it then, and I suggested that if he would acknowledge his signature in the presence of the witnesses it would be equivalent to having signed it then. I then changed the date to the 15th of February. I showed him the will and all the alterations in the presence of Mr. Dyarman; explained them to the witness Dyarman, and Mr. Gillan then declared in our presence that this was his signature and this was his will. No new signatures were made that day by the testator or the witnesses. Mr. Gillan appeared to be suffering a great deal of pain and was lying in his bed, and I can’t say whether he was able to sign his name or not.

    <p id="b426-8" data-blocks='[["BL_426.10",426,[331,753,1147,898]]]'>Sometime after the execution of his will dated as above, and its delivery for safe keeping, it appears that the testator came to the conclusion that he would make a change in it, so far as to reduce the legacies to his daughters, the appellants,-$300 each; giving as a reason, a fear that the expenses incident to his sickness would require this. To effectuate this purpose, he sent for the will, and desired the scrivener, with whom it had been deposited, and who had drawn it, to make this change by erasing the original sums mentioned, and interlining those intended. The scrivener made objections to this mode of accomplishing the object, and proposed writing a new will; but the testator insisted on the alteration, declaring an unwillingness to write his name again. Accordingly the alteration was made as he wished, and the date of the will altered to the 15th of February, the date of the alteration. The witnesses to the will were called in, and were present and their attention called to the change, and the testator acknowledged in their presence his former signature as the signature to the will. There was no new signing by the testator or.witnesses, and no intention expressed by the former of a design to change the will in any other particular, and the former custodian again took charge of the will at the request of the testator.</p>

In this decision the sons of the decedent, the residuary legatees, and who are the appellees in this case, acquiesced. Not so the daughters. They again appealed, in order, if possible, to create an intestacy as to their father’s estate, so as to become equal sharers in it with their brothers, by setting up a revocation of the will in the acts referred to.</p>

If these positions are maintainable, then a will may be destroyed without intending it, and by other means than those given in the statute, as the only evidence of the <em>animus revocandi. </em>It would be a repeal of the Statute of Wills of 1838, so far as the 13th section is concerned at least.</p>

This enumeration of the means of revoking wills establishes two general methods. The one by writing; such as making a new will, or codicil, or other writing executed in the forms necessary to be observed in making a will. Certainly nothing like this appears in this case. The other method is by acting directly on the paper on which the will itself is written; and this may be by burning, cancelling, obliterating or destroying it. These all contemplate some physical act done, to evince the intention to revoke. The extent may not be material, provided there he enough to show an intention to destroy or cancel.</p>
    <p id="b427-8" data-blocks='[["BL_427.8",427,[164,1583,1146,813]]]'>Here, there was neither burning, cancelling nor obliterating, or destruction of the will. If it had been claimed that the entire legacies to the daughters were destroyed by obliteration, there might have been abstractly some plausibility in it, but it was not intended, and nobody contends for it. Hut neither the signature to the will, nor its contents, were obliterated — I see not therefore how a careful interlineation could be held to be an obliteration within the act. The former means not destruction necessarily, as does the latter. Certainly it did not in this case, for the testator declared his will as altered, to be his will, and delivered it to be kept as. such. Keeping in mind that it is the entire instrument which we have to deal with, and not the effect of the interlineation upon the legacies to the appellants, it must be apparent to all that in point of form the will of William Grillan, deceased, was not revoked, and in point of fact was not intended to be by him. It being a complete will, it could only be revoked in some one of the modes designated in the statute. “ Those modes are an exclusion of all others Heise <em>v. </em>Heise, 7 Casey 246 ; <a href="/watts-serg/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 455" data-case-ids="1853571" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0455-01">2 W. &amp; S. 455</a>.</p>
