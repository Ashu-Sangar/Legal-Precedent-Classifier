The purchaser pays so much money as the price of the <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>mortgaged estate, and that money is distributable among such creditors as have their liens upon the estate divested by the sale. But Sheaff is not such a creditor. He had no lien that was divested by the sale. If his salary was one of the expenses which the company deemed necessary to the direction and administration of the company, he is entitled to be paid out o'f the rents accruing upon the lease of January 1847, which fund the auditor ascertained to amount at the time of sale to $776.87. This was the fund that was reserved out of the mortgage, or so much of it at least as in the judgment of the company was “ necessary to defray the expenses of direction and administration, and to continue, complete, extend and repair their works or any part thereof.” That is the fund to which Sheaff and all the officers of the company should look for their salaries. No doubt they will have a contest for it with the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, because all of it that was not subject to the reservation passed to him ; but that contest does not belong to this proceeding. Here nothing is in question except the fund raised by the sheriff’s sale, and to that it appears to us that Sheaff is a mere stranger.</p>

The instrument itself answers, “ all the tolls, profits and emoluments of the navigation which now are or hereafter may be reserved and made payable to them upon the sale, lease or conveyance of any part of their estates, rights or privileges, <em>especially a certain lease made and entered into the </em>1st <em>day of </em>January, A. D. 1847, c.,” designating the very lease out of which the rents issue. That the <em>rents </em>of that lease may be and must be included in the comprehensive terms of “ <em>tolls, profits and </em>emoluments,” results not only out of the laws of language, but out of the very particular reference which the reservation makes to the lease. For what else but rents could accrue to the company from the lease ? As surely as the reservation is expressed in English, some profits or emoluments of this particular lease were intended to be reserved, and unless they were rents, it is impossible to see what they could be. That they were not <em>called </em>rents is immaterial, for if the thing is sufficiently designated, we are not to misunderstand it because it is not called by its most appropriate name. We mistake neither persons nor things on account of misnomers, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>if there is enough of inaccurate language to individuate the object intended.</p>
    <p id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[217,534,1152,172]]]'>But these considerations do not really belong to the case as presented upon this record. The appellant clearly has no claim upon the fund now in question, and therefore he takes nothing by his appeal.</p>
