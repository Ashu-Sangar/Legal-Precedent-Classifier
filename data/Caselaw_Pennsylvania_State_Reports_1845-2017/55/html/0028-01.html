The plaintiffs in this case, Schloss &amp; Bro., and the defendant, Mr, Oonrow, were both present at this sale, and both became purchasers of a part of that tobacco. The plaintiffs bought forty boxes, the defendant bought fifty. The sale appears to have been advertised for some days, and a day appointed, I think, on which the goods were to he exhibited for the inspection of purchasers at that sale at that time ; and the inspection of these goods the defendant and the plaintiffs attended, with many others, and they made an examination of the goods, and had as fair an opportunity, I suppose, as could be (from the account of Captain Young), of knowing what the quality of the article was. On the 26th day of August, the plaintiffs in this case say they sold forty boxes of tobacco, which they had bought on the 2d, to the defendant for $1760 — sold it at 40 cents a pound, and that is the aggregate at that price. The claim of the plaintiffs is, therefore, a very common count on its face: it is for goods sold and delivered for a price which was fixed and amount ascertained. They say they are entitled to receive of the defendant that amount with the interest from the time at which they sold, which they claim was on the 26th of that month, August 1864. The first question is, whether there was any sale — whether the plaintiffs did sell this property to the defendant ? The plaintiff has produced a witness here, Mr. Katz, who was his book-keeper, and he says, producing a hill for this very article, so many boxes, designating the whole amount, showing the number of pounds, fixing the price and carrying it out to be this amount, $1760. Mr. Katz says that a copy of that bill he delivered to Mr. Oonrow at his store, No. 419 Third street, between Callowhill and Willow; that he gave this hill to Mr. Oonrow himself; and he says that Mr. Conrow, when he did it, said it was all right. That is the evidence of the sale. You have seen the bill. The goods were sent the next day. <em>You </em>

      <em>know </em>of what I am now speaking <em>and confining </em>myself to the actual sale. If a bill was presented in this way, and the parties to whom it was sent said it was all right, I leave it to you to say there was no difficulty about that fact, whether the property was really sold or not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b30-6" data-blocks='[["BL_30.6",30,[327,627,1146,427]]]'>He says that after that, on the very next day, he had a conversation with Mr. Conrow; that Mr. Conrow came to the plaintiffs’ store, and he asked for Mr. Lazarus Schloss, who is one of the three members of the firm who seems to have attended to this matter of the tobacco business, the plaintiff, as you know, being of entirely different business. He was told he was not in. That Mr. Conrow called again, and left a message that he would be much obliged if Mr. Schloss would let him off as to half, as he had much of the tobacco on hand. <em>Then </em>there is evidence all bearing on the same point.</p>

And then he says that the commodity-did not accord with the sample at all, but that it was of a very inferior quality; that the sample was of good merchantable tobacco, that there were three plugs of the tobacco exhibited, and the witness in that case says that it was that which was exhibited as a sample, that it was apparently ‘ sound damaged ;’ he says it had been, but it was yet merchantable. The defendant says that he bought it by that sample, and that there was not a correspondence in the bulk and sample, and on that he makes his defence, that he is not liable at all; and the evidence, you know, shows by the drayman, that on a certain day (I believe it was the 25th or 26th of August) that he hauled these forty boxes to the defendant’s store, and he asked where it was to be placed at the first, and it was put out upon the pavement — that was the direction, and that some dispute arose about it, the parties insisting on the part of the defendant that he was bound to carry it into the store, he refusing to take it from the pavement; he went in and delivered the second load in the same way, and the third, I believe, making three loads of this tobacco, the salesman or some one having the superintendence of the defendant’s business insisting upon it that the drayman was obliged to put it in <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>the store. He did not do so, and that was the matter of dispute between them; but the defendant couples together the account given by Mr. Peter S. Morris, of what took place with him when sent to the plaintiff’s store. Mr. Morris says that he was in the employ of Mr. Oonrow, and that he (Conrow) specially told him to go to the store of these parties and to see the tobacco which the plaintiffs had bought at the marshal’s sale. He went and he made the inquiry of them for that specific tobacco. He says he inquired for the lot of tobacco which was bought at the marshal’s sale; that Mr. Lazarus Schloss, who was the party who purchased this and <em>seemed </em>to know about it, was not in ; that another member of the firm mentioned that and told him to call on somebody in their employ, Mr. Bailey, I think, a respectable old man, and he, together with Mr. Morris, went and examined the tobacco; Mr. Morris says there were three or four plugs exhibited to him which were said to be a sample, and, as I have just said, he describes those plugs as being apparently right sound tobacco. He speaks particularly of their color, and he speaks of them in other respects as tobacco of a good quality, which he thought was worth 40 cents. I do not know whether he offered it, but the price he asked was 45 cents, and Mr. Morris, having no authority, he says that price of 45 cents being above his limit he could do nothing, and did do nothing, except to go back to the store of the defendant; and I believe the defendant being himself away at that time and continuing away for some seven or eight days, when the defendant came back he, Mr. Morris, made a report to him of what kind of tobacco it was, what price was taken, &amp;c. But he says particularly that he neither had authority to make a contract except as to a limited price, and that he did make no contract; that there was no contract between the parties through his intervention, and he knows that he never made any. Mr. Conrow appears to have come back something like ten days after this, and what took place then, whether Mr. Conrow went himself to the store, as Mr. Katz says, or how it was, we have no evidence from the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b31-6" data-blocks='[["BL_31.6",31,[221,1903,1154,514]],["BL_32.1",32,[328,390,1150,970]]]'>Mr. Katz says, that Mr. Conrow-came there himself, he does not speak of having heard any contract between them ; but a bill was prepared, according to the instructions he received, and taken to the defendant, and said, by Mr. Conrow, to be all right. That bill is, as I said, the evidence of the contract; now the defend ant seems to make up a defence by coupling what took place between Mr. Morris, who made no bargain at all, and what took place afterwards, through Mr. Conrow or somebody else, for he never has said how it was or why the terms which were asked for the tobacco, 45 cents a pound, were abandoned and 40 cents substituted for it; and at a distance, too, of some eight or ten days after Mr. Morris had been sent there, and made no kind of con<a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>tract at all, because be had no power to authorize him to do it. The defendant says, that .this tobacco was, as I said to you, by the production of a certain kind of sample, warranted to be of that kind ; and that not being of that kind, there is no contract here. I call your attention to the fact that there was no conversation, or anything else, that is in evidence here, of -what took place at the time the tobacco was actually bought; the evidence is clear that there was no contract at all through Mr. Morris, and that Mr. Conrow was absent for a number of days — I think it is said ten days; that Mr. Katz said that Mr. Conrow came himself, and there is no evidence at all of what passed between Mr. Con-row and the plaintiffs in this case; all you can collect on the subject is, that there must have been a sale, because Mr. Conrow afterwards received a bill which, in effect, declared there -was a sale, and that he said it was right; but there is no evidence at all there was any exhibition to him of any plug or plugs or anything of the kind — nothing in the shape of a sample, nothing alleged to be a sample, nor, indeed, that there was anything that took place at the time, as I stated to you. You may find what Mr. Morris said to be so. You may find that he made no contract, and he went away; that ten or twelve days passed; that then there was, if you find it so, a contract, that Katz speaks of, made so at that time.</p>

Now I say you cannot connect, from any evidence.that is here, the visit and the conversation between Mr. Morris and the plaintiff in this case, and, as far as I can see (I leave it for you), there is no evidence at all. The price having been entirely changed, 45 cents having been asked and 40 cents taken, it is for you to say whether there was not an entirely new agreement proposed, one in which there was no sample or guaranty of any kind. If you recollect, the article was sold as damaged, known to be damaged prize tobacco, and it is, probably, I submit to you, one of the most <em>unwarrantable </em>and unusual things to warrant, an article that is confessedly known to all the parties to be a damaged article. Well, then, gentlemen, if you find there was no warranty of this, then we have but the ordinary case of a bargain and sale of goods, <em>a purchase and sale of goods, </em>and at an <em>ordinary price, </em>for there is no dispute about that, and it comes to a certain amount; the goods were left with the defendant, who did dispute it; he wanted them to be sent back, but nevertheless I leave it to you to say whether there was a doubt that there was really a sale between the parties. The judge then referred to the letter written at the time of the alleged delivery of the tobacco by the defendants to the plaintiffs; he added that it was for the jury, taking all the evidence in the case, to say whether 'there had been a sale or otherwise. He then read the letter in question to the jury, and added, no allegation here of broken boxes and nothing else, and nothing said that they never bought this article not square with the contract, or anything said about it.

It would be needless to cite authorities to this effect. Our own books, and those of our sister states, abound with them. The greatest precision is required in the English courts in the mode of taking exceptions on a trial. It may not be amiss to refer to a single reported case, Bains <em>v. </em>Whitehaven, 3 Clark’s Appeal Cases 16. The opinion, which was unanimous, was delivered by Lord Brougham. His language is: “ It is necessary that when a party excepts to the reception of evidence, to the rejection of evidence, or to the direction of the judge given to the jury — whatever is the subject-matter of his exception, he must state the ground of his exception, otherwise he cannot except. It is not enough for him to say, I except to the receiving of A.’s evidence, or, I except to the rejection of A.’s evidence, or I except to the <em>first passage </em>in the direction given by the learned judge to the jury. If he objects to the reception of A.’s evidence, he must show why it should not be received, as, by stating that A. was incompetent, &amp;c. If he objects to the learned judge’s direction to the jury, he must state, not merely that he does object, but the ground on which he objects. In all these cases, the ground of objection must be clearly stated,-and beyond the grounds of objection thus stated, the court is not at all bound to look.” And this is nothing more than was said by Chief Justice Gibson (Wolverton <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 7 S. &amp; R. 278), as mentioned in the answer before us.</p>
