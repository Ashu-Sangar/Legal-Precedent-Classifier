The war of 1812 and its debt produced the second Bank of the United States. And the late rebellion and its debt have produced the present system of national banks spread over the whole country, and controlled and governed by a bureau in the treasury department, the chief officer of which is the comptroller of the currency. The principal object of this plan was to provide a national currency secured by a pledge of United States bonds, and to provide for the circulation and redemption thereof. Associations for carrying on the business of banking were authorized, which from the date of their organization-certificates became bodies corporate for a period of twenty years.</p>

The shares are to be $100 each and the stockholders are to be individually responsible for the debts of the association to the extent of their stock therein at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in their shares. These notes are to be received at par in all parts of the United States in payment of taxes, excises, public lands and all other dues to the United States except duties on imports, and also for all salaries and other debts and demands owing by the United States to individuals, corporations and associations within the United States, except interest on the public debt and in redemption of the national currency. These notes when presented must be redeemed at par in lawful money — that is, legal-tender notes— and every association must receive them at par for any debt or liability to such association. When the legal-tender notes are funded or withdrawn, then this national currency must be redeemed in gold and’ silver coin, which will then be the only lawful money. These associations may become depositaries and financial agents of the government, and then they shall receive and take at par all of the national currency bills, by whatever association issued, which have been paid into the government for internal revenue or for loans or stocks.</p>

These cases also decided that a state could not tax it, the first case being a stamp tax on the notes of a branch, and the second a tax on one of its branches. “ When a state taxes the operations of the government of the United States, it acts upon institutions created not by their own constituents, but by people over whom they claim no control. It acts upon the measures of a government created by others, as well as themselves, for the benefit of others in common with themselves. The difference is that which always exists and always must exist between the action of the whole on a part, and the action of a part on the whole — between the laws of a government declared to be supreme, and those of a government which, when in opposition to those laws, is not supreme.”</p>

This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the Constitution has declared.”</p>

J: Marshall says, p. 861, “ While they seem to admit the right to preserve this corporate existence, they deny the right to protect it in its trade and business. If there be anything in this distinction it would tend to show that so much of the act as incorporates the bank is constitutional, but so much of it as authorizes its banking operations is unconstitutional.” After discussing this question, he continues: “ Deprive a bank of its trade and <em>business, </em>which is its sustenance, and its immortality, if it have that property, will be a very useless attribute. This distinction, then, has no real existence. To tax its faculties, its trade and occupation, is to tax the bank itself; to destroy or preserve the one is to destroy or preserve the other.”</p>

      <em>“ </em>If the trade of the bank be essential to its character, as a machine for the fiscal operations of the government, that trade may be as exempt from state control as the actual conveyance of the public money. Indeed, a tax bears upon the whole machine, as well upon the faculty of collecting and transmitting the money of the nation as on that of discounting the notes of individuals. No distinction is taken between them.” <em>“ </em>Considering the capacity of carrying on the trade of banking is an important feature in the character of this corporation, which was necessary to make it a fit instrument for the objects for which it was created, the court adheres to its decision in the case of Mc-Culloch against The State of Maryland.”</p>

To say that they did not intend a tax of the capital, would be to impute to the legislature ignorance of the fact that the capital of banks enters into their average quarterly business.’ That they must have known when they passed the act.
