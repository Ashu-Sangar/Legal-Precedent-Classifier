But the parties have disposed of the rents, issues and profits by their contract of 24th June. By it the plaintiff became landlord, and was entitled to all the rents, issues and profits of the estate, from and after the 24th of June, including the proceeds of the farm. What proceeds does this refer to ? We think it includes all proceeds derived from the farm after that date. The wheat was then growing, as well as the corn and oats, all sown and planted by the tenant of the vendors ; and they might, with as much propriety, claim the whole of the proceeds of the oats and corn. But the agreement goes further. Mr. Stouffer was to receive the rents, and account to the vendors for their portion of them, up to July 1st 1864. This would include all rents not due and payable at the date of the agreement. It is not material to the question presented, whether we consider the wheat sown in the fall of 1863, which matured in the summer of 1864, the rents of 1863 or 1864. By the custom in Pennsylvania, the tenant who sows the land, and whose time of tenancy expires on the 1st of April following, before the maturity of the grain sown by him, has a right of entry after the expiration of the time of his occupancy, to cut and take away the way-going crop; so that his lease does <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>not terminate with his right of occupancy, but continues for certain purposes, and gives him a right to enter and take away the grain he has sown. The grain sown in 1868, and harvested in 1864, are the issues and profits of 1864, for they then accrue and are received; and a farmer, in counting up the profits of his farm, reckons the crop harvested the same season, and does not include the wheat crop of the preceding summer and omit that which is realized with his oats and corn. In common parlance, in Pennsylvania, the issues and profits of a farm to the landlord are the proceeds of the crop realized in one season. But if the proper construction of the contract of sale is, as contended for by defendant’s counsel, that the wheat sown in 1863, and harvested in 1864, are the issues and profits of 1863, and not of 1864, then the vendors would not only receive the whole of the crop cut in 1864, but one-fourth of the fall crop sown in 1864 and harvested in 1865, more than a year after they had executed the deed and delivered possession to the vendee.</p>
