On this note judgment was entered December 2d 1861; that plaintiff permitted his property to be sold by the sheriff under this judgment. Amongst the property was the lot bought of Sparks, which was sold to Brown for $2000, it having been agreed at the time between the plaintiff and Brown that Brown was acting as plaintiff’s agent, and that the sale was necessary to enable him more advantageously to settle with his creditors, there having been no intention that Brown should become the beneficial owner of the property ; that the property sold and assigned to Brown was far greater in value than the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>amount of the plaintiff’s debts ; that Brown made no claim of the property presently after the sale, but that plaintiff continued in full and undisturbed possession of it; that in 1864 Brown, upon representations to plaintiff that some persons were making difficulty in relation to the settlement of his affairs, induced plaintiff to take a lease from him of the Sparks lot. The bill also charged the doing by Brown of other acts recognising the ownership of the plaintiff in the lot; but that in the spring of 1864 Brown offered the lot for sale, and, against the remonstrances of the plaintiff, sold it io Ansbacher, the other defendant, for $8000. The bill further chai’ged that Ansbacher was not a bond, fide purchaser without notice, having received notice from plaintiff before the purchase that he was the owner and that he objected to the sale of it by Brown, and also that S. Longstreet, Esq., the attorney of Ansbacher, received notice of the same facts; that Ansbacher’s deed from Brown is with special warranty, and that he is informed that Brown and Ansbacher have determined to oust him from the premises in April 1865. The prayer of the bill was: That the defendants may be decreed to transfer and deliver over to the plaintiff all papers and evidences of title to the premises and property of right belonging to him; and to deliver up everything that they or either of them may have improperly obtained, or which may in anywise interfere with his perfect title thereunto; and to make and execute such and any conveyance or conveyances as may be necessary to reinstate him as fully in the indisputable title to these premises as he was before any of these proceedings commenced; and that they may be restrained by an injunction from in anywise disturbing or attempting to disturb him in the possession of his property, &amp;c.</p>

The questions raised are very simple indeed. In the plaintiff’s bill it is charged that the defendant Ansbacher bought the messuage and tenement in question, with notice that Brown, his vendor, had no authority to sell it, because Leach was the equitable owner of it; that Ansbacher was not a bond fide purchaser for a full and valuable consideration, and ought therefore to be restrained from seeking to disturb him in the possession. Brown held the plaintiff’s title by sheriff’s sale, and when he sold, the plaintiff occupied the position of his tenant under a written lease from him.</p>
    <p id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.9",89,[174,983,1155,215]]]'>The notice of title in Leach was positively denied in the answers of both Ansbacher and Brown. The master found that there was no such notice; and the court below, owing to the absence of definite exceptions to the master’s report, went into a review of the testimony for itself, and arrived at the same conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b89-8" data-blocks='[["BL_89.10",89,[174,1198,1155,428]]]'>On account of the irregularity which brought upon the court below the necessity of examining the testimony, in order to decide the case, we have been forced to look over the entire testimony likewise, to see that the learned judge made no mistake in his finding of the facts. The result of our investigation is, that there is not a shadow of testimony to sustain the plaintiff’s allegation of notice denied by the answers. On the contrary, there is abundant testimony that Leach knew of the sale to Ansbacher by Brown, and not only gave no notice of any title or trust in his favor, but assented to and approved of it.</p>
    <p id="b89-9" data-blocks='[["BL_89.11",89,[175,1627,1155,472]]]'>To have sustained his claim of an interest against the sheriff’s deed, and his position of tenant to the purchaser, would have required clear notice; but nothing in the transaction gave the least sign to put the purchaser on inquiry. The possession will, it is admitted; but when the party is in possession under a lease, the knowledge of the lease dispenses with the inquiry of how the possession is held. That knowledge the agent had, and of the very terms of the lease. That was enough for him; he was not bound to inquire of the tenant in possession if the lease was fair or fraudulent, or whether there was a trust notwithstanding: Sugd. on Vend. 339 ; Hood <em>v. </em>Fahnestock, 4 Barr 474.</p>
    <p id="b89-10" data-blocks='[["BL_89.12",89,[174,2094,1183,347]]]'>Nobody is required to make inquiry whether there is fraud or <em>t </em>trust w'here the title and possession give no indication that there is either. If there was no notice brought home to the defendant that his vendor had no right to sell, the title in his hands being all regular, and the possession being in accordance with the title, it is scarcely necessary to say, that he would take a clear title to the equitable interest conveyed by the sheriff’s deed, and that is just where this case stands, so far as the plaintiff is concerned.</p>
    <p id="b89-11" data-blocks='[["BL_89.13",89,[218,2438,1110,45]],["BL_90.1",90,[350,419,1160,515]]]'>Leach’s interest in the premises was but an equity, and the <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>purchaser at sheriff’s sale took it subject to what might be due the holder of the legal title. It was Leach’s interest only that passed By the sale to Brown. The same interest Brown sold and conveyed to Anshacher, who paid Brown for it in full before any notice of claim by Leach was given. That annulled any equity in the latter on the ground of notice before payment. What was to be paid the holder of the legal title does not concern him.. It was another matter altogether. Equity, on the score of payment after notice, applies to things pui’chased hut not paid for. Here what was purchased from Brown was fully paid for, and the notice therefore, before paying for the legal title does not weaken Ansbacher’s title to the equity he had purchased without notice.</p>
    <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[355,933,1154,473]]]'>It is scarcely necessary to remark on the strained inference of notice of a trust in favor of Leach, from the’ circumstance of a special warranty in the deed of Brown to the defendant. It did not imply knowledge of want of title. On the contrary, the implication is rather that the title had been examined and no covenant was needed. Deeds with general warranty in Philadelphia are almost unknown; and I have no doubt many persons would look on such a covenant with a suspicion that it implied that there was a defect somewhere, to be indemnified against by the covenant. Be “this as it may, it was'not a circumstance to put the defendant on inquiry for any secret trust outstanding against Brown’s title.</p>
