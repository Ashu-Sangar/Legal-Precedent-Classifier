Although this is not generally of much importance to the company, and only of practical importance in the court below to enable it to judge of the adequacy of the damages given, yet as the statute requires it, it must not be omitted. The requirement of the statute is not of details of soils composing the ground taken, -which, strictly speaking, the term quality implies ; but, as said in Zack <em>v. </em>The Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <em><a href="/wright/1/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Wright 469" data-case-ids="626196" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0481-01">supra,</a> </em>it is whether the land is “ barren or fertile, town or farm land, woodland or cultivated, hill-side or bottom.” In respect to the quality of the land, we think these reports sufficient. It is described as within the toAvn of Columbia — town property, therefore. Its use principally for board-yards and buildings, and was valued for such purposes. It Avould have been unmeaning to have declared it arable or meadoAv-land, fertile or barren, situate as it was in a large toAvn. The description of quality must have some respect to the location and circumstances of property; other<a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>wise it might be unmeaning and idle.

In our opinion, it sufficiently appears that the viewers compared the advantages and disadvantages to the owners by the contemplated branch road, and estimated damages and awarded compensation in view thereof. That they itemized what constituted the aggregate of their finding is a bad reason for holding that their finding is not according to law. The value of the property, and “ inconvenience and damage” to the balance, is an item to which a specific sum is affixed. The value of buildings, fences, &amp;c., constitute another. These are aggregated and compose the total of each award. The value of property taken is proper to be estimated: this is what the constitution requires, and would be the true measure of the damage done, unless diminished by considerations of the advantages over the disadvantages to the owner, in taking his property for the proposed improvement.</p>

And, although it appears on the paper-books, we have no jurisdiction of the facts, and cannot look into them, as on a.n appeal, or when they are brought up by a bill of exceptions. Neither the one nor the other is a remedy under the statute. On this point see The Chester Valley Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Reitenbaugh, 9 Harris 100, and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Bradford’s Heirs, 7 Id. 363.</p>
