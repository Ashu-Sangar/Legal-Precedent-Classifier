The chestnut-oak stood on the line that came up from the Yalley road. The testator called it Wolfe’s corner: said that it was a chestnut-oak tree. The testator said that the line from the Yalley road to the chestnut-oak corner was already laid down on the land, and the. line from the chestnut-oak to the mountain was to be a straight line.

The defendant insists that it should simply be an extension of the line on which the chestnut-oak stands as a corner. Either of these lines would be a ‘ straight line to the mountain.’ To determine this question of fact, or rather to shed such light upon it as would enable the jury to settle it, the defendant offers parol evidence to show that the testator intended the straight line to be an extension of a straight line already marked upon the ground, and it is objected to as inadmissible.</p>

    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.6",413,[208,651,1149,1550]]]'>The case on hand differs from those referred to, in this impoN tant particular, namely, that there is no ambiguity in the descrip-1 tion of the line directed to be run, or defect in terms, as to the subject described. “ Beginning at a chestnut-oak corner, northwest, near Wolf’s field, thence running in a straight line to the mountain,” seems neither ambiguous nor uncertain. There appears to be no difficulty about the <em>termini </em>of the line, or that it cannot he laid down as described ; and if so, it is a case in which parol evidence is not needed and not admissible: Wig. on Wills 17, and cases referred to under Proposition II. The testimony of William Mackey, admitted against the objection of the plaintiff, described a different line from that in the will. It was only because it did, that it was offered. The very difference, however, shows the error of the admission. The testator’s line, represented by the will, was to begin at a chestnut-oak corner, north-west, and thence in “ a straight line to the mountain.” Geometrically this would be the most direct line through the testator’s land to the mountain. The line proposed to be established by the parol evidence as the line intended by him, was the extension of a line from the chestnut-oak of a line running from the Valley road along Martha and Mary Kirkpatrick’s lot <em>to the chestnut-oak </em>at Wolf’s corner, thence in a straight line to the mountain. The <em>extension </em>of the line from the Valley road might result in a very different division of the land from that of a line beginning at the chestnut oak, and thence straight to the mountain, and the proof shows that it does. Thus to give effect to the testimony was change the will of the testator, and make his oral declarations his will, instead of what he had executed and published according to the forms of law, as his will. It would directly tend to encourage frauds and perjuries, to permit wills to be affected or altered proof of intention, from declarations of the decedent outside of what he had written as his will. All the formalities required in making a will by the statutes, were .to prevent this, and it is the duty of courts to execute the law in its true spirit. We think the testimony should not have been admitted, and that there was error in this, as also in the charge predicated of it.</p>
