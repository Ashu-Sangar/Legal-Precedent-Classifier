      <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>“ It is conceded that Weger was in the employment of the railroad company at the time of his death, and it is contended that it was caused by the mistake of Wilber, another employee of the company, in starting out with the hand-car when there was not sufficient time to run to the station, and that, as he was a superior employee, the company must be responsible for his blunder, or incautious act. [It is now well settled in England, and in nearly every state of this Union, that a servant who is injured by the negligence or misconduct of his fellow-servant, can maintain no action against the master for such injury.] See Redfiold on Railways, p. 386, and a host of authorities there cited. The same principle is fully recognised and adopted in our own state in Ryan <em>v. </em>The Cumberland Valley Railroad, 11 Harris 884. It is impossible to distinguish that case, in principle, from the one under consideration. There, as here, the injured man was not employed in running the cars, or in connection with the train, but in digging gravel to repair the road. The connection between the alleged cause of the disaster and the party injured was more remote than here, for the allegation was, that the engineer or conductor in that case had failed to hare the cars in proper order, and they were employed in a different occupation ; whilst in this they were all engaged in the same business — repairing the road. The only bond between them, in either case, was that they were servants of one common employer. Both are alike in this, that they were not pursuing their labor at the time, but were travel-ling from their place of boarding to their work. It is urged upon us that they were servants of different grades, the one a mere laborer, the other his director or superintendent. The same might be said as to the case of Ryan. But it is settled in other states that the difference in grade of those in one common employment, has no effect on the rule of law, nor that they were employed in different branches of labor at the time: see <a href="/mass/64/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Cush. 228" data-case-ids="1991596" data-case-paths="/mass/64/0228-01">10 Cushing 228</a> to 232; 6 Id. 75. [There is no proof that Wilber was either unskilful or negligent;] on the contrary, the only evidence in the case shows that he was reputed and known as both careful and vigilant. If he had been known to the company not to possess the requisite qualifications, yet had been kept in its employ, a different rule might apply : see Farwell <em>v. </em>Boston, &amp;c., Railroad Company, <a href="/mass/45/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Met. 49" data-case-ids="2065782" data-case-paths="/mass/45/0049-01">4 Met. 49</a>, 57, 60, 61; also, <a href="/mass/57/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Cush. 270" data-case-ids="1984096" data-case-paths="/mass/57/0270-01">3 Cush. 270</a>. This case is, in every particular, the same in fact and principle, as that reported in 10 Cushing, already cited, which we consider sound law; as is also that in 11 Harris 384, which is binding on this court. We have neither the power or disposition to disregard the rule there established, or fritter it away by fine-spun distinctions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[198,2313,1140,85]],["BL_464.1",464,[314,401,1142,798]]]'>“It is contended that the doctrine invoked applies only to those engaged in the common employment of running a train, as <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>engineer, conductor, brakesman, &amp;c., and not to mere laborers, who can, in no wise, contribute to the disaster. The present case well illustrates the danger of such distinctions. "Who can say that, if the two men working the hand-car had applied a very little more force, they would not have gotten safely through ? It is conceded that one minute more would have carried them to a place of safety. [It may, therefore, have been quite as much their fault as what they, in common parlance, call ‘ <em>the boss' </em>It is said that Wilber should have been furnished with the correct time, and that his watch was wrong; but it must be borne in mind that he was not employed to run trains, hut to superintend laborers.] They took the hand-car for mutual convenience in reaching their place of boarding, without any orders from the company, its superior officers or agents; and, as McCalla says, against his express orders. They all wished to save themselves the labor of walking to their meals. This is, however, a disputed question, and we have been considering the case as proved by the plaintiff alone, without calling your attention to the evidence of the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-5" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[311,1210,1142,767]]]'>“ One other position is assumed by the plaintiff: that the railroad company, by continuing Wilber in its employment since the accident, shows acquiescence in his acts, and knowledge of his carelessness or incapacity, and thereby renders itself responsible. The witness proves that he has been in the general employment of the company ever since, or a large portion of the time; in what capacity he does not state. But even had it been in running hand-cars, it could not help the plaintiff’s case. Guilty knowledge, to avail, must be proved to have existed <em>before </em>the accident. If a man has a dog who bites another, the owner is not responsible until the propensity is known; barely keeping the animal afterwards will not be evidence of previous knowledge, which is essential to create liability ; but for that occurring subsequently, the owner must respond. There is no proof of any previous want of care in Wilber, and we can see no evidence in the case which will render the company responsible for Weger’s death, or on which you can properly render a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs.”</p>

But it seems to be conceded that if there be any fault in the selection of the other servants, or in continuing them in their places, after they have proved incompetent, perhaps, or in the employing unsafe machinery, the master will be answerable for all injury to his servants in consequence. The law thus clearly stated by Judge Bedfield in his Law of Bailways, vol. 1, p. 521, is the rule in Pennsylvania and governs the present case. The deceased was killed (taking the evidence in its strongest light) by the negligence of his fellow-employee, and the only bond between them was, that there were servants of one common employer. The company, therefore, was not liable for the death of their employee. (See, also, Burges <em>v. </em>Wickham, in note to Readhead <em>v. </em>Midland Railway, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20Law%20J.%20Q.B.%20195" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="36 Law J.
