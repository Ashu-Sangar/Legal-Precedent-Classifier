He further alleged that the defendant, without having acquired any right by law and in violation of law, had constructed on the complainant’s land before described a house known as a eoal-schute, the main structure being 64 feet long and 37 feet wide, and a smaller building attached, being 16 feet long and 14 feet wide, the whole being 50 feet high, partly within the breadth of the 20 feet of the complainant’s land formerly occupied by the lateral railroad, but the greater part being outside of the 20 feet; that <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>Lance, without permission of the complainant, made a railroad connecting the said coal-schute with his tunnel or mouth of his coal-bed, a portion of the building being on complainant’s land, partly on the 20 feet formerly used for the lateral railroad and partly without said 20 feet, beginning at a point on the line between the complainant’s lands and those of The West Branch Coal Compány and by various courses and distances mentioned in the bill to a point at the commencement of a platform, and by an irregular curvature upon said platform and trestles crossing above the public wagon-road and the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to the north-west corner of the coal-schute; that said railroad was constructed on an ascending grade, being at the point where it commenced to run over the complainant’s land at the line of The West Branch Coal Company, eighteen-hundredths of a foot above the grade of the old lateral railroad and rising to the height of about 18 feet above the grade of said old lateral railroad where it connected with the coal-schute and at the same point about 26-|- feet above the grade of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg .Railroad, the ascent between the two points being gradual and the distance over the complainant’s land being about 900 feet, all being exhibited in a draft attached to the bill. The complainant further alleged, that Lance was continuing to use the said railroad and schute in carrying on the business of mining and shipping coal without permission of the complainant, &amp;c., and in the prosecution of such business was constantly depositing on the complainant’s land large quantities of coal, coal-dirt, culm, slate and rubbish in disregard of the complainant’s rights and of the law, notwithstanding he had frequently requested Lance to desist.

The defendant further averred that in pursuance of an act of incorporation passed about April 5th 1852, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company laid out, constructed and used a railroad 60 feet wide, which passed over the complainant’s land, crossing the lateral railroad as laid down on complainant’s draft and running both above and below the lateral railroad entirely across the land of the complainant ; that the grade of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad was about 7 or 8 feet below the level of the lateral railroad and was laid on the only practicable grade at the point where it crossed the lateral railroad; that if the lateral railroad had been kept at its grade as theretofore used, the Lackawanna and Blooms-burg Railroad could not have been used for a locomotive railroad and the purposes for which it was chartered would have been defeated; that the Mammouth Vein Coal Company and the railroad company entered into an arrangement for enabling the railroad company to use their road for the purposes for which it was chartered, and that in pursuance thereof the lateral railroad was raised several feet higher than its original grade, but that the defendant had no control or authority in relation to it and that the lateral railroad was no otherwise altered than in the grade. The defendant denied that the lateral railroad had been disused since 1856 or that it had at any time been disused and suffered to remain out of repair, since he became lessee of Thomas, for two years or more ; and denied that he or any one by his authority had constructed any railroad on Harvey’s land other than upon the lateral railroad constructed by Thomas and upon the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad. The defendant further averred that in January 1860, his schute-house at the terminus of the lateral railroad at the Nanticoke pool was burned, and that owing to the before-mentioned obstruction of the navigation in the pool he had not rebuilt it, but intended to do so ; that he had erected a coal-sehute as mentioned in the bill and that the whole of the schute is upon land occupied and appropriated for the lateral railroad and the land taken and used by the Lackawanna and Blooms-burg Railroad ; that it was erected by the consent and under the <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>authority of the railroad company, and is used for a coal-schute or coal-loading depot for the purpose of temporary deposits of coal taken from the mines and transported on the lateral railroad to the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad and unloaded into schutes in the building and thence in the ordinary way by gravity is loaded into the cars of the railroad company and transported to market; that he, the defendant, was out of possession of. the premises about 28 months. The defendant further averred that in 1855 the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company appropriated a strip of land belonging to Harvey about 60 feet wide for the purposes of their railroad, and had used the same ever since for such purposes; that about the time the company took said land, a fence was erected above the schute-house along the line of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, on the south-easterly side, which was the boundary on that side of the land so appropriated; that the surface of the ground along this fence and between it and the north-western boundary of said strip of land is much lower than the grade of the road, and that for the last two years he had been employed by the railroad company in filling up and grading said strip for the purpose of laying a second track, sidings, &amp;c., and that in doing this he had used culm, coal-dirt, &amp;c., and had deposited and was depositing considerable quantities of it cn the strip of land, which had been in the entire possession and control of the railroad company since 1855, and had not been since that time in the possession or under the control of Harvey.</p>

But as the case had not been sifted by a master, we referred it to one appointed by us, with authority to report on the whole case ; to take further testimony, if he deemed it essential to a full understanding of the controversy, to define as accurately as possible the area of plaintiff’s ground covered by the dirt and debris from the defendant’s mine, its depth and superficies, with an estimate of its amount in cubic yards, and to report to the court in banc at the ensuing October Term at Pittsburg. During that term the report was <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>accordingly made and filed, and the case submitted without argument on part of the appellant, printed or oral, and without filing any exception to the report, although in substance it did not materially differ from the facts which were found by the learned judge and which were the cause of the decree appealed from, nor have any exceptions ever been filed to the master’s report. However, notwithstanding these several findings of the learned judge, and afterwards of the master, we have also examined the testimony with care, and agree with them in all material points. This being the result, we shall affirm the decree, with a single suggestion as to its execution, leaving that to be carried into effect by the court below, viz.: That on compliance by the defendant with the decree in other particulars, he shall be allowed to enter a rule to show cause why that portion of it requiring the removal of the deposits of coal-dirt, slate, refuse coal and other materials made by the defendant and lessees or employees within the limits of the right of way of the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, should not be annulled or modified. If it be the bonS fide intention of the railroad company to occupy and use it as the bed of a second track or siding of their road, it would not benefit the plaintiff to have it removed to be replaced by other material in order to lay such track, and an unnecessary expense to the defendant. We will not, however, modify the decree in this particular at this time, but leave it to the court below to determine when the proper time arrives. Their proximity to the scene of action will enable them intelligently to supervise and do right in the matter.</p>

The power arises out of that natural principle which teaches that private convenience must yield to the public wants. This public interest must lie at the basis of the exercise, or it would be confiscation and usurpation to exercise it. This being the reason for the exercise of such a power, it requires no argument to prove that after the right has been exercised the use of the property must be held in accordance with and for the purposes which justified its taking. Otherwise it would be a fraud on the owner, and an abuse of power. Hence it is that no one can pretend that a railroad company may build private houses and mills, or erect machinery, not necessarily connected with the use of their franchise, within the limits of their right of way. If it could, stores, taverns, shops, groceries and dwellings might be made to line the sides of the road outside of the track — a thing not to be thought of under the terms of the acquisition of the fight of way. <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>The exercise of the right of eminent domain, whether directly by the state or its authorized gi’antee, is necessarily in derogation of private right, and the rule in that case is, that the authority is to be strictly construed: Dwarris on Stat. 750 ; 2 Casey 355 ; 3 Id. 339 ; 7 Harris 211. What is not granted is not to be exercised. When, therefore, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company, under its charter, and the promoter of the private railroad under the Act of 1832, were authorized to take private property for the use of their roads, the rights they acquired were a right of way and facilities necessary to the efficient use of the right. They were not empowered to use the exclusive right of way granted to each for any other independent purpose than that for which it was granted. The fee remained in the private owner, and outside of the authorized use, which must be public or incidental to the public use, the proprietary right is in the original owner: 1 Barr 336 ; 8 Id. 294; <a href="/watts-serg/6/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 378" data-case-ids="480128" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0378-01">6 W. &amp; S. 378</a>; Redf. on Railways 69. Upon these principles, without further elaboration, we think the court were right in holding the defendant bound to remove the deposits of dirt placed by him or under his authority from both roads, and most assuredly from the ground covered by it outside of them.</p>

The jury of view appointed by the court reported in favor of the proposed road, as applied for and surveyed. That was a road on the surface — an inclined plane all the way. In 1856, the grade was entirely changed. In place of an inclined plane from the starting-point, at the tunnel, the incline was rather in the opposite direction. The road was elevated on stilts, or timbers, beginning a short distance from the tunnel and gradually rising from the ground until at its junction with the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad it was 18 to 20 feet above the old road, and on that structure a slope was erected from which to ship coal on that railroad. It was contended below -that the defendant and his lessees had a right to take up the old road and reconstruct it in this manner. No authority for this was shown, nor can there be. The proceedings in the court at the outset, resulting in the grant of a right of way, was the charter for the road, and unless we disregard the act, there is no authority to do anything other than is provided therein. A survey is to accompany the petition for a private railroad. That shows what the petitioner asks liberty to do. The courses and distances, grades and the like, are to be laid down .on the drafts, and if the road be allowed, that remains on file to define the rights acquired on the one hand and taken on the other. On <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>this proposed plan a view is granted and damages are assessed. It cannot be maintained, on any principle, that the right once granted on a proposed plan, the promoter may adopt any other. If he could, there is nothing to define his right or restrain his power, and he might pay trifling damages on one plan, and do infinite mischief to the owner of the land on another, without compensation. The whole act is against the assumption that the location as evidenced by the draft of survey and allowed by the jury may be disregarded at will. That proposition is incapable of maintenance for a moment.</p>
    <p id="b27-6" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[184,825,1146,931]]]'>Again, the original application was for a private road from the tunnel of the plaintiff in this proceeding to connect with the slackwater navigation at the river. Since 1856 this connection has been abandoned, and the connection changed to the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad, and the portion between that and the river permitted to fall into disuse. If we take into consideration, what is possible to have occurred when damages were originally assessed for the right of way for this road, that the advantages to the landowner in common with the public to pass over the road may have entered into the calculation, we perceive at once how great injustice might result from changing the road and its terminus, so as to render this impracticable. Nothing of this may have occurred, but it might, and may, if we yield the right to change the construction so as to change the location in point of fact at pleasure or according to the promptings of interest on part of the roadowner. The one party being irrevocably bound by a location which takes a portion of his property from him, the rule would be unjust which would permit the other to act in regard to it as he pleases. If the latter desires a different road than that which he has got, let him apply anew to the proper source of power for authority to make it. He will not get it otherwise.</p>
