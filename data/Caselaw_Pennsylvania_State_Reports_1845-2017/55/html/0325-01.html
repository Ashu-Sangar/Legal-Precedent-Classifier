Foreman offered $180 if Ahl would stand the government inspection, but Ahl agreed to take $160, Foreman to stand the government inspection.</p>

    <p id="b330-7" data-blocks='[["BL_330.7",330,[333,1401,1154,341]]]'>The evidence was that the contract was consummated on Sunday night. Not only was the note given but possession of the thirteen mules was transferred, and Foreman became liable for their keep from that night. The fact that the entry on the tavern books could not be made that night, because the book-keeper had gone to bed, is of no consequence, for it was done next morning in pursuance of their agreement the night before. The clerical act only verified the bargain of the night before.</p>

Now, if we should treat the contract as entire for fifteen mules and regard all that was done Sunday night as amounting to constructive delivery of the two mules, it is evident the plaintiff would have no more standing on his money counts than upon the note itself, because his action, however viewed in the pleadings, would be founded upon a contract fully consummated on Sunday. But perhaps the better view is, that though an entire contract the parties severed it in the performance and made it not the purchase and delivery of fifteen mules <em>solido </em>as one round and complete transaction, but the purchase of fifteen mules <em>per capita </em>at $160 the mule, and the delivery of possession mule by mule. In this view it is clear that whilst the plaintiff cannot steer clear of the Sunday law as to thirteen of the mules, he may as to the two delivered on Mon<a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>day, for as to them, though the bargain was begun on Sunday, it was not consummated until Monday.</p>

But as to the thirteen mules it is manifest he stands no better upon the common counts than he would upon a special count or on his statement of the note as his cause of action.</p>

It was worldly employment upon the Lord’s day in violation of the divine command and of our Statute of 1794, and according to many decisions of this court it was a void contract.</p>
    <p id="b331-9" data-blocks='[["BL_331.9",331,[238,1503,1155,301]]]'>Thus stands the case upon the evidence. In the most favorable view of it that can be taken for the plaintiff, the utmost he could recover would be the price of the two mules delivered on Monday, and the court fell into error in suffering the jury to inquire into more than the liability of the defendant for those two mules. Whether entitled to a verdict for them will depend upon all the evidence in the cause, but not upon the Sunday law.</p>
    <p id="b331-10" data-blocks='[["BL_331.10",331,[238,1806,1156,469]]]'>And we think the court erred in admitting the payee as a witness. It is true that in Evans <em>v. </em>Dela, 11 Casey 451, where the witness who was called to testify had passed the note away before its maturity <em>by delivery merely and without </em>endorsement, it was held that he was competent to establish the consideration, but in Baily <em>v. </em>Knapp, 7 Harris 192, and Katz <em>v. </em>Snyder, 2 Casey 511, the rule furnished by the case of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 509" data-case-ids="478356" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0509-01">5 W. &amp; S. 509</a>, was applied to payees who had transferred negotiable paper by endorsement. And the disqualification, resting as it does in part on considerations of public policy, cannot be removed by a release of the endorser from his liability to the endorsee.</p>

If it were still in his hands and the suit were in his name no one would contend for his competency as a witness for himself.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[317,558,1150,341]]]'>The force of this objection is not parried by the circumstance that the suit is a proceeding upon the consideration of the note, and therefore, that the witness is not, in strictness of speech, to be considered as an endorser. If not an endorser he is the assignor of a chose in action coming in upon the record as plaintiff to recover it, and under the salutary doctrine of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, and the general principle that forbids a man to testify for himself in his own cause, his mouth ought to be stopped.</p>
    <p id="b332-7" data-blocks='[["BL_332.7",332,[316,899,1151,343]]]'>As to those parts of the charge in which the judge, in answer to the points, declared the effect of the evidence and stated the rules of law touching warranty, representation, deceit and fraud, we conceive the defendant has no just ground of complaint. Indeed, we see no reasons suggested in the assignment of errors for reversing the judgment save only the two already stated— the suffering a recovery for thirteen mules sold and bought on Sunday, and the admission of James W. Ahl as a witness.</p>
    <p id="b332-8" data-blocks='[["BL_332.8",332,[486,1244,976,75]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
