We affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b378-7" data-blocks='[["BL_378.7",378,[277,958,1150,843]]]'>The evidence of record establishes that on the evening of November 15, 2006, Appellant and his codefendant, Nyako Pippen, were driving through Winder Village, a high-crime area in Bristol Township, Bucks County, when they observed Shawn Parker, Jarrett Osborne, and Jamar Osborne standing together on a street corner. Based on the reputation of the neighborhood, Appellant and Pippen surmised that the men were likely drug dealers who possessed large sums of cash and would not alert police if robbed of their drug proceeds. Thus, Appellant and Pippen viewed the men as prime targets and conspired to rob them at gunpoint. Appellant drove to a nearby playground where he and his confederate armed themselves and concealed their identities; Appellant donned a ski mask and carried a nine-millimeter Kel-Tec handgun while Pippen procured a sawed-off shotgun and tied a t-shirt around his face.</p>
    <p id="b378-8" data-blocks='[["BL_378.8",378,[276,1836,1151,526]],["BL_379.1",379,[177,320,1151,621]]]'>Appellant and Pippen drove back into the residential area where the three men were standing, parked in front of a house, and approached the targeted individuals on foot. As they neared the trio, Pippen raised the shotgun and attempted to cock the weapon, but the gun jammed. Alerted to their assailants’ presence, Parker and his companions fled on foot. As the three men were running along Elmhurst Avenue, Appellant pointed his handgun at them and fired a single round from a distance of approximately seventy feet, wounding Jarrett Osborne in the buttocks. Jarrett ran a short <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>distance, fell to the ground, and began writhing in pain. Appellant and Pippen immediately returned to their vehicle and drove off while Jamar Osborne summoned emergency medical personnel to the scene. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and placed Jarrett inside an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest and heart failure on the way to Frankford-Torresdale Hospital. Subsequent efforts to revive Jarrett were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 11:43 p.m. An autopsy revealed that the bullet traveled through the pelvis and severed a large blood vessel called the iliac artery, causing high volume blood loss that ultimately resulted in Jarrett’s death.</p>

Detective Greg Beidler of the Bristol Township Police Department testified that he responded to the police radio dispatch concerning the incident and recovered two objects at the crime scene: a fired nine-millimeter shell casing and a black neoprene ski mask. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 5/11/09, at 143. The shell casing and the bullet recovered from Jarrett Osborne’s body were submitted to a firearms examiner employed by the Montgomery County District Attorney, and the ski mask was sent to the Pennsylvania State Police Crime Laboratory in Bethlehem for forensic analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 155. The nose and mouth areas of the ski mask were swabbed and found to contain genetic material that produced a single DNA profile of an unknown male. After recovering the Kel-Tec handgun and acquiring information that identified Appellant as a suspect, police obtained a search warrant for a DNA sample and submitted genetic material provided by Appellant to the crime laboratory for analysis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The known sample procured through <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>the search warrant exhibited the same DNA profile as samples collected from the ski mask and the Kel-Tec handgun. <em>Id. </em>at 157; <em>see also </em>N.T. Trial, 5/12/09, at 6. All of the DNA evidence was entered by way of stipulation; the defense conceded the accuracy of the laboratory reports. Furthermore, expert analysis of the firearm, shell casing, and projectile removed from Jarrett Osborne’s body revealed that the fatal shot had been fired from the Kel-Tec handgun that bore traces of Appellant’s DNA. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 5/12/09, at 88.</p>

Detective Beidler explained to the jury that telephone records showed Appellant and Pippen began using their cellular telephones in Philadelphia before placing calls which indicated that they were traveling toward Bristol Township on the night in question. At 9:40 p.m., Pippen’s telephone transmitted a signal to a cellular telephone tower located in Bristol Township, and another call made by Pippen at 10:36 p.m., approximately four minutes after Jamar Osborne contacted a 911 operator to request an ambulance for the victim, was traced to a tower “just outside of [the] Winder Village neighborhood.” N.T. Trial, 5/11/09, at 175. Subsequent calls placed by Appellant and Pippen after 11:00 p.m. demonstrated that both men returned to their homes in Philadelphia upon leaving the Winder Village area. <em>See id. </em>at 176-177.</p>

Pippen testified that on the night of the murder, he and Appellant drove to Bristol Township at approximately 9:00 p.m. to socialize with some women, but their plans fell through, and the two men <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>ended up “just riding around.” N.T. Trial, 5/12/09, at 15. As they proceeded through Winder Village, they observed a group of men standing on the corner of Elmhurst Avenue and Winder Drive, and Appellant “brought up the idea of robbing them” because they appeared to be drug dealers conducting business in an area known for drug activity. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[181,673,1153,1069]]]'>Appellant drove to a playground where they decided that Appellant would hold the victims at gunpoint while Pippen searched their pockets for money. After concealing their identities, Appellant drove back up Elmhurst Avenue and parked in front of a house. Appellant supplied Pippen with a sawed-off pump-action shotgun, and they approached the men on foot; however, as the targets came into view, Pippen tried to cock his weapon, and the three men “took off running.” <em>Id. </em>at 27. Pippen testified that he immediately retreated to Appellant’s vehicle, and, at that time, he saw Appellant point his pistol at the fleeing men. Pippen heard a gunshot as he returned to the car, placed his shotgun in the trunk, and reentered the vehicle through the passenger-side door. Appellant returned to the vehicle moments later and began driving toward Philadelphia. When Pippen asked if one of the men discharged a gun during the incident, Appellant replied in the negative and stated that he had fired one round “in the air to scare them.” <em>Id. </em>at 32. Pippen claimed that several months passed before he learned that someone had been killed during the robbery attempt at Winder Village. <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>

Instead, defense counsel argued throughout the trial that the killing was unintentional based on evidence that the barrel in Appellant’s handgun had been altered in a manner that made the weapon “inherently inaccurate.” N.T. Trial, 5/11/09, at 34. In support of this claim, counsel referenced the testimony of two firearm examiners with expertise in ballistics and marksmanship, both of whom test-fired the murder weapon and concluded that its accuracy had been degraded when someone reamed the barrel with an unknown <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>object to alter the rifling and hinder firearm identification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Commonwealth’s expert, Montgomery County Detective John Finor, testified that he took the handgun to an indoor shooting range, fired six bullets for accuracy at a distance of seventy-five feet and found that the bullets formed a group ten inches in diameter that impacted the target approximately 12.5 inches to the left of center. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 5/12/09, at 112-113. Defense expert Carl Leisinger III achieved similar results when he fired the gun at an outdoor range, creating a six-inch-diameter group at seventy-five feet with the bullets striking the right side of the target. <em>Id. </em>at 133. Mr. Leisinger also tested for accuracy at one hundred feet and found that the bullets drifted so far to the right at that distance that he could not hit the target when aiming at the center; however, by aiming at “the extreme left side” of the target, Mr. Leisinger was able to hit the target fifty percent of the time. <em>Id.</em>

That request was denied, and he was subsequently convicted of the aforementioned crimes.

Appellant’s post-sentence motions were denied on May 26, 2009. This appeal followed, wherein Appellant argues that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to convict him of first-degree murder; (2) the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence; (3) the trial court abused its discretion in limiting cross-examination of a prosecution witness; and (4) a new penalty hearing is warranted because the jury failed to specify what considerations prompted it to find the mitigating circumstance codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).</p>

In evaluating the issue, we must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, supports the jury’s finding that every element of the offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth presented testimony that <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>Appellant pointed a loaded handgun at Jarrett Osborne and fired a bullet that pierced an artery in Osborne’s pelvis, causing his death. While the firearm experts agreed that the murder weapon became less accurate when the barrel was reamed with a foreign object, both experts were able to hit paper targets at a distance of seventy-five feet, the approximate range described by Shawn Parker. Moreover, the factors that purportedly show a lack of malice and specific intent, <em>i.e., </em>the number of shots fired, the distance the bullet traveled, the location of the entry wound, and Appellant’s self-serving claim that he merely fired into the air to cause fear, do not establish a right to relief. The question herein is whether the evidence proffered at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant committed an unlawful killing in an intentional, deliberate, and premeditated manner. We find that the Commonwealth met its burden of proof, as the evidence supported an inference that Appellant deliberately fired a handgun at Jarrett Osborne, piercing a vital artery. Thus, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Appellant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill the victim, and committed the killing in an intentional, deliberate and premeditated manner.

In leveling this claim, Appellant reiterates that he shot the victim from a distance of 159 feet, that the bullet struck the victim in the buttocks, and that Pippen testified Appellant claimed to have fired into the air to scare the men as they attempted to flee.</p>

The record reveals that, on direct examination, Detective Beidler read, without objection, a brief excerpt from Appellant’s grand jury testimony wherein Appellant described his relationship with Nyako Pippen and indicated that he occasionally used a certain vehicle and a cellular telephone provided by Pippen’s father. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 5/11/09, at 180-182. There was no mention of firearms. Later, on cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to question the detective about an unrelated portion of Appellant’s grand jury testimony dealing with firearms.

As the Commonwealth accurately points out, the grand jury testimony that defense counsel sought to discuss at trial constituted hearsay; the statements were made by Appellant at a separate proceeding, and they were being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, <em>i.e., </em>that Appellant lacked marksmanship skills. In <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>addition, the statements at issue were not admissible under the hearsay exception for former testimony because Appellant invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination multiple times when questioned about firearm usage at the grand jury hearing, thus denying the Commonwealth an adequate opportunity to develop his testimony on the issue. <em>See </em>Pa.R.E. 804(b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Firearm identification involves scientific examination of fired bullets and cartridge cases for the purpose of identifying the weapon that expelled them. Modern firearm barrels contain rifling, a series of spiraling grooves that enhance accuracy by generating spin that stabilizes the bullet as it exits the barrel. Microscopic marks left on the bullet as it contacts the rifling create a unique signature that enables firearm examiners to determine whether a bullet recovered from a crime scene was fired from a particular gun. Some individuals who are aware of this occurrence alter the original rifling by reaming the barrel with a foreign object in an attempt to preclude examiners from making a positive identification. <em>See </em>N.T.

In his brief, Appellant emphasizes that evidence was presented at trial indicating that he may, in fact, have fired the fatal shot from a distance of 159 feet. <em>See </em>Appellant’s brief at 16. That number is based on testimony that investigators used a laser to measure the distance between the spent shell casing and a pool of blood that formed at the spot where Jarrett Osborne collapsed. <em>See </em>N.T. Trial, 5/11/09, at 185— 186. The laser calculated the distance between the casing and the blood at 174 feet. <em>Id. </em>at 186. Characterizing that figure as a incontrovertible fact, Appellant maintains that the bullet was fired from a distance of 159 feet based on testimony suggesting that Jarrett ran five feet after he was wounded and testimony that the murder weapon ejected one shell casing ten feet behind Mr. Leisinger as he was test firing the gun. In actuality, however, there was conflicting testimony on this point, as Shawn Parker testified that Appellant was "probably 60 to 70 feet” away when he fired the pistol. <em>Id. </em>at 67. Contrary to Appellant’s position, no one is certain of the exact distance that the bullet traveled before it struck the victim, and the jury was free to accept Mr. Parker’s estimate.</p>
