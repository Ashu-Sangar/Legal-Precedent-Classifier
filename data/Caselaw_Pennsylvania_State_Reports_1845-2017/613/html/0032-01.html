The court nonetheless considered the present circumstances to raise an issue of first impression, namely, “whether conduct resulting in a felony conviction under federal law, but which would be classified as a misdemeanor under our Crimes Code, constitutes an ‘infamous crime’ under the Pennsylvania Constitution.” <em>Rambler, </em><a href="/a2d/991/0909-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="991 A.2d 909" data-case-ids="7291230" data-case-paths="/a2d/991/0909-01">991 A.2d at 913</a>. In this regard, the court suggested that the question of whether a federal offense constitutes a felony for Article II, Section 7 purposes, depends upon the grading attached to similar crimes by the Pennsylvania Legislature rather than the grading established by Congress for the actual crime involved. Because the Crimes Code defines an offense that is similar to the one Appellee committed, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3923(a)(3) (providing that a person is guilty of theft if he intentionally obtains or withholds property of another by threatening to “expose any secret tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt or ridicule”), and grades that offense as a misdemeanor, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3903(b), the Superior Court concluded that Appellee’s crime was not constitutionally infamous. <em>See Rambler, </em><a href="/a2d/991/0909-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="991 A.2d 909" data-case-ids="7291230" data-case-paths="/a2d/991/0909-01">991 A.2d at 914</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

It contends alternatively that the Superior Court erred in asserting, as a premise, that the state and federal offenses at issue are equivalent. The Commonwealth notes that, unlike Pennsylvania’s theft-by-extortion statute, the federal law incorporates as an additional element that the defendant used the mails to aid in the commission of the offense. Because of this element and Pennsylvania’s lack of control over the postal system, the Commonwealth argues that Pennsylvania lacks an equivalent offense and, as such, the grading chosen by Congress should prevail. Thus, the Commonwealth asserts that the Superior Court, in effect, applied the grading of a lesser-included offense to the actual offense that Appellee committed. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 9-10. Finally, the Commonwealth states that, under prevailing Pennsylvania law, theft by extortion is considered <em>crimen falsi </em>for evidentiary purposes and, moreover, is analogous to bribery as an infamous crime. <em>See id. </em>at 10-12.</p>

In the event the appeal is not dismissed, Appellee argues in the alternative that the Superior Court was correct in holding that, because his conviction was the equivalent of a Pennsylvania misdemeanor, it was not infamous under Article II, Section 7. He notes, as well, that the maximum punishment for his federal offense was two years, which, under the Pennsylvania <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>Crimes Code, would make it a misdemeanor and not a felony. Thus, Appellee asserts that treating it as a felony would “elevate terminology over the meaning behind the terminology,” as the Pennsylvania Legislature has clarified that it understands the term “felony” to mean an offense carrying a maximum sentence of at least seven years. Brief for Appellee at 9 (citing 18 Pa.C.S. § 106(b)(4)). To support his position in this regard, Appellee draws an analogy to the computation of a prior record score for sentencing purposes when a defendant has prior out-of-state convictions. He notes that, in at least one case, the Superior Court has referenced the state Sentencing Commission’s expressed belief that counting all non-Pennsylvania crimes systematically for sentencing purposes is desirable for the sake of uniformity; thus, according to such reasoning, whenever possible, prior foreign convictions should be scored in the light of Pennsylvania Law — particularly if an equivalent in-state offense can be found. <em>See id. </em>at 10 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Bolden, </em><a href="/pa-super/367/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="367 Pa.

In this regard, the central theme of both the Superior Court’s analysis, and Appellee’s presentation, is captured in the intermediate court’s assertion that “the definition of ‘felony’ in Article II, § 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution should reflect those crimes the Pennsylvania Legislature, not the legislature of a foreign state or of the Congress, chooses to classify as ‘felonies.’ ” <em>Rambler, </em><a href="/a2d/991/0909-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="991 A.2d 909" data-case-ids="7291230" data-case-paths="/a2d/991/0909-01">991 A.2d at 914</a>.</p>

Still, it remains possible that the General Assembly may at some point begin to create felony offenses that depart so sharply from what was within the contemplation of <em>Shaver </em>and the minds of the framers that the felony label alone will become insufficient. Although a more probing inquiry on the question of constitutional infamy relative to in-state felonies may therefore eventually be implicated, <em>see generally People ex rel. Keenan v.

Appellee also notes that Section 106 of the Crimes Code contains a general rule that "[a]n offense hereafter defined by any statute other than this title shall be classified as provided in this section.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 106(e). He claims that this requires that the federal extortion statute be "classified as provided in this section” — that is, as a misdemeanor— because it is an offense defined by a statute other than the Crimes Code. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the phrase, "any statute other than this title,” was intended by the General Assembly to override the grading assigned to crimes committed in other jurisdictions, Appellee's argument overlooks the word, "hereafter.” Since the federal statute predates the state provision, Section 106(e) is inapplicable.</p>
