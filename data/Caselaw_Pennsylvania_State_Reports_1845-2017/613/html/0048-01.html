The Fochts filed suit against the Raceway on September 8, 2000, and the case was settled on November 23, 2004, for a total of $410,000.

During the <em>Nuhfer </em>parties’ marriage, the husband had participated in an office lottery pool. When one of his coworkers filed a winning ticket with the Pennsylvania Lottery Bureau and claimed ownership, litigation ensued to determine whether the co-worker or the office pool was the rightful owner of the ticket. The suit over the lottery ticket settled <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>after the final separation of the Nuhfers. <em>Id. </em>at 1349. The Superior Court concluded that husband’s claim had accrued when he had contributed to the purchase price of the lottery ticket, at which time he was married and not finally separated. Therefore, based on a prior version of subsection 3501(a)(8),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the court held that the settlement proceeds were marital property, even though settlement had been reached and the claim had been liquidated after the parties had divorced. <em>Id. </em>at 1350.</p>

Appellant contends that the Superior Court misconstrued the plain text of subsection 3501(a)(8), particularly with respect to the concept of accrual. Appellant argues that Appellee’s personal injury cause of action accrued on the date of the accident, or at the latest two weeks later when he retained counsel, because by that time Appellee was fully and completely aware of his injuries and the Raceway’s negligent conduct. Appellant’s Brief at 10. In contrast, Appellee contends that his personal injury claim did not accrue until the date of settlement, which was the first time that he was actually entitled to the settlement proceeds. Appellee’s Brief at 15-18. Appellee insists that a personal injury claim “unliquidated” by verdict or settlement cannot be subject to equitable distribution and, indeed, cannot even be property, much less marital property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

      <em>Nuhfer. </em>Paraphrasing <em>Drake, </em>the “critical question” here is whether Appellee’s right to seek damages for personal injury by filing a negligence suit accrued during his marriage, not whether his suit was settled during his marriage. <em>See id. </em>at 726. Appellee errs by conflating two very different concepts: accrual of a cause of action and settlement of a cause of action. By the explicit text of subsection 3501(a)(8), the date of accrual of a cause of action is the only date of relevance.</p>

All of these events occurred one to two years before the parties’ final separation. Thus, because Appellee’s cause of action accrued during the marriage, before the parties’ final separation, proceeds from the settlement of the suit are marital property. The marital property exception set forth in subsection 3501(a)(8) does not apply, and it is irrelevant that the parties had finally separated by the time the suit settled and the settlement award was liquidated. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
