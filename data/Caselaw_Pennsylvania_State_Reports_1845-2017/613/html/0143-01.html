Penn PRIME argues that the workers’ compensation exclusion does not conflict with any language in the MVFRL. Instead, it maintains that the exclusion supports the “dominant” policy underlying the MVFRL — cost containment. Penn PRIME asserts that the purpose of UIM coverage, to protect innocent victims, has not been elevated to a “dominant” public policy. In this vein, Penn PRIME observes that the MVFRL obligates the offer of UM/UIM coverage in every policy but allows insureds to reject the coverage. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1781(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> Penn PRIME argues, “In light of the express public policy allowing an insured not to provide UIM coverage, a provision for such coverage subject to an exception for employees who receive workers’ compensation comports with public policy.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Brief of Appellee at 8.

Under the facts of the case, the exclusion renders the coverage illusory. The Borough has been denied the benefit of the bargain, while Penn PRIME has received a windfall by collecting a premium for illusory coverage. To uphold the exclusion would thwart the purpose of the MVFRL by allowing an insurer to deny benefits for which their insured paid a premium. Thus, permitting the exclusion to stand provides a disincentive for insureds to pay premiums for coverage that is not statutorily required and relieves the insurer of its obligation to provide benefits for which the insured paid.

The pre-amendment MVFRL permitted the dual recovery of workers’ compensation and UM/UIM benefits.

Section 1737 stated that nothing in the Workers’ Compensation Act could prevent an employee from recovering UM/UIM benefits from an employer-sponsored policy. Thus, the preamendment version of the MVFRL expressly sanctioned recovery from employer-purchased plans and precluded insurers from constructing exclusions or benefit reductions based on the recovery of workers’ compensation. <em>See Ducjai v.

Penn PRIME also highlights the optional nature of UM/UIM coverage to justify its workers’ compensation exclusion, claiming that optional coverage cannot be converted into a public policy mandate. Penn PRIME’S argument is misplaced. The optional nature of UM/UIM coverage is limited to its offer. Once an insured elects to purchase the coverage, it is no longer "optional” and must satisfy statutory requirements and comport with public policy. An insurer cannot invoke the optional nature of the coverage to justify numerous coverage exclusions.

Facially, however, the coverage applies to non-employees in government vehicles, <em>see </em>PennPRIME Trust Liability Coverage Document, at 32, R.R. at 51a (defining “Covered Party” to include “[ajnyone else occupying a Covered Auto”), and to employees using the vehicles in circumstances in which workers’ compensation would not be applicable.</p>

However, this does not translate into a mandate to ignore the coverage an insurance policy provides in every case in which exclusions operate to foreclose coverage. No exclusion could survive such a perverse analysis. Here, it seems to me, broadly speaking, that the PennPRIME Trust Liability Coverage Document ensures that some form of coverage is provided to those injured by underinsured motorists while traveling in local government vehicles, with the workers’ compensation operating as the primary protection, and the UIM coverage serving as a failsafe. In the absence of evidence that the premium paid by the Borough does not reflect the value of this sort of extension of protection, I cannot join in the majority’s characterization of the insurance as illusory or in its finding of a windfall.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

By continuing, however, to favorably entertain abstract arguments by litigants in this arena, we invite more of the same. Furthermore, the direction is away from what, in my view, is the soundest judicial approach — that is — to rely on the Legislature and the administrative agency it has selected to make any necessary adjustments to insurance contracts prospectively where, as here, the policy considerations are mixed.</p>

The UM/ UIM coverage provided by PennPRIME is an integrated aspect of a coordinated risk scheme administered by a nonprofit trust organized as a group liability coverage pool for Pennsylvania municipal entities. <em>See </em>PennPRIME Trust Liability Coverage Document, R.R. at 20a-72a.</p>

Here, PennPRIME Trust represents a collective body in which the Borough maintains an interest. With regard to the automobile insurance component of such risk management schemes, there is obviously a smaller group of members to share risks than in broader-scale commercial insurance arrangements. Thus, assuming the portion of the premium allocable to UIM insurance was calculated (as it should have been) with the workers’ compensation exclusion in mind, the judicial disapproval of that exclusion is likely to have a very substantial impact on future premiums and other interests of participating municipalities.</p>

Curiously, the majority derives this “clear intent,” in part, from amendments removing a prohibition against offsetting UM/UIM coverage by workers’ compensation benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 160-62, 32 A.3d at 1225-26.</p>

The objective is to maintain affordable premiums while ensuring carriers will continue to provide coverage, and the adjustments seem to favor the segment of the insurance industry which, at any given time, appears least able to redress losses without impacting premiums or financial viability. In such a landscape, I fail to discern any overarching public policy in terms of where the burden should fall, other than in the express direction of the General Assembly. Here, the majority concedes there simply is no such direction. <em>See id. </em>at 154, 32 A.3d at 1221.
