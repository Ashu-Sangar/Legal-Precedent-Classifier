She explained that she was a high school senior with average grades, planned to attend college, and aspired to become a lawyer. She testified that during the previous week, a physician examined her, confirmed her pregnancy, and explained the procedure of an abortion, as well as the risks and complications. The physician also informed Appellant of alternatives to abortion, such as adoption, and raising the child herself. Appellant indicated that after fully considering the procedure, the risks, and the alternatives, she decided to proceed with the abortion, which was tentatively scheduled for later in the afternoon on the date of the hearing.</p>

The court also elicited that Appellant’s sister and Appellant’s brother’s girlfriend had experienced unplanned pregnancies, and that both are struggling financially to take care of their children, but are “getting through it.” <em>Id. </em>at 23.

Appellant responded in the negative when the court inquired whether the abortion provider offered her printed materials listing available agencies that would assist her in adoption; she did, however, agree with the court that adoptive parents could possibly provide a home for a child. Appellant further acknowledged the medical and emotional risks of abortion, but reiterated that she was unable to care for a child, and that her future plans would be jeopardized if she were forced to do so.

When Appellant’s counsel inquired as to the basis for the court’s decision, the trial court expressed two concerns. Pertinent to the issue raised by Appellant, the court expressed its concern with her failure to inform her mother of the proposed abortion. The court stated, “it seems to me that in every case if we would allow a minor to use the bypass provision based solely on the representation that their [sic] parent would be disappointed with their [sic] decision, I can’t imagine that any parent is going to receive news that their [sic] child has an unplanned pregnancy....” N.T. 3/19/2010 (Afternoon Session) at 58. When counsel reminded the court that Appellant additionally testified that she did not seek parental consent because she feared her mother would “throw her out,” the court responded that it did not credit that portion of Appellant’s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[282,1459,1151,572]]]'>Second, the court relied on the abortion facility’s initial failure to provide Appellant with the printed materials it erroneously deemed required by Section 3205. <em>Id. </em>at 56.

The court believed, however, that Appellant’s examination of such information after she had already decided to proceed with the abortion placed her in a position where she had “no choice but to proceed further.” <em>Id.</em>

(emphasis added). The scarcity of appellate review of a judicial bypass petition is apparently attributable to the fact that the overwhelming majority of these petitions are granted. Consequently, the trial court’s determination of the credibility and maturity of the minor in those cases where it grants the petition to have an abortion will escape the same scrutiny that this case has now received. This reality further highlights the need for trial judges to engage in meaningful and objective evaluations of requests for judicial authorizations and for appellate courts to refrain from re-weighing their credibility determinations, as I believe the majority does here, in those apparently few cases where the authorization is denied.</p>

Respectfully, I believe the majority takes the trial court's comments in this regard out of context. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 360, 33 A.3d at <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>628. Specifically, with reference to the statement, "a minor, such as [Appellant], must attempt to secure the consent of at least one parent,” the court was merely offering an alternate rationale based upon its interpretation of the United States Supreme Court's decision in <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, </em><a href="/us/505/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="505 U.S. 833" data-case-ids="1480969" data-case-paths="/us/505/0833-01">505 U.S. 833</a>, <a href="/us/505/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="505 U.S. 833" data-case-ids="1480969" data-case-paths="/us/505/0833-01">112 S.Ct. 2791</a>, <a href="/us/505/0833-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="505 U.S. 833" data-case-ids="1480969" data-case-paths="/us/505/0833-01">120 L.Ed.2d 674</a> (1992), it did not form the basis for its initial and primary holding. Rather, the court was just pointing out the fact the consent of one parent was not obtained in this case for whatever relevance an appellate court would attribute to that fact. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. <em>slip op. </em>at 19-21. I view the trial court’s other comments as properly explaining why the minor's reasons for failing to involve her mother lacked credibility and, therefore, contributed to its finding of immaturity.</p>
