According to the agreement, the contemplated, 68,-000-square-foot structure was to be used as an elementary charter school, and the project was denominated “Collegium Charter School.”</p>

The lease also required the Foundation to tender $1.6 million in the form of a specialized “security deposit,” which Developer was to apply to acquire materials and equipment listed in the lease’s “Exhibit E.” As further developed below, Exhibit E was not made available to the reviewing tribunals until a recent production per this Court’s directive. In any event, the document evidences that the $1.6 “security deposit” to be provided by the Foundation was dedicated largely to funding the procurement of materials necessary to the interior construction or “fit-out” of the building for the contemplated use as a charter school and related administrative offices. This is significant, in light of the Wage Act’s application to projects “paid for in whole <em>or in part </em>” from public funds. 43 P.S. § 165-2 (definition of “public work”) (emphasis added). Other than in terms of this allocation, this original lease did not differentiate materially between the infrastructure construction (referred to by the parties as construction of the building shell) and the fit-out.</p>

In this regard, the Bureau explained that charter school construction is treated the same as a traditional school project for prevailing wage purposes. <em>See </em>Letter from Deputy Chief Counsel for the Bureau to the School Solicitor (Oct. 4, 2006), <em>reproduced in </em>Supplemental Reproduced Record (“R.R.

Furthermore, the School observed that Developer bore the <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>responsibility for construction of the building; accordingly, the School had not awarded (and would not award) any contract of construction. Given its lack of involvement in the construction activity, the School took the position that no “funds of a public body” would be used for construction. 43 P.S. § 165-2(5). Thus, according to the School, “[biased upon the foregoing, we believe that the Project is not a construction project or construction-related work of a charter school and ... is not subject to the requirements of the Prevailing Wage Act.” R.R.

The agency relied on the Foundation’s involvement as the lessee; the intended use of the building as a charter school; rental payments by the School exceeding $600,000 annually; the option to purchase after five years; the $1.6 million “security deposit,” which the Bureau had learned was to be financed by bonds issued in 2004 by the Chester County Industrial Authority; and the Foundation’s obtaining of a leasehold mortgage (apparently as a condition to the use of the bond monies), as authorized under the lease terms. <em>See </em>Letter from Deputy Chief Counsel for the Bureau to the School Solicitor (Oct. 27, 2006), <em>reproduced in </em>R.R. at 14a-15a. By way of analogy, the Bureau explained that, under a federal prevailing wage law known as the Davis-Bacon Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> a lease may implicate prevailing wage regulation. The Bureau referenced a multi-factored test employed by the United States Labor Department’s Administrative Review Board to assess whether a long-term lease is a disguised public-works contract. <em>See In re Phoenix Field Office, Bureau of Land Mgmt., </em>ARB Case No. 01-010, <a href="/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20944696" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2001 WL 944696">2001 WL 944696</a> (June 29, 2001), <em>reproduced in </em>Brief for Intervenor at App. 4.

In their grievance and the accompanying papers, Appellees conceded for the first time of record that the interior construction of the building was subject to wage regulation. According to Appellees, however, Developer and the Foundation had structured their relationship to draw a close, material distinction between the interior construction and the erection of the building shell. In this respect, Appellees represented that the building fit-out was the sole responsibility of the Foundation and the School, to be undertaken at their sole cost and by their own contractor or contractors. <em>See </em>Proposed Facts on Behalf of Grievants, <em>In re 500 James Hance Court, L.P. &amp; Knauer &amp; Gorman Constr.

By contrast, Appellees indicated, construction of the building shell was Developer’s responsibility, was to be financed privately by it, and was to remain under Developer’s <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>ownership. As such, Appellees maintained that the shell construction was not a public work or otherwise subject to wage regulation, since there was no payment from public funds or funds of the Foundation or School. <em>See </em>43 P.S. § 165-2 (definition of “public work”); 24 P.S. § 17-1715-A(10)(iii) (applicability of the Wage Act to charter school boards of trustees and contractors).</p>

In their papers, Appellees did not discuss this “security deposit” arrangement under the existing lease or the discrepancies between their representations and the terms of such lease. Indeed, while purporting to provide this lease to the Board, <em>see </em>Exhibits on Behalf of Grievants, <em>In re 500 James Hance Court, L.P. &amp; Knauer &amp; Gorman Constr.

Appellees highlighted that no such agreement existed in their case.

Thus, even if the Foundation exercises its option, its lease payments will have already nearly paid for the cost of constructing the shell, including financing costs, and the sum of its lease payments and the purchase price will be nearly twice the construction costs.

I view this test, detailed below, as appropriately looking to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the lease, with an eye to considering whether the transaction is an attempt to avoid the remedial purpose of the Prevailing Wage Act. Accordingly, I see no reason not to afford the Board’s adoption of the <em>Phoenix Field Office </em>Test the substantial deference generally accorded to agencies in areas under their expertise. <em>See Penn.

    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[281,436,1150,838]]]'>Applying the <em>Phoenix Field Office </em>Test to the facts of this case, the Board concluded that the factors weighed in favor of application of the Prevailing Wage Act. In regard to the length of the lease, the Board observed that the lease was for a period of almost twenty-four years, with an option granted to the charter school to purchase the real property after five years, which weighed in favor of the application of the Act as “long-term leases of custom built facilities are a common technique used by enterprises (including governments) to acquire new buildings.” <em>Id. </em>at 14. Turning to the second factor concerning the extent of government involvement in the construction project, the Board opined that the evidence presented did not favor either position clearly, but noted that the burden of proof was on the Appellees/Grievants to demonstrate that the project was not a custom built facility. <em>Id. </em>at 15-17 (citing 34 Pa.Code § 213.8(j)).</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[279,1298,1151,880]]]'>As to the third factor, the Board considered the extent to which the construction would be used for private rather than public use. It observed that the charter school would be the sole tenant, which favored the conclusion that the building is for public rather than private use. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The Board noted that the fourth factor also weighed in favor of application of the Act because the lease payments would pay off the costs of construction within a mere six years, while the useful life of the building was at least the twenty-four year length of the lease. <em>Id. </em>at 19. Finally, the Board found that the Appellees/Grievants “conceded at argument that it was a fair assessment that the contract was split into separate contracts to avoid application of the Act, or more accurately to minimize the Act’s application to the ‘fit-out’ or custom work.” <em>Id. </em>at 19. The Board found this to constitute evidence of an intent to evade the requirements of the Act for purposes of the fifth factor. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>
