Northeastern paid Philips $2,172,375 for the MRI system, and paid $129,774.02 in sales tax. For the PET/CT Scan system, it paid Philips $1,815,000, and paid $98,010 in sales tax. To prepare for installation of both systems in its facility, Northeastern made extensive structural changes to the building, which it owns. The changes included: revising the electrical, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and plumbing systems; installing floor and ceiling supports; enlarging rooms; installing troughs in the walls and conduit above the ceilings to accommodate power cables and wire; installing radio frequen<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>cy shielding in the walls, floor, and ceiling to prevent MRI radio signals from interfering with other devices; installing a vent for safe removal of cryogenic helium vapor the MRI magnet generated; installing lead panels for radiation shielding; enlarging doors in order to move the PET/CT Scan system into the building; and removing an outside wall in order to move the MRI system into the building.</p>

The system’s magnet and patient table were bolted to the building, using anchors installed in concrete beneath the floor. Removal of the system would require several days of interior construction work and would necessitate removing an exterior wall to give a crane access to the system. The PET/CT Scan system weighed 12,375 pounds and took approximately two weeks to install. The system’s gantry<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and patient table were bolted to the building by anchors installed in concrete beneath the floor, and the system was hardwired to Northeastern’s electrical system.

At issue in <em>Sheets </em>was whether canopies covering gasoline pumps at a service station became part of the real estate for purposes of assessing the real property’s value. <em>Sheets </em>identified three classes of chattel: (1) furniture and similar items, which are always personalty; (2) items annexed to the building or land to the extent they could not be removed without causing injury to the realty or themselves, which are always realty; and (3) items affixed to the realty <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>that can be removed without damaging the item or the realty, which items can be either realty or personalty, depending on the circumstances. <em>Sheetz, </em>at 1012-18. Because the gas pump canopies fell into the third category, the Commonwealth Court considered, in assessing the circumstances: (1) the manner by which the canopies were affixed to the land; (2) the canopies were essential to the property’s use as a gas station; and (3) the canopies were intended to be permanent. <em>Id., </em>at 1013. Based on these factors, the <em>Sheetz </em>court concluded the canopies were realty and thus were to be included in the real estate assessment.</p>

Regarding the second factor, <em>ie., </em>whether the systems were essential to the use of the building, the court held the owner’s chosen use of the property determines whether the chattel is essential. The court concluded the systems were essential to the ongoing use of the building as an imaging center, noting the “numerous and specialized structural, electrical, and mechanical improvements to [Northeastern’s building] would serve no function without the systems themselves.” <em>Northeastern, </em>at 1065. Finally, the court found the third factor— whether the systems were intended to be permanent — was met, as they were installed with the intention that they remain in the building as long as Northeastern continues to use it as an imaging center or until the systems become obsolete and must be replaced.</p>

In contrast, the case before us concerns a determination, under a specific and quite different statute, of whether the sale of this equipment is subject to sales tax paid by the purchaser, or use tax paid by the seller.</p>

The Commonwealth Court’s decision finds use tax applies because $4,000,000 worth of equipment has become a permanent part of these buildings — the state has its tax, which should end the matter.

What is the point of making intent a prong at all? One thing we may presume with confidence is that if any party has intent vis a vis the tax laws, it will always be to <em>avoid </em>tax. This makes the premise of this prong very dubious.</p>

Due to the extensive structural building modifications required for installation and removal of the imaging systems, including exterior wall removal, the connection of the systems to the building’s plumbing, cooling, and electrical systems, and the bolting of the components of the systems into the concrete sub-floor, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s holding that the imaging systems became a part of the real estate pursuant to a construction contract, and, thus, are subject to a use tax, rather than sales tax.</p>

Specifically, 72 P.S. § 7202(a) imposes a six percent sales tax on “each separate sale at retail of tangible personal property or services.” “Sale at retail” includes “[a]ny transfer, for a consideration, of the ownership, custody or possession of tangible personal property[.]” <em>Id. </em>§ 7201(k)(l). In turn, “tangible personal property” is defined as “[cjorporeal personal property including, but not limited to, goods, wares [and] merchandise____” <em>Id. </em>§ 7201(m). Similarly, the Pennsylvania Code defines “sales activities” as “[a]n activity resulting from an agreement or contract under which a contractor transfers tangible personal property or performs services upon tangible personal property belonging to another person and installs the property <em>so as not to become a permanent part of the real estate.” </em>61 Pa.Code § 31.11 (emphasis added).</p>

In the <em>Northeastern </em>case, for example, the MRI system weighs 15,201 pounds, and includes a magnet assembly, a patient table, power and control cabinets, and a computer system for image processing. The system is generally installed in three separate rooms — a mag<a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>net room, an adjoining room containing power and control components, and yet another adjoining room containing the operator’s console and computer equipment. Installation requires: removal of a portion of an exterior brick wall to enable a crane to place the magnet inside the structure, and replacement thereof; strengthening of virtually all of the floors and ceiling supports of the building so that they can withstand the weight of the magnet; installation of troughs in the walls and conduits above the ceiling to accommodate the many cables and wires necessary to power the MRI; installation of power and communications -wires and cable into the walls and ceiling of the MRI room; connection of the wires and cables to the MRI components; insertion of radio frequency shielding in the walls, floors, and ceiling to prevent the radio signals broadcast by the MRI equipment from interfering with other devices; installation of a vent to allow for the safe removal of cryogenic helium vapor generated by the MRI magnet; connection of the equipment to the building’s electrical, heating, ventilation/air conditioning, and plumbing systems; and bolting of the MRI magnet and patient table to the floor.</p>

The Majority found the <em>Sheetz </em>factors inapplicable because <em>Sheetz </em>involved real estate taxes, and not a determination of whether a sales or a use tax should have been imposed, as in <em>Beck </em>and the instant case. The Majority states that "[t]he concepts of <em>Sheetz </em>seek to determine if a tax is due — the concepts of <em>Beck </em>deal with which tax is due.” Op. at 573, 35 A.3d at 759. I do not share this view, as the factors set forth in <em>Sheetz </em>merely reflect the common law of fixtures, and are not necessarily limited to cases involving a determination of real estate taxes. I further disagree with the Majority's assertion that if we were to apply the <em>Sheetz </em>test and conclude that the imaging systems became a permanent part of the buildings, the real estate taxes would "skyrocket.” Op. at 573, 35 A.3d at 759. Such conclusion not only exceeds the scope of this appeal, but also assumes improperly that permanent installation of particularized equipment in an office building results in an increase in the fair market value of the office building as a whole.</p>
