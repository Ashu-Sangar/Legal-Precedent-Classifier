The man sleeping on the couch was Ricardo Thomas, a friend of Ms. Johnson’s, who offered to spend the night at her home; Ms. Johnson was fearful because appellant had struck her in the face earlier that day when she refused to have sex with him, and then he harassed her by phone all evening, demanding to speak with her new boyfriend, Tracy “Denzell” Brown.

Mr. Smith’s PCRA hearing testimony refuted Mr. Brown’s version of events; Mr. Smith stated they left Ms. Johnson’s home at approximately 10:00 p.m. and did not drive around the block. <em>See </em>N.T.

Appellant further contends trial counsel should have interviewed Ms. Johnson’s next-door neighbor, Vivian Butler, and had her testify; Ms. Butler’s police statement indicated she heard appellant’s car go by Ms. Johnson’s house, not <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>stopping, about 15 minutes before she heard the shots. <em>See </em>Police Interview of Vivian Butler, 4/23/91, at 3-4 (stating she recognized sound of appellant’s car because it “is loud and he keeps the radio up”).</p>

Trial, 2/27/92, at 86-88. Since Mr. Brown did not realize the significance of the car until one week prior to trial, the fact he neglected to mention it to the police is inconsequential. Likewise, the testimony of a neighbor who was inside her home the entire time in question and simply heard a car go by would have been of dubious value. Mr. Smith’s version of the events on the night of the shooting was inconsistent with appellant’s self-defense claim. Appellant testified he went to Ms. Johnson’s home around 11:30 p.m., after three men (one of whom was Mr. Smith) telephoned him from the home, <em>see </em>N.T.

Thus, Mr. Smith’s testimony was inconsistent with appellant’s version of events. Furthermore, although Mr. Smith testified at the PCRA hearing, appellant did not question trial counsel regarding why he did not pursue this purported witness.

Appellant suggests the first judge’s ruling, which granted a hearing on one ineffectiveness claim, did not specifically deny a hearing on the other issues; therefore, he asserts, the issue of whether a hearing was required on his remaining claims was still pending before the second PCRA judge. Appellant’s argument is specious; in granting a hearing on one claim, the first judge obviously considered whether a hearing was appropriate on all claims; finding only one claim where there were issues of material fact, he granted a hearing on that claim alone. The judge’s failure to specify a hearing was denied on appellant’s remaining claims, coupled with the judge’s death before the proceedings were concluded, does not give appellant a second bite at the apple; the second judge appropriately resumed the hearings on the penalty phase claim, then issued the final order granting a new penalty phase and denying relief without a hearing on appellant’s other claims.

Indeed, direct appeal counsel in this matter raised an extra-record claim on direct appeal. On the other hand, as our decision in <em>Grant </em>recognized, there were practical impediments to pursuing and developing certain extra-record claims given the constraints of the appellate process; and, there is some competing basis in law, under the <em>Griffin </em>line and, later under relaxed waiver, to support an assessment by direct appeal counsel that a direct appeal default of a trial level ineffectiveness claim would not result in the underlying claim <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>escaping collateral review, or being made any more difficult to establish.</p>

The General Assembly's clear intent in the PCRA was to channel all collateral claims involving the criminal judgment into a single statutory review process. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9542. Furthermore, ineffectiveness claims are specifically deemed cognizable. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2)(h). As explained more fully in <em>Grant, </em>perpetuation of the <em>Hubbard </em>rule is inconsistent with the General Assembly's intention of creating an avenue for the presentation of ineffectiveness claims on collateral review. We addressed the tension in <em>Grant, </em>and relieved appellants of compliance with <em>Hubbard </em>on direct appeal. Much of our corrective case law has been directed at ensuring that the PCRA functions as the General Assembly intended, which included reserving review of ineffectiveness claims to the collateral review phase.
