An autopsy revealed that the victim had <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>died from multiple sharp and blunt wounds inflicted with at least two different instruments, which were not recovered.</p>

In reaching this holding, we summarized the various rationales that the <em>Powell </em>Court had advanced in support of the <em>Dunn </em>rule. First, the High Court reasoned that inconsistent verdicts “should not necessarily be interpreted as a windfall to the Government at the defendant’s expense.” <em>Powell, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">supra </a></em><a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">at 65</a>, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">105 S.Ct. 471</a> (cited in <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 1100). Rather, the High Court determined, it was equally possible that the jury was convinced of guilt and accordingly reached a verdict of guilty on the compound offense, but “then through mistake, compromise, or lenity,” reached an inconsistent verdict of acquittal on the lesser offense. <em>Id. </em>Thus, although an inconsistent verdict constitutes jury “error,” it is not at all clear whether the error was made at the expense of the Government or the defendant. “Given this uncertainty, and the fact that the Government is precluded [by double jeopardy considerations] from challenging the acquittal, it is hardly satisfactory to allow the defendant to receive a new trial on the conviction as a matter of course.” <em>Id. </em>As the High Court concluded, “the fact that the inconsistency [in the verdict] may be the result of lenity, coupled with the Government’s inability to invoke review, suggests that inconsistent verdicts should not be reviewable.” <em>Id.</em>

Finally, the <em>Powell </em>Court noted that “a criminal defen<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>dant already is afforded protection against jury irrationality or error by the independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence undertaken by the trial and appellate courts.” <em>Id. </em>at 67, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">105 S.Ct. 471</a> (cited in <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 1100-1101). Recognizing that the Government must not only convince the jury with its evidence, but also satisfy the court that the jury could rationally reach a guilty verdict given the Government’s evidence, the High Court concluded that “further safeguards against jury irrationality” were not necessary. <em>Id.</em>

Because Appellee had been acquitted of robbery, the predicate felony, the Superior Court concluded that the Commonwealth had failed to prove that Appellee killed the victim while in perpetration <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>of a robbery, and accordingly, his second-degree murder conviction could not stand. We hold here that the Superior Court erred by extending our holding in <em>Magliocco, </em>which was grounded in the plain text of the ethnic intimidation statute, to the offense of second-degree murder, the text and elements of which bear little resemblance to the offense of ethnic intimidation. More generally, we address the tension identified by Justice Saylor in <em>Magliocco </em>and <em>Reed, </em>and resolve it in favor of retaining the longstanding acceptance of inconsistent verdicts. Our reasoning behind this holding is as follows.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[279,865,1148,679]]]'>To secure a conviction for ethnic intimidation, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant “committed” the predicate offense “with malicious intention toward the race” of an individual or group. <em>Magliocco, supra </em>at 489, 493 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 2710(a)). From a plain reading of the statutory text, there is no question that the commission of the predicate offense is an element of ethnic intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 493 (concluding that a “conviction for ethnic intimidation ... requires as an element the commission beyond a reasonable doubt of the underlying offense”). Our holding in <em>Magliocco </em>reflects our conclusion that the Commonwealth fails to prove an element of the offense of ethnic intimidation if the factfinder acquits the accused of the predicate offense.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[276,1576,1152,786]]]'>In contrast to the ethnic intimidation statute, the second-degree murder statute does not set forth or require the commission of the predicate offense as an element. To secure a conviction for second-degree murder, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant committed a murder “while [he or she] was engaged ... in the perpetration of a felony.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(b). “Perpetration of a felony” is statutorily defined in a very broad manner, encompassing, <em>inter alia, </em>“[t]he act of the defendant in engaging in ... the commission of, or an attempt to commit, ... robbery....” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d).

While recognizing that the jury’s verdict appears to be inconsistent, we refuse to inquire into or to speculate upon the nature of the jury’s deliberations or the rationale behind the jury’s decision.

Furthermore, the “special weight” afforded the fact of an acquittal plays no role in the analysis of inconsistent verdicts, because, by definition, one of the verdicts will always be an acquittal. <em>Maglioeco </em>and <em>Reed </em>are distinguished by the plain text of their particular governing statutes, which controlled our disposition of those cases, but are not generally applicable to other offenses.</p>

Magliocco, </em><a href="/pa/584/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="584 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="988483" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0244-01">584 Pa. 244</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="883 A.2d 479" data-case-ids="8908078,988483" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0479-01,/pa/584/0244-01">883 A.2d 479</a>, (2005), I believe that Magliocco’s reasoning lends itself to application beyond the scope of the ethnic intimidation statute. <em>See id. </em>at 268, <a href="/a2d/883/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="883 A.2d 479" data-case-ids="8908078,988483" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0479-01,/pa/584/0244-01">883 A.2d at 493</a> (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>see also Austin, </em><a href="/a2d/906/1213-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="906 A.2d 1213" data-case-ids="8470103" data-case-paths="/a2d/906/1213-01">906 A.2d at 1222</a> (“To paraphrase the Supreme Court by substituting the relevant facts of this case, ‘since the factfinder in this case specifically found that Appellant did not commit the offense of robbery, the conviction for felony murder, which requires as an element the killing while in the perpetration of a robbery, simply cannot stand.’ ”) (citing <em>Magliocco, </em><a href="/pa/584/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="584 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="988483" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0244-01">584 Pa. at 267</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="883 A.2d 479" data-case-ids="8908078,988483" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0479-01,/pa/584/0244-01">883 A.2d at 493</a>); <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>No. JA 05-02408, <em>slip op. </em>at 14-15 (Pa.Super., Nov. 23, 2009). I support the majority’s decision effectively to limit <em>Magliocco </em>to its facts, because I am not persuaded, at least at this juncture, that the practice of tolerating inconsistent verdicts should be abandoned, while, again, acknowledging that there are policy considerations on both sides of this question. <em>See Magliocco, </em><a href="/pa/584/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="584 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="988483" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0244-01">584 Pa. at 268-70</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="883 A.2d 479" data-case-ids="8908078,988483" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0479-01,/pa/584/0244-01">883 A.2d at 493-94</a> (Saylor, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>
