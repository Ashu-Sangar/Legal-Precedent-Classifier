Bassett alleged that, in October 1999, she purchased a model year 2000 Sephia from appellant Kia Motors America, <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>Inc., (“KMA” or the “manufacturer”) with an extended warranty of sixty months or 60,000 miles.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The purchase contract included the manufacturer’s standard warranty clause, which stated that: “[KMA] warrants that your new [Sephia] is free from defects in material and workmanship,” subject to several terms and conditions.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[281,678,1153,1243]],["BL_449.1",449,[177,317,1146,95]]]'>According to the complaint, Bassett experienced malfunctioning of her Sephia’s brakes within 17,000 miles of use, which manifested as an inability to stop the vehicle, increased stopping distances, unpredictable and violent brake pedal pressures, brake lockup and vibration, and general interference with control of the vehicle. She attributed these manifestations to a defect in the design of the Sephia’s brake system causing inadequate heat dissipation, premature wear of the brake pads, and warping of the rotors.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> KMA’s authorized dealerships attempted five repairs on Bassett’s vehicle between January and October 2000, replacing brake pads and rotors on four of five occasions. According to Bassett, she sought to rescind her purchase contract but KMA refused her demand. Bassett claimed that, although KMA was aware of the defect in the brake system, KMA failed to correct the defect and failed to honor the warranty by charging her for the required repairs and replacements. Further, Bassett alleged that the defect in the brake system’s design was common to all model year 1995 to 2001 Sephias. She claimed that all members of the class experienced premature wear and malfunction of the brakes, needing repairs within the first 20,000 miles of purchase. According to the complaint, all repair attempts were ineffective, most were not covered by <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>KMA under the warranty, and the members of the class incurred damages of a similar nature to Bassett’s.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[175,454,1154,691]]]'>The complaint stated four causes of action: breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, violation of the MMWA, and violation of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (“UTPCPL”). Bassett claimed that each member of the class was entitled to compensatory damages for out-of-pocket repair costs, loss of use costs, loss of resale value, funds for permanent repair of the vehicle, treble damages, and costs of litigation, including legal fees. Finally, Bassett requested an injunction compelling KMA to notify all class members of the potential danger for personal injury deriving from the Sephia’s brake defect, and to provide free repair and replacement of the affected brake systems.</p>
    <p id="b449-5" data-blocks='[["BL_449.5",449,[170,1187,1155,1177]]]'>In February 2001, counsel for KMA filed a notice to remove the action to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, invoking that court’s diversity jurisdiction. The parties then filed an amended complaint and answer with the federal court. Bassett’s amended federal court complaint re-stated the allegations in her original state court complaint, and KMA answered denying all allegations and asserting forty-seven boilerplate affirmative defenses. The manufacturer sought dismissal of the amended complaint. In due course, the district court certified the class on all of Bassett’s claims except her UTPCPL claim. <em>See Samuel-Bassett v. Kia Motors Am., Inc., </em><a href="/frd/212/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="212 F.R.D. 271" data-case-ids="985404" data-case-paths="/frd/212/0271-01">212 F.R.D. 271</a> (E.D.Pa.2002). KMA appealed and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which raised the issue of jurisdiction <em>sua sponte, </em>vacated the lower court’s certification decision, and remanded for a determination of whether the parties met the amount in controversy required to establish diversity jurisdiction. <em>See Samuel-Bassett v.

Nos. 1702.1708 <em>with </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(b). In September 2004, the trial court granted Bassett’s motion for class certification in part.

Following discovery, the parties stipulated that KMA did not begin selling the Sephia in the United States until 1997. Bassett also conceded that the 2001 model Sephia had undergone substantial redesign that corrected the alleged brake defect. Consequently, the class was limited to purchasers of 1997 to 2000 Sephias. Class certification was denied as to the UTPCPL claim, and Bassett was permitted to proceed alone on that count. Bassett was designated class representative and her attorneys were appointed counsel for the class. Subsequently, KMA asked the trial court to certify the September 17, 2004, order granting class certification for interlocutory appeal, but its request was denied in November 2004.</p>

On September 26, 2005, the trial court held a hearing on KMA’s motion, at the end of which it directed the manufacturer to file an addendum indicating where issues raised in the motion had been preserved; KMA complied. The trial court issued no further order to dispose of the request for post-trial relief within 120 days of filing and, therefore, upon praecipe of the class, the prothonotary entered judgment on the molded jury verdict on October 25, 2005. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P.

First, respecting commonality, the trial court noted that the theory of liability of the putative class centered on KMA selling one vehicle “with a uniformly defective braking system that affected all drivers” and on KMA’s unsuccessful attempts to remedy the defective vehicles in a similar manner, <em>i.e., </em>by replacing brake pads and rotors every few thousand miles. The court listed the common questions of law identified in the complaint, which included whether the Sephias possessed the brake system defect alleged; whether KMA lacked the means to repair the defect; whether the defect constituted breach of express and implied warranties and violation of the MMWA; and whether members of the class were entitled to actual damages and/or an injunction. The court found that sufficient evidence of record supported Bassett’s allegations that KMA knew its Sephia vehicles required premature and frequent replacement of brake pads and rotors. According to the court, with the evidence offered, Bassett met her burden of proof for class certification with regard to three claims: breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, and violation of the MMWA.

Without specifying whether it is addressing the certification hearing or the trial testimony, KMA attacks Bassett’s evidence as not credible and not probative. Thus, KMA challenges the conclusion of Bassett’s expert witness that the Sephias suffered from a common defect, on the basis that he personally inspected only two vehicles rather than all the vehicles in the class. According to KMA, warranty repair statistics did not cure any deficiencies in the expert’s testimony regarding the existence of a defect and, instead, showed only that “KMA honored its express warranty” by routinely covering brake repairs to Sephia vehicles.</p>

According to Bassett, warranty data showing high <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>percentage rates of covered brake repairs was <em>prima fade </em>proof that all 1997-2000 Sephias experienced a premature wear defect. Further, deposition testimony from KMA executives, KMA internal documents, and a “coupon” program, through which KMA offered free brake repairs to members of the class, showed that KMA recognized the 1997-2000 Sephias as suffering from a model-wide defect. Bassett states that KMA did not require individual inspections of each Sephia, nor inquiry into individual drivers’ habits, as a prerequisite to qualify for its coupon program, proof that KMA discounted their role in revealing the causes of customer complaints. Bassett claims that KMA also did not limit the program to select iterations of the 1997-2000 Sephia models, in recognition that any modifications or “tweaks” of the brake system did not alter the basic defective design.</p>

Thus, Bassett asserts, warranty data supported the commonality and predominance allegations, regardless of whether the same data also showed that KMA complied with its warranty promises, a fact relevant to KMA’s liability but not a factor for the court to consider for certification purposes.</p>

Bassett notes that KMA’s appeal strategy is different from its trial argument: at trial, KMA sought to prove that a common defect did not exist but, on appeal, KMA is claiming that existence of a defect is irrelevant. Bassett emphasizes that, at trial, KMA “recognized” that it was replacing one set of defective brakes with another and, therefore, that warranty repairs did not restore the Sephias to a defect-free condition. But, Bassett adds, on appeal, implicit in the jury’s verdict is a finding that commonality existed so there is no basis to overturn the certification decision.</p>

Common issues included whether KMA met its express promise to deliver vehicles free from defect; whether the Sephias had a braking system design defect; and whether the design defect manifested as abnormal or premature wear of the brakes.

The evidence available to the court at the time of certification supported the following findings of fact by the trial court. KMA sold the Sephia to U.S. consumers between 1997 and 2000. N.T., 7/15/04, at 10, 19. Although KMA made several changes to the design of the Sephia’s brake system during those years, the modifications did not significantly alter the basic defective design. N.T., 7/15/04, at 86-87, 129; 7/16/04, Vol. 1, at 79-81. According to Bassett’s expert, the brake systems of all 1997-2000 Sephias had a common design defect related to heat dissipation in the front brakes, which caused premature wear of the brake pads and rotors. N.T., 7/15/04, at 93, 100-01.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> Bassett showed U.S. consumer expectations and the KMA owner’s manual to set the reasonable life expectancy of Sephia brake pads at 20,000 to 30,000 miles. <em>Id. </em>at 94-97. But, the Sephias’ brake pads (and, subsequently, rotors) wore prematurely. <em>See </em>Motion for Class Certification, Exh. 2-D-I, K (KMA Technical Service Bulletins dated 1997-1999; Sephia Repair Tips (from Kia Technician Times, Apr. 1998)). Warranty data showed high claim rates related to the premature wear of brake pads and rotors for 1997-2000 Sephias, which indicated, according to Bassett’s expert, “extra” or “abnormal” wear independent of factors like driver habits and the environment that normally contribute to brake component wear.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> N.T., 7/15/04, at 98-99, 102, 104. Bassett also offered KMA internal memoranda and <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>evidence of a free brake pad coupon program to confirm the existence of a system-wide brake defect and KMA’s knowledge of the defect since 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 132; N.T., 07/16/04, Vol. 1, at 48-49 (quoting quality assurance report of June 8, 1999, in reference to premature brake wear and warping of rotors on the Sephia: “This is a well-known condition and needs to be corrected ASAP.”); <em>see also </em>Motion for Class Certification, Exh. 2-D-I, K (KMA Technical Service Bulletins dated 1997-1999; Sephia Repair Tips (from Kia Technician Times, Apr. 1998)). Finally, warranty data, internal memoranda, and KMA’s repeated attempts to make minor brake system modifications, as explained by expert testimony, supported the trial court’s finding that KMA was unable to effectively repair the defect in the brake system. N.T., 7/15/04, at 88 (brake system defect was “chronic”). Thus, the trial court’s findings of fact for the purposes of Bassett’s class certification motion are supported by the record.</p>

During class certification proceedings, Bassett adduced evidence to support her averments that, like the other class members, she purchased a Sephia vehicle model year 1997-2000 and received the standard purchase contract and written warranty. Because of a design defect that affected the ability of the Sephias’ front braking system to dissipate heat, Bassett’s vehicle, like the other vehicles in the class, experienced premature wear of the brake pads and warping of the rotors.

Bassett also recounts the evidence introduced at trial, specifically addressing the following elements of a breach of warranty: KMA’s warranty or promise, KMA’s failure to meet its promise, causation, notice to KMA and opportunity to cure, and the class members’ damages. Although Bassett articulates her arguments with parallel references to the record from the trial and to the record created during class certification proceedings, she observes that there is “a material difference between pre-trial certification and post-trial reexamination” of a trial and argues that “the question after trial is whether generalized proof was fairly presented and confronted by the parties at trial.” Bassett’s Brief at 33.</p>

The court also noted internal documents which demonstrated that KMA was aware of the brake system problems as early as 1995 and tried unsuccessfully to convince parent-company KMC to remedy the problem. One document prepared for KMA vendors, for example, related the discrepancy between the high warranty claims rate for the Sephia (41.8%) versus the relatively low rate for KMA’s Sportage (6.3%) during the 1997-1999 period. In addition, a field report from a Kia Parts Service Manager in May 1999 described the Sephias’ defect as “a well[-]known condition [that] needs to be corrected ASAP,” and a record of calls to KMA’s technical assistance hotline documented complaints that “systemic design problems existed causing unreasonably early wear-out of brakes and rotors.” The court also described evidence of KMA attempting to identify the brake problem with the aid of an independent engineering firm, and to remedy the defect by developing and introducing improved pads and rotors from different manufacturers. But, testing of the Sephias after KMC’s brake pad and rotor improvements showed that the vehicles’ brake system components continued to underperform.

Witnesses testified that, under ordinary use conditions, the Sephias did <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>not meet consumer expectations for brake component life under either KMA or American consumer standards.

Once the lining on the brake pads wore down to the indicators and the rotors warped, the members of the class experienced noise and vibration when applying the brakes. KMA’s corporate designee Tim McCurdy and Bassett’s expert agreed that brake system components had to be replaced significantly in advance of when anticipated by KMA and by consumers. It was only in 2001, when a significant modification for that year’s model involving a re-design of the front brake rotor, a larger brake pad, and a repositioning of the axle, that the performance of the brake system improved to KMA and American market expectations. According to Bassett’s expert, high warranty claim rates for the 1997-2000 Sephias confirmed the existence of a common defect. <em>See </em>N.T., 5/19/05, Vol. 1, at 55, 60, 68-70, <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>95-116 (King testimony); N.T., 5/18/05, Vol. 1, at 80-81; 5/18/05, Vol. 2, at 15-16; 34-35, 41-42, 72-78 (McCurdy deposition); N.T., 5/23/05, Vol. 1, at 17, 20 (Sawyer deposition); N.T., 5/23/05, Vol. 1, at 42-43 (Pearce deposition); N.T., 5/23/05, Vol. 5. at 19-23 (Sohn deposition); Tim McCurdy Inter-Office Memorandum to James Lee, 2/03/99.</p>

Indeed, only a “field fix” for vehicles already on the market, announced via a January 2002 Technical Service Bulletin, and a redesign of the brake system for new models (re-named the Spectra), successfully offered the necessary repair in late 2001. <em>See </em>KMA Technical Service Bulletin (chassis division), 1/02, Vol. 3 # 8.

According to KMA executives, they became aware of the problem because of an increase in the sale of brake parts and warranty claim activity. KMA sought repeatedly to increase the performance of the brake system but failed until 2001, when a field fix was developed for in-use models concurrently with the re-design of front brake system on the new model in the Sephia line. In the meantime, class members experienced varying treatment in seeking replacement of brake pads and rotors under the warranty. <em>See </em>Tim McCurdy Inter-Office Memorandum to James Lee, 2/03/99; KMC Brake Quality Team Meeting Summary, 2/15/99; N.T., 5/23/05, Vol. 1, at 16-18, 23-24 (Sawyer deposition); N.T., 5/18/05, Vol. 2, at 35 (McCurdy deposition).

Donald Pearce and Michelle Cameron testified that KMA dealerships offered some free repairs to promote good will for Sephia owners, as well as the brake coupon program in late 2001. But, according to the KMA witnesses, in general, the replacement of brake pads and rotors was not covered by the written warranty. As a result, KMA owners sustained out-of-pocket repair costs estimated by Bassett’s expert at approximately $1,005 over the life of their Kia Sephia. On cross-examination, the expert stated that he derived the number not from Bassett’s repair history data but by relying on data from KMA, and in particular on the Field Assurance and the Technical Assistance Center Incident reports, regarding the frequency of repairs over the life time of a Sephia.

KMA makes two related but nonetheless distinct arguments. First, KMA contends that molding of the verdict was improper or in violation of its due process rights because it allowed each member of the class to recover $600, although no evidence of liability and amount of out-of-pocket costs was of record for any member of the class except Bassett. Essentially, the manufacturer re-asserts its prior arguments regarding the certification of the class and the sufficiency of evidence to prove a breach of the express warranty. <em>See Jackson v.

Second, KMA states that molding of the verdict was improper because the trial court did not conduct claims proceedings per its pre-trial order of May 16, 2005 (“May 16th Order”), which disposed of KMA’s motion to bifurcate the trial into proceedings on what KMA perceived as “common” versus “individual” issues.

In <em>Straub, </em>after the parties rested, the trial court discussed the verdict sheets with the parties and stated that it aimed to explain to the jury that the plaintiffs were forwarding two independent claims, and that the plaintiffs <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>could win on one claim but lose on the other or vice versa. The parties agreed and the trial court issued its instruction. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on one claim but not on the second. The defendant did not object to the jury questionnaire, the trial court’s instructions, or the jury’s verdict. Then, in post-trial motions, the defendant sought a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the ground that once the jury found that the product was not defective respecting the first claim, it should have found in its favor on all counts. The trial court did not rule on the post-verdict motions and entered judgment on the verdict; the Superior Court reversed and remanded. This Court, however, held that the Superior Court erred in rejecting the plaintiffs’ waiver argument and reversed. We concluded that the defendant premised its claim of error “on the argument that the jury’s verdict was incompatible with a principle of law.” But, this alleged error should have been evident when the verdict sheets and the trial instructions were agreed upon and formulated. Yet, the defendant did not object to the verdict sheets, to the trial court’s related instructions, or “to the verdict itself when it was rendered.” By failing to object, the defendant had waived its claim. <a href="/pa/583/0608-01" class="citation" data-index="210" data-cite="880 A.2d 561" data-case-ids="687718,8937242" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0608-01,/a2d/880/0561-01">880 A.2d at 567</a>.</p>

The manufacturer appealed the judgment on October 28, 2005, and the trial court decided the fee petition on January 23, 2006, nearly three months later. According to KMA, the MMWA requires that the counsel “fee award be entered ‘as part of the underlying judgment.” But, here, the trial court issued the fee award months after and, thus, it was not part of the final judgment entered. The manufacturer argues that, pursuant to Rule of Appellate Procedure 1701(a), the trial court no longer had jurisdiction to act on the petition for counsel fees once Bassett entered voluntary judgment on the verdict.

As a separate issue, Bassett also argues in a footnote that KMA waived all of its appellate arguments by failing to move for decertification before or after trial. Bassett’s Brief at 48-49 n. 27. In its reply brief, KMA responds that, pursuant to Rule 1710, a party may seek decertification at any stage, including on appeal, "before the final appeal is exhausted.” According to KMA, a party is not required to file for decertification in order to preserve its arguments regarding class certification on appeal. KMA’s Reply Brief at 10-11 &amp; n. 10. Both parties conflate two separate concepts: decertification by the trial court and appellate review of a trial court certification decision. Thus, only the trial court may decertify a class pursuant to Rule 1710(d), which, as a Rule of Civil Procedure, governs practice and procedure in the courts of common pleas. Practice and procedure in the appellate courts is governed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Pa.R.A.P. 103. Rule 1710(d) plainly states that a decertification decision is proper only "before a decision on the merits.” Pa.R.C.P. No. 1710(d). But, filing a motion to decertify is optional and failure to move for decertification does not waive a party’s claims of error on appeal regarding the trial court’s initial certification decision. Appellate courts review a trial court decision under an abuse of discretion standard and may order the judgment vacated or reversed, on the basis that certification was erroneous, with the ultimate result that the class is decertified. <em>See, e.g., Debbs, </em><a href="/a2d/810/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="372" data-cite="810 A.2d 137" data-case-ids="9307705" data-case-paths="/a2d/810/0137-01">810 A.2d at 164</a> (judgment vacated with direction for trial court to decertify the class).

But, the trial court denied KMA’s motion to bifurcate, which had expressly requested separate trials on these "individual” issues.

The court also suggested that the plain language of the MMWA does not preclude application of a contingency multiplier which "multiplies the lodestar by a number representing the probability of loss [as the fee awarded would continue to be] based on the number of hours the attorneys worked.” <em>Skelton, </em><a href="/f2d/860/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="382" data-cite="860 F.2d 250" data-case-ids="655734" data-case-paths="/f2d/860/0250-01">860 F.2d at 257</a>.

In <em>Perdue, </em>the Court clarified its <em>Dague </em>holding and explained that a fee determined by the lodestar method is strongly presumed reasonable but may be enhanced in very "rare" and "exceptional” circumstances, <em>Le., </em>(1) "when the hourly rate employed in the lodestar calculation does not adequately measure the attorney’s true market value, as demonstrated in part during litigation;” (2) "if the attorney’s performance includes an extraordinary outlay of expenses and the litigation is exceptionally protracted;” and (3) in "extraordinary circumstances in which an attorney’s performance involves exceptional delay in the payment of fees.” <em>Perdue, </em>559 U.S. at-, 130 S.Ct. at 1674-75.

Indeed, this baseline reality of this case was reflected in the following impromptu comment by class counsel during the trial proceedings: "I don’t know how, in the context of this Class Action, or in any Class Action, at a trial you could prove the amount of damages actually incurred by everyone.” N.T., May 26, 2005, Vol. 3, at 19.</p>

Grinnell Corp., </em><a href="/f-supp/356/1380-01" class="citation" data-index="408" data-cite="356 F.

However, the settlement context, involving a consensual resolution of affairs, is far different from the adversarial trial setting. Indeed, it is the difficulties of proof facing plaintiffs, and the scale of potential liabilities faced by defendants should they go to trial, which often provide the incentives for consummation of settlements.</p>
      <p id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.6",533,[200,1545,1120,342]]]'>Again, it may well be that, as a matter of social policy, some or all of the techniques and philosophies pertaining to class action <em>settlements </em>should be transported into the <em>trial </em>context. My main point here is that, undisputably, the approval of the class action device as acceptable procedure did not accomplish such a substantive change in Pennsylvania. <em>See supra </em>Part I. Moreover, and again, in any such substantive decision making, separation of powers considerations and the constitutional interests of affected defendants obviously merit careful consideration. <em>See id.</em>

For example, courts will ... bend the rules of evidence and alter burdens of proof so that contested facts can be resolved on a common rather than individualized basis[.] ... Nothing inherent in the class action device distorts substantive or evidentiary rules in this manner, but certification has that practical effect when judges try to manage the dissimilar aspects of class members' claims.</blockquote>

Responsively, the majority does say that its opinion is so confined, in relevant part. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 440 n. 27, 34 A.3d at 42 n. 27. Nevertheless, the majority decision sanctions the certification of a broad-scale class in circumstances in which there was no ostensible plan for appropriate treatment of individualized issues, while at the same time cataloguing the incongruities, missteps, and (in my view) unfairness which resulted. While the majority places the onus upon defendants to provide some greater critique of class certification efforts, in my view, the need for individualized treatment of some elements of the plaintiffs' claims was obvious from the outset of this case (and KIA's objections were sufficient to identify the problem, in any event). Moreover, to prevent similar disorder in future class action cases, I believe the Court should take this opportunity to place the burden upon <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>proponents of class treatment to advance an appropriate management plan.</p>
