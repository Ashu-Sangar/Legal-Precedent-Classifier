The insured argues that this practice violates the common law “made whole doctrine.” As discussed in more detail below, the made whole doctrine provides generally that an insurance company cannot exercise its right of subrogation until its insured has been fully compensated or “made whole.” As we conclude that the made whole doctrine does not apply to the collision coverage at issue in this case, we affirm the dismissal of appellant-insured’s class action.</p>

A deductible clause is defined as “[a] clause in an insurance policy exempting the insurer from paying an initial specified amount after an accident.” The American Heritage Dictionary 227 (4th Ed.2001); <em>see also </em>Black’s Law Dictionary 285 (6th Ed.1991) (“The portion of an insured loss to be borne by the insured before he is entitled to recover from the insurer.”). Likewise, the policy at issue in this case defines a deductible as “the amount of loss to be paid by the insured. We pay for covered loss above the deductible amount shown in the Declarations.” Nationwide Auto Policy, dated October 19, 2005, at Dl. Accordingly, unlike a UM/UIM claim where the insured is not responsible for paying a deductible prior to recovery but may recover only up to the policy’s specified coverage limits, an insured recovering under a collision coverage policy may recover the entire amount of the damage up to and including the total value of <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>the vehicle, after subtracting the amount of the deductible that the insured contracted to pay.</p>

Indeed, the MVFRL requires this reduction in premiums. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1792(b)(4) (“With the purchase of a $500 or greater deductible, there shall be an immediate commensurate reduction in rate for collision and comprehensive coverages. The reduction in rate shall be based on the insured’s existing deductible level.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Additionally, the MVFRL forbids insurers from issuing policies that do not include deductibles, and provides that policies must include a $500 deductible unless the insured “signs a statement indicating the insured is aware that the purchase of a lower deductible is permissible and that there is an additional cost of purchasing a lower deductible”. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1792(b)(1). With these basic parameters in mind, we consider the case at bar.</p>

The facts as presented to this Court do not address any bodily injury resulting from the accident.

The policy also provided Nationwide with the right of subrogation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Nationwide paid Jones for all damage to the vehicle, reduced by the $500 deductible.</p>

The proposed class included “all Pennsylvania residents who are or have been insured under Pennsylvania policies of insurance issued by defendant that have deductibles applicable to collision damage coverage.” Complaint at 8. Jones’s complaint included several counts. First, Plaintiff claimed that the pro rata reimbursement constituted a breach of contract, arguing that the contract was subject to common law equitable principles such as the made whole doctrine. Jones also brought claims of bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8371, conversion, and unjust enrichment. All claims were based upon Jones’s conclusion that Nationwide should have reimbursed her for her entire $500 deductible, despite the provision in the policy granting Nationwide subrogation rights.

The federal court concluded that 31 Pa.Code § 146.8(c), which provided for the pro rata subrogation distribution procedure, was within the authority delegated to the Insurance Department by the General Assembly pursuant to the UIPA. The court held that because the procedure is “specifically permitted by Pennsylvania’s insurance regulations, [it] cannot violate the common law ‘made whole’ doctrine even assuming that the doctrine would in fact support a claim like that of [the] plaintiffs.” <em>Id. </em>The federal court then reasoned, “[b]ecause the behavior does not violate the ‘made whole’ doctrine, the plaintiffs have failed to state a basis on which the Court could find a breach of the parties’ contract.” <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, based in part upon the federal district court’s decision in <em>Hamick, </em>the trial court dismissed Jones’s complaint in the matter now before us.

Instead, Nationwide contends that the pro rata reimbursement procedure utilized by the insurance company and provided for by Section 146.8(c) of the regulations appropriately balances the policies of the made whole doctrine and the deductible requirement by requiring the reimbursement of the insured’s deductible from subrogation recoveries on a proportionate basis.</p>

In contrast to insurance such as UIM, which involves coverage limits, the Commissioner notes, “Collision coverage, however, is fundamentally different from other first-party coverages because it does not have a coverage limit.” <em>Id. </em>at 4 (emphasis omitted).

Under the policy, the insured agreed to pay the deductible as a first dollar obligation prior to implicating the insurer’s obligation to cover the damages. Therefore, the loss of the deductible is not a “shortfall” in the insurance coverage. The Commissioner argues that requiring the insurer to refund the deductible in full to insured prior to recovering its own payment would render the deductible meaningless and would convert the policy into a deductible-free policy, which is prohibited by the MVFRL. Additionally, the Commissioner observes that, pursuant to the MVFRL, premiums are based upon the contractually determined deductible, such that applying the made whole doctrine would “negate any differentials in premiums paid by consumers electing higher or lower deductibles and undermine” the rate structures approved by the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>

For example, if the insured is ten percent at fault in the accident, the third-party tortfeasor’s insurance company will only pay the insurer ninety percent of the insured’s loss. The Commissioner asserts that it would be inequitable for the insured, who was partially at fault for the accident, to recover in full for her deductible prior to the insurer receiving any of the subrogation proceeds. Accordingly, an insured, who is partially at fault for the accident, would recover all losses, when the insurer who pursued the litigation and accepted the risks thereof, would recover only a portion of its losses.</p>

Although the General Assembly has not specifically spoken to the question of reimbursement of an insured’s deductible from an insurer’s subrogation recovery, we cannot ignore that the legislature has set forth clear policy regarding deductibles generally. The MVFRL requires all motor vehicle insurance policies for collision coverage issued in this Commonwealth to contain a deductible of no less than $100. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1792(b)(2). This requirement ensures that insureds share <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>with their insurance companies the risk of damage to the vehicle. The legislature also directed insurers and the Commissioner to set premium rates based upon the deductible amount chosen by the insured. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1792(b)(4). Accordingly, the legislature provided a system where an insured, who agreed to accept a higher percentage of the risk through a higher deductible, would pay a lower premium to reflect that the insurer would cover less risk. With these legislative directives in mind, we agree with the Commissioner that applying the made whole doctrine to the distribution of subrogation recoveries in collision coverage cases would undermine the MVFRL’s provisions related to deductibles. Specifically, application of the made whole doctrine would require the insured to recover the entire deductible from the proceeds of any action against the tortfeasor prior to the insurance company’s recovery, thus in essence creating a no-deductible policy, in the limited circumstances of a cases involving subrogation recoveries, in violation of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1792(b)(2).</p>

The question as framed by Jones is whether "Pennsylvania law require[s] that a party suffering damages be made whole before an <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>insurer is entitled to subrogation?” As noted by all parties and set forth below, Pennsylvania has applied the "made whole” doctrine repeatedly, and thus there is no dispute in this case that the doctrine applies, generally, as part of Pennsylvania common law. The interesting question raised by this case is whether the made whole doctrine applies to the case at bar, involving the pro rata reimbursement of the insured’s deductible from the insurer’s subrogation recovery.</p>

Although we affirm the courts below based upon our conclusion that the made whole doctrine does not apply to collision coverage cases, we recognize that the parties devote substantial briefing to Nationwide’s argument that the made whole doctrine does not apply to cases where the insurer, rather than the insured, is the party pursuing the subrogation action against the third-party tortfeasor. In support of its argument, Nationwide contends that the made whole doctrine typically applies where the insured takes on the risk of litigation and sues the tortfeasor; in such a case, the insured must be made whole before the insurer can make its subrogation claim against the insured’s recovery from the tortfeasor. Nationwide argues that equity does not require the application of the made whole doctrine when the insured has not asserted a claim against the tortfeasor, as in this case where the action was brought by the insurer.</p>

As in any subrogation claim, the insurer steps into the shoes of the insured-subrogee, and can only claim the rights of the insured-subrogee. She further argues that Nationwide cannot divide the claim against the tortfeasor into Nationwide's claim for the amount above the deductible and Jones’s claim for the amount of the deductible, pursuant to caselaw asserting that a cause of action for negligence cannot be split or divided. <em>See Fitzpatrick v.

Specifically, 31 Pa.Code § 146.8(c) provides, in part, “Insurers shall, upon the request of the claimant, include the first-party claimant’s deductible, if any, in subrogation demands.
