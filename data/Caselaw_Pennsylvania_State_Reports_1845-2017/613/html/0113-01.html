Similarly, the Pennsylvania State Trooper’s Association (“PSTA”) filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief in support of Trooper Williams, emphasizing the policy considerations that favor extending private UIM benefits to police officers injured in motor vehicle accidents that occur in the line of duty. The PSTA asserts that citizens of this Commonwealth recognize the important role police officers play in protecting the public and, in turn, unanimously agree that their rights should be safeguarded.</p>

Therefore, GEICO submits, we should not infringe on the legislature’s prerogative to enact such a policy.

Thus, tolerating the risk of injury from an underinsured motorist was a viable option for Mrs. Burstein. Second, she could have obtained UIM coverage for the vehicle in either of two ways: she could have negotiated with her employer for it to purchase UIM coverage on the vehicle; or, if the employer refused, there is no evidence of record suggesting that Mrs. Burstein could not have purchased the coverage herself.

In considering the insurance industry’s rhetoric, I cannot help but observe that the industry appears to be awash in revenue. It is hard not to notice the industry’s spending on many discretionary activities, including incessant television advertising, the All-State Sugar Bowl, Safe Auto’s sponsorship of the Ultimate Fighting Championship Series, and Progressive Field, home of the Cleveland Indians. In consequence, I join my colleagues in calling for advocates and the judiciary to cease their continued reliance on the unthinking perpetuation of the long-ameliorated concern for cost containment, and, if my supposition regarding the industry’s financial status is correct, I urge the industry to reduce premiums as a humanitarian gesture to suffering Pennsylvanians.</p>

Thus, by this mandate, the General Assembly has articulated a remedial public policy that promotes the recovery of damages for innocent victims of accidents from motorists who cannot adequately compensate such victims for their injuries. While the offer of such coverage is required, the purchase of UM/UIM coverage is optional. In the matter before us, we observe that GEICO limited the breadth of UM/UIM coverage by inserting certain exclusions into its policies. In particular, although State Trooper Williams purchased UIM coverage on his personal automobile policy, the policy contained a regular use exclusion which operates to preclude the UIM coverage he seeks herein. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 115, 32 A.3d at 1197.</p>

The Heart and Lung Act, 53 P.S. § 637, enacted in 1935, provides full salary for temporary disability by certain emer<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>gency personnel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_1" id="ref_footnote_4_1">1</a> Similarly, the 1915 Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 27.1(m.1), and the 1939 Occupational Disease Act, 77 P.S. § 413, provide special protection to first responders injured in the course of their employment. These provisions impose a presumption that certain occupational diseases which occur during the course and scope of employment are work related, due to the unique hardships and challenges such workers face.

In my view, emergency first responders should not be subjected to the consequences of driving a vehicle without UIM coverage in light of the intent of the MVFRL and the public policy in favor of protecting these brave men and women. Therefore, I urge the General Assembly to consider measures to ensure that these public servants are not vulnerable to inadequate compensation for injuries incurred in the performance of their critical duties — by, for example, requiring that public employers purchase UM/UIM coverage for emergency first responders in their employ, or mandating that automobile insurers be barred from excluding UM/UIM coverage for emergency first responders.</p>
