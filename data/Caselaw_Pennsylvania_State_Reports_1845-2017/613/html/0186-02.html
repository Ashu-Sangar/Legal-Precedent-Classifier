The parties agree that the insurance policy is subject to all provisions of ERISA. On June 27, 1998, Decedent married Appellant, Jodie L. Sauers (Ex-Spouse), and named her as the primary beneficiary of the insurance policy. On October 13, 1998, Decedent designated his nephew, Ian D. Rehn, as a contingent beneficiary (Contingent Beneficiary) of the insurance policy. Almost four years to the date of their nuptials, on June 11, 2002, Decedent and Ex-Spouse divorced.

As for the motion <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>to dismiss, Ex-Spouse argued that regardless of any Pennsylvania statute to the contrary, ERISA mandates that the proceeds of the policy be paid to her as the primary beneficiary of the policy. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201104" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1104">29 U.S.C. § 1104</a>(a)(1)(D) (providing that, with respect to ERISA-governed plans, plan administrators and fiduciaries shall discharge their duties, including payment of benefits, “in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan”).

Concerning the motion to dismiss, the Orphans’ Court disagreed with Ex-Spouse that ERISA preempted Section 6111.2, because, under what is commonly known as the prior restraint clause of Section 6111.2, <em>see supra </em>note 1, plan administrators/fiduciaries cannot be held liable for “making payments to a former spouse which would have been proper in the absence of [Section 6111.2].” 20 Pa.C.S. § 6111.2; <em>see also </em>Tr.

As will be developed <em>infra, </em>the trial court accepted Administrator’s argument that the plan administrator’s statutory protection meant that she could distribute the insurance proceeds without state law constraining her actions. Thus, there was no conflict between the federal law’s directive and state law.</p>

In the CO/DO’s view, this clause was properly severable from the preempted portions of Section 6111.2, because it did not <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>implicate the concerns Congress expressed in passing ERISA.

Before this Court, however, Ex-Spouse only raises Administrator’s capacity to sue. The basis of Ex-Spouse’s contentions in this regard centers around the assertion that the insurance policy is merely an employee benefit plan, and not testamentary in nature. To that end, Ex-Spouse contends that, under 20 Pa.C.S. § 6108(a), who is and who is not <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>designed a beneficiary of life insurance or an employee-benefit plan “shall not be considered testamentary and shall not be subject to any law governing the transfer of property by will.... ” Ex-Spouse then argues that in light of this statutory language, it is clear that this case involves nothing more than the applicability of federal law as to who is a rightful designee/beneficiary.

In applying this construct to the <em>Fort Halifax </em>facts, the Supreme Court determined that the Maine severance statute required only a one-time lump sum payment to employees who lost jobs and therefore implicated an employee benefit, and not a benefit plan, which, by its nature, would require constant administration. In a footnote, the Court made the distinction even more clear:</p>
    <blockquote id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[321,767,1109,1120]]]'>[FHPC] notes that death benefits sometimes involve a onetime payment to beneficiaries, and that ERISA nonetheless defines an employee welfare benefit plan to include a program that pays such benefits. <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 1002">29 U.S.C. § 1002</a>(1). Thus, it contends, the fact that the Maine statute requires a single payment does not mean that the statute does not establish a plan. This argument, however, misunderstands what it is that makes a plan a plan. While death benefits may represent a one-time payment from the perspective of the beneficiaries, the employer clearly foresees the need to make regular payments to survivors on an ongoing basis. The ongoing, predictable nature of this obligation therefore creates the need for an administrative scheme to process claims and pay out benefits, whether those benefits are received by beneficiaries in a lump sum or on a periodic basis. This is borne out by the fact that death benefits are included in appellant’s retirement plan, with instructions on how eligibility is to be determined, benefit levels calculated, and disbursements made. By contrast, appellant’s statutory obligation did not prompt the establishment of any payment program, since there were no ongoing benefits to be paid.</blockquote>

There is some lack of clarity here, because the question presented has been framed in terms of the "capacity” of the administrator, which has been distinguished from "standing,” albeit the distinction has been couched by some Justices at least as "metaphysical.” <em>Witt v. Dep’t of Banking, </em><a href="/pa/493/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="493 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="8731560" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0077-01">493 Pa. 77</a>, 83 n. 7, <a href="/pa/493/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="493 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="8731560" data-case-paths="/pa/493/0077-01">425 A.2d 374</a>, 377 n. 7 (1981) (opinion in support of remand). In any event, Appellant’s brief makes clear that her treatment of capacity and standing overlaps. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 22.</p>

      <em>See </em>Majority Op., at 199, 32 A.3d at 1249.

      <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[167,1896,1147,465]]]'>. I agree with Justice Saylor that the parties and the courts below failed to distinguish capacity and standing. <em>See </em>Concurring Op., at 214 n. 1, 32 A.3d at 1258 n. 1 (Saylor, J., concurring). Indeed, Appellant conflates the concepts of standing and capacity in her brief, using the terms interchangeably. Likewise, the majority opinion does not clarify the issue but contends legal capacity is "extremely amorphous” and the "blurry distinction between capacity to sue and standing [i]s a ‘somewhat metaphysical question.’ ” Majority Op., at 199, 32 A.3d at 1249. The majority merely characterizes Appellant’s capacity argument as a question of authority, which does not make the distinction less blurry— as such, I believe it is best put aside, particularly as it is made irrelevant by resolution of the preemption issue.</p>
