The court recognized that, while subsection 3802(d)(1) prohibits driving when there is <em>any </em>quantity of illegal drug in one’s blood, subsections 3801(d)(2) and (d)(3) do not require that a drug be chemically detectable in the defendant’s body or that blood tests be performed. <em>Id. </em>at 1268 n. 6. Rather, the text of subsections 3801(d)(2) and (d)(3) requires only that one’s ability to safely drive be impaired because of the influence of a drug. The Superior Court further concluded that expert testimony was not required to establish that the <em>DiPanfilo </em>appellant’s impairment was due to his use of cocaine and/or opiates, because the intoxicating effects of cocaine and opiates, like the intoxicating effects of alcohol, are widely known and commonly understood. <em>Id. </em>at 1267.</p>

Thus, the Commonwealth’s expert did not opine that the appellant had been under the influence of marijuana when he was driving, much less that the appellant had been under the influence to a degree that impaired his ability to drive safely. The Superior Court subsequently explained further that its decision in <em>Etchison </em>rested, in “large part,” upon the fact that marijuana is a fat-soluble drug, the metabolites of which can be detected in the blood for a long time after ingestion. <em>Williamson, <a href="/a2d/962/1200-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="962 A.2d 1200" data-case-ids="8189240" data-case-paths="/a2d/962/1200-01">supra </a></em><a href="/a2d/962/1200-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="962 A.2d 1200" data-case-ids="8189240" data-case-paths="/a2d/962/1200-01">at 1205</a>; <em>see also Commonwealth v.

We do not dispute that in some cases, depending on the specific facts and circumstances, expert testimony may be helpful, or perhaps even necessary, to prove causation under subsection 3802(d)(2), but we decline to hold that the need for expert testimony is inherent in the statutory provision and thus mandatory in all cases.</p>

      <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>Our decision derives, in large part, from a comparison of those provisions of Section 3802 that concern alcohol consumption versus those that concern drug usage. Most of the alcohol-related provisions, <em>i.e., </em>subsections 3802(a)(2), (b), and (c), prohibit driving after an individual has imbibed sufficient alcohol such that the alcohol concentration in that individual’s blood or breath reaches certain, specific levels within two hours after driving. To prove the specific level of alcohol in the defendant’s blood or breath at the relevant time, a blood or breath test is obviously required. In contrast, under the general impairment provision set forth in subsection 3802(a)(1), a blood or breath test to determine alcohol level is not required; rather, a different standard is used, to wit, “imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol such that [one] is rendered incapable of safely driving.” We have made clear that Section 3802 neither specifies nor limits the type of evidence that the Commonwealth may proffer to prove its case under subsection 3802(a)(1). <em>Commonwealth v.

Although the Commonwealth <em>may </em>proffer evidence of alcohol level and/or expert testimony to establish that the defendant had imbibed sufficient alcohol to be rendered incapable of driving safely, it is not required to do so under subsection 3802(a)(1). <em><a href="/a2d/906/1237-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="906 A.2d 1237" data-case-ids="8470293" data-case-paths="/a2d/906/1237-01">Id.</a> </em>This is well-established, long-standing law in Pennsylvania. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

As we stated in <em>Segida, supra </em>at 879, “Regardless of the type of evidence that the Commonwealth proffers to support its case, the focus of subsection 3802(a)(1) remains on the inability of the individual to drive safely due to consumption of alcohol — not on a particular blood alcohol level.” Thus, as an important practical consequence of this statutory scheme, a drunk driver who declines to submit to a blood or breath test to determine alcohol level can still be charged with and convicted under subsection 3802(a)(1) if the Commonwealth can prove that he or she drove after imbibing <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>a sufficient amount of alcohol such that he or she was rendered incapable of safely driving.</p>

First, subsection 3802(d)(1) prohibits one from driving if there is any amount of a Schedule I controlled substance, any amount of a Schedule II or Schedule III controlled substance that has not been medically prescribed for the individual, or any amount of a metabolite of a controlled substance in one’s blood. Analogously to subsections 3802(a)(2), (b), and (c) for alcohol intoxication, subsection 3802(d)(1) requires a measurement to determine if any amount of a Schedule I, II, or III controlled substance is detectable in the defendant’s blood. Second, and analogously to subsection 3802(a)(1) for alcohol intoxication, subsection 3802(d)(2) prohibits driving if one is “under the influence of a drug or combination of drugs to a degree which impairs [one’s] ability to safely drive.” This provision by its plain text does not require that a drug be measured in the defendant’s blood, nor does it specify any particular manner by which the Commonwealth is required to prove that the defendant was under the influence of a drug. Like subsection 3802(a)(1), <em>see Segida, supra </em>at 879, subsection 3802(d)(2) does not limit, constrain, or specify the type of evidence that the Commonwealth can proffer to prove its case. Given the general nature of subsection 3802(d)(2)’s prohibition, the textual similarity of subsection 3802(d)(2) to subsection 3802(a)(1), and Section 3802’s overall structure, we decline to impose a requirement for expert testimony in all prosecutions under subsection 3802(d)(2).</p>
