It is not disputed here that Appellee had a “prior <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>offense” for purposes of Section 3805, <em>i.e., </em>his 1998 DUI conviction in Florida. The only issue is whether Appellee “violated” Section 3802 for purposes of Section 3805 by virtue of his having been accepted into and having completed an ARD program to resolve his 2007 DUI charge. Largely adopting the reasoning of the trial court, the Commonwealth Court held that there was no factual basis from which to conclude that Appellee had “violated” Section 3802. <em>Whalen, supra </em>at 831. The Commonwealth Court relied on the facts that Appellee did not acknowledge violating Section 3802 in his ARD agreement and, subsequent to his completion of the ARD program, the charges were dismissed and Appellee’s arrest record was expunged. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court recognized that acceptance into an ARD program does not constitute a conviction, nor does Section 3805 statutorily equate acceptance into ARD with a conviction or violation. <em>Whalen, supra </em>at 831. Reviewing the Vehicle Code, the Commonwealth Court concluded that when the General Assembly intends to equate acceptance into ARD with a conviction or violation, it does so expressly. <em>Id. </em>(citing, as examples of the General Assembly’s expressions of intent in this regard, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1542 (considering acceptance of ARD as an offense for purposes of defining an “habitual offender”), and § 3806 (defining a “prior offense” for purposes of the DUI chapter of the Vehicle Code to include, <em>inter alia, </em>a conviction or an acceptance of ARD). Hence, to establish that a person “violated” Section 3802 for purposes of Section 3805’s ignition interlock requirement, the Commonwealth Court would require either a judicial determination of guilt, <em>e.g., </em>a conviction, or a statutory provision expressly equating acceptance into an ARD program with a conviction or violation for purposes of Section 3805.</p>

The Department argues that a person’s voluntary acceptance of ARD for a DUI offense is an <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>implicit acknowledgment that the person violated Section 3805.

ARD is not some trivial <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>mechanism for avoiding a conviction and expunging an arrest record. Rather, it is an intensive process involving personal assessments, safety classes, and addiction treatment if necessary, all under court supervision for six months to a year and all designed to rehabilitate the offender. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3807(b). Before a case is resolved via ARD, the judge must hear the facts of the case, the defendant must indicate understanding of the proceedings and agree to the conditions, and the judge must conclude that the ease warrants ARD. Pa.R.Crim. P. 313. Informing all of these proceedings must be the primary purpose of ARD, to wit, rehabilitation. If the defendant has committed no offense, rehabilitation is not necessary and ARD’s primary purpose is irrelevant. Appellee is, of course, correct in his assertion that acceptance of ARD does not involve a guilty plea. However, that assertion of fact should not be allowed to obscure the common sense observation that a defendant who actively denies that he committed a violation of law is simply not a likely or promising candidate for ARD.</p>
    <p id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[281,1285,1152,469]]]'>Our reading of the entirety of Section 3807, informed by well-established decisional law from the appellate courts of this Commonwealth and the Rules of Criminal Procedure as they apply to ARD, lead us to conclude that, for purposes of Section 3805 (the ignition interlock statute), a defendant who has accepted ARD to resolve a DUI charge is a person who has violated Section 3802. The fact that the defendant who has accepted ARD has not been convicted of that violation is neither required nor relevant for purposes of Section 3805.</p>

As Appellee points out, Section 3805 does not define “violate;” however, Section 3805 <em>does </em>provide a definition of “prior offense.” For purposes of Section 3805, “prior offense” is expressly defined, not just as a conviction, but also as acceptance of ARD. 75 75 Pa.C.S. § 3805 (citing § 3806). Therefore, as a direct result of this definition, when an offender’s first DUI offense is resolved by ARD and his second DUI offense results in conviction, the ignition interlock requirement is applicable pursuant to the plain text of Section 3805. To repeat this important point in short-hand form: acceptance of ARD (DUI offense 1), followed by conviction (DUI offense 2) triggers the ignition interlock requirement.</p>

Thus, under most circumstances, the statute does not contemplate a defendant who has a conviction for DUI offense 1, followed by an acceptance of ARD for DUI offense 2. Nonetheless, these are the precise circumstances here, because the trial court held that Appellee’s first DUI offense, which resulted in a conviction in another jurisdiction, did not preclude his eligibility for ARD. The matter of the trial court’s logic and reasoning with respect to its characterization of Appellee’s first DUI offense <em>is </em>not before us. The question that is before us concerns a situation not expressly addressed by Section 3805’s statutory scheme, to wit, whether a repeat offender who first has a conviction (DUI offense 1) and then accepts ARD (DUI offense 2) is subject to the ignition interlock requirement for restoration of his operating privileges.</p>

      <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[286,1487,1148,580]]]'>. Pursuant to Section 3807(a), there is one circumstance where a defendant might be offered ARD even though he or she had previously been found guilty of or accepted ARD for a prior DUI charge. That exception is when the defendant’s first DUI charge was for an ungraded misdemeanor under subsection 3802(a)(2), which requires a blood alcohol concentration of at least 0.08% but less than 0.10%, the lowest concentration that is addressed under the statute. Thus, a defendant previously convicted under subsection 3802(a)(2) (DUI offense 1) may be considered for ARD if he or she is subsequently charged with a second DUI offense. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3807(a)(2)(i). We discern no intent on the part of the General Assembly to exempt such an offender from the ignition interlock requirement of Section 3805 for restoration of operating privileges. Section 3805 simply refers to a violation of Section 3802, without differentiating among the subsections for different levels of blood alcohol concentration.</p>
      <p id="b136-8" data-blocks='[["BL_136.8",136,[317,2085,1117,274]]]'>One additional point is worth noting here. When a defendant whose blood alcohol concentration was less than 0.10% accepts ARD, license suspension is not a condition of ARD participation. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3807(d)(1). When there has been no license suspension, the ignition interlock statute does not come into play because ignition interlock is a condition of license restoration. If there has been no suspension, there is obviously no need for restoration.</p>

    <p id="AVe" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[512,318,193,41]]]'>dissenting.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[157,386,1154,691]]]'>I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, as I do not believe an agreement to enter Accelerated Rehabilitation Disposition (ARD) necessarily equates to admission of a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802. Here, the trial court found appellee was eligible for the ARD program after concluding the Florida charges did not constitute a prior DUI offense. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 66 n. 1, 32 A.3d at 678 n. 1 (citing Trial Court Opinion, 12/15/08, at 1-2 (citation omitted)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> Once appellee was accepted into ARD, all criminal proceedings against him were stayed, and upon successful completion of the program, the charges were dismissed and his arrest record was expunged. At no point during the criminal proceedings was appellee explicitly found to be in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802.</p>
    <p id="b137-5" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[155,1104,1153,689]]]'>Despite this, the Department of Transportation considered his acceptance of ARD as determination there was a violation of § 3802. <em>See </em>Official Notice of Suspension of Your Driving Privilege, 2/25/09 (“Before your driving privilege can be restored you are required by law to have all vehicle(s) owned by you to be equipped with an Ignition Interlock System. This is a result of your <em>conviction </em>for Driving Under the Influence.”) (emphasis added). Similarly, the majority concludes “for purposes of Section 3805 (the ignition interlock statute), a defendant who has accepted ARD to resolve a DUI charge is a person who has violated Section 3802.” Majority Op. at 76, 32 A.3d at 685. No matter how simple or salient this result, it is one with which I cannot agree.</p>
    <p id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.7",137,[154,1819,1151,312]]]'>Too often considered the equivalent of a guilty plea, ARD is a device which specifically makes a guilty plea irrelevant. Merely charging someone with committing a violation does not constitute proof there was a violation — there must be more, but ARD does not require more. If it is to become more by presumption, the statute must say so.</p>
    <p id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.8",137,[154,2157,1150,96]],["BL_138.1",138,[280,318,1150,468]]]'>ARD entry requires no admission of guilt by the accused nor proof thereof by the prosecution. Defendants facing DUI <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>charges often request ARD, to be sure, for if available, acceptance eliminates mandatory incarceration, not an insignificant consideration. ARD limits costs to both sides, addresses legitimate societal concerns such as rehabilitation, restitution, and the like, but to state that every person who enters ARD has “violated” § 3802 is just not accurate. If it is to be that entry into ARD shall be treated as a finding of guilt sufficient to require interlock, the statute would say so, but it does not.</p>
