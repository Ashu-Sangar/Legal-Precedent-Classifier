The 2006 filing did not apprise the PCRA court of <em>Miller, </em>nor did it request a determination of the <em>Atkins </em>claim. Nor was the “supplement and amendment” relevant to <em>Atkins. </em>The filing instead raised a new claim under <em>Brady v.

Attorney Ñolas stated that the PCRA court had held the 2002 <em>Atkins </em>petition “in abeyance,” awaiting the outcome of the federal <em>habeas corpus </em>cross-appeals. N.T., 9/25/07, at 12. Counsel also stated that the Third Circuit was holding the federal cross-appeals, at his request, until appellant could exhaust his new <em>Brady </em>claim in state court. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 8 (“[T]he Third Circuit ... has held the case in abeyance so this <em>[Brady] </em>issue could be resolved[.]”). Counsel then sought permission to “depose” witness Gentile. The prosecutor focused on the gate-keeping PCRA jurisdictional issue of timeliness, including the fact that the Superior Court had found a similar claim respecting the same witness, in another of <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>appellant’s criminal matters, to be time-barred. The prosecutor also argued that the deposition request was a “fishing expedition,” and noted that the PCRA required appellant to show an entitlement to an evidentiary hearing first.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[279,552,1151,797]]]'>The PCRA court focused on the time-bar jurisdictional issue and ruled that “[t]he petition is denied.” The court elaborated that it had read the parties’ pleadings, and stated: “I am denying the PCRA petition on the grounds that it is not timely and it does not meet the requirements for the <em>Brady </em>material.” Following the court’s denial of the <em>Brady </em>petition, Attorney Ñolas brought up the pending <em>Atkins </em>petition. Counsel did not request a decision on <em>Atkins, </em>which would resolve all pending issues in state court, possibly have appellant removed from death row if the <em>Atkins </em>claim succeeded, and free up the Third Circuit to pass upon the federal cross-appeals. Instead, counsel adverted to the <em>Atkins </em>petition as leverage to relitigate his request to depose Gentile, even though the court had just determined that the claim was time-barred.

Our procedural Rules contemplate that amendments to pending PCRA petitions are to be “freely allowed to achieve substantial justice.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(A). And, it is true that Rule 905 does not explicitly distinguish between initial and serial petitions. However, appellant is mistaken in arguing that Rule 905 amendments are self-authorizing, <em>i.e., </em>that a petitioner may simply “amend” a pending petition with a supplemental pleading. Rather, the Rule explicitly states that amendment is permitted only by direction or leave of the <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>PCRA court. In this case, there is no indication that appellant ever requested, or that the PCRA court ever granted, leave to amend the <em>Atkins </em>petition at all, much less to amend it to include a new and unrelated claim.

Significantly, this approach accepted the <em>Brady </em>claim precisely as Attorney Ñolas initially argued it to the PCRA court and exactly as he had presented it to the Third Circuit in securing a federal stay. Counsel said he filed the new claim within sixty days of its discovery so as to comply with the PCRA time-bar. He posed it as a separate serial claim that could and must be ruled upon, while the <em>Atkins </em>petition remained in abeyance, so that the Third Circuit could proceed with the stayed federal cross-appeals, which in turn had, according to counsel, led to the <em>Atkins </em>petition being held “in abeyance.” Counsel explicitly told the PCRA court that the Third Circuit was “waiting for Your Honor to decide on the issue pertaining to Mr. Gentile.” N.T., 9/25/07, at 14. Likewise, in securing a stay of the federal appeals, counsel told the Third Circuit that the sole purpose of returning to state court was to litigate the <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>new <em>Brady </em>claim, giving the Circuit the impression that the <em>Brady </em>claim was immediately reviewable, and that the resulting delay pending state exhaustion would be minimal.</p>

The court noted appellant’s filing of the 2002 <em>Atkins </em>petition in one paragraph. In the following paragraph, the court recounted that the <em>Brady </em>issue was forwarded in a pleading labeled a “supplemental and amended PCRA motion,” but thereafter repeatedly adverted to it simply as “the petition” or “the instant PCRA petition” without further reference to the <em>Atkins </em>petition.

In short, the PCRA court treated the <em>Brady </em>filing as a distinct collateral attack ripe for “resolution” — just as federal counsel had argued it was in both state and federal court, up until the point the court ruled against counsel, and just as counsel later treated it when he filed his Notice of Appeal and his initial brief.</p>

But, the notion that a PCRA court should hold a serial PCRA petition in abeyance while a petitioner pursues different claims on federal <em>habeas </em>review, in the lower federal courts, serves only to create unwarranted delay in capital cases. There is no reason why federal <em>habeas </em>petitions and serial state collateral petitions cannot proceed simultaneously.

Gentile also claimed he “told a woman who worked in the court” where the preliminary hearing was held that appellant was not the robber, but the unidentified woman told him that defendants always look different once they are in court and that the evidence showed that appellant was guilty of the robbery. Gentile further claimed that, once he was told that appellant was guilty of the robbery of his store, “I did whatever the prosecutor wanted,” which included his later identification testimony at appellant’s murder trial as well as the trial for the robbery of his store, even though, in his “heart,” he knew he was lying. Notably, federal counsel’s presentation of appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim to this Court quotes Gentile’s statement, but includes a bracketed interpolation: “I told a woman who worked in the court the prosecutor] that Mr. Porter was not the person____” Nothing in Gentile’s statement, or appellant’s proffer, supports counsel’s presentation, as if it were fact, that Gentile said that the “woman in court” at the preliminary hearing was the prosecutor.

The ease with which counsel’s investigator secured Gentile’s declaration corroborates that it was available upon the exercise of due diligence for a generation; and certainly could have been discovered more than sixty days prior to the filing of appellant’s <em>Brady </em>petition.

So, according to Ñolas, the PCRA court could act on neither “claim,” and counsel had already succeeded in having the federal <em>habeas </em>appeals held until the PCRA court acted on the <em>Brady </em>claim.

As reflected in Part I of this Opinion, counsel had represented to the PCRA court that the federal appeals were being held solely to allow for exhaustion of the <em>Brady </em>claim; that appellant’s <em>Atkins </em>claim was being held in state court until after the federal appeals were decided; that there was no need to decide the <em>Atkins </em>claim before the federal appeals were decided; and indeed, that counsel would object if the PCRA court passed upon the <em>Atkins </em>claim.

In a subsequent Motion seeking my recusal, Attorney Ñolas has attached a non-record letter dated August 13, 2003, from an Assistant District Attorney to the PCRA judge which, counsel says, shows that the <em>Atkins </em>petition was initially held upon the request of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth’s letter specifies two reasons to "stay further proceedings”: (1) the federal district court had recently granted penalty phase relief (on June 26, 2003), and thus the <em>Atkins </em>claim could be addressed when that new penalty hearing was held; and (2) the Pennsylvania General Assembly was then considering legislation to establish the "procedures and criteria” to determine <em>Atkins </em>claims. Three of the Commonwealth’s four substantive paragraphs in the letter concerned the second point. The Commonwealth noted the impracticality of passing upon <em>Atkins, </em>where the U.S. Supreme Court had left it up to the states to implement <em>Atkins, </em>but the General Assembly had yet to do so, and thus, there was no governing authority. The Commonwealth also noted the potential futility of the PCRA court fashioning its own manner of implementing <em>Atkins, </em>since the Legislature could opt for a different standard.</p>

Attorney Ñolas said nothing of the absence of standards for the implementation of <em>Atkins, </em>which comprised the bulk of the Commonwealth's concern. Instead, Attorney Ñolas said, the petition was held in abeyance "to see what the Third Circuit would do because if there’s no death sentence then there’s no point in us doing an <em>Atkins." </em>The Commonwealth's 2003 letter made no mention of the Third Circuit or cross-appeals; instead, it adverted to the prospect of an imminent new penalty hearing resulting from the federal trial-level ruling. In short, the Commonwealth requested that the <em>Atkins </em>petition be held for reasons other than the reason Attorney Ñolas identified to the PCRA court below; and neither of the reasons cited in the Commonwealth’s 2003 letter retained any currency after this Court’s 2005 decision in <em>Miller.</em>

While this federal action was pending, Appellant began new litigation in state court with the filing of his <em>Atkins </em>petition. Thereafter, the federal district court granted Appellant sentencing relief premised upon a finding of instructional error, relying upon the Third Circuit’s precedent construing <em>Mills v.

Maj. Op. at 515-18, 35 A.3d at 8-9.

The parties and the <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>PCRA court, however, expressed an understanding that an appeal from the denial of the <em>Brady </em>claim would not affect the trial court’s decision to hold the <em>Atkins </em>petition pending disposition of the parties’ cross-appeals to the Third Circuit.

First, the Majority reasons that amendments to pending PCRA petitions may only be permitted upon prior direction or leave of the PCRA court. Maj. Op. at 523, 35 A.3d at 12 (citing Pa.R.Crim.P. 905). Because Appellant did not request and receive leave to amend the <em>Atkins </em>petition, the Majority does not consider the <em>Brady </em>claim to be an amendment. Second, the Majority observes that the PCRA court treated the <em>Brady </em>claim as a separate petition, by virtue of its order dismissing “the petition.” The Majority proceeds to consider whether the PCRA court had the authority to dismiss the <em>Brady </em>“petition” while holding the <em>Atkins </em>petition in abeyance, and finds no impediment to such resolution.</p>

First, with respect to the procedural requirement that a petitioner who wishes to amend a pending PCRA petition must first seek and obtain leave of court, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 905, the Majority apparently views an amendment filed without prior approval by the PCRA court necessarily to be a new petition. Notably, the Commonwealth never objected to the filing of the <em>Brady </em>claim and there is no indication that the PCRA court focused on this issue. It does not follow that because Appellant did not seek permission to amend, the Commonwealth did not object to this failure, and the trial court did not recognize the procedural irregularity, that the filing is a new petition. Just as the Majority finds it obvious that the filing must be a new petition under these facts, I find it equally obvious that it was an amendment, notwithstanding <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>that the issue of leave to file escaped the parties’ and court’s attention.</p>
    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[271,438,1153,1217]]]'>Moreover, I view the record as supporting this construction. Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim was asserted through an amendment to his pending <em>Atkins </em>petition, rather than through the filing of a new petition. Appellant styled this claim as a supplement and amendment to the petition for post-conviction relief, and the on-the-record exchange reproduced in the Majority opinion demonstrates that the parties and the court treated the <em>Atkins </em>claim and the <em>Brady </em>claim as two issues rather than two petitions. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 517-20, 35 A.3d at 9-10. When the PCRA court resolved only one of the two claims before it, Appellant indicated in his notice of appeal that he was solely appealing from that order, and indicated in his jurisdictional statement that he was appealing from the order “denying (at least in part)” his PCRA petition. The PCRA court’s imprecise reference to its denial of the “petition” either comes from loose language borne from lack of recognition of the issue now before this Court or because of the trial court’s understandable uncertainty regarding the treatment of the filings before it. Additionally, the Commonwealth’s belated supplemental argument that Appellant’s attempt unilaterally to amend his petition should not be permitted rests on the premise that Appellant’s <em>Brady </em>claim arose through an attempted amendment of the pending PCRA petition.</p>

The trial court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate issues directly related to this case; only this court did.”). In my view, the logic of <em>Lark </em>is in tension with the majority’s holding herein. While it is clear that Petitioner could not have filed his <em>Brady </em>petition if the <em>Atkins </em>petition had been finally decided and appealed from, the Majority holding means that <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>so long as the trial court maintains jurisdiction, multiple claims can be presented to it in serial filings, the PCRA court can decide each individually and each can be subject to a separate appeal.

I suggest also that it is wholly inconsistent with the <em>Lark </em>decision, and the wisdom that guided that pronouncement.</p>

The portion of the <em>Porter </em>transcript I quoted then set forth the PCRA court’s of-record ruling that the petition in this case was denied “on the grounds that it is not timely and does not meet the requirements for <em>Brady </em>material.” Later in the quotation, after the PCRA court noted the next step in implementing its time-bar decision — issuing a dismissal notice under Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 — Ñolas said he would object, and the court asked Ñolas what he would suggest the court do instead. Ñolas responded that he should be permitted to depose the <em>Brady </em>witness. At that point in the <em>Spotz </em>concurrence’s quotation from the transcript in <em>Porter, </em>I inserted the following clarifying notation in brackets: “i.e., drag out the disposition of the time-barred <em>Brady </em>claim.”</p>

The bracketed reference in the <em>Spotz </em>concurrence to “the time-barred <em>Brady </em>claim,” which appeared in a block quotation from the transcript in this case, was an explanatory factual reference to the status of the <em>Brady </em>claim, as already determined by the PCRA court and reflected in the very same quoted material. The bracketed reference also noted the effect of Nolas’s argument, faced with a time-bar ruling; the argument, if accepted, would have caused further delay in a case, already delayed for years, to pursue a claim deemed time-barred. Notably, Nolas’s request to depose the witness was not an answer or challenge to the court’s time-bar ruling; it was, instead, a request that would induce delay despite the petition being deemed time-barred. My bracketed comment accurately characterized the excerpt I quoted.</p>

My concurrence in <em>Spotz </em>noted that the FCDO’s strategy of delay in cases such •as <em>Spotz </em>and <em>Porter </em>was made relevant by the FCDO’s global federal motion in yet another then-pending capital case, <em>Commonwealth v. Dougherty, </em>585 CAP. That federal motion attacked this Court’s handling of its entire capital docket, including this case, blamed the delays on this Court, and claimed that this Court was indifferent to, and incompetent to manage, its capital docket. (Notably, there has been no averment that the FCDO has corrected the scurrilous accusations in its federal motion in <em>Dougherty </em>or "withdrawn that motion.) My final point about this case in <em>Spotz </em>was to accurately note that not once did Ñolas “forward the [FCDO’s] new-found concern with delay while ensuring delay in both judicial systems in <em>Porter.” </em>18 A.3d at 348.</p>

Moreover, the FCDO’s own actions indicate that it does not subscribe to this novel theory posed by Ñolas. My discussion in <em>Spotz </em>of examples of FCDO-induced delay in capital cases was occasioned in part by the motion filed in federal court by the FCDO in <em>Dougherty, </em>which attacked the competence of this Court to manage its capital docket, while failing to acknowledge the FCDO’s central role in causing delay in many of the cases they cited.

Obviously, all courts, state and federal, should guard against such manipulation. I believe counsel's conduct in this case should be scrutinized to see if it has crossed a line from zealous advocacy to inappropriate manipulations of the court system.
