In early 2004, appellees and McCafferty were approached by Michael Mastromarino, owner of Biomedical Tissue Services, a business that sold human tissue harvested from cadavers to tissue banks for resale and medical use. Appellees and McCafferty agreed to provide cadavers from appellees’ business to Mastromarino for $1,000 each. The arrangement was undertaken without the knowledge or consent of the families of the deceased and continued through September 2005, at which point Mastromarino learned that the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) was investigating him. Mastromarino advised appellees to destroy their records, which they did by incinerating them in a crematory, just days before FDA investigators arrived.

The Commonwealth argued that imposing prosecution costs was within a trial court’s discretion.

The Commonwealth cited and quoted 16 P.S. § 1403, the “all counties” version of Section 7708.

Appellees’ attorney protested that imposing these costs after restitution to the victims’ families had already been negotiated and agreed upon as part of appellees’ plea bargain amounted to improper “double dipping.” The trial court held that, in light of the complex and time-consuming nature of the matter, prosecution costs representing ADA and detective salary hours could be assessed against appellees (roughly $90,000 per appellee).

The panel agreed with appellees that “whether [appellees] ever committed a crime, let alone [were] convicted of such, the [ADAs’] salaries were going to be paid out of the county treasury, and therefore, the salaries were not expenditures made in connection with [appellees’] prosecution.” 993 A.2d at 316-20.</p>

The panel stated that “to accept the Commonwealth’s position would, in effect, make the District Attorney’s Office operate as a private law firm using billable hours. Clearly, this was not the intent of the Legislature .... ” The panel also referenced the “American Rule,” which provides that the parties to litigation generally pay their own legal costs, and assessment of attorneys’ fees from another party is viewed as exceptional and limited to instances of contractual agreement, which was not present here, or explicit statutory authorization.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> In the panel’s view, the statutes authorizing prosecution costs may not be read so broadly as to allow recovery by the Commonwealth of regular prosecutorial personnel salaries. This was so because there was no “specific provision for a convicted defendant to pay the salaries of assistant district attorneys, whose services fall within the ambit of usual services.” According to the panel, the General Assembly could have expressly conveyed such an intention, but did not; and the panel declined to read such a requirement into the legislation. The panel reached the same conclusion with regard to the salary of the detective who worked full-time on appellees’ case. Deciding that the costs could be subtracted from the trial court’s sentence without need for remand, the panel included language to that effect in its mandate. 993 A.2d at 320-23.</p>

    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.4",546,[276,596,1151,832]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court’s ruling improperly invaded the sphere of the trial court’s discretion to order a criminal defendant to pay costs and expenses associated with prosecution. The Commonwealth critiques the Superior Court’s distinction between expenditures that are extraordinary or unbudgeted (deemed recoverable costs) and salaries paid regularly out of county treasuries (deemed non-recoverable) as flawed, illogical, and contrary to the plain language of Section 7708. The Commonwealth asserts that the statute’s plain language reflects a legislative purpose and intent to enable trial courts, within their discretion, to order recovery of county district attorneys’ investigation and prosecution personnel expenses. According to the Commonwealth, a contrary conclusion, “turns on its head the legislative intent of making the criminal, instead of the taxpayer, bear all the costs of his crime.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 12-15.</p>

The Commonwealth adds that the Superior Court’s decision contravenes basic economic realities, particularly in light of the need for public austerity: “[E]ven where a district attorney succeeds (whether by choice or necessity) in operating within an existing budget, costs— which economists call ‘opportunity costs’ — are nevertheless born[e] by the county in the form of a reduced overall ability to combat crime.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 15-16.</p>

To the Commonwealth, the Superior Court’s distinction between unbudgeted costs and costs paid regularly out of the county treasury, taken to its logical conclusion, could negate any application of the statute because “[t]he reality is that <em>all </em>prosecution expenses are born[e] by the county” and might therefore never be recoverable. The Commonwealth posits that because a statute may not be read or applied so as to negate itself, the Superior Court erred and should be reversed. Commonwealth’s Brief at 16-17.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[160,864,1154,1113]]]'>Next, the Commonwealth critiques the Superior Court’s consideration of the American Rule. The Commonwealth asserts that the American Rule should be limited to its traditional application in private civil litigation, where it serves the purpose of enabling parties to compete on a more or less level economic playing field by dictating that the penalty for a loss in court is not the double burden of paying one’s opponent’s legal bills. Instead, the Commonwealth posits, criminal prosecution has its own scheme to eliminate economic disadvantages: this balance is struck between the state, which is the injured party, and the defendant, who either pays for his own representation or may be eligible for appointed counsel at taxpayer expense. Moreover, according to the Commonwealth, permitting recovery of prosecution costs from a convicted defendant with the means to pay may serve as part of a valid sentencing scheme. As such, the Commonwealth asserts, recovery of prosecution costs, including prosecution personnel salary hours, resembles restitution, rehabilitation, and deterrence, and therefore is not comparable to damages awards in civil litigation, where the point is to make the injured party whole.

Moreover, the Commonwealth claims, assessment of costs from a criminal defendant is a matter of trial court discretion. From this premise, the Commonwealth argues that any attempt by appellees to circumvent the trial court’s sentence, <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>including its assessment of costs for ADA and detective salary-hours, should be seen as a waived claim that the trial court abused its discretion in composing appellees’ sentences. This is so, the Commonwealth argues, because appellees argued to the Superior Court only that the trial court simply lacked authority to assess costs representing ADA and detective salary hours.

Appellees note that several of the provisions in this Article have been repealed, particularly Section 7705, which provided for district attorney salaries to be paid out of the county treasury but did not express an alternative means by which salary amounts could be recovered by the Commonwealth in conjunction with criminal convictions. Despite the repeal, appellees argue that the fact that district attorney salaries and expenses were addressed in separate and distinct provisions, one of which provided for recovery in the event of criminal conviction and one of which did not, reflects a legislative intent that prosecutorial personnel salary hours were not meant to be recoverable in the same manner as the “expenses” contemplated in Section 7708.

The costs included “amounts expended [by the father] for private investigators, trying to locate his children, for legal fees, within Louisiana and Pennsylvania, and for expenses for trips to Louisiana.” The sums due, the Commonwealth notes, were deemed acceptable as a form of restitution, a condition of probation, and “a constructive alternative to imprisonment.” <em>Id. </em>at 703-07 (internal quotation marks omitted). Hence, the Commonwealth suggests, there is no reason that the sums sought from appellees cannot be viewed as both a recovery of costs and restitution.

The Commonwealth argues that the plain language of the statute encompasses salary hours expended on a given case by regular staff prosecution and investigative personnel; appellees rejoin that the statute does not mention salaries and cannot be read to include prosecution personnel salaries as “expenses,” particularly given the way in which awards of attorneys’ fees have traditionally been approached. Under the plain language of the statute, there is some facial appeal in both positions. The statute says that the “expenses” of the prosecutor, in connection with the case, shall be considered part of the “costs” and paid by the defendant, in cases where the defendant is convicted and sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution. On the one hand, the statute does not specifically identify salaries of prosecutors and detectives as “expenses” and, in the legal realm at least, there is considerable force in appellees’ position, which was accepted by the panel below, that salaries involving party opponents are viewed distinctly from other expenses, and require specific statutory authorization.

Notably, a since-repealed section of Article XII, Section 7705, directly addressed District Attorney salaries. Section 7705 provided only that a certain salary figure was to be paid to the Philadelphia District Attorney. A separate section setting forth the various levels of ADA salaries remains at 16 P.S. § 7721. The current statute addressing Philadelphia District Attorney salaries is 16 P.S. § 11011-5.1. This provision allows for a more flexible District Attorney salary scale and also prohibits the Philadelphia District Attorney from earning money from any other source, particularly from private practice. For purposes of <em>in pari materia </em>analysis, the salient point is that the General Assembly was well aware of the necessity to fund prosecutor salaries, and indeed addressed salaries distinctly, but made no express <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>provision that prosecutor salaries were recoverable or otherwise tied to actual prosecutions undertaken.

For example, the statutory provision governing “fines and penalties” that may be assessed against an individual found to have committed workers’ compensation fraud states clearly that the “prosecuting authority” successfully undertaking workers’ compensation fraud litigation may recover statutory fines beginning at $5,000: “The penalty shall be paid to the prosecuting authority to be used to defray the operating expenses of investigating and prosecuting violations of this article. The court may also award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the prosecuting authority.” 77 P.S. § 1039.11(a). This provision addresses salaries directly, distinguishes between salaries and expenses, and authorizes recovery of both. A fair number of other statutory provisions reflect the same treatment of expenses and amounts representing attorneys’ fees as different from each other, even though both may be recoverable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> No such clarity of intention is conveyed in Section 7708.</p>

Again, the statute does not expressly identify prosecution-related salaries as recoverable expenses, and the question being equivocal (at best), the narrower construction favoring appellees must prevail. We need not import the American Rule into the criminal context in order to conclude that the power to shift prosecution salary costs to the defense would have been conveyed directly, if such was the General Assembly’s intention in this instance.</p>

We are aware of no case, and the Commonwealth has cited none, where Section 7708 (or its analogues respecting other counties) has been construed to allow, as expenses, the regularly budgeted salaries of prosecutors and investigative staff. In <em>Commonwealth v. Davy, </em>this Court certainly employed broad language, stating that “it is clear that the Legislature intended to include in the costs for which a convicted person is liable the costs of all proceedings requisite for the final disposition of the case.” <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="317 A.2d 48">317 A.2d at 48</a> (construing previous version of non-first class county version of Section 7708).

Thus, the Commonwealth does not argue that the trial court’s order should be upheld for the reasons expressed by the trial court. The Commonwealth’s argument does not require an extraordinary or particularly difficult case to warrant recovery of prosecutorial salaries as expenses under Section 7708. Rather, the Commonwealth’s rule would be, if the defendant can pay, and the prosecution salary amounts are fixable, Section 7708 authorizes the trial court to order the defendant to pay those costs as “expenses.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

This precept has been addressed by the parties to the extent their arguments involve policy concerns. The Commonwealth asserts that if Section 7708 is read broadly to include prosecutorial personnel salaries, this would ensure that the “costs of crime” remain upon convicted defendants and are not drained from the public fisc. Moreover, the Commonwealth adds, such a recovery paradigm would serve the public interest: the “paying” cases could help to offset the costs of the “non-paying” ones involving indigent defendants and free up prosecutors to more effectively combat crime. Appellees counter that, if the Commonwealth’s interpretation is accepted by this Court, the criminal justice system would be radically upended by <em>post hoc </em>assessments in which courts would become subservient to the accountings of county district attorneys.

Our conclusion that Section 7708’s authorization of expenses does not include the regular salaries of prosecution personnel necessarily requires rejection of the Commonwealth’s position that the award here was proper as a matter of the trial court’s discretion, as well as its related claim that appellees waived their challenge to a discretionary sentencing decision. We also reject the Commonwealth's implication that restitution and the recovery of prosecution expenses under Section 7708 may be treated as a composite recoverable "mass.” Both are potential aspects of a criminal sentence, but they are governed by different statutory provisions. Restitution is addressed at Section 1106 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106, and Section 9728 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9728; <em>see also </em>Black's Law Dictionary 1339 (8th ed.2004) ("restitution” in criminal context is "[cjompensation for loss; esp., full or partial compensation paid by a criminal to a victim ... ordered as part of a criminal sentence or as a condition of probation."). Section 7708, however, is part of the "District Attorneys” sections of the Counties Code. 16 P.S. § 7708. The two are similar, but not equivalent. Moreover, appellees note correctly that their sentences already include significant sums of restitution to the decedents’ families, and appellees have also been ordered to reimburse the Commonwealth for thousands of dollars representing traditional "prosecution costs" that they do not dispute: travel and expert fees for witnesses, graphics and exhibit scanning and production, bank and real estate searches and reports, reproduction of death certificates, bank records, medical records, and so forth. But the regular salaries of staff ADAs and detectives, which we have already held are not recoverable under Section 7708, are not restitution either, even under the legal construct that the state, "as the representative for society as a whole,” acts as the injured party in criminal matters. <em>In re Hickson, </em><a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="573 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="197205" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01">573 Pa. 127</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="821 A.2d 1238" data-case-ids="197205,9141182" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0127-01,/a2d/821/1238-01">821 A.2d 1238</a>, 1244 (2003).</p>
