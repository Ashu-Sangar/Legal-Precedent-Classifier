Wachovia is the corporate successor to Fidelity; Mr. Goldsmith died in 1952 and was eventually replaced by Bruce Taylor as the individual trustee. As a result of Mr. Taylor’s death, Wachovia filed the third account of the Fridenberg trust January 12, 2006, detailing the trust activities from the close of the second accounting in 1978 to March 16, 2005, the day of Mr. Taylor’s death. The accounting also included requests for commissions to be paid out of principal for Wachovia and Mr. Taylor. The Attorney General objected to this request, arguing the law in effect at the time the trust was created prevented parties who served as both executors and trustees under a will from receiving more than one commission from principal.

In <em>Williamson’s Estate, </em>the testatrix appointed a corporate fiduciary as both a trustee and co-executor in her will. She died February 15, 1930; later that year, the corporate fiduciary received a commission from principal for its services as an executor. After the death of a trust beneficiary, the corporate fiduciary also requested a commission from principal for its services as a trustee. At that time, we stated the corporate fiduciary was “seeking to induce this Court to overrule a long line of cases extending for over a century and a half which established principles of fiduciary compensation.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="82 A.2d 49">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%2049" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="82 A.2d 49">at 50</a>.

In <em>Scott’s Estate, </em>the testator died in 1940, leaving the residue of his estate to certain trustees for life, and then to a children’s hospital. The executors received a commission from principal in 1941 for their services. Upon the death of the last remaining life tenant, an account was filed, and the auditing judge approved $20,000 in additional compensation to the remaining trustees from the principal. The remainder-man challenged the award, and the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County refused to allow the additional compensation from principal. On appeal, the appellants argued the portion of <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>which prohibited the retroactive application of the Act of April 10, 1945 was <em>dictum </em>and should be overruled. This Court acknowledged, “[njeither the appellants nor the appellee nor the Judges of the Orphans’ Court agree as to <em>exactly </em>what <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>decided, and what parts thereof were dicta and should not be followed, or in any event should be overruled.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20429" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="211 A.2d 429">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20429" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="211 A.2d 429">at 431</a> (emphasis in original). Regardless of whether it was <em>dictum, </em>this Court held <em>Williamson’s </em>Estate’s rationale was persuasive. <em><a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20429" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="211 A.2d 429">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=211%20A.2d%20429" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="211 A.2d 429">at 432</a>. We noted the corporate trustee accepted the initial commission for its services as executor, and the law at that time made it clear that was to be deemed full compensation for services as a trustee as well; the Act of 1953, like the Act of 1945, did not change this. In reaching this holding, we stated:</p>

However, all the parties concerned, including the present corporate fiduciary and the individual fiduciaries and the beneficiaries, knowingly took this chance — they all knew that the Statute (Act of 1917) clearly and unambiguously fixed the present and future rights of all executors-trustees to a single commission on principal, which such fiduciaries received and agreed to accept as full compensation for their combined executor and trustee fiduciary services, past, present and future.</blockquote>

In <em>Ehret’s Estate, </em>the testator died February 17, 1913; in his will, among other bequests, he created a trust for the benefit of his children. A corporate fiduciary was later appointed as substitute trustee; it did not serve as an executor and had not received any commission at the time of its appointment. The corporate fiduciary filed an accounting, seeking an interim commission from principal for its services. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>objected to the commission, and the auditing judge refused the payment in the accounting. On appeal, the issue before this Court was “whether a trustee under a testamentary trust created prior to 1945, which was not an executor, may receive for its ordinary services as trustee an <em>interim </em>commission on principal.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20414" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="235 A.2d 414">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20414" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="235 A.2d 414">at 416</a> (emphasis in original). After discussing and extensively quoting <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>and <em>Scott’s Estate, </em>this Court distinguished those cases; unlike <em>Ehret’s Estate, </em>those trustees also served as executors and were seeking double commissions. We also noted, while <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>held retroactively allowing double commissions would be unconstitutional, it “did not decide or preclude as Unconstitutional the retroactive modification of the interim commission rule, since this does not involve additional compensation but merely the time for payment.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20414" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="235 A.2d 414">Id., </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20414" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="235 A.2d 414">at 420</a> (emphasis removed).

The Attorney General maintains in order for such a retroactive application to be constitutional, it must be reasonable and justified by a rational legislative purpose. The Attorney General argues the legislation in question is neither rational nor reasonable because: its retroactive application would abandon long-settled principles re<a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>garding trustee payment; the legislation does not limit the period for retroactive application; it is uncertain whether trustees’ duties have changed as a result of changes in the law related to trust administration; trustees have the ability to request additional money from the courts for extraordinary services; and it is contrary to the public’s interest in receiving the benefits of the charitable trust for as long as possible.</p>

The Attorney General suggests when a settlor selects a trustee and the trustee agrees to provide services for a fee, a contract is formed, "with the beneficiaries of the trust as third party beneficiaries and the law in effect at the time incorporated into its terms. Here, the law in effect at the time the will was drafted, and when the trust was accepted by Wachovia, prohibited more than one commission from principal. Therefore, the Attorney General claims any retroactive application of the laws allowing more than one commission from principal would violate the Contracts Clause because it would impair the beneficiaries’ rights under the contract — the beneficiaries only expected one commission from principal would be paid to the trustee, and any additional payments not originally contemplated would reduce the funds available to them. The Attorney General goes on to suggest such an impairment of contract rights is unconstitutional, as it is unreasonable and there is no legitimate public purpose for it. Specifically, the Attorney General argues there is no special urgency for the government to interfere with contracts, and a retroactive allowance of dual commissions only benefits a private interest, mainly corporate fiduciaries, not the public interest.</p>

It also notes the due process issue should be examined using federal due process law as it exists today, not at the time of <em>Williamson’s Estate. </em>It explains the modern due process analysis of retroactivity issues began in 1976 with the United States Supreme Court case of <em>Usery v.

Because of this change, and the fact that <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>only addressed the 1945 legislation, Wachovia claims the Attorney General’s reliance on <em>stare decisis </em>is erroneous. Furthermore, Wachovia argues a retroactive application does not offend the Due Process Clause because a trust beneficiary does not have a vested interest in the trust and, given the drastic changes in the duties of a trustee, there is a rational <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>basis for the Legislature to alter any interest a beneficiary has in the trust.</p>

Although these Acts had a similar purpose, they are still different laws, and this fact alone suggests <em>Williamson’s Estate </em>does not automatically control our decision in this case. Furthermore, we note “the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is not a vehicle for perpetuating error, but rather a legal concept which responds to the demands of justice and, thus, permits the orderly growth processes of the law to flourish.” <em>Ayala v.

    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[171,1378,1154,850]]]'>Here, the Legislature’s purpose in allowing more than one commission from principal was to ensure trustees received reasonable compensation for their services. As detailed above, the responsibilities of trustees have changed drastically since the creation of the Fridenberg trust. At the time of its formation, trustees, in order to meet their legal duties, merely had to choose an investment from a legislatively-created list, then sit back and clip coupons. Since then, the legal list has been abandoned, and trustees must now rely on their own discretion and exercise ongoing discretion in determining what investments should be undertaken. The extinction of legal lists alone would likely be enough to justify a change in trustee compensation; combined with the many other changes to the trustee landscape since 1940, the Legislature had a legitimate purpose in retroactively allowing additional trustee compensation from principal.</p>

It would make no sense to allow trustees administering trusts after February 18, 1982 to receive more than one commission from principal, but not trustees administering trusts created before February 18, 1982. <em>See Bible, </em>at 1156 (holding retroactive application was rational means of implementing legitimate legislative purpose because, if legislation was only prospective, certain claimants would obtain advantage over others based on timing alone). The trustees for both of those trusts have the same responsibilities, and they should be compensated similarly, not arbitrarily.
