In general, the plan must describe “existing sewage disposal methods, take into consideration existing plans for population growth and land development, [and] provide for future needs by specifying plans for sewage treatment facilities that will adequately prevent the discharge of untreated or inadequately treated sewage or other waste into any waters.” <em>Delaware Riverkeeper v.

The Plan provided for public sewers to be constructed from the Village of Pogue to Rockhill Furnace Borough and for construction of a treatment facility. Implementation of the Township sewage collection and treatment system involved the: 1) acquisition of several million dollars of financing; 2) creation of numerous easements; 3) passage of multiple ordinances; and 4) advertising, opening, and awarding of construction bids. Although various sewage disposal problems existed, Township concluded the Plan was <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>too expensive to implement. Thus, despite requesting several extensions that DEP granted, Township failed to implement the Plan. On May 24, 2002, DEP ordered Township to implement its August 2000 Act 537 Plan. This order was not appealed.</p>

In January 2005, the Orbisonia Rockhill Joint Municipal Authority (“ORJMA”), an authority organized pursuant to the Municipalities Authorities Act, 53 Pa.C.S. § 5601 <em>et seq., </em>operated the public sewage system for residents of both boroughs. At that time, ORJMA was experiencing an overload in its wastewater treatment plant; concurrently, Township was endeavoring to execute its Plan because DEP was threatening to impose a daily penalty for failure to do so. Township Board of Supervisors (“Board”) Chairman Ted Whitsel approached ORJMA and proposed a joint venture that would increase the capacity of ORJMA’s plant and, simultaneously, decrease the anticipated cost to Township residents for their sewage treatment.</p>
    <p id="b64-5" data-blocks='[["BL_64.5",64,[290,1471,1152,643]]]'>ORJMA pursued a feasibility study in August 2005. Following public meetings in the ensuing weeks, Township executed a sewage treatment agreement (“Agreement”) with ORJMA on November 15, 2005. One month later, Township amended the Plan to implement that Agreement, which it then submitted to DEP. On January 12, 2006, DEP approved the Plan’s amendment. Concurrently, however, membership of the Township’s Board changed when David Booher, who openly opposed the Plan, was elected to a six-year term and Lewis Fleck, who was appointed to fill a vacancy, joined the Board. Chairman Whitsel resigned as a supervisor in December 2005, and it appears he was replaced by Howard Clark.</p>

Over the ensuing seven and one-half months, when Township failed to comply with the Commonwealth Court’s January 22, 2008 order as well, DEP filed a petition for contempt on August 11, 2008. DEP requested that the Commonwealth Court 1) impose a daily $300 fine against Township and each supervisor until Township complied with the January 22, 2008 order, retroactive to June 1, 2008; 2) award DEP costs and attorneys’ fees; and 3) set a timeline of conditions for Township to purge its contempt. DEP Contempt Petition, 8/11/08, at 6. Township filed an answer on September 12,2008.

The Commonwealth Court directed all members of the Board to appear for sentencing on December 4, 2008. With regard to the ability of Board members to purge themselves of contempt, the Commonwealth Court instructed that it would “consider efforts to comply with the terms of the Court’s order dated January 22, 2008.” Order, 9/16/08, at 1-2.</p>

Quigley sentenced David Booher, Lewis Fleck, and Howard Clark to undergo three to six months imprisonment, but he delayed their incarceration.

Nevertheless, in the face of those presented here, I, for one, am certainly willing to reconsider the decision’s appropriate parameters and/or continuing viability. Notably, commentators have identified the strong conceptual difficulties with treating enforcement proceedings in which an agency is seeking non-statutory, judicial redress as appellate jurisdiction matters:</p>
    <blockquote id="b89-4" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[199,969,1117,461]]]'>The supreme court has not yet identified ... the order that is appealed to the commonwealth court, when the appeal period begins, how the “appellant” agency is aggrieved by its own order and thus has standing to appeal, or what the commonwealth court’s scope and standard of review are.

In the absence of such prescription, where, as here, an agency has averred that it is without an adequate remedy at law and seeks non-statutory remedies to enforce its own directives from a court of law, the only conceptually stable conclusion is that the court’s original jurisdiction is implicated. At the very least, when the agency seeks additional remedies against members of a governing body as “individuals],” Petition for Contempt, R.R. at 7a, either original jurisdiction must be recognized or the agency’s effort must be regarded as an impermissible attempt to join additional parties on the “appeal.” <em>See PHRC, <a href="/pa/557/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="557 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="56857,56891" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0126-01,/pa/557/0126-02">557 </a></em><a href="/pa/557/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="557 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="56857,56891" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0126-01,/pa/557/0126-02">Pa. at 132</a>, <a href="/a2d/732/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="732 A.2d 578" data-case-ids="11549290,56891" data-case-paths="/a2d/732/0578-01,/pa/557/0126-02">732 A.2d at 581</a> (“The <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>parties to an enforcement proceeding are limited to the parties before the administrative agency.”).
