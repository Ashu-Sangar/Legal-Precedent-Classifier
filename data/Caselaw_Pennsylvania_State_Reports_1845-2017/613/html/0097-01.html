This is manifested in the opening sentence of Section 9542 of the PCRA, or its “Scope of subchapter” provision. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 (“This subchapter provides for an action by which persons convicted of crimes they did not commit and persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief.”). As it pertains more specifically to attorney ineffectiveness, the Legislature’s concern with safeguarding the innocent can be gleaned from the prejudice requirement reposited within Section 9543 — entitled “Eligibility for relief’ — which sets forth the material requirements for redress. <em><a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 9543(a)(2)(h) (conditioning the availability of statutory post-conviction relief on proof that ineffectiveness “so under<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>mined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place”).</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[278,434,1150,519]]]'>The main issue in the <em>Lantzy </em>line of decisions was whether Section 9543(a)(2)(ii)’s prejudice element universally required PCRA petitioners specifically to establish unreliability in the truth-determining process in guilt adjudication as a threshold to relief. <em>See Lantzy I, </em><a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">712 A.2d at 289, 291</a>.

Additionally, the majority opined that other avenues were available to vindicate a defendant’s rights where he was unable to establish innocence, for example, the conferral of <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief. <em>See <a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">id.</a></em>

According to the <em>Lantzy I </em>dissent, the majority’s recognition of alternate avenues for collateral relief — made necessary by its narrow construction of Section 9543(a)(2)(ii) — directly contravened the statute’s “sole means” mandate. <em>See <a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">at 299-301</a>. In particular, the dissent viewed the majority’s approach as removing a wide category of post-conviction claims from the ambit of the PCRA, thus thwarting the General Assembly’s objective of channeling the widest possible range of collateral review through the orderly, controlled process it had designed. <em>See <a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">id.</a> </em>In this regard, President Judge McEwen observed that, short of a constitutional amendment, the Legislature could not foreclose habeas corpus review. <em>See <a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">id.</a> </em>at 300 (citing Pa.

Finally, the dissent touched on the concepts of structural error and presumed prejudice and provided authority for the proposition that the failure to file a requested direct appeal thwarts the truth-determining process and, thus, meets Section 9543(a)(2)(ii)’s prejudice requirement in any event. <em>See <a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/712/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="712 A.2d 288" data-case-ids="11810098" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0288-01">at 296-99</a>.</p>

Nevertheless, the salient analysis equally pertains to Section 9542, particularly since Section 9542’s own sole-means provision has always served as the linchpin of the dispositive rationale. <em>See, e.g., Lantzy II, </em><a href="/pa/558/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="558 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="838560" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0214-01">558 Pa. at 222-23</a>, <a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">736 A.2d at 569</a>. Indeed, as a matter of statutory construction, the task of reconciling the tension between Section 9542’s internal innocence-illegality and sole-means provisos is a far simpler matter than the - consideration of Section 9543(a)(2)(ii)’s prejudice term, as was necessary in the <em>Lantzy </em>decisions. In this regard, the Legislature has specified (subject to limited exception not applicable here): “[Wjhenever, in the same statute, several clauses are irreconcilable, the clause <em>last in order </em>o/date or <em>position </em>shall prevail.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1934 (emphasis added). In Section 9542, the sole-means term is last in order of position; accordingly, it should predominate,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> particularly in the absence of any substantive argument why this is unreasonable.</p>

Rather, as Appellee and <em>amicus </em>observe, the parties presented conflicting evidence on the subject and the PCRA court made no factual finding. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth cannot rely on a credibility judgment which does not exist, apparently because it was thwarted when the PCRA court was led to overlook the PCRA’s sole-means proviso and <em>Lantzy II. </em>Thus, per the Superior Court’s directive, the matter is to be returned to that court for the necessary factual assessment.</p>
