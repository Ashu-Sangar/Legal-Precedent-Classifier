After these modifications, the plant experienced multiple “burn-through” incidents, meaning that molten steel burned through the firebrick lining and shell wall of a furnace. In each instance, the molten steel escaping from the furnace ruptured nearby water lines, causing a steam explosion. The explosion, in turn, caused steam and debris to spew onto the pouring platform where furnace operators were working. During one such incident, a worker escaped from the pouring platform via an “access drawbridge” connecting the platform with other parts of the facility. PA Partners eventually removed the drawbridge to improve operation of the plant’s overhead cranes. It did not, however, take steps either to provide an alternate means of escape from the platform, or to shield the water lines from damage in the event of a burn-through.</p>

Notably, the mill’s physical plant was not substantially altered, meaning that the access drawbridge was not replaced and the water lines remained unshielded.</p>

The court held that Appellants had failed, in their complaints, to set forth a legally sufficient cause of action under Section 385. In reaching this holding, the court initially observed that, at the time of the alleged negligence, PA Partners was the possessor of the property, and that PA Partners eventually became the property’s vendor. The court found these factors significant because Section 385 appears in a portion of the restatement entitled, “Liability of Persons <em>Other Than </em>a Possessor, Vendor, or Lessor.” <em><a href="/a2d/989/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="989 A.2d 344" data-case-ids="7290778" data-case-paths="/a2d/989/0344-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/989/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="989 A.2d 344" data-case-ids="7290778" data-case-paths="/a2d/989/0344-01">at 348</a> (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts, Division 2, Chapter 13, Topic 8 (1965)) (emphasis added by Superior Court).

The court made express reference to Section 388 of the Restatement, which relates to chattels known to be dangerous for their intended use, and provides that a supplier of such a chattel may only be held liable if the supplier “has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition.” <em><a href="/a2d/989/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="989 A.2d 344" data-case-ids="7290778" data-case-paths="/a2d/989/0344-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/989/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="989 A.2d 344" data-case-ids="7290778" data-case-paths="/a2d/989/0344-01">at 350</a> (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 388 (1965)).

As the liability of a servant or an independent contractor who erects a structure upon land or otherwise changes its physical condition is determined by the same rules as those which determine the liability of a manufacturer of a chattel, it follows that such a servant or contractor who turns over the land <em>with knowledge that his work has made it dangerous in a manner unlikely to be discovered by the possessor </em>is subject to liability both to the possessor, and to those who come upon the land with the consent of the possessor or who are likely to be in its vicinity.</blockquote>

The term “on behalf of’ means that the servant or contractor who makes the alteration does so for the possessor’s benefit and by his authority. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>Torts § 383, cmt. a (1965), <em>incorporated by </em>Restatement (Second) Torts § 385 cmt. b (1965). It would be unreasonable to attenuate the plain import of this definition to cover a situation where the possessor acts on his own behalf, particularly in view of the portion of Section 385 referencing the acceptance by the possessor of the work performed by the contractor or servant. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Torts § 385 (1965) (reflecting that liability only exists “after [the employee’s or contractor’s] work has been accepted by the possessor”); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) Torts § 385 cmt. d (1965) (“When the work is completed and accepted by the possessor, <em>the servant’s or contractor’s connection with the land ceases, </em>just as a repairman loses possession of a chattel which is entrusted to him for repair when he returns it to its owner.” (emphasis added)). Additionally, as the Superior Court recognized, the portion of the Restatement in which Section 385 appears pertains to entities “other than” a possessor or vendor of land. We therefore find merit in PA Partners’ position that Section 385 contemplates two distinct entities — a possessor, and a person acting on the possessor’s behalf — and only pertains to the potential liability of the latter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The cause of action on which summary judgment was granted was asserted pursuant to Section 353 of the Second Restatement. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Torts § 353 (1965) (relating to undisclosed dangerous conditions known to a vendor). The common pleas court observed that one prerequisite to Section 353 liability is that the seller is aware, or should realize, that the buyer will not discover the dangerous condition or understand its risk. The court held that this condition was not met because; (1) PA Partners was aware that the plant's workforce, including its senior management, would remain in place after the sale; and (2) under agency law precepts, the knowledge of agents (here, the plant’s employees) may be imputed to the principal (here, FMS). <em>See Beltowski v.

In any event, such theory has been applied in limited circumstances, most notably, in the workers’ compensation arena.
