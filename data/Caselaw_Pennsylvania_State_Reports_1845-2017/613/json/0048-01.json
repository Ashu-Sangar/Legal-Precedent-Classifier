        "text": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nIn this case, we interpret a provision of the Pennsylvania Divorce Code to establish when a cause of action in negligence accrues for purposes of determining whether the settlement proceeds are marital property. Because the Superior Court erred in its interpretation of the relevant statutory provision, we reverse.\nOn April 1, 1999, Justin E. Focht (hereinafter \u201cAppellee\u201d) sustained a serious injury in an accident at the Family Grand Prix Raceway (hereinafter \u201cRaceway\u201d) in Leesport, PA. Approximately two weeks later, Appellee and his then-wife Tracy L. Focht (hereinafter \u201cAppellant\u201d) retained an attorney to represent them in their respective claims of personal injury and loss of consortium. The Fochts filed suit against the Raceway on September 8, 2000, and the case was settled on November 23, 2004, for a total of $410,000. After payment of attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses, Appellee and Appellant received, respectively, $231,618 and $14,784 from the settlement.\nBetween the dates of the accident and the settlement, specifically on August 1, 2001, the parties separated by mutual consent. Appellee filed a divorce complaint in February 2004, and a divorce decree was entered on January 23, 2009.\nDuring the first year after the settlement of his personal injury suit, by which time the Fochts had separated, Appellee spent his entire portion of the settlement proceeds. He expended some of the proceeds for the purchase of a residence, and then shortly after this purchase, he used the residence to secure a mortgage. Subsequently, when Appellee ceased making mortgage payments, foreclosure proceedings were commenced against him. Pursuant to an agreement with the mortgagee, Appellee sold the residence in 2007 to avoid foreclosure. After payment of the settlement charges, mortgage, taxes, attorney\u2019s fees, and expenses for repairs, Appellee recovered only $60,206 from the sale of the residence. This sum of money is the focus of the instant dispute.\nDuring the parties\u2019 lengthy divorce proceedings, it became apparent that the only asset involved was the settlement award from the lawsuit. The special master assigned to the parties\u2019 divorce case determined that all of the settlement proceeds were marital property, subject to equitable distribution. The special master further concluded that Appellant and Appellee were entitled to, respectively, 25% and 75% of the settlement proceeds. Based on this conclusion and after determining the amount that each party had already received, the master calculated that, of the $60,206 that remained from the settlement proceeds, Appellant was entitled to $44,617 and Appellee was entitled to $15,589. The trial court affirmed the decision of the special master.\nThe parties cross-appealed the equitable distribution order to the Superior Court. Based on its conclusion that the trial court had erred by including the settlement proceeds in the marital estate, the Superior Court vacated the equitable distribution order. Focht v. Focht, 990 A.2d 59 (Pa.Super.2009) (Table). As its rationale for this decision, the Superior Court relied solely on the fact that settlement in the negligence suit had been reached after the parties\u2019 final separation.\nAppellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal in this Court, asserting that the Superior Court\u2019s determination conflicted with this Court\u2019s precedential decision in Drake v. Drake, 555 Pa. 481, 725 A.2d 717, 722 (1999). We granted Appellant\u2019s petition to consider when a cause of action or claim accrues for purposes of determining whether it is marital property pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a)(8). Focht v. Focht, 606 Pa. 505,1 A.3d 867 (2010).\nThe definition of marital property is set forth in the Divorce Code. The issue before us involves the interpretation of this statutory definition, which, like all statutory interpretation, is a pure question of law. Accordingly, our standard of review is de novo and our scope is plenary. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Center v. Department of Public Welfare, 600 Pa. 131, 963 A.2d 1274, 1276 (2009). The object of all statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly, giving effect, if possible, to all provisions of the statute. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). In general, the best indication of legislative intent is the plain language of a statute. Malt Beverages Distributors Ass\u2019n v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, 601 Pa. 449, 974 A.2d 1144, 1149 (2009). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). Words of the statute are to be construed according to their \u201ccommon and approved usage; but technical words and phrases and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning ... shall be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning....\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\nThe statutory definition of marital property is broad, encompassing \u201call property acquired by either party during the marriage.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a). The statute presumes that property acquired during the marriage is \u201cmarital.\u201d Drake v. Drake, 555 Pa. 481, 725 A.2d 717, 722 (1999). However, there are eight exceptions to this presumption, which set forth classifications of property that are not considered \u201cmarital,\u201d including the following:\n[Mjarital property does not include:\n(1) Property acquired prior to marriage....\n* *\n(4) Property acquired after final separation until the date of divorce....\n(8) Any payment received as a result of an award or settlement for any cause of action or claim which accrued prior to the marriage or after the date of final separation regardless of when the payment was received.\n23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a) (emphasis added).\nWith regard to subsection 3501(a)(8), interpretation hinges on the meaning of the word \u201caccrue.\u201d There is no statutory definition of accrue. A general legal definition is the following:\nTo come into existence as an enforceable claim or right; to arise <the plaintiffs cause of action for silicosis did not accrue until the plaintiff knew or had reason to know of the disease >.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary, 8th Ed. (2004).\nThe above legal dictionary definition is consistent with this Court\u2019s long-established, historical understanding, as expressed in Bell v. Brady, 346 Pa. 666, 31 A.2d 547, 549 (1943), a case involving application of the statute of limitations, that \u201ca cause of action accrues only when one has the right to institute a suit.\u201d (Emphasis added). Reiterating the same basic principle, this Court has very recently stated that, \u201c[generally, a statute of limitations period begins to run when a cause of action accrues; i.e., when an injury is inflicted and the corresponding right to institute a suit for damages arises.\u201d Gleason v. Borough of Moosic, 15 A.3d 479, 484 (Pa.2011) (emphasis added).\nWe have explained these well-settled principles in more detail as follows:\nThe Judicial Code provides in pertinent part that limitations periods are computed from the time the cause of action accrued. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a). In Pennsylvania, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff could have first maintained the action to a successful conclusion. Thus, we have stated that the statute of limitations begins to run as soon as the right to institute and maintain a suit arises. Generally speaking, in a suit to recover damages for personal injuries, this right arises when the injury is inflicted..... Once a cause of action has accrued and the prescribed statutory period has run, an injured party is barred from bringing his cause of action.\nFine v. Checcio, 582 Pa. 253, 870 A.2d 850, 857 (2005) (emphases added); see also Wilson v. El-Daief 600 Pa. 161, 964 A.2d 354, 361 (2009) (citing Fine, supra, as reflective of \u201cthe general rule that a cause of action accrues, and thus the applicable limitations period begins to run, when an injury is inflicted\u201d) (emphasis added).\nSubsection 3501(a)(8) must be interpreted in the context of this well-established understanding of the concept of accrual of a cause of action. Thus, when a cause of action accrues (i.e., when an injury has been inflicted, leading to the right to institute and pursue a suit for damages) after the date of marriage and before the date of final separation, then any settlement proceeds resolving that cause of action are marital property, regardless of when the settlement actually occurs. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a)(8). Although the statute does not explicitly mention causes of action or claims that accrue during a marriage, prior cases from this Court or the Superior Court have addressed such circumstances.\nIn Drake, supra, the contested proceeds comprised a commutation award in a workers\u2019 compensation claim, and the question was whether the award was marital property pursuant to subsection 3501(a)(8). The Drake parties were married when, in July 1985, husband sustained a work-related injury. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation petition shortly thereafter and began receiving biweekly benefits. In April 1988, his status changed to partial disability, but he continued to receive benefits until December 7, 1989, when his benefits were terminated. Then, in October 1990, husband and his employer entered a supplemental, commutation agreement, under which husband would receive a single, lump-sum award to compensate him fully for eight and one-half years of partial disability, beginning on December 7, 1989, the agreed-upon effective date of his partial disability. Id. at 719. Approximately three years after husband entered into the commutation agreement, he and his wife separated, and Mrs. Drake filed a complaint in divorce. The appointed master concluded, and the court of common pleas agreed, that the commutation award was marital property because it was received during the marriage and was reimbursement for lost wages. Id. at 720. The Superior Court affirmed, and we granted husband\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nIn reviewing the lower courts\u2019 holdings, this Court first recognized the wide breadth of subsection 3501(a)(8)\u2019s applicability, as follows:\nThe Divorce Code at Section 3501(a)(8) makes no distinction concerning the purpose of the award or settlement, but posits that it applies equally to all claims or causes of action for personal injury, lost wages, disability or other damage .... it is irrelevant that the settlement or award is for disability payments, personal injuries, lost wages, or future earnings. We look only to the timing of the right to receive [the award or settlement].\nThe critical question is ... whether the right to seek a commutation of [husband\u2019s] earnings accrued during the marriage.\nDrake, supra at 725-26 (emphases added).\nReviewing the sequence of events, see supra, we further concluded that \u201cas of December 7, 1989, [h]usband certainly had an enforceable right to this lump sum commutation award, and [h]usband\u2019s claim \u2018accrued,\u2019 as that term is used in the Divorce Code, well before the parties separated in July of 1993.\u201d Id. Because husband\u2019s claim accrued during the marriage, before the parties separated, the award was marital property. Id.\nIt is important to recognize the significance of our determination that the Drake husband\u2019s claim had accrued as of the effective date of his partial disability, to wit, December 7, 1989. As of this date, husband had not actually been granted a commutation award, and indeed husband and his employer had not yet entered into any agreement regarding any compensation for his partial disability. It was not until October 1990 that husband and his employer entered into the commutation agreement, pursuant to which the effective date of husband\u2019s partial disability was agreed to have been in the prior year. We concluded that husband\u2019s claim \u201caccrued\u201d not when the commutation agreement was entered and the commutation award was actually granted, but rather as of the effective date of husband\u2019s partial disability, which is when his right to seek commutation of his earnings arose. Id. Although Drake involved a workers\u2019 compensation claim, not a cause of action in tort, our interpretation of when the Drake husband\u2019s claim accrued for purposes of subsection 3501(a)(8) was consistent with our well-established understanding of the concept of accrual of a cause of action, as discussed supra. Furthermore, our conclusion that the award was marital property was grounded in subsection 3501(a)(8) and based on the determination that husband\u2019s claim accrued while the parties were married, before they finally separated.\nIn Nuhfer v. Nuhfer, 410 Pa.Super. 380, 599 A.2d 1348 (1991), the question before the Superior Court was at what point in time an ownership interest in a winning lottery ticket accrued. During the Nuhfer parties\u2019 marriage, the husband had participated in an office lottery pool. When one of his coworkers filed a winning ticket with the Pennsylvania Lottery Bureau and claimed ownership, litigation ensued to determine whether the co-worker or the office pool was the rightful owner of the ticket. The suit over the lottery ticket settled after the final separation of the Nuhfers. Id. at 1349. The Superior Court concluded that husband\u2019s claim had accrued when he had contributed to the purchase price of the lottery ticket, at which time he was married and not finally separated. Therefore, based on a prior version of subsection 3501(a)(8), the court held that the settlement proceeds were marital property, even though settlement had been reached and the claim had been liquidated after the parties had divorced. Id. at 1350.\nThus, although the facts of Nuhfer and Drake were quite different, the holdings by the Superior Court and this Court, respectively, were consistent: an award or settlement arising from a cause of action or claim that accrued during the marriage of the parties, before final separation, is marital property subject to equitable distribution.\nWe now apply these principles to the case before us. Appellant contends that the Superior Court misconstrued the plain text of subsection 3501(a)(8), particularly with respect to the concept of accrual. Appellant argues that Appellee\u2019s personal injury cause of action accrued on the date of the accident, or at the latest two weeks later when he retained counsel, because by that time Appellee was fully and completely aware of his injuries and the Raceway\u2019s negligent conduct. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10. In contrast, Appellee contends that his personal injury claim did not accrue until the date of settlement, which was the first time that he was actually entitled to the settlement proceeds. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 15-18. Appellee insists that a personal injury claim \u201cunliquidated\u201d by verdict or settlement cannot be subject to equitable distribution and, indeed, cannot even be property, much less marital property. Id. at 17-19. Like Appellee, the Superior Court incorrectly focused on the date of settlement of Appellee\u2019s cause of action, in essence concluding that Appellee\u2019s cause of action did not \u201caccrue\u201d until a settlement had been reached. In the Superior Court\u2019s view, because the parties had separated by the time of settlement, the proceeds were not marital property, even though the injury had occurred and litigation had been initiated prior to the parties\u2019 final separation.\nThe decision advocated by Appellee and reached by the Superior Court is untenable in light of the plain language of subsection 3501(a)(8); our long-established understanding of the concept of accrual of a cause of action; and this Court\u2019s and the Superior Court\u2019s decisions in, respectively, Drake and Nuhfer. Paraphrasing Drake, the \u201ccritical question\u201d here is whether Appellee\u2019s right to seek damages for personal injury by filing a negligence suit accrued during his marriage, not whether his suit was settled during his marriage. See id. at 726. Appellee errs by conflating two very different concepts: accrual of a cause of action and settlement of a cause of action. By the explicit text of subsection 3501(a)(8), the date of accrual of a cause of action is the only date of relevance.\nThere is no question that Appellee\u2019s cause of action in negligence accrued during his marriage: the accident in which Appellee was injured occurred during his marriage, and he became aware of his serious injuries and of the Raceway\u2019s negligence during his marriage, as shown by the fact that he retained counsel and filed suit against the Raceway during his marriage. See Notes of Testimony, 12/12/07, at 34-35. All of these events occurred one to two years before the parties\u2019 final separation. Thus, because Appellee\u2019s cause of action accrued during the marriage, before the parties\u2019 final separation, proceeds from the settlement of the suit are marital property. The marital property exception set forth in subsection 3501(a)(8) does not apply, and it is irrelevant that the parties had finally separated by the time the suit settled and the settlement award was liquidated. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nFinally, we recognize that some prior opinions from the Superior Court concerning subsection 3501(a)(8) have not been consistent with our holding here, nor with Drake and Nuhfer. In the present case, the Superior Court reached its erroneous holding primarily by relying on Pudlish v. Pudlish, 796 A.2d 346 (Pa.Super.2002), another case involving a workers\u2019 compensation claim in the context of subsection 3501(a)(8). In Pudlish, husband sustained a work-related injury during the marriage, but his employer denied his workers\u2019 compensation claim, leading to nearly two years of litigation before a settlement was reached. By the time that husband\u2019s claim was settled for a lump sum, husband and wife had separated. Id. at 347. Focusing on when the claim was settled \u2014 and not on when the claim had accrued \u2014 the Superior Court held that the lump sum settlement was not marital property because husband and wife had separated before husband\u2019s claim for benefits was settled. Id. at 349-50. For all the reasons discussed in this opinion, we conclude that the Superior Court wrongly decided Pudlish, and it is hereby overturned.\nOrder of the Superior Court reversed and case remanded to Superior Court for resolution of the parties\u2019 other issues on appeal. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices EAKIN, BAER, TODD and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. Act of December 19, 1990, P.L. 1240 No. 206, as amended, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3101-3904.\n. Appellee purchased the residence for $156,000, apparently in cash, plus closing costs and other expenses, on December 30, 2004. The deed was placed in the names of Appellee and Rebecca J. Keiffer, his then-girlfriend and the mother of his son.\n. The parties' remaining issues concerned the equitable distribution of the settlement proceeds. Because the Superior Court concluded that these proceeds were not marital property, it saw no need to address the remaining issues.\n. Nuhfer was decided under the 1980 Divorce Code, 23 P.S. \u00a7 101 et seq., as amended by the Act of February 12, 1988, P.L. 66, No. 13, which was the law in effect on September 21, 1989, when the parties' divorce was filed. The text was subsequently consolidated at 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3101 et seq. Current subsection 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a)(8) is for all relevant purposes the same as the old subsection 23 P.S. \u00a7 401(e)(8).\n. In Appellee\u2019s brief to this Court, he attempts to rely on two cases decided under the Divorce Code as it existed prior to the 1988 Amend-merits. See Budnick v. Budnick, 419 Pa.Super. 172, 615 A.2d 80 (1992) and Hurley v. Hurley, 342 Pa.Super. 156, 492 A.2d 439 (1985). Under the pre-1988 version of the Divorce Code, there was no explicit marital property exception for awards and setdements, i.e., no provision comparable to the current subsection 3501(a)(8). The only possibly relevant marital property exception was for property acquired after separation. 23 P.S. \u00a7 401(e)(4) (repealed) (re-enacted in the same substantive form as 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501(a)(4)); see Budnick, supra at 82 & n. 1. In Hurley, supra at 442, and Budnick, supra at 82-83, the Superior Court relied on subsection 401(e)(4) to conclude that a personal injury claim that had not yet been \"liquidated\u201d by settlement or verdict could not be considered marital property and thus could not be subject to equitable distribution.\nAppellee insists that Budnick and Hurley remain good law and should be followed here, despite the subsequent amendments to the Divorce Code, which amendments included, most relevantly, the addition of subsection 3501(a)(8). Appellee\u2019s Brief at 15-16. Appellee totally misapprehends the import of the addition of subsection 3501(a)(8). In 1991, the Superior Court explained the substantial import of the addition of subsection 3501(a)(8) as follows:\nIn Hurley, a panel of this court held that for purposes of determining whether the proceeds of a personal injury cause of action, which arose prior to separation were marital property, the court must look to the time the proceeds were received. The 1988 amendment has discarded the time of liquidation as the determinative factor. We must now look to the time the cause of action accrued.\n* * *\n[Based on the 1988 amendments, an] asset is characterized as marital property or non-marital property based on the time the cause of action accrued.\nNuhfer v. Nuhfer, 410 Pa.Super. 380, 599 A.2d 1348, 1349 (1991) (internal citations omitted).\nAppellee's assertion that subsection 3501(a)(8) did not change the law, see Appellee\u2019s Brief at 15-16, is entirely untenable, as recognized and explained by the Superior Court twenty years ago.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\nconcurring.\nI agree with the majority that a cause of action \u201caccrues,\u201d for purposes of Section 3501(a)(8) of the Divorce Code, when the right to institute and maintain a lawsuit first arises. See Majority Opinion at 53, 32 A.3d at 671. I differ, however, with the majority to the extent it suggests that the meaning of that term is ascertained by employing the principle that words must be construed according to their common and approved usage. See id. at 51-52, 32 A.3d at 670-71 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a)). Rather, as \u201caccrued\u201d is a term of art, I would employ the latter principle contained in Section 1903(a) of the Statutory Construction Act \u2014 that \u201ctechnical words and phrases and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning ..., shall be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\nI also do not support the majority\u2019s criticism of the Superior Court for adhering to the ruling in Pudlish v. Pudlish, 796 A.2d 346 (Pa.Super.2002). See Majority Opinion at 56-59, 32 A.3d at 673-75. For one, it is well established that, when sitting as a panel, the Superior Court cannot overrule an earlier decision from that tribunal. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cooper, 710 A.2d 76, 79-80 (Pa.Super.1998). Therefore, the intermediate court was required to follow the directives of Pudlish. Moreover, the Focht court criticized that decision, reasoning that it would be \u201cwilling to accept another interpretation of Drake if [it] were not bound by the Pudlish court\u2019s interpretation.\u201d Focht v. Focht, Nos. 336 & 357 MDA 2009, slip op. at 6 (Pa.Super. Dec. 17, 2009).\n. While I recognize that the Court has not always limited the instances in which it invoked the common-and-approved-usage rule, I believe the better approach is to employ this principle sparingly, as it stands to reason that there are few words in the English language that have acquired a singular meaning. See generally Baker v. Ret. Bd. of Allegheny County, 374 Pa. 165, 171, 97 A.2d 231, 234 (1953) (\"It is conceded that words can have a variety of interpretations, depending on context, circumstance, history and juxtaposition to other words, but there are a few words which are immune to mutation, and retain, regardless of rhetorical climate, only one meaning. \u2018Hereafter\u2019 is such a polestar in the sea of language.\u201d).",
