        "text": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice EAKIN.\nIn January, 2001, appellant\u2019s car was in a collision. His insurer totaled the aging New Yorker, then made a just division of the value of the insurance claim, sending $6,289 to the lender; the balance of $135, to appellant they made tender. And thus the matter terminated, or so one might have thought, but that was not to be, when Goodson\u2019s later schemes were caught.\nAppellant was unhappy with his meager share, we guess\u2014 comparing the two payouts, his disbursement was much less\u2014 so six months later, in July, Mr. Goodson would appear at a branch of First National Bank, and there he made it clear that he\u2019d a check made out to him, which he innocently presented to open a new bank account \u2014 \u201cfrom State Farm,\u201d he represented.\nThe check was numbered familiarly, same as the prior one for $135 that he\u2019d been given when this saga\u2019d just begun. And it was for $6,289, a unique and memorable amount. The bank obligingly took the check and opened a new account. \u201cWelcome our new customer!\u201d a greeting that we\u2019d bet the bank would come to think of with a measure of regret.\nNever thinking that appellant\u2019s check might have a minor flaw (like perhaps being a forgery), it allowed him to withdraw several thousand dollars and, days later, a few thousand more; he\u2019d taken over $5,000 before the bank would learn the score. There was no evidence appellant seemed the least bit nervous, having picked a branch with such unmatched customer service.\nOf course the crime soon came to light, as agents of State Farm refused to pay the check he\u2019d forged, which forestalled further harm:\n\u201cIt\u2019s not from us, there is no claim, the check we cannot honor!\u201d\nAnd appellant\u2019s scheme was thus undone \u2014 he knew he was a goner. When braced, he paid the money back, a mitigating solution, but despite this act, the Commonwealth commenced its prosecution.\nConvicted of the forgery, insurance fraud, and theft, he admits the first and last, but denies the charge that\u2019s left. He claims the sentence for insurance fraud is most certainly amiss\u2014\nhe says \u201cI may be guilty, but I\u2019m just not guilty of this. My sentence is inappropriate \u2014 undo the wrongful conviction.\u201d And in the end, seeks this relief from our appellate jurisdiction.\nOur standard of review\u2019s de novo; our scope will be plenary. And upon reviewing what Goodson\u2019s done, it takes not long to see his argument is legally sound, its merits clearly true, and so it falls to us to expeditiously undo the sentence for insurance fraud that was affirmed below for the elements just aren\u2019t made out, a closer look will show.\nWe find the elements of the statute are not proved in Goodson\u2019s case. No insurance claim was instituted, by writing or face-to-face. Goodson gave nothing to an insurer, and what he gave the bank exec was neither \u201cstatement\u201d nor \u201cinsurance claim\u201d \u2014 it simply was a check. That\u2019s not to say appellant\u2019s acts are free from any blame, it\u2019s just they\u2019re neither part nor parcel of an insurance claim.\nThe prosecution says the check is linked \u201cinexorably\u201d to the January claim, by check amount, its number, and payee. Though such particulars indicate some shared genealogy \u2019tween January and July, still they\u2019re branches of a different tree. His first claim was legitimate and, resemblances notwithstanding, he later passed a counterfeit check, no insurance coverage demanding.\nJust because the bogus check shows an insurance company\u2019s name doesn\u2019t make the crime insurance fraud \u2014 it\u2019s simply not the same. A check may seem a statement that State Farm owed him the dough but that assumption by the bank isn\u2019t false insurance info, or evidence that\u2019s material to a claim involving State Farm\u2014 there\u2019s no new claim and the old claim\u2019s gone \u2014 this was a different harm. One must ask when parsing the crime, what was the legislative intent? In creating such a focused crime, is counterfeiting what they meant? Were they targeting specific fraud unique to insurance firms, or is this a broad and sweeping crime, a can of felonious worms? It is the former, being so specific \u2014 who must give what to whom\u2014 and dressing up the facts won\u2019t make them fit in this costume.\nBecause he made no insurance claim, nor a proffer to an insurer, he didn\u2019t commit insurance fraud, and neither judge nor juror can to the contrary rightly find, even if they\u2019d like to. Two crimes are strikes, but not the third \u2014 the count is but strike two, and while those strikes are such that he\u2019s not going to walk, on this last pitch we have no choice but to call a figurative balk.\nSentenced on the other crimes, he surely won\u2019t go free, but we find he can\u2019t be guilty of this final felony. Convictions for the forgery and theft are approbated\u2014 the sentence for insurance fraud, however, is vacated. The case must be remanded for resentencing, we find, so the trial judge may impose the result he originally had in mind. What Goodson did is serious, but doesn\u2019t comprise this crime\u2014 there\u2019s simply no rhyme nor reason for it, for these reasons (and in rhyme).\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice BAER joins the opinion.\nJustices TODD and McCAFFERY concur in the result.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice CASTILLE joins.\n. There is set forth in the trial court's opinion a fuller recitation of the case\u2019s protracted history and facts, adopted by the Superior Court. Nevertheless, the facts necessary to resolve the issue accepted for review are few, undisputed, and fully contained herein.\n. The offense of insurance fraud occurs when a person:\n[k]nowingly and with the intent to defraud any insurer or self-insured, presents or causes to be presented to any insurer or self-insured any statement forming a part of, or in support of, a claim that contains any false, incomplete or misleading information concerning any fact or thing material to the claim.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(a)(2).",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nAs the lead Justices explain, Section 4117 of the Crimes Code defines insurance fraud to include:\nKnowingly and with the intent to defraud any insurer ..., presenting] or causing] to be presented to any insurer ... any statement forming a part of, or in support of, a claim that contains any false, incomplete or misleading information concerning any fact or thing material to the claim.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(a)(2) (emphasis added).\nIn the first instance, the lead opinion appears to indicate that there was no presentation to an insurer. See Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (\u201cOAJC\u201d), op. at 336, 33 A.3d at 613-14 (\u201cBecause he made no insurance claim, nor a proffer to an insurer, he didn\u2019t commit insurance fraud[.]\u201d (emphasis added)). While it may be true that Appellant did not directly present the counterfeit instrument to State Farm, by tendering it to First National Bank he certainly \u201ccause[d it] to be presented\u201d to the insurer. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(a)(2); see OAJC, op. at 334, 33 A.3d at 613 (explaining that \u201cagents of State Farm refused to pay the check [Appellant had] forged\u201d).\nSecond, the lead Justices determine that Appellant made no insurance claim. See id. at 336-37, 33 A.3d at 614. However, Appellant acknowledges that he did make an \u201cunderlying insurance claim,\u201d Brief for Appellant at 23, and the lead opinion otherwise recognizes as much. See OAJC, op. at 333-34, 33 A.3d at 612.\nIn my view, this appeal turns on whether the forged check Appellant caused to be presented to State Farm for payment constitutes a \u201cstatement\u201d under Section 4117(a)(2), in which context \u201cstatement\u201d is broadly defined to encompass:\nAny oral or written presentation or other evidence of loss, injury or expense, including, but not limited to, any notice, statement, proof of loss, bill of lading, receipt for payment, invoice, account, estimate of property damages, bill for services, diagnosis, prescription, hospital or doctor records, X-ray, test result or computer-generated documents.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4117(i). In light of this intentionally sweeping, non-exclusive definition, I find substantial resonance in the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the presentation of a forged check duplicating the amount of an already-paid obligation on an insurance claim represents a \u201cstatement that [State Farm] owed him this money, a statement which was completely false and directly concerned an insurance claim.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 9; see also id. (\u201cThis was, plain and simply, an attempt by Goodson to get far more money from an insurance claim than he deserved by presenting a fraudulent check for a duplicate amount and effectively make State Farm pay twice on the same claim.\u201d).\nAppellant indisputably designed to perpetrate fraud on an insurance company, and the artifice he employed was to mimic an amount previously tendered on his insurance claim. In light of the above, and like the Commonwealth, I have difficulty appreciating why this is not insurance fraud, under the broad statutory definitions.\nChief Justice CASTILLE joins this dissenting opinion.",
