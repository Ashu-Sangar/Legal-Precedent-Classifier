        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nWe granted review in this case to consider an issue of first impression regarding the legality of an insurance companjfs practice of reimbursing, on a pro rata basis only, an insured\u2019s deductible from funds obtained in an insurer\u2019s subrogation action against a third-party tortfeasor. The insured argues that this practice violates the common law \u201cmade whole doctrine.\u201d As discussed in more detail below, the made whole doctrine provides generally that an insurance company cannot exercise its right of subrogation until its insured has been fully compensated or \u201cmade whole.\u201d As we conclude that the made whole doctrine does not apply to the collision coverage at issue in this case, we affirm the dismissal of appellant-insured\u2019s class action.\nAlthough this Court regularly addresses questions involving uninsured and underinsured motor vehicle coverage (UM/UIM) and other types of bodily injury coverage under the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1701-1799.7, we have not reviewed a question involving collision coverage in recent years. Accordingly, we briefly review the basics of this coverage.\nAs most vehicle owners understand, with collision coverage, an insured typically contracts with an insurance company to cover the cost of any damage to the vehicle above the amount of an agreed upon deductible. A deductible clause is defined as \u201c[a] clause in an insurance policy exempting the insurer from paying an initial specified amount after an accident.\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 227 (4th Ed.2001); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 285 (6th Ed.1991) (\u201cThe portion of an insured loss to be borne by the insured before he is entitled to recover from the insurer.\u201d). Likewise, the policy at issue in this case defines a deductible as \u201cthe amount of loss to be paid by the insured. We pay for covered loss above the deductible amount shown in the Declarations.\u201d Nationwide Auto Policy, dated October 19, 2005, at Dl. Accordingly, unlike a UM/UIM claim where the insured is not responsible for paying a deductible prior to recovery but may recover only up to the policy\u2019s specified coverage limits, an insured recovering under a collision coverage policy may recover the entire amount of the damage up to and including the total value of the vehicle, after subtracting the amount of the deductible that the insured contracted to pay.\nNot surprisingly, if an insured is willing to bear the risk of paying a higher deductible, her premiums will be reduced to reflect that the insurer will be responsible for covering less risk. Indeed, the MVFRL requires this reduction in premiums. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(4) (\u201cWith the purchase of a $500 or greater deductible, there shall be an immediate commensurate reduction in rate for collision and comprehensive coverages. The reduction in rate shall be based on the insured\u2019s existing deductible level.\u201d). Additionally, the MVFRL forbids insurers from issuing policies that do not include deductibles, and provides that policies must include a $500 deductible unless the insured \u201csigns a statement indicating the insured is aware that the purchase of a lower deductible is permissible and that there is an additional cost of purchasing a lower deductible\u201d. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(1). With these basic parameters in mind, we consider the case at bar.\nOn December 10, 2005, Appellant Brenda Jones was involved in an automobile accident with another driver that caused damage to Jones\u2019s vehicle. The facts as presented to this Court do not address any bodily injury resulting from the accident. Jones\u2019s insurance policy with Nationwide Property and Casualty Company (Nationwide) included collision coverage for the vehicle involved, subject to a $500 deductible. The policy also provided Nationwide with the right of subrogation. Nationwide paid Jones for all damage to the vehicle, reduced by the $500 deductible.\nNationwide filed a subrogation claim against the other driver and recovered under the other driver\u2019s liability coverage. The recovery, while in excess of Jones\u2019s $500 deductible, was apparently only ninety percent of the amount Nationwide paid Jones under the collision coverage policy. Pursuant to its practice, which mirrors an Insurance Department regulation, Nationwide paid Jones a pro rata share of the subrogation award by reimbursing her for ninety percent of her deductible, which amounted to $450.\nJones filed a class action against Nationwide claiming that Nationwide\u2019s uniform practice of pro rating reimbursements of deductibles violated the made whole doctrine. The proposed class included \u201call Pennsylvania residents who are or have been insured under Pennsylvania policies of insurance issued by defendant that have deductibles applicable to collision damage coverage.\u201d Complaint at 8. Jones\u2019s complaint included several counts. First, Plaintiff claimed that the pro rata reimbursement constituted a breach of contract, arguing that the contract was subject to common law equitable principles such as the made whole doctrine. Jones also brought claims of bad faith pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8371, conversion, and unjust enrichment. All claims were based upon Jones\u2019s conclusion that Nationwide should have reimbursed her for her entire $500 deductible, despite the provision in the policy granting Nationwide subrogation rights. Jones also sought injunctive relief to stop Nationwide\u2019s practice of pro rata deductible reimbursement.\nNationwide filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. It observed that Nationwide\u2019s procedure of using pro rata reimbursement was consistent with a regulation of the Insurance Commissioner, 31 Pa.Code \u00a7 146.8(c), which provides in relevant part,\n(c) Insurers shall, upon the request of the claimant, include the first-party claimant\u2019s deductible, if any, in subrogation demands. Subrogation recoveries shall be shared on a proportionate basis with the first-party claimant, unless the deductible amount has been otherwise recovered.\n31 Pa.Code \u00a7 146.8(c). Moreover, Nationwide asserted that the pro rata reimbursement was consistent with the equitable principles underlying subrogation. It claimed that subrogation is allowed \u201cto prevent double recovery and ensure that the party at fault, rather than an innocent party, be held responsible for the injury claimed.\u201d Preliminary Objections at 7 (quoting Thompson v. W.C.A .B. (USF&G Co.), 566 Pa.420, 781 A.2d 1146, 1153 (2001)). Finally, it contended that the language of the policy provided Nationwide subrogation rights. See Insurance Contract at G3, supra note 2.\nThe trial court sustained Nationwide\u2019s preliminary objections without issuing an opinion. After Jones filed an appeal and her Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of matters complained of on appeal, the trial court issued an opinion supporting its decision on a basis not raised by Nationwide. It concluded that Jones failed to exhaust administrative remedies under the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (UIPA), without identifying what those remedies entailed, and instead merely referenced the title section of the UIPA, 40 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 1171.1. Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 3.\nIn the alternative, the trial court considered the merits of the case. It observed that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania recently addressed a very similar argument in Harnick v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Insurance, 2009 WL 579378 (E.D. Pa. Mar 5, 2009). The district court in Hamick acknowledged that the common law made whole doctrine \u201crequires that an insured recover the full amount of his losses before his insurer may demand reimbursement for any payments previously made to the insured under an insurance policy,\u201d id. at *3, but implicitly found that Pennsylvania\u2019s regulatory scheme controlling automobile insurance modified the common law doctrine. The federal court concluded that 31 Pa.Code \u00a7 146.8(c), which provided for the pro rata subrogation distribution procedure, was within the authority delegated to the Insurance Department by the General Assembly pursuant to the UIPA. The court held that because the procedure is \u201cspecifically permitted by Pennsylvania\u2019s insurance regulations, [it] cannot violate the common law \u2018made whole\u2019 doctrine even assuming that the doctrine would in fact support a claim like that of [the] plaintiffs.\u201d Id. The federal court then reasoned, \u201c[b]ecause the behavior does not violate the \u2018made whole\u2019 doctrine, the plaintiffs have failed to state a basis on which the Court could find a breach of the parties\u2019 contract.\u201d Id. Accordingly, based in part upon the federal district court\u2019s decision in Hamick, the trial court dismissed Jones\u2019s complaint in the matter now before us. Jones filed a supplemental Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling based on the UIPA issue that had not been raised by Nationwide. The trial court did not file a supplemental opinion.\nIn a unanimous published opinion, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order but on different grounds. Jones v. Nationwide Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co., 995 A.2d 1233 (Pa.Super.2010). The appellate court concluded that the trial court erred in finding that Jones should have pursued an administrative remedy under the UIPA, because the UIPA does not provide a private remedy. It additionally recognized that Jones did not seek relief under the UIPA. Nonetheless, the Superior Court adopted the analysis of the Eastern District Court\u2019s decision in Harnick and affirmed the trial court\u2019s order dismissing Jones\u2019s complaint because it concluded that she failed to assert a viable cause of action.\nJones appealed to this Court, and we granted review of the following issues:\n(1) Does Pennsylvania law require that a party suffering damages be made whole before an insurer is entitled to subrogation?\n(2) Does the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner have the authority to promulgate a regulation regarding allocation of subrogation proceeds between an insurance company and its insured following subrogation recovery?\n(3) Is the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner\u2019s regulation allowing insurers to allocate subrogation proceeds on a pro rata basis void because it violates Pennsylvania substantive common law, the \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine?\nJones v. Nationwide Prop. and Cas. Ins. Co., 607 Pa. 480, 8 A.3d 311 (2010).\nJones\u2019s first issue presents a pure question of law regarding whether the pro rata reimbursement of the insured\u2019s deductible from the insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery in a collision coverage case violates the common law made whole doctrine. As with all questions of law, this Court\u2019s review is plenary. See Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The Architectural Studio, 581 Pa. 454, 866 A.2d 270, 274 (2005). Given that the underlying decision involves the dismissal of the case on preliminary objections, we further observe \u201cthe standard of review for preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer is limited; the question presented by the demurrer is whether, on the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible\u201d Id.\nJones reasserts her claim that Nationwide\u2019s practice of reimbursing the insured\u2019s deductible from the insurer\u2019s subrogation only on a pro rata basis calculated upon the percent of the insurer\u2019s recovery from a third party violates the common law made whole doctrine. Relying on Superior Court and federal court cases applying Pennsylvania law, Jones asserts, \u201cPennsylvania law provides that an insurance company cannot exercise its right of subrogation until the insured has been fully compensated or \u2018made whole.\u2019 \u201d Brief at 6 (citing inter alia, Gallop v. Rose, 420 Pa.Super. 388, 616 A.2d 1027, 1031 (1992); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. DiTomo, 330 Pa.Super. 117, 478 A.2d 1381, 1383 (1984); Walls v. City of Pittsburgh, 292 Pa.Super. 18, 436 A.2d 698, 701 (1981) (holding insurer\u2019s right to subrogation arises \u201conly upon the insurer\u2019s showing that the sum of the insured\u2019s recovery from the insurer and from persons legally responsible for the injury exceeds the insured\u2019s loss.\u201d)). She observes that in Valora v. Pa. Employees Benefit Trust Fund, 595 Pa. 574, 939 A.2d 312, 321 (2007), this Court recognized the use of the made whole doctrine in other states. She further asserts that we held in Valora that, because subrogation is based in equity, even contractual subrogation rights are subject to equitable principles. Id.\nAlthough Jones acknowledges that Pennsylvania courts have yet to apply the made whole doctrine to collision coverage deductibles, she observes that because we have not spoken to the question, we have also not determined that it does not apply. She urges this Court to apply the doctrine broadly, as equity would demand. As support, she observes that the Supreme Court of Montana recently certified a class of automobile insureds seeking recovery of unrecovered losses, including deductibles, from their insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery. Reply Brief for Jones at 8 (citing Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164, 1168 (2008) (opining that when \u201ceither the [i]nsured or the [ijnsurer must to some extent go unpaid, the loss should be borne by the [ijnsurer for that is a risk the [ijnsured has paid it to assume.\u201d)). She argues that where Nationwide \u201cbrings a subrogation claim\u2014 her subrogation claim \u2014 in order to recover funds it has paid to its own insured, it must, upon recovery, make sure that she is \u2018made whole\u2019 by repaying any deductible before Nationwide dips its own hand into the recovery.\u201d Reply Brief for Jones at 11. She asserts that the insurer has assumed the risk of loss regardless of the deductible and that the insurer cannot consider her potential fault in determining the amounts distributed from the subrogation recovery, because her policy provides for payment regardless of fault. Jones also claims that the violation of the made whole doctrine, through the pro rata distribution process, results in a breach of contract.\nIn response, Nationwide avers that the made whole doctrine does not apply to this case because Jones is attempting to seek reimbursement from insurer\u2019s recovery for an uninsured loss \u2014 her deductible. It argues that Jones cannot provide any precedent for her claim that the made whole doctrine has been applied to allow the recovery of uninsured losses, including deductibles. Instead, Nationwide directs our attention to other jurisdictions that have rejected the application of the made whole doctrine in similar cases, as discussed below.\nSpecifically, Nationwide observes that Florida courts have rejected complaints brought by insureds seeking reimbursement of their collision deductible and other uninsured losses under the made whole doctrine. Brief of Nationwide at 7-8 (citing Schonau v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co., 903 So.2d 285, 287 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 4th Dist.2005) (Appellant\u2019s \u201cproposed application of the \u2018made whole\u2019 doctrine would effectively eliminate this entire body of Florida subrogation law, by forcing an insurer to cover uninsured losses before the insurer can pursue a subrogation claim.\u201d); Monte de Oca v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 897 So.2d 471 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 3rd Dist. 2004)). Nationwide also discusses a decision from the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where the court held that an insurer that pursues subrogation against a tortfeasor has no obligation to make the insured whole out of the proceeds, if the insured has not filed suit herself to recover from the tortfeasor. Brief of Nationwide at 8 (citing Chandler v. State Farm Mutual Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2010)). Relying upon Chandler, Nationwide claims that \u201can insured may not sit back and do nothing to assert its rights against the responsible party, and then expect to be made whole by the insurer who enforces its right of subrogation.\u201d Brief of Nationwide at 8. Nationwide also looks to a decision from Washington State, holding that the made whole doctrine does not apply where the insurer pursues a subrogation action and the insured seeks reimbursement of a deductible from the proceeds, in part because the deductible represents the amount of risk retained by the insured. Brief at 9 (citing Averill v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Washington, 155 Wash.App. 106, 229 P.3d 830 (2010)).\nNationwide further asserts that the application of the made whole doctrine to deductibles would undermine the public policy expressed in the MVFRL, which forbids the issuances of insurance policies without deductibles. Nationwide observes that 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(2) provides, \u201c[u]nder no circumstances may a private passenger automobile insurance policy provide a collision deductible in an amount less than $100.\u201d In Nationwide\u2019s view, application of the made whole doctrine to require insurers to reimburse insureds for their deductible in full from any subrogation recovery would create, in essence, a no-deductible policy contrary to the policy language and the MVFRL, which require insureds to shoulder some of the risk of collision coverage. Instead, Nationwide contends that the pro rata reimbursement procedure utilized by the insurance company and provided for by Section 146.8(c) of the regulations appropriately balances the policies of the made whole doctrine and the deductible requirement by requiring the reimbursement of the insured\u2019s deductible from subrogation recoveries on a proportionate basis.\nThe Acting Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Nationwide. The Commissioner asserts that the made whole doctrine is inapplicable to cases involving collision coverage insurance. He explains, \u201cThe \u2018made whole\u2019 doctrine was developed to give consumers with excess damages priority over their insurer when there is a shortfall in the amount of first-party coverage (e.g., Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist (\u2018UM/UIM\u2019) coverage) and there are limited funds available from any third-party source (i.e., the tortfeasor or his insurer).\u201d Commissioner\u2019s Brief at 4. It is also intended, the Commissioner observes, to prevent double recovery by the insured from both the insurer and the tortfeasor. Id. at 9. In contrast to insurance such as UIM, which involves coverage limits, the Commissioner notes, \u201cCollision coverage, however, is fundamentally different from other first-party coverages because it does not have a coverage limit.\u201d Id. at 4 (emphasis omitted). As a result, the Commissioner argues, collision coverage cannot result in a shortfall because the insured is paid the full value of the damage to the vehicle by the insurer, or if totaled, the vehicle\u2019s replacement value.\nUnlike other first-party benefit insurance, where the insurer is liable from the \u201cfirst dollar,\u201d the Commissioner explains that a deductible is a \u201cthin layer of first dollar liability retained by the consumer (and specifically not transferred to the insurer) to ensure risk-sharing and loss avoidance.\u201d Id. at 4 (emphasis omitted). Under the policy, the insured agreed to pay the deductible as a first dollar obligation prior to implicating the insurer\u2019s obligation to cover the damages. Therefore, the loss of the deductible is not a \u201cshortfall\u201d in the insurance coverage. The Commissioner argues that requiring the insurer to refund the deductible in full to insured prior to recovering its own payment would render the deductible meaningless and would convert the policy into a deductible-free policy, which is prohibited by the MVFRL. Additionally, the Commissioner observes that, pursuant to the MVFRL, premiums are based upon the contractually determined deductible, such that applying the made whole doctrine would \u201cnegate any differentials in premiums paid by consumers electing higher or lower deductibles and undermine\u201d the rate structures approved by the Commissioner. Id. at 14.\nThe Commissioner also argues that allowing the insured to recover her entire deductible prior to the insurer receiving any of the subrogation funds is inequitable for two reasons. First, he notes that, in cases such as this, the insurer is bearing the cost and risk of litigation. Second, the Commissioner observes that in collision coverage subrogation cases where an insurer recovers only a portion of the damages it paid to the insured, it usually does so because there has been an apportionment of fault to the insured. For example, if the insured is ten percent at fault in the accident, the third-party tortfeasor\u2019s insurance company will only pay the insurer ninety percent of the insured\u2019s loss. The Commissioner asserts that it would be inequitable for the insured, who was partially at fault for the accident, to recover in full for her deductible prior to the insurer receiving any of the subrogation proceeds. Accordingly, an insured, who is partially at fault for the accident, would recover all losses, when the insurer who pursued the litigation and accepted the risks thereof, would recover only a portion of its losses.\nThe Commissioner observes that we need not consider Jones\u2019s remaining issues relating to the validity of the Department\u2019s regulation because Jones has not demonstrated a right to relief even in the absence of the Department\u2019s regulation. If the made whole doctrine does not apply to the pro rata distribution of subrogation recoveries in cases involving deductibles, we need not consider the propriety of the Insurance Department regulations providing for this practice.\nIn determining the legality of Nationwide\u2019s practice of reimbursing Jones from its subrogation recovery only a pro rated portion of the deductible, we must first consider subrogation and the made whole doctrine generally. We have repeatedly held that subrogation is an equitable doctrine intended to place the ultimate burden of a debt upon the party primarily responsible for the loss. Valora, 939 A.2d at 320. Subrogation allows the subrogee (in this case the insurer) to step into the shoes of the subrogor (the insured) to recover from the party that is primarily liable (the third party tortfeasor) any amounts previously paid by the subrogee to the subrogor (in this case, the amount of damage to the vehicle less the deductible). See e.g. Ario v. Reliance Insur. Co., 602 Pa. 490, 980 A.2d 588, 594-95 (2009). As well-stated by the Superior Court,\n[W]hen an individual who has been indemnified for a loss subsequently recovers for the same loss from a third party, equity compels that the indemnifying party be restored that which he paid the injured party; thereby placing the cost of the injury upon the party causing the harm while preventing the injured party from profiting a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d at the indemnifying party\u2019s expense.\nAllstate Ins. Co. v. Clarke, 364 Pa.Super. 196, 527 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1987). While subrogation rights may be contractually determined, as in this case, those rights are still subject to equitable principles. See Valora, 939 A.2d at 320.\nTurning to the made whole doctrine, all the parties agree that the doctrine applies generally in Pennsylvania. See e.g. Gallop, 616 A.2d at 1031. Couch on Insurance describes the made whole doctrine as follows: \u201cwhere an insured is entitled to receive recovery for the same loss from more than one source, e.g. the insurer and the tortfeasor, it is only after the insured has been fully compensated for all the loss that the insurer acquires a right to subrogation, or is entitled to enforce its subrogation rights.\u201d 16 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 223:134 (3d Ed.) (footnote omitted). Our courts have explained that the made whole doctrine both ensures that the insured is fully compensated for his or her injury before the insurer recovers, in cases where there are insufficient funds to satisfy both the insured and the insurer, and prevents the insured from receiving dual recovery for the same loss from both the tortfeasor and the insurer. Gallop, 616 A.2d at 1030.\nThe case at bar presents the question of whether the made whole doctrine, as described above, applies to cases where the underlying collision coverage policy includes a deductible. Although the General Assembly has not specifically spoken to the question of reimbursement of an insured\u2019s deductible from an insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery, we cannot ignore that the legislature has set forth clear policy regarding deductibles generally. The MVFRL requires all motor vehicle insurance policies for collision coverage issued in this Commonwealth to contain a deductible of no less than $100. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(2). This requirement ensures that insureds share with their insurance companies the risk of damage to the vehicle. The legislature also directed insurers and the Commissioner to set premium rates based upon the deductible amount chosen by the insured. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(4). Accordingly, the legislature provided a system where an insured, who agreed to accept a higher percentage of the risk through a higher deductible, would pay a lower premium to reflect that the insurer would cover less risk. With these legislative directives in mind, we agree with the Commissioner that applying the made whole doctrine to the distribution of subrogation recoveries in collision coverage cases would undermine the MVFRL\u2019s provisions related to deductibles. Specifically, application of the made whole doctrine would require the insured to recover the entire deductible from the proceeds of any action against the tortfeasor prior to the insurance company\u2019s recovery, thus in essence creating a no-deductible policy, in the limited circumstances of a cases involving subrogation recoveries, in violation of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792(b)(2).\nApplication of the made whole doctrine to deductibles would not only be contrary to the relevant MVFRL provisions but, when considering the inherent nature of deductibles, would run counter to the equitable principles underlying the made whole doctrine and subrogation. \u201cThe equitable principle underlying the made whole rule is that the burden of loss should rest on the party paid to assume the risk, and not on an inadequately compensated insured, who is least able to shoulder the loss.\u201d 16 Couch on Insurance \u00a7 223:136. While the made whole doctrine is consistent with equity in other types of first-party insurance cases where the insurer has been paid to assume the risk, it is not in the case of collision coverage insurance involving deductibles.\nAs discussed at the beginning of this opinion, a primary difference between collision coverage policies utilizing deductibles and other first-party insurance is that with collision coverage, the insured contracts to accept the risk of the first portion of any loss by way of the deductible and to pay the insurer premiums to assume the risk for the entire amount of the loss above the deductible up to the fair market value of the vehicle. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 285 (6th Ed.1991) (defining \u201cdeductible\u201d as \u201c[t]he portion of an insured loss to be borne by the insured before he is entitled to recover from the insurer\u201d). In contrast, in cases involving other first-party insurance coverage, the insurer has accepted premiums in exchange for assuming the risk of the first dollar of coverage up to the policy limits, but any amount above the policy limits is an uninsured risk not attributable to the insurer.\nAs noted by the Commissioner, the deductible in a collision coverage policy is a \u201cthin layer of first dollar liability retained by the consumer (and specifically not transferred to the insurer) to ensure risk-sharing and loss avoidance.\u201d Commissioner\u2019s Brief at 4 (emphasis omitted). The insurer, thus, accepted only the risk of paying if the loss exceeded the amount of the deductible, with premiums calculated based upon the amount of first dollar liability accepted by the insured. Application of the made whole doctrine in such a case would force the insurer essentially to cover the risk of the deductible where the insured has not paid premiums to cover that risk. It follows that the insured should not get preferential treatment in a collision coverage case, when he or she accepted the risk of paying the deductible in the event of an accident. We conclude that the made whole doctrine does not apply in cases involving collision coverage policies, and accordingly, that the practice of pro rata reimbursement of the insured\u2019s deductible from the insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery does not violate the made whole doctrine.\nGiven that we conclude that the practice of pro rata reimbursement of the insured\u2019s deductible from the insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery does not violate the made whole doctrine, and therefore is a valid practice for Nationwide and other insurers to use, we agree with the Commissioner that we need not consider whether the regulation providing for the same process is validly enacted, as the practice is valid with or without the regulation. Accordingly, we do not address the second and third issues granted for review, but instead affirm the decision to dismiss the class action based on our conclusion that Nationwide did not violate the made whole doctrine in providing Jones pro rata reimbursement of her deductible from Nationwide\u2019s subrogation recovery from the third party tortfeasor, such that dismissal of the class action was appropriate.\nAlthough on different grounds than either of the courts below, we affirm the decision to dismiss Appellant Jones\u2019s class action based, upon the preliminary objections raised by Nationwide.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, TODD, McCAFFERY, and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. The MVFRL provides in full in regard to deductibles as follows:\n(b) Mandatory deductibles.\u2014\n(1) Every private passenger automobile insurance policy providing collision coverage issued or renewed on and after the effective date of this subsection shall provide a deductible in an amount of $500 for collision coverage, unless the named insured signs a statement indicating the insured is aware that the purchase of a lower deductible is permissible and that there is an additional cost of purchasing a lower deductible, and the insured agrees to accept it.\n(2) Under no circumstances may a private passenger automobile insurance policy provide a collision deductible in an amount less than $100.\n(3) Any person or entity providing financing to the purchaser of a motor vehicle or otherwise holding a security interest in a motor vehicle shall not be permitted to require the purchase of a deductible for less than $500 for collision and comprehensive coverages. Any financial institution, insurer, agent or other person or entity found to have violated this provision shall be required to reimburse the policyholder in an amount equal to the difference in premium and, in addition, shall be required to pay a civil penalty of $500 to the Department of Transportation for each violation.\n(4) With the purchase of a $500 or greater deductible, there shall be an immediate commensurate reduction in rate for collision and comprehensive coverages. The reduction in rate shall be based on the insured's existing deductible level.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1792.\n. In relevant part, the Subrogation provision of the insurance contract provides:\nSubrogation. We have the right of subrogation under the: (a) Physical Damage ... coverages in this policy and its endorsements. This means that after paying a loss to you or others under this policy, we will have the insured\u2019s right to sue for or otherwise recover such loss from anyone else who may be liable. Also, we may require reimbursement from the insured out of any settlement or judgment that duplicates our payments. These provisions will be applied in accordance with state law.... We are not entitled to recover under Uninsured or Underinsured Motorist coverage until the insured has been fully compensated for damages.\nInsurance Contract at G3.\n. As the Superior Court observed in its decision, the record, which does not include the subrogation proceedings between the relevant insurance companies, is silent regarding how or why the subrogation award amounted to less than Jones\u2019s total loss. The parties suggest that during subrogation proceedings the relevant percentage of each driver\u2019s fault is often determined and the subrogation award is based thereupon. Additionally, the parties do not discuss the total amount paid by Nationwide to Jones under the collision coverage policy for the damage to Jones\u2019s vehicle.\n. Although the plaintiff in Harnick appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that court decided to hold the case pending the appeal of the case at bar. Harnick v. State Fam Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., No. 09-1942 (3d Cir. Dec. 4, 2009).\n. The question as framed by Jones is whether \"Pennsylvania law require[s] that a party suffering damages be made whole before an insurer is entitled to subrogation?\u201d As noted by all parties and set forth below, Pennsylvania has applied the \"made whole\u201d doctrine repeatedly, and thus there is no dispute in this case that the doctrine applies, generally, as part of Pennsylvania common law. The interesting question raised by this case is whether the made whole doctrine applies to the case at bar, involving the pro rata reimbursement of the insured\u2019s deductible from the insurer\u2019s subrogation recovery.\n. Although we affirm the courts below based upon our conclusion that the made whole doctrine does not apply to collision coverage cases, we recognize that the parties devote substantial briefing to Nationwide\u2019s argument that the made whole doctrine does not apply to cases where the insurer, rather than the insured, is the party pursuing the subrogation action against the third-party tortfeasor. In support of its argument, Nationwide contends that the made whole doctrine typically applies where the insured takes on the risk of litigation and sues the tortfeasor; in such a case, the insured must be made whole before the insurer can make its subrogation claim against the insured\u2019s recovery from the tortfeasor. Nationwide argues that equity does not require the application of the made whole doctrine when the insured has not asserted a claim against the tortfeasor, as in this case where the action was brought by the insurer.\nWhile we do not decide the merits of this argument, we acknowledge that Jones presents an argument refuting Nationwide's claim by noting that any rights Nationwide has in subrogation are based entirely on her own and not Nationwide\u2019s rights. As in any subrogation claim, the insurer steps into the shoes of the insured-subrogee, and can only claim the rights of the insured-subrogee. She further argues that Nationwide cannot divide the claim against the tortfeasor into Nationwide's claim for the amount above the deductible and Jones\u2019s claim for the amount of the deductible, pursuant to caselaw asserting that a cause of action for negligence cannot be split or divided. See Fitzpatrick v. Branoff, 504 Pa. 169, 470 A.2d 521, 523 (1983). We make no determination regarding whether the made whole doctrine applies when an insurer brings the litigation against the third party tortfeasor.\n. We additionally note that Harleysville Preferred Insurance Company; the Pennsylvania Defense Institute, Inc.; Insurance Federation of PA, Inc.; and National Association of Subrogation Professionals, Inc. filed amicus curiae briefs in support of Nationwide.",
