This tract of land was formerly located in Northumberland county, and remained within that county until the passage of the act of assembly in 1813, carving out of Northumberland county the county of Columbia. This tract of land was surveyed March 7, 1794, in pursuance of a warrant that had previously (January 10 of that year) been issued by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to Johnston Besely. This survey was duly returned (September 29, 1794) to the land office, and a patent was afterwards issued to one, Robert Morris — we think in the same year; we will not be exact about that, but think it was the same year, probably the fall of 1794; dated October 16, 1794. The patent was issued to Robert Morris in consequence of his having become the purchaser of this tract of land, conveyed to him by deed dated May 20, 1794. We thus have the title out of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and in Robert Morris.</p>

We are not clear whether the testimony shows that tlie taxes for all those years or that all the taxes for those years were due and unpaid at the date of that treasurer’s sale, but that is not material. As soon as the taxes for at least one year, excluding the year of the sale, were due, the treasurer of the county had a right to make sale of the land for the payment of the taxes; and it is clearly in evidence that these taxes on the tract in dispute were not paid for several of the years preceding the sale. This treasurer’s sale of this particular tract was made on the 15th day of June, 1816; and if that sale is good, then the title passed by it and became vested in the purchaser at that sale, <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>and still remains in the purchaser, or in those to whom he has conveyed his title, or who now hold the land under him in the chain of title from him, unless there has been a redemption from that sale or unless something else has occurred to wrest the title from the purchaser at that sale. This treasurer’s sale appears to have been regularly made and for taxes undoubtedly due and unpaid; on that part of the subject there is no conflict in the testimony. At this sale the county of Northumberland through its commissioners became the purchaser. Evidently no bid exceeding the taxes and costs was offered, and the act of assembly requires that the commissioners of the county shall in such case bid in the lands for the county. The title remained in the county of Northumberland from that date (June 15, 1816) until some time in the year 1874; but, in the meantime, in the year 1838 this same land had been again sold for taxes accrued upon it while lying in Columbia county, which taxes were due and unpaid. From tins sale of 1838 there was a redemption in 1840 (within the limit of two years from the date of the sale, as provided by act of assembly, within which limit the owner may redeem) by the treasurer of Northumberland county, and thus the title of that county remained intact. In 1874 the commissioners of that county, not having received the purchase money and the taxes which had subsequently accrued, made sale of this property, as they had a right under the act of assembly to do at any time after five years from the date of their purchase, within which period redemption might be made. If the land is not redeemed within five years from the date of the sale to them, they may sell it again, and then the absolute title passes to the purchaser. The land was not redeemed within the five years, and the commissioners did make such sale, and at that sale the land was purchased by some one whose name we do not remember, nor is his name important. It is in evidence that the purchaser reconveyed the same land; and divers conveyances have been put in evidence here showing that the title of that purchaser finally became vested in the defendants to this action, or rather in their landlord, they being tenants of the Johnston Besely Coal Company, the present owner of the land.</p>

She, the city, does not, however, pretend that she has proved an actual redemption from this sale; but she says that she has proved that for more than a half century she (or those under whom she claims) has paid the taxes upon these premises, and that the county of Northumberland did not pay any attention to them nor pay any taxes upon them, and she claims that this act of payment of taxes upon her part or on the part of her predecessors in title, and this neglect to pay on the part of the defendants, or of those under whom they assert title, lost to the defendants or to their landlord (if they ever had it) this treasurer’s tax sale title.</p>

In this case, however, we must say to you that the plaintiff or her grantors did have the legal title (so far as the evidence produced here shows) up until it was divested by the treasurer’s sale in 1816, and that, of course, during that period, from the time of the issuance of the patent to Robert Morris up to the tune of this sale, the plaintiff’s grantors, having the legal title had also the constructive possession of this tract of land — not the actual possession, the land being unseated and not in a condition to be occupied by any one. In such case, the legal title draws to itself the possession, called constructive possession, and that possession belonged to the holders of the plaintiff’s title down to the time of this treasurer’s sale; [but after the title of the plaintiff was divested by that treasurer’s sale, in 1816, then the county of Northumberland became the legal owner, and the sale to it not having been redeemed from within the five years allowed by law, it follows that in the year 1821 the county of Northumberland had an absolute vested title to this land. It was the complete legal title; there was nething inchoate or imperfect any more about it. From that time on, we charge you, as the law applicable to this case, that the county of Northumberland had the title and the constructive possession of this property, and that the mere fact of failure or neglect on her part to pay the taxes assessed <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>thereon is not sufficient to deprive the county of her title or to defeat its assertion here to-day by these defendants, in whose landlord that title now vests.] [7]</p>

Of course, if actual possession of this land had been taken in the meantime by the plaintiff or by those under whom she claims, then payment of taxes in connection with that possession might have determined the extent of the possession, and also might have been a strong circumstance to show the character of the possession.</p>

The county of Northumberland did itself redeem this land in 1840 from the sale in 1838. The county certainly claimed and asserted title in 1840 by that act of redemption from the sale of 1838. Besides, it appears now that for some years — since the latter part of December, 1871, as alleged by the defendants; and since February 27, 1882, as conceded by the plaintiff — some two years, at least, before suit brought, the Johnston Besely Coal Company, by its tenants, has been in the actual possession and occupancy of this tract. We have no recollection that the plaintiff has shown that she, or any of her grantors, ever took actual possession of this land at any time.

We leave that question to be decided by you, but in doing so we say that we do not think that there is sufficient evidence to warrant you in finding otherwise than that it is the same land, although this instruction is not binding upon you. In the assessment books and other papers in evidence the warrantee-name of this tract is spelled sometimes one way and sometimes another, and there are other little matters of variance; but, if our recollection is right, on all the papers we have the same number of the warrant and the same number of acres, and the number of the warrant for the survey of the land for which this suit is brought is the number of the warrant for the survey of the land that was sold in 1816. And you will remember that the plaintiff here has offered evidence uncontraclicted to show that there was no other Johnston Besely tract or Besely warrant, or any warrant, that could come under that name or anything like it, within forty miles of the territory where this land is located. This is a fact which you must take into consideration when you come <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>to determine whether or not this is the samé land. If there is no other warrant of like name within forty miles, then is not the tract for which this suit is brought the same land surveyed under the same warrant as that which was sold at the sale in 1816 ? Besides, the name all through the papers is substantially the same in sound. If, on little technicalities of that kind — on the misspelling of a name — courts and juries were to permit a sale to be set aside, no man would be safe in buying at any public sale. [Is there such a discrepancy here in the name or in the location or in the evidence anywhere as to cause you to doubt as to the identity of this tract?

In Goodman v. Sanger, <a href="/pa/85/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="85 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="440451" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0037-01">85 Pa. 37</a>; Same v.

Goodman (not reported), substantially the same questions, that are now presented, were considered and disposed of. The last was a writ of error to the judgment for plaintiff below on the verdict directed by the learned trial <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>judge. After referring to the fact that the case had been here twice before, the court, in unanimously affirming the judgment, said that every material question had already been passed upon; that Robinson et al. v. Williams et al., <a href="/watts/6/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="6 Watts 281" data-case-ids="1846081" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0281-01">6 Watts, 281</a>; and Devor v. McClintock, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 80" data-case-ids="12168986" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0080-01">9 W. &amp; S. 80</a>, ruled the controversy, etc. As will be seen by reference to the cases referred to and authorities therein cited, all the material questions presented in the record now before us have already been ruled adversely to the contention of the present plaintiff. The question as to the discharge of the Northumberland county taxes, by the alleged sale for taxes due Columbia county, was raised and decided when the title now in controversy was before this court the third time. As shown by that record, the offers of evidence are substantially the same as those in the record now before us. As to the questions of abandonment, estoppel, redemption, etc., the language of Mr. Chief Justice Agnew in Goodman v. Sanger, 85 Pa. supra, is equally applicable to the evidence in this case. We find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining either of the assignments of error; nor do we think that further discussion of the questions presented by either of them is necessary.</p>
