Seven years afterwards he applied to the defendant’s agent for insurance and the agent asked the insured “who the title was in,” to which the insured replied “ the title is in me, I have the deed.” The defendant subsequently accepted two annual premiums, and the insurance was renewed without any further information or inquiry.

It is conceded that D. Caldwell at the time the policy was issued, and at the time of the fire, had an insurable interest in the property insured. At the time the policy was issued, D. Caldwell, so far as the legal title showed of record, was the absolute owner thereof. The deed to him contained no condition of trust, nor was there any'declaration of trust in relation thereto upon record. So that the trust under which the legal title was held was a secret trust so far as the public was concerned. The declaration of trust executed by D. Caldwell, <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>George A. Port and Joseph It. Cannon, January 7, 1885, defines the nature of the trust, as follows: “ The said Caldwell agrees to hold the title to the said property, purchased as aforesaid, for the joint use of himself and such of us as have contributed to the payment of the purchase-money aforesaid and when said property aforesaid is sold or disposed of by him he will distribute and pay to each contributor, as aforesaid, his <em>pro rata </em>share of the net proceeds thereof.” The condition of the trust, as above stated, left the property in the hands of the trustee, with power to sell and dispose of the same and account for the proceeds to his cestuis que trust. It then can hardly be said that a tenancy in common existed under its terms. It is not necessary to cite the very numerous decisions of our own courts and those of other states construing what amounts to “ unconditional and sole ownership ” as contained in the policy. It has been held that a vendee under articles having paid part of the purchase money, the vendor still holding the legal title, is such owner, and that such ownership by the insured is not a violation of such a clause in the policy. It has also been ruled that if the insured after taking out a policy with a clause such as contained in this policy, sell the property insured, under an executory contract, and retain the legal title until purchase money be paid, and loss occur before purchase money be paid or deed executed, is not a violation of the condition: Walter v.

And we are inclined to think that under the express term of the trust, had D.

The premiums in full were duly paid for the insurance of the whole. When the policies were first taken out in 1891, W. H. D’Armitt testifies that he asked the insured in whom the title was, and the insured replied that, “ the title is in me, I hold the deed.” He did not inquire as to the character of the ownership. He further testifies that he asked the question as to whom the title was in, because he had information as to mixed ownership. He does not state what information he had or from whom he received it. He says further, that when Mr. Caldwell told him that the title was in him; that he held the deed, that he (D’Armitt) took it for granted that Caldwell had bought the others out; by fuller inquiry he would no doubt have learned, if he did not know, the real character of the ownership. It seems to us that according to Mr. D’Armitt’s own testimony he had such information that practically amounted to knowledge of the interests of the other parties therein. The answer of Mr. Caldwell that the title was in him, that he held the deed, would seem to import that. If so, then may it not be fair to presume that the insurance was placed with such information as to ownership as was tantamount to knowledge thereof. And if so, then the company would be liable.</p>

His findings of fact together with his conclusions of law are set forth in the record and need not be repeated here.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.8",521,[199,937,1172,505]]]'>The policy in suit provides, among other things, that it “ shall be void if the interest of the insured be not truly stated therein .... or if the interest of the insured be otherwise than unconditional and sole ownership.” The learned judge was asked to hold, as matter of law, that there had been such violation of these provisions of the policy that there could be no recovery thereon. This he refused to do ; and, in view of the facts, and for reasons suggested by him in support of his judgment we are not prepared to say there is any substantial error therein. We find nothing in the record that requires a reversal.</p>
    <p id="b521-7" data-blocks='[["BL_521.9",521,[200,1449,1171,657]]]'>Plaintiff’s intestate, David Caldwell, acquired title to the property insured by sheriff’s deed in December, 1884. In January following he signed a paper recognizing the fact that George A. Port and three others had contributed to the purchase money of the property at the sheriff’s sale and agreeing that, when the property is sold or disposed of by him, he will distribute and pay to said contributors each Iris pro rata share of the proceeds. This declaration left the property in the hands of Caldwell, the sheriff’s vendee, with full power to sell or dispose of the same, as he might deem best, and account to the parties above referred to for their respective portions of the proceeds. In that way he held the legal title to the property and controlled the same until his death in April, 1893.</p>

He did not say from whom he derived that information. If he knew, as he testified he did, that more than one person was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof, and desired to ascertain who they were, etc., he should have prosecuted his inquiry further by asking Caldwell who, if any one, other than himself, was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof; but, he did not do so. On receiving Caldwell’s answer which was directly responsive to his question, he appears to have been satisfied with the information thus communicated, viz: that the legal title to the property was in Caldwell and that he had the deed therefor; and thereupon, as he says, he wrote the policy in Caldwell’s name, individually delivered it to him and received the premium. In the circumstances attending the writing and delivery of the first policy, Caldwell doubtless believed, and was warranted in assuming, that everything was satisfactory to the company. In January, 1892, and again in 1893, the annual premiums were paid by plaintiff’s intestate, and the insurance was renewed in his name alone, as before, without any further information or inquiry by either party. The company, through its agent, previously knew that more than one person was interested in the property or the proceeds thereof, and nothing was ever said or done by the insured to indicate anything to the contrary. As was rightly found by the court below, the insured acted in entire good faith. Whatever mistake, or worse than mistake, was made in writing the policy in the name of the holder of the legal title alone, it is clearly chargeable, not to the insured, but to the company’s agent, and should be imputed to the company itself.</p>
