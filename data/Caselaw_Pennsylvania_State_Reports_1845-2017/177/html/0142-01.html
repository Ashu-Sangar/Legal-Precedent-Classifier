At the time the bill was filed, and until recently, the defendant’s line was projected to run through the old retaining wall on the south side of the plaintiff’s viaduct, and rails were laid to a near-by point. This wall belongs to plaintiff and the defendant had no authority to remove or break into it until damages were arranged according to law. At the trial defendant filed an amended answer and put in evidence certified copies of records showing an abandonment of portions of its line and a change in the route at the place in dispute, and further proved that the place of crossing the plaintiff’s right of way by the line as amended is through the westernmost span of the viaduct on the bed of the <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>old New Cumberland turnpike. This span has been open for travel since the railroad was built nearly sixty years ago, and there is no evidence tending to show that it will ever be necessary or desirable for the proper prosecution of plaintiff’s business to close it. Defendant clearly has a right to construct its line across the plaintiff’s easement at this point, and as the proposed crossing is not at grade, no special order on the subject is necessary at this time. The franchises of a corporation may be taken in whole or in part, or even destroyed, in the exercise of the right of eminent domain by the commonwealth: Article 16, section 3, of the constitution; In re Towanda Bridge Company, <a href="/pa/91/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="488691" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0216-01">91 Pa. 216</a>; In re Twenty-second street, <a href="/pa/102/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="102 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="502718" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0108-01">102 Pa. 108</a>.</p>

If the elder one has exercised its power to condemn property for a right of way, and has constructed and is operating its road, that does not withdraw its right of way from the liability to be condemned for a crossing, to be enjoyed in common with a junior company. The right to cross is equal, and does not arise out of purchase. When the younger corporation has acquired its right of property in common with the elder in a crossing, they become joint and equal owners, bound by mutual obligations to each other and to the public to so use this common right as to do no unnecessary harm to each other or to the public: 1 Wood’s Railway Law, p. 680.

It does not follow from this, however, that the route of a small portion of the line may not be changed before actual construction, if deemed expedient, but the rule merely signifies that the owner of the land traversed by the first location may recover full damages, even if the road is not built on his property.

    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[252,717,1170,854]]]'>It is unnecessary to consider all the questions presented by this record. Such of them as are worthy of notice have been referred to, at least briefly, by the learned president of the common pleas in his opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law sent up with the record. The general and controlling question, however, is, whether a company chartered under the street railway act of May 14,1889 (P. L. 211), has the right to construct, maintain and operate its road across the lines of a steam railroad company, without the consent and against the protest of the latter, at a point where its roadway is not crossed by a public highway ? The answer to this question must, of course, be sought for in the expressly granted or necessarily implied powers and authority with which the street railway company has been invested by the law under which it was created and subject to which it continues to exist. If the right referred to cannot be found therein, it necessarily follows that the question must be answered in the negative.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[250,1579,1171,605]]]'>Section 1 of the act of 1889 provides: “ That any number of persons, not less than five, may form a company for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a street railway on any street or highway upon which no track is laid, or authorized to be laid or to be extended under any existing charter, with the privilege of so much of any street used or authorized to be used under any existing charter, as is hereinafter provided, for public use in the conveyance of passengers, by any power other than by locomotive; and for that purpose may make and sign articles of association, in which shall be stated .... the streets and highways upon which the said railway is to be laid and constructed.” etc.</p>

    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[164,633,1171,401]]]'>Section 14 authorizes the “use of such portion of the track of any other company, already laid down, as may be necessary to construct a circuit upon its own road at the end thereof.” The length of track, to be thus used, “ only with the consent of the local authorities of the city, borough or township, in no event, shall exceed five hundred feet of single track.” It also prescribes the mode in which compensation for such use shall be made, etc.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[164,1046,1176,394]]]'>The next section declares: “ No street passenger railway shall be constructed by any company incorporated under this act within the limits of any city, borough or township without the consent of the local authorities thereof, nor shall any street railway be incorporated hereunder which shall not have a continuous route from the beginning to the end, forming a complete circuit with its own track, excepting the five hundred feet to be used under section fourteen.”</p>

Indeed, the specific grant of these qualified rights is strongly indicative of legislative intention to withhold from such companies every other power of eminent domain. This conclusion is further fortified by the provisions intended to restrict them to established streets and highways as the location of their main lines, extensions and branches. As we have seen, their right to construct, maintain and operate street railways is specifically limited to existing streets and highways. The names of the streets and <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>highways selected by them must be stated in each company’s articles of association. In the recorded action of the company, exercising the branching power, etc., authorized by the act, it must also “ distinctly name the streets and highways on which said extension or branch is to be laid or constructed.” In brief, in the selection or adoption of the route, either of their main line, or of any extension or branch thereof, they are expressly confined to established streets or other avenues in cities and boroughs, and to public highways in townships, subject to such further restrictions, even as to them, as are specified in the act. Outside of and beyond the restricted power and authority, as to selection and adoption of a route etc., thus granted, they are not invested with any other authority in that regard, except such as may be necessarily implied. Without ignoring the well settled rules applicable to the construction of charters, it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that the legislature, in this carefully drawn and well guarded act, intended to withhold from companies chartered thereunder everything in the nature of a roving commission under which they might assert the right to locate, construct and operate street railroads wherever they pleased.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[248,1458,1169,862]]]'>It was successfully contended in the court below that the authority, given in section 18 of the act, “to cross at grade, diagonally or transversely, any railroad operated by steam or otherwise,” is general in its application and confers an unqualified right to cross a steam railroad anywhere without regard to whether there is an established street or highway crossing at the same point or not. This is a grave mistake. As we have seen, location, construction and operation of street railways are authorized only on established streets and highways. Section 18 is evidently predicated of that fact, and hence the authority therein granted is necessarily applicable only to crossings at points where the railroad is crossed by a street or highway. . In other words, it refers only to crossing at a point where the street or highway, on which the street railway is located, crosses the steam railroad. To hold otherwise would not only be contrary to the manifest intention of the legislature, but it would involve the constitutionality of the eighteenth section.</p>

Aside from the ownership in fee of the twenty feet wide strip, the plaintiff has a substantial property interest in its right of way which the defendant is bound to respect. While that interest cannot be called a fee, it is a species of title that has some of the incidents of an estate in land. As was well said by our Brother Mitchell in Railroad Co. v. Reading Paper Mills, <a href="/pa/149/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="149 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="832646" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0018-01">149 Pa. 18</a>, “Such title is sometimes called an easement, but it is a right to exclusive possession, to fence in, to build over the whole surface, to raise and maintain any appropriate superstructure including necessary foundations, and to deal with it, within the limits of railroad uses, as absolutely and as unconditionally as an owner in fee. There was no such easement at common law. ... It would seem to be rather a fee in the surface and so much beneath as may be necessary for support, though a base or conditional fee, terminable on the cessor of the use for railroad purposes. But whatever it may be called, it is in substance an interest in the land special and exclusive in its nature and which may be the subject of special injury . . . . , and therefore within the rule which governs the application of equitable relief.”</p>

To what extent the danger, from accident or other cause, would be increased, would of course depend very largely on the degree of care and skill exercised in the construction and maintenance of the bridge and in the operation of the street railway thereon, but that, under the most favorable circumstances, there would be an appreciable increase of danger, no one can doubt.</p>
