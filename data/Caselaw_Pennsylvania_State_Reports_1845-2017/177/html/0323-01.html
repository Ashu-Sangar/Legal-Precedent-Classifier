Blabon, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad and land of George W. Carpenter. The land fronting on Nicetown lane had been partly improved and built upon, and a part thereof theretofore conveyed by plaintiff in lots extending in depth northwardly two hundred and twenty feet. Plaintiff had at this time laid out the tract of land in question by plan, and. had placed thereon certain streets, known as Schuyler street on the east, sixty feet in width; a forty foot street immediately back of the Hunting Park avenue lots and a thirty foot street at a distance of one hundred and fifty feet north of said forty foot street running east and west called Midvale avenue. This plan was in existence on the 3d day of October, 1888. Lots had been laid out' between said forty foot wide street and said Midvale avenue, and numbered from 1 to 74 inclusive, and also lots between Midvale avenue and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad and fronting on said avenue numbered from 75 to 111 inclusive. <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>Previous to October 3, 1888, plaintiff had entered into contract of sale for lot No. 75 at the corner of Schuyler street and Midvale avenue, with one Ryder, and had received a payment on account of the consideration money of said purchase; and had also entered into a contract with one Bowman for the purchase of lots 109, 110, 111 fronting on Midvale avenue, and had received payments on account of the purchase money. On October 3, 1888, the defendant, James Howard, visited the plaintiff, Franklin S. Hovey, at his office, No. 248 Chestnut street, Philadelphia, with a view of purchasing some of the land in question; and after negotiations taking up the entire morning and up to 2 o’clock in the afternoon, an agreement of sale was arrived at, wherein defendant agreed to purchase and plaintiff agreed to sell the tract of land lying between the immediate rear of the Hunting Park avenue lots, the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad, the land of Carpenter and the lands of Blabon, for the price of sixteen thousand five hundred (16,500) dollars; three thousand (3,000) dollars cash down; two thousand (2,000) dollars to be paid on the 1st day of January, 1889, and the balance, eleven thousand five hundred (11,500) dollars on ground rent at five (5) per cent. Plaintiff contends that the agreement was for the sale of this tract, subject to the opening of streets laid down upon said plan known as plan No. 3, and excepting the lots 75, 109, 110 and 111 theretofore sold. Plaintiff instructed John C. Allen, in his employ, and who was familiar with his real estate matters, to write a receipt to defendant for f-3,000 on account of purchase money, saying that he had sold the ground on the terms mentioned above as to payment.

Negotiations were subsequently had between the parties to see if some understanding could not be arrived at, with a view to the satisfactory adjustment of the matter. Plaintiff offered to convey the lots numbered from 1 to 74 inclusive and Nos. 75,109,110 and 111 upon releases to him from the parties to whom he had already sold them, and agreed to sell and also convey the fee of Midvale avenue within the lines of his ground, and also from Schuyler street from said forty foot street on plan to the railroad, and subject as respects both streets, to easements acquired by purchasers of lots, and also subject to whatever interest they might have in the fee of the same, by virtue of their conveyances; that he would also convey the fee of the forty foot street abutting his lots subject to its use as a part of said street, and, as far as his interest was concerned, agree that said forty foot street should be made thirty feet. This was not accepted by defendant. Previously defendant had asked for a deed of tract bounded by Blabon on the northeast, by the railroad on the northwest, on the southeast by the land of said Hovey and others, fronting on Hunting Park avenue, and extending back two hundred and twenty feet, and by land of the Carpenter estate on the southwest as shown by the plan, upon it being understood and agreed that defendant should indemnify the plaintiff from all loss, trouble or demand that he might be put to by reason of outstanding conveyances, etc., and that Howard should lay out and dedicate to the city a street on the southeast portion of the said lot, immediately in the rear of the Hunting Park avenue lot thirty feet wide. On April 3,1889, plaintiff had tendered the defendant the deed duly executed and acknowl<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>edged, by himself and wife, dated Jannary 1,1889, for said lots laid down on said plan, 1 to 74 and 76 to 108 inclusive, reserving said ground rent of <em>$575, in </em>accordance with the understanding of plaintiff as to the contract and also tendered the defendant at the same time a deed duly executed and acknowledged, conveying to said defendant a certain portion of Schuyler street marked on said plan subject to any easements that might have been acquired by purchasers of lots bounding thereon. This tender was declined by defendant. On the 1st day of May, 1889, defendant James Howard by deed conveyed all his right, title and interest in said contract of sale to Benjamin F. Teller, by deed recorded in deed book G. G. P. No. 604, page 329. On the 21st day of November, 1889, Benjamin F. Teller conveyed back the same to James Howard by deed recorded G. G. P. No. 582, page 259. On November 13,1889, defendant Howard and wife conveyed to James T. Richards, the other defendant in these proceedings, all their right, title and interest in said contract by deed recorded G. G. P. 592, page 4. This deed was made for the purpose of collateral security, it is admitted, of an existing indebtedness of said Howard to said Richards. On July 10, 1890, plaintiff informed said J ames T. Richards that he elected to rescind the contract of sale, and tendered said Richards the sum of three thousand and fifty (3,050) dollars in cash, which he declined to accept. The plaintiff has thereupon filed his bill averring that the existence of said receipt so mistakenly given and the record now existing of said assignment of James Howard to Richards, is a cloud upon the title, and praying that the receipt be given up to be canceled and that James Howard and James T. Richards execute and deliver a written declaration in such form as shall be receivable in the office of the recorder of deeds of Philadelphia county, declaring that they have no right or title in the premises, and for general relief.</p>

That the plaintiff has always been ready to comply with his part of the contract, but that defendant Howard has refused so to comply. That on the 3d day of <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>April, 1889, deeds were duly tendered defendant Howard for the land sold in accordance with the contract but that defendant Howard has refused so to comply. That on the 3d day of April, 1889, deeds were duly tendered defendant Howard for the land sold in accordance with the contract and declined. That on July 10,1890, plaintiff elected to rescind the contract, and tendered to defendant Richards, then the holder of the receipt (and the evidence of said contract) the amount of money paid by defendant Richards, and interest, and requested the surrender of the receipt which was refused.</p>

    <p id="b353-10" data-blocks='[["BL_353.12",353,[119,1495,1167,706]]]'>We fire unable to discover any particular force in the contention that the bill should have been dismissed on the ground that Howard had no notice, before it was filed, of Hovey’s purpose to rescind the contract. Howard had assigned to James T. Richards, by deed dated November 30, 1889, and duly recorded in the proper office, whatever interests he acquired under his contract with Hovey. Before the institution of the suit Hovey had tendered to Richards all the money he had received from Howard on account of the contract, and it is clear that in the event of rescission Richards was the party entitled to receive it. He was made a corespondent with Howard in the suit and the same was heard and disposed of on its merits. There is no discernible cause for setting aside the decree if the findings on which it was based were warranted by the evidence.</p>

Hovey claimed that the <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>contract was oral and limited to certain lots of ground situate at Nicetown and numbered on a certain plan of lots belonging to him, while Howard claimed that the contract was written and included all the ground “ bounded by Blabon Carpenter on a line 220 feet northwest of Nicetown lane, and the Richmond branch of the Reading R. R.” Hovey also claimed that the description in the receipt was erroneous and unauthorized by him; that it was made through the inadvertence of his clerk and that immediately upon the discovery of the mistake he sought from Howard and was refused a correction of it. It was further claimed by Hovey that before the contract in question was made he had sold to other parties four lots upon the plan which were expressly excepted from his sale to Howard, and that the land he sold to the latter was sold subject to the easements which the plan gave to the owners of other lots located upon it. These claims were also denied by Howard whose principal insistence was that the land sold to him was correctly described in the receipt.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[251,1293,1165,542]]]'>In all the issues of fact made by the bill and answer the findings of the master are against the appellant. Those findings were warranted by the evidence and approved by the court. They established the contract as claimed by the appellee and show his willingness and the appellants refusal to comply with it. They also show that the latter sought to acquire through the mistake of the clerk that which he knew was not included in their contract. Surely under these circumstances he ought not to complain of the rescission of the contract and the payment of the money received thereunder to the party who by his own deed was entitled to it.</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[251,1854,1161,93]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
