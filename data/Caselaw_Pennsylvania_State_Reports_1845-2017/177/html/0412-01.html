C. W.” The letters “P. C. W.” were the initials of the senior member of plaintiff’s firm. The defendants’ trade-mark was described for registration as consisting of the letters “ W. H. W., made in script in white on a dark ground.” The letters “W. H. W.” were the initials of the founder of defendants’ business. Both plaintiffs and defendants were engaged in manufacturing confectionery, and both used the marks above described on boxes in which caramels were packed. These boxes were known as stock boxes, and were manufactured by box makers, and sold to the public generally. The court below issued an injunction restraining defendant from using the letters W. H. W. printed in script, in white, in a horizontal line upon a red background. <em>Held', </em>to be error.</p>

Bennett, Esq., as master, who found that Peter C. Wiest, in 1872, founded the business of the manufacture and wholesale and retail of confectionery; that in 1883 he adopted the initials of his name, “ P. C. W.,” in the form of Spencerian script in white on a red background as a trade-mark; that he transferred his business with the trademark in 1885 to the firm of P. C. Wiest &amp; Company, composed of Peter C. Wiest and Daniel F. Lafean, who caused it to be registered in the Patent Office at Washington on the 27th day of May, 1890, as of No. 17957. The statement or specification accompanying the application on which this registration was based was “ Our trade-mark consists of the letters, ‘ P. C. W.’ These letters have generally been arranged as shown in the accompanying facsimile in which they appear in script printed in a horizontal line upon a background of any suitable color, but other forms of letters may be employed, or they may be dif<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>ferently arranged without materially altering the character of our trade-mark, the essential features of which are the letters, ‘ P. C. W.’ This trade-mark has been used continuously by us in business since about January, 1883. The class of merchandise to which this trade-mark is appropriated is confectionery and the particular description of goods comprised in such class on which it is used is candies. It has been our practice to mark the trade-mark upon the boxes and papers of all kinds in which the confectionery is packed.” This trade-mark was formally transferred and assigned with the business on the 18th of January, 1892, to the new firm of P. C. Wiest &amp; Company, organized on that day, and by said company transferred and'assigned to the present plaintiffs when the firm was organized on the 9th day of December, 1892. This trade-mark and label has been used continuously since its adoption in 1883 by the said Peter C. Wiest and the different firms aforesaid which have succeeded to the business, by being placed upon the boxes and packages of candies and caramels manufactured and sold in that business. The business has been a large and constantly increasing one, so that for some years it has had a capital stock of over $100,000, and employed between four hundred and five hundred people in the city of York, and its sales have run up to several tons of confectionery daily and thousands of cases yearly, consisting in large measure of what are known in the confectionery business as caramels, made from different ingredients, and having different distinguishing names. These goods have attained a good deal of popularity throughout the country in jobbing and retail confectionery trade as of superior quality and desirability, and by reason of the name of the founder of the business, the preservation of his name in the different succeeding firms, and the trade-mark and label already referred to, these goods have become well and widely known as the “ P. C. W.” or the “ P.'C. Wiest” goods.</p>

Weeks, has been engaged in the confectionery business to a greater or less extent for the last twenty years in the borough of Hazleton, this county. Since October, 1892, he has been associated in his business with Henry Loechel of Pottsville. In the beginning it was proposed between him and his partner that their firm should be in the form of a limited association to be called “ W. H. Weeks Company, <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>Limited,” but no papers were executed in pursuance of this plan, and after carrying on the business as W. H. Weeks Company, Limited, up to the 1st of January, 1898, the name was changed to and has since existed as that of “ W. H. Weeks Company.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-3" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[115,578,1166,555]]]'>12. Formerly the business of the defendant, William H. Weeks, was mainly that of a jobber and retailer of confectionery, but for a number of years he has also manufactured, to some extent, what are called “ plain goods ” and “ caramel ” goods. The caramel goods manufactured by him, however, were not put up and sold in boxes with labels upon them until the spring of 1891, although in 1886 or 1887 he adopted and used for certain purposes, a rough form of label with the Roman letters “ W. H. W.,” being the initials of his name. From 1885 to 1891, he handled the P. C. Wiest goods' put up in boxes and packages bearing upon them the P. C. W. trade-mark.</p>

Wiest goods and began the manufacture of caramels on a larger scale than previously, and to put up caramels of his own manufacture in the form of boxes and packages of a character similar to those used by the plaintiffs. At the same time he remodeled as his trade-mark the initial letters of his name “W. II. W.” by using them on a finer label in the form of Spencerian script, in white on a red background, and continuously since then this trade-mark and label have been used by him and the firm of W.- II. Weeks Company which succeeded him, by being placed upon boxes and packages of candies and caramels manufactured and sold by them.</p>

W. label and tracle-mark, the plaintiffs and their predecessor in the business put and have been putting up the candies and caramels manufactured and sold by them, in square or nearly square strawboard or pasteboard boxes of different sizes, sometimes painted or colored red on the outside and sometimes of the natural color of the board as manufactured. On the ends of these boxes proper the red label with the trademark “ P. C. W.” upon it has been placed, and on the end of the box cover corresponding with the labeled end of the box, the names given to the confectionery inside have been put, with the number of single pieces of confectionery contained therein, and the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>addition of certain numbers of these pieces “ for one cent,” these words and figures being indicative in themselves, not of the origin or ownership of the confectionery, hut more particularly of the somewhat arbitrary names given to it, of the quantity contained in the box, the size of the pieces comprising its total contents and the number of these pieces that may be sold “for one cent.”</p>

H. W. label has been placed; while on the corresponding end of the box cover have been put names which in many cases are alike or show greater or less similarity to those upon the plaintiffs’ boxes, and with the same numbers upon them.

C. W.” printed in Spencerian style horizontally across a red label, and warned him that unless he desisted from further infringement they would restrain Mm from using the label which he had adopted. Mr. Weeks replied that he thought he had a perfect right to use his own label or any other that would not be “ P. C. W.” That he had submitted the matter to the best authority he knew of and should be governed by their advice; that there were some conflicting decisions in parallel cases, and just at present he could not decide which was the best course to pursue, but hoped in a few days to arrive at the facts.

The substance of this evidence is as follows: That of Mr. Wiest is that while he can see a difference on close inspection, yet a person of ordinary intelligence would be misled by the similarity of the labels, and that defendants’ method of putting up and packing their goods in boxes with their trade-mark attached, so resembles that of the plaintiffs as to be calculated to deceive buyers. Also that he has often heard complaints of that character from the trade. That of Mr. Williams is that defendants’ packages and label are calculated to deceive buyers in general; while Mr. Dougherty thinks the deception would occur with many of the people with whom he deals, who are more or less ignorant; and Messrs. Metzger and Case say the deception would occur to persons not ac<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>customed to handling the goods. Mr. Metzger, however, says he would not be deceived nor would an ordinarily prudent man, if he made close examination. Mr, Switzgable says the similarity between the labels is so close that a person who came into his store thought, from seeing the plaintiffs’ goods and label there, that the witness was handling the goods of the defendants ; while Mr. Aston says that after handling the Wiest goods for a number of years he, in asking for more of these, received instead, from the person from whom he was buying, a quantity of the Weeks goods, and only discovered the mistake when, his customers afterwards made complaint as to the quality of the latter goods, he examined the boxes and found that they were the goods of the defendants.</p>

These witnesses are William H. Weeks, Thomas W. Haines, Frank E. Weeks, F. W. Pedrick, John Specht, John C. Bush, James F. Hubley, J. B. Labaugh, Frank Seely, Frank Toole and John L. Perkins. Eight of these say that in their opinion persons who could and would actually read the two labels would not be deceived in purchasing the Weeks goods with the belief that they were purchasing the Wiest goods. Five of these eight, as also the ninth and the tenth witnesses say that persons of ordinary intelligence and prudence would not be deceived, while the eleventh one says he cannot tell whether persons of the character last referred to would be deceived, but thinks one who could read very plain would not take one label for the other. Such of these several witnesses as were asked the question say that they, personally, would not be deceived by the similarity of the labels, that they never have been, and never heard of others who were. In the course of the cross-examination of these different witnesses, however, the existence of a greater or less similarity between the two labels is admitted. Most of them, when questioned, concede in the two a similarity in the red background in the white lines indicating the letters “P. C. W.” and “W. H.

Quite likely this is true so far as concerns whole-, sale dealers who know of the two manufactories, for as the trademark P. C. W. indicates goods manufactured by P. C.

In the same case on this point the court also stated the issue substantially to the same effect hy saying in another connection that the label complained of must be so similar in appearance that any person using such reasonable care and observation as the public generally are capable of using and may be expected to exercise, would mistake the one for the other. And again, that in order to entitle the plaintiffs to relief by injunction, the resemblance must he such that ordinary purchasers dealing with ordinary caution are likely to be misled. The above case was followed in Brown et al. v.

The mere registration of a description and claim of a sign or mark, alleged to have been adopted and used, does not actually make a trade-mark of that which before was not possessed of the essential qualities of that species of property. It does not operate to create a title to the exclusive use of a symbol which could not be a trade-mark without registration. In other words, the recognition and protection given in general to a trade-mark rest upon principles of common law, and registration is only the means of proclaiming <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>to the public the evidence of ownership, to wit: the fact that the sign adopted as such has been and is in use by the proprietor.

Burgess, cited from 17 Eng. Law and Eq. 257, in Lauman’s Appeal, supra. It is therefore held that as a general rule a man cannot turn his name into trade-mark. See Browne, Trade-Marks, sections 195-206. So in Pratt’s Appeal, supra, which was the case of a trade-mark consisting of a cornucopia with the plaintiffs’ name “ Darlington,” stamped upon it, the court say (page 411) “ the master has found, and we think correctly, that the distinguishing feature of the plaintiffs’ trademark is the cornucopia. It is a symbol, a device, which the plaintiffs have adopted to mark their butter. Had they used merely the name ‘ Darlington,’ any other person of that name could have stamped his butter as Darlington’s butter. The mere name of a person or of a place cannot, as a general rule, be appropriated as a trade-mark; at least not in the sense of preventing another person, having the same name or residing in the same place, from using it.”</p>

They were held at the common law to be against public policy because against common right. The grants, charters, letters patent, or other form of device or assurance, by the sovereign for their creation were declared by the act of parliament of 21 James I. chap. 8, to be “ utterly void and of none effect, and in nowise to be put in use and operation.” Nothing short of the “omnipotence of parliament” is able to exclude a subject from trade in England: Bacon’s Ab. vol. 7, p. 23. Two exceptions to this general rule were given by the early text writers. First, “It seemeth clear that the king may, for a reasonable time, make a good grant to any one of the sole use of any art invented or first brought into the realm by the grantee.” Second, The king may grant to particular persons the sole use of some particular employments, as “ of printing the Holy Scriptures, and law books,” etc. The somewhat curious reason given for the second exception is that an unrestrained liberty to print the books to which it relates might be “ of dangerous consequences to the public.” To these exceptions a third must now be added, viz, the right of a tradesman to the exclusive use of such signs, words or symbols as he may have adopted and used in his business to distinguish articles of his own production from all similar articles produced by other persons. These exceptions do not impair the force of the general rule. Exceptio probat regulam de rebus non exceptis. The rule is unrestricted liberty in the practice of all arts and trades and in the use of the methods by which they are conducted. He who asserts the right to an exclusive privilege in any department of business must bring himself under the protection of some recognized exception to the rule. The plaintiff in this case claims an exclusive privilege under the third exception, viz, the right to the sole use of a certain trade-mark adopted, used, and registered by him; and he alleges that the defendant has adopted and is now using a trade-mark which is an imitation of, and an infringement upon, his own. It becomes important therefore to learn just what the plaintiff’s trade-mark is, and then to determine whether <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>it has been improperly imitated by the defendant. In the bill filed in this case the plaintiff’s trade-mark is fully described, and the precise form in which it is registered in the U. S. Patent Office is given as follows: “ Our trade mark consists of the letters ‘P..C. W.’ These letters have generally been arranged as shown in the accompanying fae-simile, in which they appear as script, printed in a horizontal line upon a background of any suitable color; but other forms of letters may be employed, or they may be differently arranged without materially altering the character of our trade mark, the essential features of which are the letters ‘ P. C. W.’” The business of the plaintiffs was the manufacture of confectionery goods, and particularly of that kind of confectionery known as caramels. The caramels when finished were put in boxes of various sizes and forms, which are manufactured by box makers and sold to the public generally. The plaintiff had no exclusive right to their use. They were what is known as stock boxes. When the boxes were filled the particular kind of caramel they contained wao indicated by printed slips or labels pasted upon them in some suitable position, and another slip or label was placed on each box having the trade-mark “P. C. W.,” which indicated that the caramels were the genuine production of the plaintiff’s factory. These letters were the initials of the name of P. C. Wiest and no one but the owner of the name could rightfully use them without authority from him. The trade-mark of the defendant consisted also of the initials of the founder of the business done by it, W. H. Weeks; and it is described in the answer and in the statement registered in the <em>U. S. </em>Patent Office as consisting of the letters “ W. H. W.” made in script, in white, on a dark ground.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[295,1882,1163,503]],["BL_451.1",451,[133,355,1175,1580]]]'>The defendants are engaged in the manufacture of confectionery and state in their answer that their goods include stick candies, toy forms, caramels, plain confections, candied fruits, leaves, nuts, and the like. These when prepared for use are packed in boxes of various sizes and forms, each of which bears a slip or label indicating the variety of confectionery it contains, and another slip or label displaying the trade-mark which affords to the purchaser an assurance that the goods he is about to buy are the genuine product of the defendant’s establishment. As a general proposition the right of W. H. <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Weeks to the use of his name or initials as a trade-mark is as clear as that of P. C. Wiest to the use of-his name or initials: Hoyt v. Hoyt, <a href="/pa/143/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="143 Pa. 623" data-case-ids="978543" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0623-01">143 Pa. 623</a>. They are not the same. They do not even bear a close resemblance to each other; and the master reached the correct conclusion that there was neither imitation nor infringement shown by the evidence. If the initials had been the same we do not see how the defendant could have been restrained from using his own, although in that case we think there should have been something in the manner of use to distinguish, and enable the public to distinguish, the product of the rival establishments from each other; and it is probable that without it a court of equity would have restrained the second comer. But in a recent case in New York, Higgins v. Higgins Soap Co., <a href="/citations/?q=27%20L.R.A.%2042" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="27 L.R.A. 42">27 L. R. A. 42</a>, it was held that the prior use of one’s name by other persons in the same business does not destroy the right of him whose name it is to use it. The right to use one’s own name seems to have been held to be a personal right as clear in business as in personal correspondence. We have, however, no such question here. The master has recommended, and the court below has issued, an injunction against the defendant restraining him from the use of the letters “ W. H. W.” printed in script, in white, in a horizontal line upon a red background. This decree says to the defendant, “ you have a right to your trade-mark and may lawfully use it ” but, going beyond the claim of the plaintiff as stated in the bill it adds, you must not use the same kind of letters, or mode of arrangement, or colors used by the plaintiff. Now these accessories constitute no part of the plaintiff’s trade-mark. The description filed in the U. S. Patent Office states that the letters are generally used in script, but may be used in any other way.</p>
    <p id="b451-3" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[131,1943,1165,452]],["BL_452.1",452,[271,363,1163,148]]]'>They are put upon a background of “ any suitable color,” no color whatever being named. If this injunction can be sustained on the ground on which it was put in the court below, there is no style of letter, no mode of arrangement, no color in the solar spectrum, to which the plaintiffs cannot lay equal claim. But as the plaintiffs themselves say in the description from which we have quoted, “ the essential characteristic of our trade-mark is the letters P. C. W.” Those are what indicate the ownership and origin of the goods, and they carry their <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>assurance to the public without regard to their own shape, arrangement or color. A tradesman can have no exclusive, right to mathematical lines, to styles of printing or colors.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[254,517,1178,1166]]]'>The master finds that the defendant has adopted boxes and packages quite like those used by the plaintiff. The same is no doubt true of most of the confectioners in the commonwealth. The boxes and packages are made by box manufacturers to contain an even number of pounds, or fractions of a pound, and are necessarily uniform in size and general appearance. They are made for the trade and are sold to the trade, without discrimination. The plaintiff and the defendant have an equal right to buy from the manufacturers; and they must buy boxes of the sizes and shapes made for, and in use by, confectioners generally. The similarity in size and shape of the boxes does not therefore justify the master in finding that they were selected for an improper or fraudulent <em>purpose; </em>for the size and shape of the boxes are determined by the makers and fixed upon with a view to the accommodation of the largest number of purchasers. The other circumstance to which the master refers as justifying his decree is the use of the same names for varieties of candies that the plaintiff had previously used, and perhaps devised. But one who invents a machine or a new combination, or devises a new article, contributes the result of his skill and his inventive powers to the public if he does not take the necessary steps to secure himself an exclusive right to use and vend his invention.</p>

The ground on which the courts will interfere in such cases is to protect the inventor from the attempt of his neighbor to sell his own work as and for the work of the inventor. This would be enjoined as a fraud upon both the inventor and the public; but so long as he sells his own work as his own, any man may imitate the unprotected work of any other man as closely as he is able. We think the injunction awarded in this case cannot be sustained upon the findings of the learned master, and should be set aside.</p>
