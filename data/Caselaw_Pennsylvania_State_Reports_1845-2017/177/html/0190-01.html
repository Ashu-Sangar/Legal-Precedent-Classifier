Nothing herein, however, is to effect the original provisions of my will concerning my youngest son, Matthew.”</blockquote>

By his last will, executed at Chicago, November 27, 1891, he made a specific bequest to the appellant Luther Laflin Mills in trust for Matthew Mills, son of said trustee, and left the residue of his estate to his sisters, Mrs. Mills and Mrs. Brainard. This will was duly probated, and, as executor and trustee therein named, appellant claims the corpus bequeathed to Matthew L. Boies in trust, etc., by the will of his father Joseph M. Boies.</p>

The validity of Matthew’s will is not denied, nor can it be doubted that, if he had any right or title, beyond an equitable life interest, ha or to the share given him by his father, the same passed to appellant by Matthew’s will. There is no dispute as to who are the legal heirs of Joseph M. Boies; so that, if he died intestate as to the corpus of Matthew’s one fourth, the distribution confirmed by the court is correct. The case, therefore, appears to resolve itself into the question whether Matthew took more than an equitable interest for fife only in the share given him by his father’s will; and that, of course, depends on the proper construction of the residuary clause above quoted.</p>

Another rule requires that (so far as. is consistent with the will as a whole) effect must be given to the words and, if possible, all the words of the testator used in their ordinary and natural sigiaification, etc. Other rules are that the presumption <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>is always against intestacy, that the law regards with favor the heir or the first taker, and that an estate will always be construed to be a fee rather than a less estate. But, as was well said by the learned judge who specially presided in this case, these rules “ are to be applied when the meaning of the words is doubtful; for no rule, except a hard and fast one adopted for some reason of policy, or a rule upon which titles have come to depend, can override the clear expression of a testator’s will. If that be also lawful, it must be carried out without regard to the fact that ‘ another testator has used the same words with a different meaning.’ ”</p>

Standing, as we find it, however, in immediate connection with those words and the provisions which follow, it is qualified by them, but not, as we think, to the extent claimed by the appellee and sanctioned by the court below. It is conceded by them that, in using the four words above quoted, the testator did not mean “ conditions ” in the legal sense of that word. It is very evident to us that he employed the phrase only in the sense of “on the following terms,” or “subject to the following trusts.” As to “ the shares going to ” his son Henry and his daughters Mari and Ella B., he directs that they “ shall be held by each of them in trust for their children.” What he intended by this is explained in the codicil. As to “ the share going to ” his son Matthew, he provides that it “ shall be held in trust by ” his son Henry, and that Henry shall pay to Matthew “ the income from his share in quarterly payments each and every year during ” Matthew’s natural life. As to the corpus of Matthew’s share, the only other provision that is made by the testator is that “ in case Matthew shall reform and abstain from the use of all intoxicating drinks for two years,” the trustee for Matthew’s life of the corpus shall pay Matthew “from three thousand to five thousand dollars to enable him to engage in business.” In his codicil, he is careful to say: “Nothing herein ... is to affect the original provisions of my will concerning my youngest son Matthew.”</p>

      <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>We cannot assent to the proposition that the qualifying language employed, in relation to “ the share going ” to Matthew should have the effect of practically revoking or nullifying the preceding absolute gift of that share to him, and, in lieu thereof, giving him an equitable interest therein for life only, nor do we think any such result was intended by the testator. On the' contrary, what he doubtless did intend, and all that the language employed by him fairly means, was to protect his son Matthew from the probable consequences of his unfortunate habit and secure to him the use and enjoyment of the income of his share, in quarterly payments during his life, without stripping him of authority to dispose of the corpus, by will or otherwise, to take effect at his death. With that object in view he directed the share “ going to ” Matthew to be held in trust by Henry, etc., during Matthew’s natural life. He thus created, an active trust for Matthew’s protection and benefit, limited im duration to the period of his natural life, without making any further disposition whatever of the corpus, or otherwise restricting Matthew’s authority to dispose of it as he did. In some respects the case, in principle, resembles Snyder v. Baer, <a href="/pa/144/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="144 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="823776" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0278-01">144 Pa. 278</a>, Silknitter’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/45/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="45 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="9503015" data-case-paths="/pa/45/0365-01">45 Pa. 365</a>, Sproul’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/105/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="105 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="454249" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0438-01">105 Pa. 438</a>, and other cases cited by appellant.</p>

It is a long and well settled rule “ that a will must, be so construed as to avoid partial intestacy unless the contrary is unavoidable: ” Boards of Missions’ Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20513" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="91 Pa. 513">91 Pa. 513</a>; Scofield v.

In view of the provision made by the testator for his other grandchildren, it is scarcely possible to conceive that he intended to so dispose of Matthew’s share that his children, if he should leave any, would receive nothing. If he had intended to thus virtually disinherit them he doubtless would have done so in terms that could not be misunderstood,. <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>but, as we have seen there is nothing in the will to indicate any intention to restrict Matthew’s share to an equitable interest for his life only. Further consideration of the questions involved is unnecessary. Enough has been said to show that the share given to Matthew was not cut down to an equitable life estate but was vested in him subject to the trust created for his protection and benefit, and that he had a right to dispose of the •corpus as he did.</p>
