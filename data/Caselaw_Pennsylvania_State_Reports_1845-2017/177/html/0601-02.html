It consisted of an overdraft of $9,254.54 and the balance upon the indorsements by the Ridgway Bank of a number of negotiable notes which had been discounted by the American Exchange National Bank for the Ridgway Bank. When the Ridgway Bank became insolvent and receivers were appointed none of these notes had matured. They became due and were protested after the appointment of the receivers. These notes were not an existing liability of the Ridgway Bank at the time of the appointment of the receivers, and their liability attached only after protest and due notice to the Ridgway Bank as indorsers. Some of these notes were paid before and some after the first distribution by the makers. The principle invoked by the counsel for the American Exchange National Bank, that “ a creditor is entitled to a dividend under an assignment, not merely as a creditor, but as an equitable owner of the assigned estate; and the extent of his ownership is fixed by the amount of his claim when the assignment is made” (Miller’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/35/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="35 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="990502" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0481-01">35 Pa. 481</a>) has no application. At the time of the appointment of the receivers the American Exchange National Bank had no claim against the Ridgway Bank on these discounted notes, as they were not due. The American Exchange National Bank did not become creditors of the Ridgway Bank until after the notes fell due and were protested, which was after the appointment of the receivers. Consequently the American Exchange National Bank did not become equitable owners of the insolvent estate when the receivers were appointed to the amount of these notes, as they were not an existing liability at that time and have only become claims against the estate since the appointment of the receivers.</p>

It is perfectly clear that so far as the rediscounted notes which were paid at maturity by the makers <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>are concerned, there was not, and could not be, any liability to the appellant on the part of the Ridgway Bank. The indorsement by the latter was’ at the best a mere contingent liability which could never become absolute if the paper was paid at maturity, by the makers, as was in fact done. Hence it follows that the Ridgway Bank was never a debtor to the appellant, either when the receivers were appointed, or at any time thereafter. It is not possible to apply the doctrine of Miller’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/35/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="35 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="990502" data-case-paths="/pa/35/0481-01">35 Pa. 481</a>, to such a case because the fundamental facts upon which that decision was founded are absent. It was there held that the creditors of a voluntary assignor are the equitable owners of the assigned estate at the time of the assignment, and their rights are vested as of that date. Being the owner of a vested interest in the assigned estate, the creditor is entitled to a distribution of the proceeds of the estate, in the proportion which his claim bears to the aggregate of all the claims. Plaving the interest in the case cited, he was entitled to its fruits in any event, and was not to be deprived of them because he was able to secure partial payment of his claim by the subsequent attachment of a legacy, which fell to the assignor after the assignment, and therefore was no part of the assigned estate. It will be seen at once that no one who was not an actual creditor of the assignor at the time of the assignment could claim the benefit of the decision in that case, because he had no interest in the estate assigned. In this case, the appellant, so far as the notes now in question are concerned, not only was not a creditor of the Ridgway Bank at the time the receivers were appointed, but never became a creditor for any amount, at any time after. How then can the appellant claim the benefit of a relation which it never sustained to the Ridgway Bank. It is impossible.</p>

No rights can be subsequently acquired by a creditor which will entitle him to a larger participation in the estate of such insolvent corporation. This ruling was made in reference to the distribution of the estate of an insolvent insurance company. The appellant held a policy upon which a loss occurred after the decree of dissolution was made, and claimed a dividend upon the whole amount of insurance. But we held that the rights of all creditors were fixed as of the time of the dissolution, and must be adjudged as of that date, and a claim arising subsequently could not be considered. We therefore held that, a dividend could only he awarded upon the amount of the premium paid and not upon the loss.</p>

This we regard as correct. The assignments of error are all dismissed.</p>
