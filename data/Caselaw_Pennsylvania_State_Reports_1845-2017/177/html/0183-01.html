The evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that the view of the track in the direction from which the train approached which struck the deceased was obstructed. A witness for plaintiff whose testimony was contradicted stated that the deceased stopped at a point about thirty feet from the crossing. At this point the view along the track was about sixty-eight feet. At thirteen feet from the crossing the view along the track was six hundred and sixty-five feet, but at this point tbe safety gates if lowered would have come upon the driver, or between the horses and the driver. The evidence for plaintiff also tended to show that the train was run at a high rate of speed and that the safety gates were up. <em>Held, </em>that the case was for the jury.</p>

A colored man named Johnson who was driving a wagon near the deceased at the time of the accident testified that the deceased stopped about thirty feet from the crossing. Johnson’s testimony was contradicted and his reputation for truth partially impeached. There was some testimony of Roberts’ admission before his death that he had not stopped before driving upon the track. At a point thirty feet from the crossing a view could be had along the railroad track about sixty-eight feet from the crossing. At thirteen feet from the crossing the view along the track was six hundred and sixty-five feet, but at this point the safety gates, if lowered, would have come upon the driver, or between the horses and the driver.

When death occurs from an accident, the presumption of law is that the decedent performed his duty of stopping, looking and listening, bnt this presumption is slight and can be easily rebutted. But the plaintiff in this case does not depend upon this presumption alone. You are to consider all the testimony on this point. You heard the testimony of Mrs. Coar, and of the colored man, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson says that Roberts stopped about a minute at a distance of about thirty feet from the track. You also heard the testimony of Dr. Lowry and Mr. Crippen as to Roberts’ declarations in the hospital on the afternoon of the 18th. The reliability of this testimony, and the credibility of the witnesses, are matters for your consideration. You have a right to take into consideration the physical and mental condition of Roberts after the accident, and while in the hospital, as well as the credibility of Johnson as a witness. Witnesses on the stand have said that Johnson’s reputation for truth and veracity is bad. Some of the witnesses refer to a period ten years ago, when he lived in PeckviUe, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>and others to a more recent period. The purpose of this testimony is to affect his credibility as a witness. You are to determine what effect it has upon his testimony. [Several witnesses say that they did not see another wagon at the scene and at the time of the accident, but Mr. Gordon says he saw Johnson there at the scene, although he did not notice the wagon.] [8] In weighing this testimony you should take a reasonable view of all the events connected with the accident, the excitement incident thereto, the ability of the several witnesses to observe the surroundings, the accuracy of their recollection, and their credibility as witnesses.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[165,1258,1176,1017]]]'>If a traveler on the highway in approaching a crossing, either on foot or in a wagon, stops where it will do him no good, and will not enable him to protect himself against an approaching train, he does not stop in the right place. There is considerable testimony on this branch of the case. Several measurements have been made so as to determine the line of vision up the track in a northerly direction from several points on Carbon street. These measurements are not exactly the same. The two surveyors, Mr. Bartl and Mr. Mason, differ to some extent. The view up the track has been given you from the distance of thirteen, twenty, thirty, forty and fifty feet from points on Carbon street. I need not repeat the figures to you, but I say to you that a traveler is not required to get into a place of danger in order to perform his duty. [If Roberts had stopped thirteen feet from the track, according to the testimony of Mr. Mason, the gates, if lowered, would have come either on the driver or between the horses and the driver. Of course I refer to the east rail of the northbound track. The law does not require this, but the traveler must stop at the best place for his own protection under all the circumstances.] [9]</p>

    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.7",209,[190,573,1169,1222]]]'>In any view that can be reasonably taken of the testimony that was properly before the jury, this was clearly a case for them on questions of fact involving the defendant company’s negligence, and also the alleged contributory negligence of plaintiff’s husband, since deceased. The testimony, covering over three hundred and fifty pages in all, is too voluminous to admit of anything more than a general reference to its character and effect.' A careful examination of it, as a whole, has convinced us that any attempt to do more would subserve no useful purpose. Without, therefore, referring even to its salient points, relating to said questions of negligence and contributory negligence, it is sufficient to say, it was of such a character that it became the manifest duty of the learned trial judge to submit it to the jury, with proper instructions as to the law applicable to the facts that might be found by them therefrom. That was accordingly done in a clear, well-guarded and adequate charge, in which we find no substantial error. The controlling questions of fact, on which plaintiff’s right to recover depended, were definitively settled by the verdict in her favor. It necessarily implies a finding to the effect that the defendant company was guilty of negligence which was the proximate cause of the death of plaintiff’s husband, and that no negligent act of his contributed thereto. That such a finding was fully warranted by the testimony cannot be doubted.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.8",209,[190,1803,1168,502]]]'>It follows from what has been said that the judgment should not be disturbed. A careful consideration of the record with reference to each of the specifications of error has satisfied us that neither of them should be sustained. The first challenges the correctness of the court’s answer to defendant’s fifth point. In view of the evidence before the jury, there was no error in saying that it was for them “ to ascertain whether the decedent in this case could not have a proper view of the track without getting out of the wagon.” An unqualified affirmance of the point would have been error.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.9",209,[193,2311,1163,96]],["BL_210.1",210,[261,364,1166,149]]]'>The next five specifications complain of the refusal of the court to affirm defendant’s points recited therein respectively. <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>We find no error in tbe learned judge’s answers to either of these points; nor do we think there is anything in them that requires discussion.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[256,521,1171,502]]]'>The subject of complaint in the seventh specification is the affirmance of plaintiff’s second point, viz: “ Safety gates which should be closed in case of danger, if standing open, are an invitation to the traveler on the highway to cross, and while tins fact does not relieve him from the duty of exercising care, it is .a fact for the consideration of the jury in determining whether he exercised care according to the circumstances.” It requires no argument to show that this proposition is correct, especially in view of the evidence in this case, and hence there was no error in affirming it.</p>
