Prior to the accident the plaintiff had one arm, and in consequence of the accident he lost the other. The evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that the defendants who were father and son entered into a contract with the Mid-vale Steel Works by which they undertook to break up steel ingots. To carry out the contract a limestone quarry in Plymouth township was leased, and a structure placed thereon for breaking up the steel. At the time of the accident plaintiff was employed in an adjoining quarry used by the supervisors of the township. George Hagey, one of the defendants, claimed that he had no interest in the contract, and that he simply advanced the money to the other defendant, his son Samuel, to carry it out.</p>

On the part of the defendants it has been testified that there were two or three layers of these logs, and that they had used all reasonable precautions to protect the public.

As the present action is brought against the defendants as <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>joint trespassers, and the statement of plaintiff’s claim alleges that on the 21st day of April, 1894, they were engaged in blasting with dynamite large masses of steel, which blasting was done negligently and wrongfully and carelessly, so that in consequence thereof plaintiff was hurt and injured in the manner described, the burden of proof is on him to show these alleged facts affirmatively by positive evidence that the defendants were on that day jointly engaged in such blasting, and that the work was done in the negligent and careless manner complained of, and that plaintiff was injured in consequence thereof, or the verdict must be for the defendants. And if the evidence shows that only one of them was so engaged in blasting on that day, and in such negligent and careless manner, the verdict can only be rendered against that one, as the actual wrongdoer, and must be in favor of the other defendant. Answer: In order to recover in this case, the plaintiff must convince the jury by the weight of the testimony that his injuries were the result of the negligence of the defendants, or one of them, or because of the negligence of the servants of the defendants, or one of them, in the operation of blasting steel, causing the accident. If both defendants were interested in the operation, in the sense that they were joint owners thereof, or that it was carried on for their joint benefit, then they would both be liable for any acts or negligence contributing thereto, and neither would be excused from the fact that he was not present on the day of the accident. If the jury find that either defendant was not interested in the operation of blasting in the sense that he was not an owner, or that it was not carried on for his benefit on the day of the accident, then the verdict should be in favor of such defendant. If George Hagey merely loaned money to Samuel that fact alone would not make him liable in this action. But if he was interested in the operation, the mere fact that he was not present on that particular day would not excuse him.] [7]</p>

The learned court below charged <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>the jury thus: “ But I instruct you as a matter of law that no matter what precautions they took, if, notwithstanding these precautions, these missiles did fly from that place and did cause bilis injury, then in the law they would be liable in this action. So far as that branch of the case therefore is concerned I apprehend you will have no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion.” The plain meaning of this language is that the defendants were absolutely liable if the missiles did fly from the place of blasting, and did cause the injury. As there was no dispute about either of these facts the instruction was a practical direction to find for the plaintiff, without any reference to the question of negligence. Of course this is not the law, and the learned court had previously instructed the jury that the defendants were not liable unless they were guilty of negligence. But in the above quoted extract from the charge the learned judge told the jury that no matter what precautions were used to prevent the discharge of the missiles, the defendants were liable if the missiles escaped and caused the injury. In other words the mere fact of the accident established the right of recovery without proof of negligence. As this is in direct hostility with the earlier part of the charge there would necessarily be much confusion in the minds of the jurymen as to what the law really was. Thus the learned court at the opening of the charge said to the jury: “ It is undisputed that he (the plaintiff) sustained an injury. This in itself, would not sustain his action, unless he shows to your satisfaction that it was caused by negligence, and therefore, in considering this ease, our first duty is to inquire as to whether the evidence convinces you that there was negligence in the case.” According to the part of the charge covered by the fifth assignment no inquiry as to negligence was necessary, because no matter what precautions were taken by the defendants, they were absolutely liable if the plaintiff sustained his injury by missiles thrown from the quarry. As these conflicting instructions would materially tend to mislead the jury, and as the part of the charge excepted to is clearly erroneous, the fifth assignment must be sustained.</p>

If the engine is known, all the authorities concur that previous emissions of sparks by that engine may be shown. This whole subject is so thoroughly discussed in an elaborate opinion by our late Brother Clauk in the case of Henderson v.

The actual presence of the defendant at the moment of the accident was not necessary to make him liable, if the other facts and circumstances were sufficient to show liability.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[159,787,1174,711]]]'>The answer to the seventh point of defendant seems to us to be entirely correct. The plaintiff’s statement of claim does not charge the defendants as partners, nor as joint tort feasors in the sense that they were subject to a joint obligation, or had a joint interest in the business. They were charged rather as two independent persons both of whom were liable for a permanent injury inflicted by them both. Of course if both were hable under the evidence, the verdict should be against both, if one only was hable in accordance with the testimony, and the other was not, the verdict should be against the one who was, and in favor of the one who was not. If neither was hable the verdict should be for the defendants. This is precisely what the court charged and we fail to discover any error in it. These assignments are dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[159,1507,1174,912]],["BL_162.1",162,[254,375,1167,295]]]'>Ninth, tenth and eleventh assignments. There is no merit in these assignments and they are not sustained. The court below was not asked to charge the jury that if they believed the testimony of the witnesses named in the ninth assignment, George Hagey had no interest in the business, and therefore there was no error in not so charging. The court could not possibly instruct the jury that there was no evidence that there was any joint ownership, interest or management in the business of steel blasting at the place in question, because there was much testimony showing the participation of both in the conduct of the business. This evidence was necessarily for the jury and could not be withdrawn from them. It must be confessed that the explanatory testimony of the fact that George Hagey’s name appears in the papers as the party contracting and otherwise participating, and the positive testimony of both defendants that George Hagey had no interest in the business, seem to be sufficient to establish that fact, yet it is a question of fact, and the credibility of the witnesses, and the effect of the various <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>facts and circumstances in evidence as they bear upon that subject, was for tbe jury to determine, and could not be taken from them. We think the court below was not in error in submitting tbe case to tbe jury although it is quite possible that we would have reached a different conclusion if we were disposing of tbe facts. Judgment reversed and new venire awarded.</p>
