The deed was prepared under the'advice of the family physician who had knowledge of the grantor’s mental condition when he came of age. The deed was presented to the grantor together with a statement of the amount of his property, which he professed to understand. • He stated that he desired his guardian to be the trustee, but acquiesced in the temporary appointment of his uncle until his guardian should file an account and be discharged. The uncle consulted with the attorney of the guardian, and when the deed was prepared the grantor visited the attorney, who carefully explained the deed, and after discussion with the grantor, a clause was inserted at the grantor’s suggestion giving to the trustee discretion as to how much of the income should be paid to the grantor, and also a clause making the deed irrevocable. The guardian had no knowledge of the deed until after its execution. The estate amounted to about $165,000, and the compensation of the trustee was fixed by the deed at $500 per year. About five years after the execution of the deed the grantor at the suggestion of his wife’s uncle executed a deed of revocation, and subsequently filed a bill in equity to enforce the revocation. The evidence did not show that there had been any marked improvement in the grantor’s mental powers or business capacity after the date of the execution of the deed. <em>Held, </em>that the deed of trust should not be revoked; and that the bill should be dismissed.</p>

Neal was a young man possessed of a large estate. He was of weak intellect, but with sufficient ability to recognize his incapacity. He was inexperienced in business, and whether it was because of improper education, as alleged by his witness, or inability to take a proper education, as said by those more intimately associated with him, the fact remained, and even he himself did not expect improvement. It was certainly wise in him to put it into the hands of some one able and willing to take care of it, and upon terms which would prevent waste by mismanagement and so that it might not be “ coaxed ” from him. The trustee selected was a well known business man of unquestioned integrity, a friend of his grandfather, who had shown his ability by increasing his estate while guardian, from about $97,000 to about $165,000. Unless something'in the special provisions is found to be unreasonable, the deed could not be held to be improvident. We will, therefore, examine the matters suggested by counsel in their order as stated:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[112,1298,1168,298]]]'>1. “It strips Neal of all his property without any valid reason therefor.” This is not in accordance with the fact. The deed does not give away any part of his estate, except $500 a year as compensation to the trustee for management. It does give to the trustee the power to control it, for the very good reason that he did not feel able to safely manage it himself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[108,1605,1171,248]]]'>2. “ It contains no power of revocation.” This is a fact; but it does not of itself render the deed improvident. It was inserted upon full consideration and at his request, as stated by Mr. Lewis. To have made the deed revocable would have •defeated the purpose for which it was made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-7" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[110,1862,1173,502]]]'>3. “ Because it leaves him at the discretion of the trustee as to what portion of the income he shall receive from his own property.” This provision was made after full discussion, and practically at Neal’s suggestion. The income was large and he felt that it might be wasted and preferred that it, like the rest •of his estate, should be protected by the judgment of his trustee. No difficulty has so far arisen. Neal has had all he asked and presumably all he needed. If the trustee should unreasonably withhold the income, he is under control of the court and may be compelled to do his duty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-8" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[159,2372,1122,42]],["BL_120.1",120,[311,370,1167,237]]]'>4. “ Because it makes no provision for future contingencies <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>or emérgencies.” The income of the estate was probably deemed sufficient to provide for all contingencies. It is ample for the liberal support of a family and the accumulations would probably be sufficient to meet any unusual demands. If not, the entire estate is within the control of the court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[311,625,1167,246]]]'>5. “ Because it gives unsafe and unwise power to the trustee.” If a man retains control of his properly he has unlimited power over it.

There is no reason why he should be when he is selected by the grantor and he alone is interested in the estate. Presumably he is selected because of his ability and integrity and for the convenience of the grantor, and it. would be unreasonable for the grantor to ask a third person to stand good for the default of his own agent.

Black has the power to name a new trustee without security ” has more force. But this alone ought not to strike down the deed. It may seem unwise to give the power to name a new trustee to Black. Neal doubtless thought that if the occasion arose Black would act only for his (Neal’s) good, and that his acquaintance with the business world would enable him to make a better selection. He would not be likely to act without consultation with Neal, and if' he undertook improperly to act contrary to Neal’s wishes, he could be restrained.</p>

There is no reason why it should be revoked, while there are many why it should be sustained.” The facts of that case and the reasoning from them, as stated by Justice Dean, would aptly apply to this case by substituting “natural incapacity,” for “drunkenness and fear of insanity.” It meets nearly every question raised in this case. He very clearly shows that the fact that the deeds contained no clause of revocation did not affect its validity, because such a clause would have defeated the object of the trust.
