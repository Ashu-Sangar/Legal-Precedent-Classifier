R., two railroad companies, entered into a contract with the S. M. R. R. and the G. &amp; H. R. R,, two other railroad companies which were not parallel or competing lines, by which the four companies agreed to interchange traffic and cars, sell through tickets for passengers, and issue through bills of lading for freight. The P. R. R. and the C. V. R. R. also agreed to set apart fifteen per cent of <em>the gross </em>receipts of freight and passenger traffic to and from any points on the four roads, and pay the same to the trustee of a mortgage to secure bonds issued by the G. &amp; H. R. R. to build an extension of its road. These bonds were payable in thirty years, and to each bond was attached a memorandum of this provision of the agreement. The bonds were sold at par, and the extension of the G. &amp; H. R. R. subsequently completed. For nine years the P. R. R. and C. V. R. R. paid to the trustee the fifteen per cent upon the traffic receipts. About nine years after the date of the contract, the P. &amp; R. R. R. obtained a controlling interest in the stock of the G. <em>&amp; </em>H. R. R., and all of the stock of the S. M. R. R. The officers and directors were changed, and the two roads were consolidated under the name of the G. <em>&amp; </em>H. Ry. About the same time the H. R. R. was incorporated to build a railroad parallel and competing with the C. V. R. R. After the <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>completion of this road by orders of the general manager of the P. &amp; R. R. R., the traffic arrangements with the C. V. R. R. and the P. R. R. were disregarded, and the traffic contract was practically extinguished. The P. R. R. and the C. V. R. R. filed abill in equity against the G. &amp; H. Ry., and P. &amp; R. R. R., and the H. R. R. for the specific performance of the traffic contract above referred to. Some of the material portions of the contract were as follows: “Parties of the third and fourth parts (S. M. R. R. and G. &amp; H. R. R.) hereby respectively covenant and agree that they will so far as they lawfully can send to destination all traffic controlled by them via the lines of the parties of the fust and second parts. ... It being the intention that their lines shall be worked as far as possible in harmony with each other. . . . Nothing in this contract shall be so construed as to give the use of the roads and facilities of the parties of the first and second parts hereto to any parties whose interests may be at variance with, or unfriendly to said parties, nor shall the same be used hereunder to divert from the parties of the first and second part traffic properly tributary to the lines controlled by them.” <em>Held, </em>(1) that as the contract was wholly between connecting railroads, not competing or parallel, it was for the benefit of the public; (2) that under the terms of the contract the court could not assume that it was intended to unlawfully exclude traffic; (3) that as the P. R. R. and the C. Y. R. R. were bound to set aside fifteen per cent of the gross receipts to secure the bonds, and as the S. M. R. R., and the G. &amp; H. R. R. had received in large part the consideration for entering into the contract, the contract ought to be enforced specifically; (4) that the consolidation of the S. M. R. R. and the G. &amp; II. R. R. did not change the identity of the corporations nor their contract liability, inasmuch as equity deals with the substance, and not the form, when it seeks to enforce its decrees; (5) that the mere change of name and personnel of the boards of directors was no obstacle to a mandatory writ in aid of a restraining order; (6) that the contract could not be revoked by either party on notice, as it was fixed by its terms to continue for thirty years; (7) that the contract was sufficiently definite in its terms to enable the court to specifically enforce it; (8) that the complainants were entitled to a decree of specific performance.</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/92/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="92 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="490991" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0150-01">92 Pa. 150</a>. In Tonawanda R. R. Co. v. N. Y., L. E. &amp; W. R. R. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=42%20Hun%2C%20496" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 Hun, 496">42 Hun, 496</a>, a traffic agreement between two railroad companies, by which each covenanted that it would use its influence to promote the interests and business of the other, so far as it could do so with a proper regard for its own interests, was held to be valid. It was there further held that the parties having entered upon and enjoyed the benefits of the contract for a long period of time, it was too late for one of them to assert that the contract was void because it had no power to secure its performance in the manner stipulated in the instrument; neither party could assert such a defense after entering upon and enjoying the benefits of the contract. A court will not refuse to enforce specific performance of a contract between railroad companies because it involves acts of a continuou.s and perhaps complicated character extending over a long period of years. In Union P. R. R. Co. v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 51 Am. &amp; Eng. Railroad Cases, p. 162, the following language is used: “ The next objection made to this decree is that this contract is not one of which specific performance can be enforced in equity; that the acts to be performed under it are so numerous and complicated, and their performance is to extend through so long a term of years, that it would be impracticable for any court to supervise and <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>enforce such performance. The question here presented is no longer open for consideration in the federal courts. It is settled adversely to the appellants by the decision in Joy v. City of St. Louis, <a href="/us/138/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="138 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3550017" data-case-paths="/us/138/0001-01">138 U. S. 1</a>.” ... It is a settled rule in equity that the specific performance of a contract -will not be decreed, unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself; so courts of equity will not ordinarily entertain bills for the specific execution of contracts with variations or additions, or new terms to be made or introduced into them by parol: Hammer v. McEldowney, <a href="/pa/46/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="46 Pa. 334" data-case-ids="420624" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0334-01">46 Pa. 334</a>. The proposition is conceded by all parties concerned that where goods have to pass over two or more connecting lines in order to reach their destination, the shipper may designate the route and the shipping road must observe his directions. In the matter of jurisdiction, it is not material to this case that there was no demand for arbitration, under the ninth article of this agreement, before suit brought. The provision in regard to arbitration which is there contained is not adequate to oust the jurisdiction of the courts: Commercial Union Assurance Co. v.

Prior to July 1, 1891, the earnings arising from joint business were divided on a twenty mile block basis. The testimony in the case is to the effect that this division was inequitable to the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company and that said company could not continue to exist under such an arrangement. On June 4, 1891, at a meeting between <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the representative freight agents of the Cumberland Yalley Railroad Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, a memorandum was made of a proposed division of the earnings from freight traffic exchanged between the former company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, on a fifty mile block basis, which proposed division was subsequently declared by the general freight agent of the former company to be satisfactory, and it only went into effect on July 1,1891. The same through rates were continued in force as previously, the only change being in the method of apportionment between the two companies. An arrangement by which “ arbitrarles ” were charged on business exchanged between the line of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company and on the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company also went into effect on the same date. These arbitrarles, which were ostensibly “ figured on a basis of fifty miles for all points on the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad,” in reality constituted charges on the basis of blocks of one hundred miles, and they were intended to give the average charges upon that block system. The division between the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company and the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company was upon the same mileage block basis. Special arbitrarles for anthracite coal, etc., were also fixed. The above mentioned rates have continued in force ever since. . . . After a careful consideration of all the facts of the ease, we are satisfied that the court would not be justified in adjudging the twenty mile block system to be a proper basis for the apportionment of joint earnings, and further, that, there is not anything in the bill taken in connection with the evidence which would warrant a decree of any kind in relation to a mileage basis.</p>

A shareholder has a right, at a meeting of shareholders, to vote upon a measure, even though he has a personal interest therein separate from that possessed by others. In such a meeting each shareholder represents himself and his interests solely, and he in no sense acts as a trustee or representative of others.

But the plaintiffs further state in their bill that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company since it obtained control, in May, 1891, of the lines of the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad Company, has operated said roads as part of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading system, in such manner as to promote the interchange of business with itself, to the exclusion as far as possible of the plaintiffs’ roads and other lines. It is further stated that since the acquisition of control as aforesaid by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company and by reason thereof, the above mentioned parties of the third and fourth parts to the agreement of September 30, 1882, and the company into which they were consolidated in July, 1891, have not kept the covenants and stipulations of the said agreement, although requested to do so. Our 18th finding of fact'sots forth in a general way the facts in relation to the operation of the merged lines by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company as follows :</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[114,516,1178,1724]]]'>There is no prayer in the bill against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company for specific performance, but the only prayer in relation to that company (except prayer 2 which is refused, because immaterial), is that numbered 5 for an injunction to restrain it “from exerting or using the control, obtained by stock ownership, in the said Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company in any wise to the detriment of the' rights of the plaintiffs under the said contract of September 30th, 1882.” Would the court be justified in granting the injunction prayed for? Under the principles of law above referred to we are of the opinion that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company has a right to use its control obtained by stock ownership in the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company, in any way that it deems best, so long as the minority stockholders are content, and that the injunction asked for in prayer 5 should not be granted. Any remedy, therefore, which may be granted to the plaintiffs against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company can be allowed only under, and by virtue of, the prayer for general relief. We are also of opinion that the fact that the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company has taken actual possession of the lines of the consolidated companies, and conducted their operations exclusively through its own officials, cannot properly be considered to be the result of a control obtained by stock ownership, although without such ownership it ■would doubtless not have been able to take possession. Therefore if the prayer in the bill were for an injunction restraining the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company from holding possession of and operating the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway, to the detriment of the rights of the plaintiffs under the contract of September 30, 1882, it would correctly state the only relief against the first named company which under any circumstances the bill would justify; and would present to the court the real problem which is entirely irrespective of stock ownership.</p>

Although the special relief asked may not be allowed, yet the court will, if possible, grant such relief as the allegations will support, in order to meet the demands of justice between the parties; so where a bill asking for an assignment of a mortgage was not allowed, yet the court, upon certain averments in the bill, sustained it as a bill to redeem; 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 764.

It seemed to be conceded at the argument, though not distinctly admitted, that the fact that the receivers had been made parties defendant by leave of the court which appointed them, made them amenable to the decree of this court in all respects as fully as the other parties. If the practice in the United States courts should prove to be otherwise, the plaintiff should apply to the court which appointed the receivers for leave to have the subjoined decree against them carried into effect.</p>

From Carlisle, a point on the Cumberland Yalley Railroad eighteen miles southwest of Harrisburg, the South Mountain Railway &amp; Mining Company operated a railroad for eighteen miles to Pine Grove, hr a southeasterly direction; this road had a connection and interchanged traffic with the Cumberland Valley. In 1882, the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad was incorporated to be built from Hunter’s Run, a point on the South Mountain Railway about ten miles from Carlisle, to the town of Gettysburg in Adams county, a distance of about twenty-one miles. This last company needed funds to build, and thereupon all four roads named, on 30th of September, 1882, entered into an agreement by which it was covenanted, they would, to promote their mutual interests, interchange traffic and cars on their respective roads; would sell through coupon tickets for passengers ; make through bills of lading for freight; and the joint earnings of the business coming from and going over the Harrisburg &amp; Gettysburg road should be apportioned among the respective parties on a mileage basis thereafter to be agreed upon, and the •whole connecting system of the four roads should be operated in harmony in the development of traffic ; the South Mountain <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>and Harrisburg and Gettysburg at the same time covenanting they would, so far as they lawfully could, send traffic to destination over the lines of tibe Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania Railroads. In consideration thereof, these two last named roads covenanted to set apart fifteen per cent of the gross receipts of freight and passenger traffic to and from any points upon the South Mountain and Gettysburg and Harrisburg roads to and from any points on the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania roads, and pay the same to the trustee in a mortgage of $250,000 to secure bonds to be issued on such mortgage on the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railroad, the bonds to be payable in thirty years with interest at six per cent, the trustee to appropriate the fund thus raised annually in the purchase of the bonds; it was further agreed the trustee should attach to each bond a memorandum of this provision of the agreement. The bonds were soon after all sold at par, and the road completed to Gettysburg in April, 1884. A prosperous business was built up; the Cumberland Valley paid, of the fifteen per cent set apart by it in the purchase of bonds in the first five years after the road was opened, $18,000, and the Pennsylvania, $19,000.</p>

About the same time, the Hunter’s Run &amp; Slate Belt Railroad was incorporated to build a road from Pine Grove, the southern terminus of the South Mountain, to the slate quarries, a distance of about five miles; then, a traffic contract for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years was made between the different companies, and such leases made as were deemed desirable, with the stipulation that all traffic was to be sent to destination by the Reading and lines controlled or operated by its connections. At the date of these contracts, the contract with the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania of 80th of September, 1882, was known to all parties. Soon after, by orders of the general manager of the Reading, the connection between trains running on the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania was broken, <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>through, billing of freight and the sale of coupon tickets were stopped; the theretofore agreement for apportionment of receipts on a mileage basis was also disregarded; in fact, the business accruing to'the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania under their traffic contract was practically extinguished, as concerned them. Thereupon these two companies filed this bill setting out these facts and praying: 1. For a decree of specific performance of the contract as against the* Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg Railway Company into which the two contracting roads had been consolidated, and 2. For an injunction against the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Company and its receivers in aid of such decree.

The contract was not, therefore, forbidden by the constitution. It was in fact an advantage to the public, as well as to the contracting parties, for it relieved the public of the inconvenience of transfer of goods, rebilling, provided for travelers close connections, and necessarily lessened the actual cost of transportation; and there is no evidence the contract was made with a view to increase charges to the shipper; the profits of the contracting parties were expected to result from a lessening of operating expenses to all of them. Any such contract inevitably tends to the advantage of the public, for the cheaper any product can be delivered at destination, the better able is the producer to meet in the market the same products brought to the same destination by other roads, which last always aim to reach and do reach the points where products are marketable. The contract really tends to accomplish the purpose of the general railroad law of 1868, which provides that railroads of a similar character shall have the right to connect upon such terms as may be agreed upon by those who have the management of such roads; and also of the constitution, which declares they shall have the right to connect, and then avows the purpose, that they may “ receive and transport each the other’s passengers, tonnage and cars, loaded or empty, without delay or discrimination.” We conclude, therefore, the contract was not between parallel and competing roads; nor was it unlawful in its ostensible purpose. Whether any of its provisions are unlawful, or whether because of the indefiniteness of others, it is incapable of specific execution, are altogether different questions, and these we now proceed to notice.</p>
    <p id="b579-3" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[122,2023,1169,401]],["BL_580.1",580,[288,388,1167,1986]]]'>It is alleged by defendants the contract attempts to exclude other railroads from any use of the roads controlled by the contracting parties. This is only inferential; there is nothing in the contract expressive of such intention. The 5th section of the agreement provides that: “ The parties of the third and fourth parts (the South Mountain and the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg roads) hereby respectively covenant and agree that they will, so far as they lawfully can, send to destination all traffic <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>controlled by them via the lines of the parties of tbe first and second parts hereto.” Then further, the sixth section: “It being the intention of the parties hereto that their lines shall be worked as far as possible in harmony with each other;” the two stronger roads covenanting that they will, so far as they can consistently with obligations to other parties, promote the development and interchange of traffic, and carry it at as favorable rates as they accord to any others. Up to this point there is nothing even hinting at a course of conduct violative of either the common or statute law. Nor is the eighth obnoxious to the law. It is as follows: “Nothing in this contract shall be so construed as to give the use of the roads and facilities of the parties of the first and second parts hereto (the Cumberland Valley and Pennsylvania) to any parties whose interests may be at variance with or unfriendly to said parties, nor shall the same be used hereunder to divert from the parties of the first and second parts, traffic properly tributary to the lines controlled by them.” The object of this provision, it is clear, had no application to circumstances as they existed when the contract was made September 30, 1882. The Philadelphia, Harrisburg &amp; Pittsburg Railroad, running from Shippensburg to Harrisburg and crossing the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road six miles south of Carlisle, was not opened for nearly ten years after the date of this contract; it is leased and controlled by the Philadelphia &amp; Reading, and not only is a parallel and competing road with the Cumberland Valley, but was probably intended to be such by its promoters. This section of the contract had in contemplation, doubtless, the construction of this or any other road to be thereafter built; but its provisions could not legally prevent either the one party or the other, after a connection was established as provided by law, from interchange of traffic, nor could it prevent shippers from routing freight to destination over any lines they selected, no matter what the point of shipment or destination. All that can be said of this section is, it may have contemplated a violation of law; if it did, no such violation is shown, although the contract was in operation for years. As it is capable of a wholly different and lawful interpretation, we cannot assume it was intended to unlawfully exclude traffic.</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[330,2381,1121,44]],["BL_581.1",581,[98,361,1167,503]]]'>It seems to us, the argument and the authorities cited to show <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>the illegality of the contract bear on a state of facts other than those found in this case. If this agreement was intended to give a preference to a certain class of shippers or transporters, and to exclude others, shipping and transporting under like circumstances, it would be void, and Sandford v. Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Pa.%20878" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="24 Pa. 878">24 Pa. 878</a>, and like cases would be in point. But it is wholly between connecting roads, not competing or parallel, for interchange of traffic upon terms agreed upon; and they expressly disclaim any intention to violate the law by stipulating to promote their mutual interests so far as they lawfully can.</p>
    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.4",581,[96,873,1168,1259]]]'>Before the construction of the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road, plaintiffs agreed to set aside fifteen per cent of certain gross receipts for purchase of the bonds of that road, which had thirty years to run; that at once gave them a value to the investing public, who, it is to be presumed, now hold them; they have thirty years to run; to every one of them, by full authority of plaintiffs, was appended a memorandum of this agreement; the road was constructed from the money thus received; by virtue of this stipulation, already nearly $40,000 has been set aside and appropriated to the purchase of these bonds, and the action of these plaintiffs, having made this part of the contract, in effect, a contract between them and the bondholder, their liability by the contract will continue until the last bond has been paid; that is, nothing the obligor in the bond, the Gettysburg &amp; Harrisburg road, may do in violation of the contract, can relieve plaintiffs from, in substance, their contract with the bondholder to continue to set aside fifteen per cent of the gross receipts for purchase of bonds. The South Mountain and Gettysburg roads having received in large part the consideration for entering into the contract, and the contract not being in violation of law, it ought to be enforced specifically, if it be of such terms as that it is capable of enforcement in equity, and if the parties, as they now stand in relation to each other, can be brought within the jurisdiction of equity, so that the hand of a chancellor will reach them.</p>

It was manifestly, therefore, to the Reading’s interest as the practical owner of a competing line, to break the contract with the plaintiffs. It proceeded to do so without hesitation, acting nominally through the new boards of management in the roads over which it had secured control.' But a change of persons in a corporation board of directors does not change the identity of the corporation, nor its contract liability; nor is the obligation of the other party to the contract affected ; such change can no more relieve the corporation from its contract liability than from the $250,000 mortgage on its corporate property. What effect the dissolution of the corporation under judicial decree or the sale of its franchise and property under proceedings in bankruptcy would have on unsecured contracts are altogether different questions. Here, the two corporations, at the instance of stockholders having full knowledge of the prior contract, were consolidated under a new name and different management; but for juridical purposes, the new managers and new name present no obstacle to a judicial decree for performance of a contract. Equity deals with the substance, not the form, when it seeks to enforce its decrees. This was in effect held in Bald Eagle Valley Railroad v. Nittany Valley Railroad, <a href="/pa/171/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="171 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="985543" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0284-01">171 Pa. 284</a>. Counsel are mistaken in assuming the decision in that case was based solety on Tulk v. Moxhay, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phil.%20774" class="citation" data-index="135" data-cite="2 Phil. 774">2 Phil. 774</a>. The court below, in the case first cited, had based its decree on Spencer’s case, and Keppell v. Bailey, 2 Myl. &amp; K. 517; Tulk v. Moxhay was cited by us as overruling Keppell v. Bailey, and deciding that where the covenant was, the purchaser and his assigns would use or abstain from using the land in a particular manner, that equity would enforce the covenant against all purchasers with notice of it. The doctrine of that ease has been applied in later eases in England only to restrictive covenants. But this court has not so limited the principle, by confining the administration of equity in like cases to a restraining order; to accomplish equity, where there is no adequate remedy at law, often demands mandatory orders : Thou shalt do, as well as, thou shalt not. True, the restrictive order is generally more easily enforced than one purely mandatory; in practice, often, the latter is incapable of <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>enforcement; but where such order can be enforced in aid of an equitable decree it will be issued, and ought to be. In the mere change of name and personnel of the boards we see no serious obstacle to a mandatory writ in aid of a restraining order.</p>
    <p id="b583-3" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[84,588,1170,657]]]'>It is further argued that as the term for which the contract Was made is not fixed, therefore it continued only during the will of the parties, and might be revoked by either on notice. This, as a general proposition, if the fact were as stated, is correct, and it is so held in Phila. etc. Railroad v. River Front Railroad, <a href="/pa/168/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="168 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="868519" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0357-01">168 Pa. 357</a>, and the authorities there cited. But the term in this contract is fixed by the plainest implication; the bonds to be purchased ran for thirty years ; the obligation of plaintiffs was to set aside annually fifteen per cent of the gross receipts, to be used in annual purchase of the bonds. The term of defendants’ obligation under the joint contract must be coextensive as to time with plaintiffs’ obligation to set aside and pay ; that is, thirty years.</p>

While the exact details by which each shall receive and transport promptly the other’s traffic, and how the joint earnings shall be apportioned on a mileage basis, cannot now be particularized by the court, the primary stipulations of the contract are definite, and as to them has been entered a decree that they shall be performed specifically; the purpose of defendants to stop the interchange of traffic under the contract has been arrested by this decree; the contract is now obligatory upon all the parties, and is to be performed according to its manifest intent; when this is done in good faith, the daily operations of the respective roads alone can determine the exact details necessary to effective obedience of the decree. In case of dispute as to the particular methods, either can call into opera,tion the arbitration clause, or if this be unavailing, either can, on proper proof, secure from the court below a supplementary decree, which in the light of the evidence that may then be adduced will carry out fully the decree already made. While parties to such contract can agree definitely that they will pro<a id="p564" href="#p564" data-label="564" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*564</a>mote and facilitate tbe interchange of cars and business between their respective roads, and that the earnings from the joint business shall be apportioned on a mileage basis, it would be practically impossible to enumerate in the agreement all the details by which it should be carried into effect; these would necessarily have to be postponed until the daily operations of the road suggested what would best promote their convenience and that of the public.</p>
