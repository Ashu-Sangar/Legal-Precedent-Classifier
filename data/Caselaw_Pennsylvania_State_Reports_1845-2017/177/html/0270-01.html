What .amount, if any, they contributed to the formation of the general partnership does not appear. At all events, they started it by purchasing from Isaac Watermann the Chulaski Furnace for $20,000, which they paid 'for by a purchase money mortgage to be paid off in quarterly installments of $1,250. This conveyance was made on October 11,1879, and the business began. It was •continued as a general partnership until March 29,1880, when, by the articles, it was transformed into a partnership limited. The exact state of the accounts on March 29 does not appear, 'but there is an account of March 81, only two days thereafter, which for all practical purposes may be taken to have been the true state of affairs on March 29. From this account it appears that the firm was then indebted in the sum of $23,930.07, and that the value of its assets was $45,750.95, leaving a book value •of $21,820.88 as the excess of assets over liabilities. In making up this statement the Chulaski Furnace property was carried at $20,366.25, and the balance due on the mortgage therefor <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>was stated at $18,750. The chief item of the net assets was a charge against the Glendower IronWorks of $15,469.42. This concern was a corporation composed of the same parties who-took and handled all the product of the firm. Whether the claim against the Glendower Iron Works was based upon a full settlement of accounts between the parties to that date is not clear. The Glendower Iron Works’ account as of the same date, on its own books, made the claim $14,831.91, and from the testimony in the case the relations between the two concerns appear to have been so intimate that there is room for the thought that their accounts may not at all times have been perfectly clear and exact. This, in view of the fact that the members of the partnership association were also members of the corporation would not be surprising. When the partnership association was organized no change was made in the running of the business, and the old books of the general partnership were used as theretofore. An examination of the ledger of the firm shows the following curious facts: Neither of the partners received any credit for capital put into the partnership, and the presumption is that they invested none. Greveling’s account has as its first entry a charge to it of cash withdrawn on June 30,1880, of $20.00, and as its first credit it has four items dated December 31,1880, nine months after the formation of the partnership limited, “by furnace property and furnace account,” $42,217.99. This is carried down on January 1, 1881, as a balance to the credit of A. Creveling of $42,197.99. On February 28, 1881, he is charged with profit and loss of $531.33, and on December 31, 1881, there are two series of entries, one a debit series and the other a credit series, in which, on the debit side, Creveling has charged back to him the $42,217.99 which were credited to him at the beginning of the year, and has credited back to him the $531.33 which were charged to him on February 28, 1881; so that on December 31, 1881, all the entries up to that time made canceled each other, and his account stood as if it had been left blank. Thereupon, on the same day, a new start is made by crediting him on December 31, 1881, furnace account, $25,000; and a charge is made of capital stock, $33,000, leaving due by him on January 1, 1882, $8,000, being the amount of cash capital to be contributed.</p>

A general partnership may by complying with the proper forms convert itself into a partnership limited. The mere fact that the books of the old firm continued to be used would not seem to be fatal, since there is no provision in the act requiring the use of new books; nor, indeed, is the use of any book whatever specifically commanded, except the subscription list book. The use of the old books, at all events, seems <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>due merely to incompetency or injudicious economy, and not to any design to evade the statute or commit fraud.</p>

By the act of 1874 it is not necessary for a valid organization that the entire subscribed capital should be paid into the treasury before an association can begin business, but the statement must show when, and in what amounts, the subscriptions are to be paid; and the subscription list book is evidently provided in order that it may thereafter show the payment, or the failure to pay the installments falling due after the recording of the statement. The purpose of the act is that the capital shall alone be liable for the debts of the association, whence the importance of precisely stating in the articles what it is, and when and how it is to be contributed. Unfortunately for the defendants in this case, their statement that the remainder of the capital stock of the partnership association, amounting to $24,000, fifty per centum of which should be paid on or before June 1, 1880, and the balance at such times and in such installments as might be called for by the managers of the association, does not answer the requirements of the statute. The statute does not allow the capital to be payable upon a mere contingency, least of all on a contingency which cannot happen except at the will of the partners. The articles of association, as was remarked by Mr. Justice Williams in Hill v. Stetler, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20Pa.%20161" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="127 Pa. 161">127 Pa. 161</a>, are not in the form of a contract between the partners, but of a certificate for the information of the public. If at the time of the making of the articles the members had agreed when the last fifty per cent should be paid, it was their duty to impart this information to the public. If, on the other hand, they had not agreed, then there was no time fixed for the payment of that balance, and the failure to fix such a time was a fatal defect which rendered the articles ineffective to create a partnership limited under the act. This rule will seem harsh and technical only to him who loses sight of the basis of the act of 1874, namely, the capital must be contributed for the protection of the creditors. By this contribution assets are received upon which the business may be conducted. If, however, for the actual contribution of the assets at the formation of the partnership or at a specified time thereafter, the partners substitute an indefinite undertaking to pay when they will, the business is <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>hampered, its chances of success reduced and a vague promise is made to do duty for the substantial capital contemplated by the statute. How this will work the case in hand illustrates. Two of the three partners are confessed^ insolvent, and a call now made would be practically fruitless.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-3" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[113,663,1172,1783]],["BL_298.1",298,[261,378,1166,553]]]'>As to the third and fourth points : The referee is of opinion that it was the duty of the defendants to describe exactly the property contributed to the firm. The contributed property was in effect an equity of redemption in the Chulaski Furnace property, which might have been set forth and described in any one of several forms. The mere description of the real estate was accurate enough if the statement had also been made that it was subject to a purchase money mortgage of $20,000, of which $1,250 had been paid. The failure to do this leaves even the valuation doubtful, for it may be thought on the one hand that the whole property is worth $75,000, considered clear of incumbrances; or, on the other hand, that the equity of redemption is worth $75,000. If the valuation of the whole property were $75,000, the effect of it in this case would be to render the whole statement false, because as the $75,000 would be subject to a deduction of $18,750, it would follow that the net value of the property as put in the firm was but $56,250 ; and as the additional capital subscribed was but $24,000, the whole capital would be $80,250, instead of $99,000, as set forth by the articles. Such vagueness and inaccuracy violate the purpose of the act, and the referee is of the opinion that in this respect also the certificate is ineffective to create a valid partnership limited under it. Indeed, it may well be doubted whether mortgaged property can be made part of the capital contributed to such an association. There is no power conferred to appiaise the balance of value after the payment of any indebtedness upon the property contributed, and it is with wise intent that the legislature has omitted to confer such power. The debt is a fixed quantity. Opinions of value are shifting, and there is every motive in the associates to enhance their standing in the community and their power to gain credit by placing the valuation of the property contributed as high as possible. In a case like that before us, where the property contributed is owned equally by all the contributors, there is no loss or injury to any of them by appraising the property at many times its value. If the stab-<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>ate be interpreted to mean that mortgaged property can be so contributed, then property mortgaged to its full value may be made to appear as valuable capital by simply doubling or trebling the valuation, and deducting from the same the amount of the fixed quantity, to wit, the debt. Thus worthless assets may be made to figure as an imposing capital, and that without any conscious fraud on the part of the associates, but merely by their natural action under the stimulus of hope and ambition. To impute to the legislature so unwise an intention without plain and specific words constraining us, would be contrary to the plainest principles of interpretation.</p>

In order to be able to say that a valuation is grossly excessive we must first know what such valuation is ; but, as has been shown, there is a doubt left on this subject. The object of the law is, that where the capital of a partnership is contributed in assets other than money, a true valuation of such assets should be made. It is inconceivable that any law should contemplate an appraisement or any other proceeding not true. Where the truth, however, is not ascertainable by a fixed rule or standard and must remain a matter of opinion, it is always an embarrassing question to determine whether the opinion is given honestly and carefully, or dishonestly and negligently. The law having thrown upon the partners the duty of making the appraisement, the presumption is that they made it without fraud, and if any is alleged it must be proved. The evidence in this case does not satisfy the referee that there was any fraud in the appraisement. The statute appears to have been drawn with the thought that the conflicting interests of the partners would induce such a careful supervision of the price at which goods are put in by the several partners that the appraisement by the partners would be a sufficient protection to the public. The legislative mind does not seem to have considered that a contingency could happen such as has actually happened in this case, namely, that the partners being tenants in common of one piece of property, and being equal partners in the new concern, could without danger to their several interests appraise the property so held at many times its real value. There would seem to be room for an amend<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>ment to the statute providing for the ascertainment of the value of such assets by appraisers appointed by the courts.</p>

The statute itself is imperative that such a subscription list book shall be kept and shall be open to the inspection of creditors and members of the association at all reasonable times. The obvious reason for this enactment is, that where a portion of the capital remains unpaid at the time of the formation of the partnership limited, persons interested have a right to know how much is unpaid, and when the time for the payment thereof has arrived. Defaults in such payment can thus become known and their effects warded off or minimized by prompt action or refusal to give further credit. If such a book ever existed the fact would naturally be capable of proof, but the evidence in this case is entirely too vague and insufficient to warrant the conclusion that there was such a book. The rule attempted to be set up by the defendant, namely, that it is the duly of a creditor to prove affirmatively that the book did not exist, seems to be unwarranted. The defendants are not in this respect charged with fraud. The question is : Have they complied with the statute ? As they are unable to show the book or to declare with any degree of positiveness that it ever existed, the referee finds that the partnership limited kept no subscription list book as required by the act of assembly. Under ah the circumstances it appears to the referee that the defendant Levis is not justified in the contention that it is a hardship as to him specially so to rule as to charge him with liability. He was or ought to have been aware of everything that was done or omitted to be done. He was a member of the firm of Creveling, Miles &amp; Co. before the partnership limited was formed; he assisted in the formation of the partnership limited and became and remained a member of it; and though perhaps only a nominal shareholder in the Glen-dower Iron Works, he was its treasurer. The peculiar nature of the business could not have been unknown to him. Starting apparently without capital about October, 1879, Creveling, Miles &amp; Co., on March 29, 1880, without the investment of another <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>dollar (excepting only the profits, earned during these few months), became a partnership limited with a capital of $99,000, of which only $24,000 remained to be paid up, one half on June 1, 1880, and the other half at the call of the managers. No payment was made on June 1, 1880, and no call was ever made, but each partner drew out of this business, apparently as profits on February 28, 1881, 15,000, and on July 30, 1881, $2,083.33, an aggregate of $21,250. From the best evidence accessible the concern practically ceased business some time in 1884, and on July 17, 1885, the board held a meeting in Philadelphia at Mr. Levis’ office, at which, according to the testimony, Mr. Levis produced money to the amount of $8,831.33, and handed it over to the treasurer of the concern, who at the same meeting handed it back to him. The result of this transaction is thus noted in Henry Levis’ account on the books of Creveling, Miles &amp; Co. He is credited with $8,831.33, and is debited with interest on his unpaid installment of $8,000, $1,231.33, in all, $9,231.33 leaving a balance of unpaid capital due by him of $400. The cash $8,831.33 is disposed of on the books by two entries:</p>

If the valuation of the whole property were $75,000, the effect of it, in this case, would be to render the whole statement false, because as the $75,000 would be subject to a deduction of $18,750, it would follow that the net value of the property as put into the association was but $56,250; and as the additional capital subscribed was but $24,000, the whole capital would be $80,250 instead of $99,000 as set forth in the articles.”</p>
