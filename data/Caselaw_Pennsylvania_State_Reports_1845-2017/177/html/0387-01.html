Each might, as preliminary to the contract, have sought by surveys'to ascertain the proximate quantity in place, and thus have fixed in their judgment the value, but the number of tons and value per ton would have been no express part of the written contract; a round sum for the whole or per acre would have represented the price the sellers were willing to accept and the buyers to give. But although the contract was a sale of the <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>coal in place, they did not bargain on the basis of a lump sum. Why ? Because the plaintiff was not a purchaser of coal or coal lands to hold for appreciation in price, in view of a future sale for a round sum or a lease to others at a profit; it was an operator who desired to mine and market the coal at a profit, intending to operate immediately; therefore, as in all such operations, it is more convenient to pay while the operation is going on, for it involves an expenditure of far less capital, consequently a less fixed charge. Say, it had paid down for this coal what approximately it did pay in the nine years between the date of the contract and filing the bill, at simple interest, it would have been at an annual expense on the $36,000 of $2,160. This could be avoided only by payments as the mining progressed, and this it endeavored to stipulate for in the bargain. It was the adoption of this method of payment, alone, that prompted the expression of value of 25 cents per ton to be paid when mined, as provided in section 1. But the owners’ interest now clashed with the operators’, for he once in possession with right to all the coal in the tract, might indefinitely prolong such possession; fluctuations in the market, wage disputes and strikes, accidents to machinery and like causes might render rapid mining unprofitable to the operator; and rate of profit would depend on circumstances not foreseeable, and the rate of output would depend on rate of profit.</p>

Both parties assumed the value of the coal in place to be 25 cents per ton, and this value, defendants would have proximately got if it had been mined diligently; but, if, on account of conditions of market, charges for transportation or price of labor, it paid plaintiff better to mine very slowly, defendants would not receive nearly that value. For example, take the $4,000 paidfor the sixteen thousand tons mined the ninth year; if the sixteen thousand tons were worth 25 cents per ton at date of contract, then defendants had lost nine years’ interest, or $2,160; deducting this from the $4,000, left only $1,840, equal only to 111 cents per ton-by reason of the long de<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>f erred payment. The hardship of the bargain by the happening of this very contingency the owners sought to guard against by two distinct methods of fixing the purchasing price; one, 25 cents per ton, to be paid as mined; and this is all plaintiff would have paid if it had mined with diligence; but there was another method; if for any reason, it chose to retain possession, and not mine diligently, then defendants had provided for this by exacting a fixed annual income of $4,000; see section 2: “And said party of the second part .... whether coal be mined or not, shall pay to the said party of the first part .... in the proportions aforesaid, an annual minimum rental of not less than four thousand dollars.” This was a plain bargain ; in no sense unconscionable at the time it was made. The owners exact positive stipulations as to price of that which they owned, in view of future contingencies; in no case is the plaintiff to pay less than 25 cents per ton; but if it choose to not diligently carry on the work of mining, so that it takes out less than sixteen thousand tons annually, then it shall pay $4,000 annually as long as it retains possession of the premises to mine coal under the contract. The hardness of the bargain is, it seems to us, assumed by the able master on insufficient grounds. He adopts the price per ton as mined as the one value of the coal; not noting that if it paid plaintiff better to not mine, or to mine it very slowly, it was a serious loss in price to the owners, which they guarded against. Whether on the whole, as a business venture, the operator gained or lost by the second method would depend on the soundness of its judgment,- but if it lost by exercising its judgment, that does not prove the bargain a hard one.</p>

That only means, if in one year, say but eight thousand tons had been mined and $4,000 paid, then the next, or a subsequent year, if plaintiff mined, say twenty-four thousand, the $2,000 might be credited on the excess beyond sixteen thousand tons. The plaintiff is given the privilege of recouping the excess of payment above what it has mined in a preceding year, by an excess of coal in a subsequent year; there is no intimation in the language employed that there is to be any reduction oi <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>change in the annual minimum payment of $4,000 while plaintiff is in possession. There is just one provision for suspension of the annual payment, and it is embodied in this section; it is “should the breaker .... be destroyed by fire or other unavoidable cause the rent may be postponed for the time which may be necessary to erect a new breaker, not, however, to exceed three months.” This is the only contingency which can work a suspension of any part of the $4,000 rentals; and as there is the expression of one contingency alone, the silence of the contract as to any other is significant of an intention to exclude all others. <em>Exfressio unius exclusio alterius.</em>

The position of appellant is, that having already paid for more coal than the tract originally contained at the rate of twenty-five cents per ton, it has the right to cease payment and retain possession of the premises, with these rights on the surface, until all the coal be mined. As already noticed, this is not our construction of the contract. The intention of the parties to every contract of this kind must determine their rights and remedies. In the authorities cited there is no real conflict; the difference in the surroundings of the parties at the date of the contract and a distinction in the subject compel different constructions to give effect to the intention ; the language of no two of them is the same ; the covenants are different. It is useless to go over them, because, to be in point, they should be in verbis ipsissimis concerning the same subject and the parties in the same situation. On one proposition they all agree, that in contracts like unto this they must be construed as a sale of the coal or other mineral in place. The determinination of the price as well as the remedies for the enforcement of the contracts are as different as the minds of the parties. And while we do not go to the length the English cases do in enforcing payment of the purchase money where there is a total failure of consideration, yet where the consideration has not failed, as here, the law of the contract which the parties have made for themselves is the law of the land.</p>

The right to mine and remove it was an incident to the sale. When all the coal in the tract was paid for the purchase money was extinguished. If the company remained in possession for an unreasonable time in closing up its mining operations after the coal had been fully paid for it was liable to the owners of the land for such occupation, and subject to an action for the recovery of the possession. It is not liable to pay $4,000 per year for coal that has no existence.</p>
