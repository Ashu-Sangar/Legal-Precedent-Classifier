Bartlett, his interest in the insurance polic3r passed to and vested in his heirs, who, so far as the right to the indemnity against loss was concerned, stood in the same relation to the insurance company, and to the creditors of the deceased, as did the deceased in his lifetime. See Wyman v. Wyman, <a href="/ny/26/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="26 N.Y. 253" data-case-ids="2033071" data-case-paths="/ny/26/0245-01">26 N.

See Flanders on Fire Insurance, § 5, where it is held: “ Where the contract of insurance is made with the assured, ‘ his executors, administrators and assigns,’ the right of action upon the policy at death of the assured vests in his personal representative, but the insurance being' on a building, which is real estate, the interest in the property insured belongs to the heirs at law.

The contract of insurance was to indemnify the owner of the property. The heirs of Bartlett were the owners at the time of the fire, and neither the creditors of their ancestor nor his administrator, representing the creditors, had any insurable interest or any right in or to it. At most they had only a charge or lien on it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-9" data-blocks='[["BL_451.8",451,[190,1965,1169,402]],["BL_452.1",452,[273,325,1168,602]]]'>Had the loss occurred while Bartlett was alive, a judgment creditor whose only security was the insured property, could not have claimed the insurance money by virtue of the lien of his judgment. When Bartlett died, his heirs became the owner of the insured property, and were entitled to the possession and enjoyment of it, subject to the statutory lien of the debts of their ancestor, enforceable only by the methods prescribed by law. Had the insurance money been paid to the <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>heirs, the creditors of Bartlett could uot have claimed it by virtue of their statutory lien. At Bartlett’s death, he had no present interest in the contract to indemnify him for injury by fire to his real estate that could pass to his personal representative. His right to the insurance money, in case of loss, was based upon his ownership of the property at the time of loss, and by his death the ownership, by operation of law, vested in his heirs. We are of the opinion that the claim of the creditors to the insurance money, as part of the ordinary personal assets of the deceased, cannot be supported, and thus far the conclusion is in accordance with the case of Wyman v. Wyman, <a href="/ny/26/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="26 N.Y. 253" data-case-ids="2033071" data-case-paths="/ny/26/0245-01">26 N. Y. 253</a>.</p>

Wyman, the counsel for the creditors ask us to charge the administrator with the amount of the insurance money, by reason of what is claimed to be the superior equities of the creditors; and, if the reasoning of the Court of Appeals is correct and the law of Pennsylvania is the same as that of New York, the case would seem to sustain the contention. The New York court treated the insurance money as the proceeds of real estate sold and brought into court for distribution among the creditors having liens against the realty. We are of the opinion that it cannot be so regarded, under the law of this state, but that the contract of insurance must be treated as a personal contract to make good the loss to him who was the owner at the time of its occurrence, and not as a guaranty to whoever might sustain loss by the destruction of the insured property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[269,1705,1167,649]],["BL_453.1",453,[182,357,1170,95]]]'>The New York court says that “ a court having control of such funds should not allow them to pass into the hands -of irresponsible and infant heirs, leaving the creditors to pursue them by the dilatory remedy of a new and distinct proceeding.” If the money was in the hands of the heirs and could be collected from them for the benefit of the creditors under our law, then we could, to avoid circuity of action, award it to the creditors. But we do not understand such to be the law in Pennsylvania. Had the building been injured by a third person after the death of Bartlett, the administrator would have no cause of action; compensation would belong to the heirs, although the injury depreciated or made worthless the claims of the creditors; and we conclude that such <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>must be the case when the destruction is from an accident for which the insurance company agreed to indemnify the owner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b453-4" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[181,459,1172,818]]]'>It is a mistake to say that the $1,100 in controversy is in court. It is not so, unless the administrator as such is entitled to it. The fact that the person holding the money is both administrator and trustee for the heirs, is of no consequence. If the heirs are by law entitled to it, as we think they are, the Orphans’ Court cannot control it. In the hands of their trustee it is, so far as the question before us is concerned, in the hands of the heirs themselves.- We see very clearly that the loss of the building was a misfortune to the creditors and a benefit to the heirs, but if our opinion of the law is correct we are without power to make good the misfortune. Although unfortunate, the creditors are no more so than they would be had the building been burned without any insurance, or destroyed by a tornado. The case seems to us to be the accidental depreciation in value of real estate against which the creditors had liens, but in or to which they had no right.</p>

Bartlett died intestate, seised of an equitable interest in a house and lot, held under articles of agreement, and leaving issue four daughters, two of-whom were minors. The house, which was insured by him, for three years from March, 1885, in the Hamburg-Bremen Insurance Company, for $1,200, payable “ unto the said assured, his executors or administrators,” was totally destroyed by fire about four months after his decease. A question having arisen, whether <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>the insurance money should be paid to the administrator, or to the children and heirs-at-law of the assured, it was agreed, in writing, by the two adult daughters and the guardian of the minors that it should be paid to the administrator, John A. Day, and if it should thereafter be decided by the court that the money belonged to the children he would pay the same to them, otherwise he-would account for it as administrator. The loss was promptly adjusted by the insurance company, and paid to the administrator. In due time he filed his account, but instead of charging himself with the net amount, $1,100, received from the company, he referred to it as having been paid to him in pursuance of the above-stated agreement, and declared his readiness to pay the same to the children of his intestate, or otherwise account therefor as the court might direct. For the purpose of presenting the matter to the Orphans’ Court, the omission to charge himself as administrator with the insurance money was excepted to, and an auditor was appointed to pass upon the question, re-state the account, if necessary, and distribute the balance that might be found in the hands of accountant. The auditor found as a fact, that even including the insurance money as an asset for distribution among the creditors, the estate was largely insolvent; but, notwithstanding this, he held that the children of the intestate were entitled to the insurance money. The court was of the same opinion, and accordingly the decree from which this appeal is taken, was entered.</p>
    <p id="b454-5" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[271,1626,1171,759]],["BL_455.1",455,[164,340,1169,1167]]]'>The question thus presented is, whether, the estate being clearly insolvent, the creditors have any claim upon the insurance money? We think they have. The contract under which the money became due and.payable to the personal representative of the intestate, is one of indemnity against a possible loss which actually happened after his decease but during the life of the policy. If his estate, exclusive of the property insured, had been solvent, his children who succeeded to his interest in said property, would undoubtedly have been entitled to the insurance money; but, inasmuch as his estate, including the realty and the sum realized from the insurance policy, is admittedly insolvent, their right is subordinate to that of the creditors. In this state the lands of a decedent, as well as his goods and chattels, are assets for the payment of his debts. When the personal property is exhausted or clearly insufficient, it is the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>duty of the personal representative, under the direction of the proper court, to resort to the realty, and thus, if possible, satisfy the claims of creditors. In Horner v. Hasbrouck, <a href="/pa/41/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="41 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="480025" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0169-01">41 Pa. 169</a>, 179, it is said, it will be seen, from a brief glance at the history of our Orphans’ Court, how we enforce the principle, never lost sight of in our jurisprudence, that the lands of a decedent, like his goods, are assets for the payment of his debts, and that the right of succession has respect only to so much of his estate as remains after his debts have been paid. When a man dies in Pennsylvania, his real and personal estate comes within the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court, to be administered, first of all, for the benefit of creditors, and next for legatees, devisees, and heirs. We usually define the heir to be one on whom the law casts the estate at the death of the ancestor, but with us the estate is cast subject to the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court. Heirs are thus postponed to creditors. If it be said, as for some purposes it is correct to say, that the estate vests in the heirs directly the ancestor dies, it must be understood to be a contingent interest, defeasible in behalf of creditors. What really vests in the heir, is the title to the residuum, or, in the language of the act of 1834, the “ surplusage ” of the estate. This is what the law casts on the heir. It can be nothing else, consistently with oür system of administration and distribution.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[162,1516,1168,595]]]'>While, strictly speaking, the insurance money in question is not the proceeds of real estate bound by the lien of decedent’s debts, it really represents, to that extent, the realty that was insured and destroyed bjr fire. If the insurance company had elected to restore the lost building, instead of paying the amount of risk in cash, the property would have been immediately subject to sale for the payment of debts. Whether we regard the insurance money as the proceeds of the contract of indemnity and a personal asset in the hands of the administrator, or as representing the building that was destroyed, in either case the claim of the heirs thereto is subordinate to that of the creditors.</p>
