But these cases also show, that it must be a section of country, a town or borough which is essentially of a public character and well known to the public at large, not merely known to a few persons in the neighborhood; and that it is not every small section of country, every trifling collection of houses which may locally be known by a certain name, or even a large tract of land which is merely a private estate, which will bring the party using the name within the rule forbidding the use of a geographical name.

    <p class="summary" id="b29-7" data-blocks='[["BL_29.6",29,[213,646,1176,1785]]]'>But little importance can be attached to the fact that at the time of the adoption of the trade-name by the complainants, a railroad station on the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, a mile west of complainants’ mine, was called Sonman, and that there was a telegraph office there. Of themselves, standing alone and unconnected with any borough or town of importance, they are of little consequence. The names of railroad stations are merely private names given and changed at the will of the corporation, and in no sense geographical or descriptive of any large section of country or any borough or settlement known generally to the public. A settlement on the main line of a great railroad, in which there is no store, blacksmith shop, or business of any kind carried on, and which is not reached by a single public road, cannot be said to be a place of any importance whatever, and cannot be known at all to the public generally. It does not rise even to the dignity of a village. In Wotherspoon v. Currie, before referred to, the court says: “ Glenfield, which is really only a place of about sixty inhabitants, is not a parish, it is not a hamlet, it is not a district of any special character, but it is an estate of that name upon which some people seem to have erected some houses or manufactories, and on which now some sixty people are living. There was, therefore, nothing whatever to give particular celebrity to the name of Glenfield, so connected with a starch factory, beyond the facts that the appellants had manufactured an article known by that name and having a large sale by that name. That, of course, was a fact of considerable importance to any one who should be minded to appropriate the name of Glen-field to his starch.” Glenfield, therefore, was a place many times larger, and at which there does seem to have been some considerable business carried on, and yet it was not a place of such particular importance as to bring it within the rule forbidding the use of geographical names.

The master’s position was that the word Sonman was not of sufficient importance to be considered a geographical word for the purposes of this case. There is one case cited by him which appears at first glance to sustain him, that of Wotherspoon v. Currie, L. R. 5 Eng. &amp; I. App. 512, but there are obvious distinctions between that case and this. Here the subject is a natural product, found only in a particular locality, to which the name of that locality alone is peculiarly applicable, not a manufactured article with the name used as a fancy name. There any name would have done for defendant’s starch, but he moved to the private estate of Glenfield for the very purpose of calling his starch by that name, while here the miners on the Sonman tract cannot describe the place whence their coal comes without using the word Sonman.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[209,1507,1173,866]]]'>4, Nor can the importance of Sonman, which is a question of thousands of acres producing Sonman coal, be measured by the same rule as that of Glenfield. Whether Sonman has natural boundaries, like the Lackawanna Valley, or not, the importance of the word as a geographical name is illustrated by a circular of the plaintiffs in which they speak of “ Sonman Station,” “ Sonman Coal Basin,” etc. Various portions of the testimony show that the word is the name of a coal district. No fraud has been shown upon the complainants’ rights sufficient to entitle them to a decree, and this must be shown before an injunction can be granted: Canal Co. v. Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wall.%20322" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="13 Wall. 322">13 Wall. 322</a>. It is not disputed that the defendants sold their Sonman coal as their own, and not as the coal of the plaintiffs. They made no attempt to impose on the public. The only ground of the master’s finding of fraud is their use of the word Sonman. But their claim of a right to use this word cannot be made the basis for constructing a fraud.</p>

The absence of any difference in the geological formation between the Sonman tract and the surrounding country, was fully proved. The authorities cited by the master to show that Sonman wg.s not a geographical word, amply support him. That a few houses scattered near a railroad station cannot make the name geographical, is sustained by Wotherspoon v. Currie, L. R. 5 Eng. &amp; I. App., 512, a case which was approved by this court in Glendon Iron Co. v. Uhler, <a href="/pa/75/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="75 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1036762" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0467-01">75 Pa. 467</a>, and is strikingly like the case at bar. The remark of V. C. Malin in that case, in the court below, 18 Weekly R. 564, that Glenfield was known to persons in its neighborhood, but to the kingdom at large utterly unknown, is equally true of Sonman.</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[256,1095,1173,808]]]'>2. Considering the subject with respect to the whole tract, the case is the same. It presents none of the features of a geographical division, but is a private estate and nothing more. Every owner of a farm might as well claim his farm to be a geographical division. The term “ district of country,” as used in Canal Co. v. Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wall.%20327" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="13 Wall. 327">13 Wall. 327</a>, was applied to a great valley known throughout the country. In the Glendon case this court applied the true test when it distinguished between a public name and the name of a private estate, which is a matter of caprice and changeable at the will of the owner. So, names of railroad stations are private matters and it is common to change them. The fact that there is a station on this tract cannot make the name geographical. The word is not descriptive of the coal as coming from this tract, and the testimony shows that the existence of the Sonman estate is utterly unknown outside the immediate neighborhood.</p>

The argument of appellants that every miner on this tract has a right to the use of the word Sonman, involves the proposition that the owner of a private estate has a property in the fancy name he has given it, which all the cases deny: Day v.

Such confusion can never take place where the law is properly applied, e. g., between Lackawanna and Schuylkill coal.

The name Sonman had no value as a name for coal till plaintiffs gave it such by acquiring a reputation for their coal under that name. That defendants adopted it for this reason and not because it was a necessary designation descriptive of locality, is shown by the fact that their adoption of it was five years after the opening of their mine and that they advertised their coal under this name without anything to distinguish it from that of plaintiffs.

Piper &amp; Co., are miners and shippers of bituminous coal in Cambria county. They are engaged in mining what is known on the geological maps of the state as the Miller vein, at Ben’s creek, on the western slope of the Allegheny mountains; their mines are located upon what was sometimes called the Big Survey, containing an area of about ten square miles, or over six thousand acres. This large body of land, it is said, was conveyed by William Penn directly to one Arent Sonman, and hence has been generally known as 'the Sonman survey. From the testimony of Mr. Westbrook, it appears that in the Sonman tract there are several seams or veins of coal, one above another. Mr. Westbrook says: “The bottom vein is known as vein A; a short distance above this is a small vein known as A primal; the next higher vein is <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>known as vein B, and a few feet above this is a smaller vein known as B primal; the next is known as C, and so on to E; E being the highest upper workable vein. These are the designations given in geological surveys. These several veins have other several local designations; they are known by miners in the neighborhood by the name of the person who owned them. The Lemon vein was so named because it was opened by John A. Lemon or his father. The Lemon vein is vein E, and the Miller vein, said to have been first opened by a man of that name, is vein B. The coal mined from the same vein in different localities is not always of the same quality. The Miller vein, or vein B, at Gallitzin, ten miles east of Sonman, is very much softer; while at South Fork, which is eight or ten miles from Sonman west, it is very much harder. In some cases, two or three miles make a difference in the quality of the coal from the same vein.”</p>

On July 26, 1879, the firm of Dysart &amp; Co. dissolved, Dysart and Laughman transferring their interest to Piper.

Mr. Alexander M. White, who mined the Lemon vein in 1852 or 1853, says: “We called it the Son-man coal in contradistinction to the Lilly Mill coal, which was mined east of it, between planes 3 and 4; this was a common appellation for it; we called the coal from that survey Sonman coal.” Hon. John Dean testifies, that there were about five thousand acres known to him as the Sonman lands; that the coal is called the Sonman coal, and that he always heard it called by that name; and that it was a very common name as far back as 1854. Mr. Westbrook, who opened the Miller vein and sold coal to the Altoona Manufacturing Company, to the Logan Iron and Steel Works, to the Phoenix Iron Company, and to dealers, says: “I always called all coal mined and shipped Sonman coal, as designating the locality or region in which it was mined; sometimes, however, designating the coal by the name of the vein by which it is known.”</p>

Holt, <a href="/us/128/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="128 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="3533449" data-case-paths="/us/128/0514-01">128 U. S. 514</a>. “ As distinct property, separate from the article^, created by the original producer or manufacturer, it may not be the subject of sale; but when the trade-mark is affixed to articles manufactured at a particular establishment and acquires a special reputation in connection with the place of manufacture, and that establishment is transferred, either by contract or operation of law, to others, the right to the use of the trade-mark may be lawfully transferred with it. Its subsequent use by the person to whom the establishment is transferred, is considered as only indicating that the goods to which it is affixed are manufactured at the same place, and are of the same character as those to which the mark was attached by the original designer.” Such is the appropriate language of Lord Cransworth, in the case of Leathercloth Company v. The American Leathercloth Company, in 11 Jur., N. S. 513; Kidd v. Johnson, <a href="/us/100/0617-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="100 U.S. 617" data-case-ids="4672" data-case-paths="/us/100/0617-01">100 U. S. 617</a>. We assume, therefore, that W. H. Piper, as the assignee of Dysart and Laughman, possessed the rights of the firm of Dysart &amp; Co. in any trademark which that firm, at the time of its dissolution, may have acquired, and, with his approval, the new firm of W. H. Piper &amp; Co. were certainly entitled to exercise that right.</p>

The object of a trade-mark is that the article, to which it is attached or belongs, may be distinguished from articles of a similar kind, and thus be known and identified in the market; its purpose is to indicate the personal origin of the article to which it is applied, or the source from which it comes. The office of a trade-mark is thus defined by Mr. Justice Fieud, in Manufacturing Go. v. Trainor, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20U.S.%2053" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="101 U.S. 53">101 U. S. 53</a>: “ Every one is at liberty to affix to the product of his own manufacture any symbol or device not previously appropriated, which will distinguish it from articles of the same general nature, manufactured or sold by others, and thus secure to himself the benefits of increased sale by reason of any peculiar excellencies he may have given to it. The symbol or device thus becomes a sign to the public of the origin of the goods to which it is attached, and the assurance that they are the genuine article of the original producer.”</p>

No property can be acquired in any word, mark, or device, which denotes merely the nature, kind, or quality of an article. Thus, in Raggett v. Findlater, L. R. 17 Eq. 29, an injunction to restrain the use of the words “ Nourishing Stout,” which the plaintiff had previously used, was refused upon the ground that “ nourishing ” was a mere English word denoting quality. “ The owner of an original trade-mark has an undoubted right to be protected in the exclusive use of all the marks, formsi or symbols that are appropriate as designating the true origin tfr ownership of the article or fabric to which they are attached; but he has no right to the exclusive use of any words, letters, figures, or symbols which have no relation to the origin dr ownership of the goods, but are only meant to indicate their names or quality. He has no right to appropriate a sign or symbol which, from the nature of the fact it is used to signify, others may employ with equal truth, and therefore have an equal right to employ for the same purpose: ” Amoskeag Manufacturing Company v. Spear, 2 Sandf. S. C. 599. And whilst the office of a trade-mark is to indicate the personal origin or ownership of an article, yet a merely geographical name cannot be so used: Bispham’s Eq., § 457; Canal Company v. Clark, <a href="/us/80/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="13 Wall. 311" data-case-ids="1134245" data-case-paths="/us/80/0311-01">13 Wall. 311</a>. In the case last cited, it was held <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>that the word “ Lackawanna,” which is the name of a region of country in Pennsylvania, could not, by combination with the word coal, constitute a trade-mark, because every one who mined coal in the valley of the Lackawanna had a right to represent his coal as Lackawanna coal. “ The word ‘ Lackawanna,’ ” says Mr. Justice Strong, “was not devised by the complainants. They found it a settled and known appellative of the district in which their coal deposits and those of others were situated. At the time they began to use it, it was a recognized description of a region and, of course, all the earths and minerals in the region.”.....“It must then be considered as sound doctrine,” says the learned Justice, “that no one can apply the name of a district of country to a well-known article of commerce, and obtain thereby such an exclusive right to the appellation as to prevent others inhabiting the district, or dealing in similar articles coming from the district, from truthfully using the «ame designation. It is only when the adoption or imitation of what is claimed to be a trade-mark amounts to a false representation, expressed or implied, designed or incidental, that there is any title to relief against it.”</p>

Alvord, <a href="/barb/49/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="49 Barb. 588" data-case-ids="2244797" data-case-paths="/barb/49/0588-01">49 Barb. 588</a>, the plaintiffs manufactured a cement at Akron, N. Y., and sold it under the name of “Akron Cement.” The defendants made the same sort of cement at Syracuse, and labeled it “ Onondaga Akron Cement.” The court held that, “though all the world had a right to manufacture cement at Akron and call it Akron cement, yet the action of the defendants, in calling their cement made at Syracuse, Akron cement, was a fraud on the plaintiffs and on the public, and should accordingly be restrained.” To the same effect is our own case of Glendon Iron Co. v. Uhler, <a href="/pa/75/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="75 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1036762" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0467-01">75 Pa. 467</a>, where a corporation adopted the trade-mark “ Glendon ” upon their iron. The place where their furnaces were located was afterwards erected into a borough by the name of Glendon. Another company, engaged in business in the same place, afterwards used the word “ Glen-don ” on their iron, and it was held that the second company was justified in so doing. “ The appellees,” said this court in the case cited, “ put upon their pigs the initials of their firm and the name of their town. That name was Glendon to the whole world. It cannot be that the previous appropriation by <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>the appellants of the word which now is the name of the town, prevents any other manufacturer of pig iron within its limits from using the same word. If it be so now, it may continue through all coming time. The boundaries of the town may be enlarged ; the borough may grow into a city; the manufacturers of pig iron may be multiplied, and the word most expres sive to indicate their location must be denied to all save one. So far as the authorities go to restrain a manufacturer from the adoption of a truthful trade-mark, we will endeavor to enforce them; when asked to go further we must decline. If the effect of the incorporation of the appellants’ district of country into a town by the name of Glendon, has been to deprive them of some of their former rights, they must submit to the consequences.” It is upon the same principle that every person may put his own name upon his own goods, notwithstanding another person of the same name may, in that name, manufacture and sell the same or a similar article: Burgees v. Burgees, 17 Eng. L. <em>&amp; </em>E. 257.</p>

It is clear, from the evidence, that Sonman is a word of geographical signification ; it denotes a specific territory or region of country of considerable extent, which is and for many years both before and since the trade-name was adopted has been devoted to the production of a somewhat peculiar quality of coal by different operators. In the year of 1854 the village of Sonman was built upon this tract. Mr. Alexander M. White testifies, “ That the village consisted of a steam saw-mill, a store, a dwelling which he constructed for himself, one for his superintendent, and six tenement houses. The village was on the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and although at first there was no station, a siding was constructed to facilitate the shipping of coal and lumber.” Mr. Richard P. Westbrook testifies, “that in 1867 there was a settlement or village, consisting of two large mansion houses, one 40 by 60, the other 30 by 40, a steam sawmill, a store-house in which was kept a company store, two barns, one of which was very large, a blacksmith shop, several tenements for workmen, and an iron siding connecting the lumber yard with the Pennsylvania Railroad. There were sev<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>eral other houses or tenements in different parts of the Sonman property. This village was known by the name of Sonman. There was a post-office there at that time, kept in the storehouse. James A. Shoemaker was the postmaster.” He further testifies, “that a station was established at Sonman by the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. in 1871; the building was destroyed by fire. In the latter part of 1872 or the early part of 1873, the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. erected a permanent building there for ticket and freight purposes and appointed an agent. About the same tirhe, a telegraph station was established there by the Western Union Company; both the railroad station and the telegraph station were called Sonman. There was a post-office called Sonman located there previous to 1857. A. F. Cantwell was postmaster in 1857. The office was continued by that name for more than ten years; and when Shoemaker removed from Sonman, a man residing at Portage, one mile west, was appointed, and he removed the office from Sonman to Portage.” Mr. Martin says that in 1869 the saw-mill was gone; the post-office had been removed to Portage, and some houses were vacant, but the mines were still in operation, and continued to be in operation until the railroad and telegraph stations were established in 1872 or 1873 and ever since that time.</p>
    <p id="b42-5" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[255,1445,1172,916]],["BL_43.1",43,[197,316,1170,1373]]]'>It may be that the Sonman tract does not present the features of what the appellees call an independent region; that it is not so extensive or so sharply defined in its natural boundaries as the Lackawanna Valley; it may be, also, that Sonman cannot be considered as a separate coal basin, or even as a sub-basin, yet it is plain that it had received a distinct geographical recognition from the public. These lands, for many years prior to the time that the plaintiffs adopted their trade-name, were, as we have seen, known as the Sonman survey. Its boundaries were marked and defined úpon the map of Cambria county; the village erected thereon was Sonman; the post-office was Sonman; the railroad station was Sonman; the telegraph office was Sonman; the coal taken from the mines was shipped as Sonman coal, and, by this desciption, was known in the market. Can it be doubted that the term Sonman, in the year 1874, was a name descriptive of a locality? If it was, the name, when applied to its own natural products, must be taken in its geographical sense. We do not say that a geographical name may <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>not, in some oases or under some circumstances, be applied as a trade-name; but we do say, that when the article to which it is applied is a product of the place named, the term cannot be used as a trade-name by one to the exclusion of others, owners of like products of the same place. This is the doctrine of all the cases. The case of Wotherspoon v. Currie, L. R. 5 E. &amp; I. App. 512, relied upon by the appellees, when properly considered and understood, will be found, we think, to be consistent with this statement of the law. In that case, as we understand it, the trade-name “ Glenfield ” was applied to a starch which, at the time of the infringement, was not made at Glenfield, but elsewhere. The name was then used, and for some time before that had been used, in an entirely fictitious sense; as denoting the personal origin of the article known as “ Glenfield Starch,” and not in connection with the place of its manufacture. The word Glenfield, assuming that it maj^ have a geographical import at first, was at the time of the infringement, used in an entirely different sense, and for a wholly different purpose; and the remarks of the Lord Chancellor are intended to emphasize the fact that the defendant, who was then the owner of Glenfield, had nothing to lose in being denied the privilege of affixing the name of his private estate to his products, as the place was of little consequence, and he could hope for no advantage therefrom, only from the fact, of considerable importance, that the plaintiff had manufactured a superior article of starch known by that name, which had a great reputation in the market, and of which he had made large sales.</p>

The case just cited is an illustration in point; for the plaintiff, in that case, at first manufactured starch on the private estate of Glenfield, and called his starch Glenfield. He removed from his private estate, but retained for his starch manufactured elsewhere the same trade-mark, and his right to do so was sustained by the judgment. But Sonman is not the name of a private estate in this sense; it is the name of a large boundary of land containing a number of separate private estates, owned by a number of different persons, all of whom are engaged in the same business of mining and shipping coal; and we hold that no one of these can assume and adopt, as a trade-name, the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>name by which the place is generally known in the geography of the country, to the exclusion of others.</p>
