    <p class="summary" id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[194,502,1180,611]]]'>On April 26, 1886, Mrs. Jones was a passenger on a train of the defendant company from Bloomsburg to Nanticoke. At Nanticoke, the station platform was on the left hand or west side of the track. Nanticoke, Mrs. Jones’ destination, was on the right hand or east side of the track and some little distance from it. Passengers for Nanticoke would alight upon the platform, pass along in front of a store-room, and descend by steps to the ground; and then, instead of taking a highway laid out around to the left and turning across the track 182 feet north of the steps, they would usually cut across the track from the foot of the steps and take a pathway across the open ground leading into the public road.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.6",329,[193,1120,1179,612]]]'>Mrs. Jones was about sixty-six years of age, and very fleshy. At the date given she alighted at the platform and passed along toward the steps. She asked the conductor, as it was claimed, whether she would have time to cross in front of the train, and was told by him that he did not know. Other passengers were crossing at the time and she followed them. Before she had passed over the track, she was struck by the engine of the train and so injured that she subsequently died. As to what was the exact position of the. engine with reference to the path when Mrs. Jones started to cross, whether she was yet on the track when the train started, and whether any signal was given or bell sounded, the testimony was conflicting.</p>

Negligence is a fact to be proved by competent evidence, to your satisfaction. Upon this question of fact as to whether or not the defendant company was guilty of negligence, you will inquire whether this path, upon which it is alleged she was crossing the railroad, was a usual way for passengers going to and from the station. Was she upon the path or was she off the path? Was she a passenger? That she was a passenger, does not seem to be disputed. If both of these facts be established, she was not a trespasser, and it <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>would be negligence upon tbe part of tbe railroad 'company to start the train across the path without giving some warning. As to whether or not she was upon the path, there is perhaps some discrepancy in the testimony. According to the testimony of the plaintiff’s witnesses, she was upon this path; according to the testimony of Edward Dickson, the fireman, the engine covered the path when the train was standing at the station. Of course, if she was not crossing the railroad in the usual way, a way commonly traveled by passengers, a different rule would apply; she would then be a trespasser. If, however, she was upon the path, and that was a usual way for the passengers to go to and from the station, she would not be a trespasser ; and if she were a passenger, then the company owed to her the duty of giving some warning, either by ringing the bell or by some other signal, before crossing this way. Upon this question of fact as to whether the bell was rung, there is a conflict of evidence. Several witnesses have testified that they did not hear a bell or any other warning; others, that they do not recollect of having heard a bell; others, that there was no bell rung. Defendant’s witnesses testify that before the train was started the bell was rung. This is a question of fact to be decided by you, in accordance with the weight of the credible testimony in the cause.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-5" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[258,1529,1178,353]]]'>If you find as a matter of fact that the deceased was a passenger on this railroad, that she was crossing the railroad by a way usually traveled by passengers, and that no warning was given before starting, that the train was about to start, the defendant company might be held to have been guilty of negligence, and if she were guilty of no contributory negligence, they might be held liable for the damages which ensued.</p>

What was the care required of an ordinarily prudent person at this point, in view of all of the circumstances ? The court say to you as a matter of law that if when she attempted to cross the track, the train was already in motion, she did not exercise the care of an ordinarily prudent person and the plaintiff cannot recover. There can be no dispute as to that. Under all <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>of the testimony, at the very farthest, this engine was not more than eight or ten feet from the path. According to some of the witnesses it was very much nearer to the path. But even if it were ten feet from the path and the engine had started when she first attempted to cross the railroad, it was a negligent act upon her part, and, unfortunate as the consequences may have been, she could not recover for the injuries, nor could her husband recover in case of her death. But this presents a question of fact for your consideration and decision. Was the train in motion when she attempted to cross, or was it standing still ? If the train was standing, and no warning was given before she attempted to cross, we cannot say to you as a matter of law that she was guilty of contributory negligence in attempting to cross. We think it would be a question rather for your decision as to whether or not that was the care which an ordinarily prudent person ought to have exercised under the circumstances. I do not propose to comment upon the testimony of the witnesses in detail; it is within a brief compass, and has been fully brought to your attention by the counsel on the one side and the other, and this question of fact, like the other question of fact, is to be decided in accordance with your convictions as to the weight of the credible testimony in the case.</p>

In other words, it does not give to the ^surviving husband or the children, damages by reason of the suffering that the deceased endured, by reason of the grief caused by her death or by reason of the loss' of the mere companionship of the wife or mother. Because none of these can be measured pecuniarily. It is compensation for the pecuniary loss that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover under the testimony in the case.

That <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>is a difficult question to answer, even laying aside all sentimental considerations.

These and cognate questions of fact were fairly submitted to the jury, in a clear and impartial charge, in which the principles of law applicable to every feature of the case are accurately stated. The jury, as the evidence fully warranted them in doing, found in favor of the plaintiff below and against the defendant company. It follows that the learned judge was right in refusing to charge as requested by the company, defendant below, that “ under all the evidence, the plaintiff cannot recover,” and also in refus<a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>ing to affirm its third, fourth and fifth points, wherein he was, in substance, requested to withdraw the case from the jury on the ground that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence.
