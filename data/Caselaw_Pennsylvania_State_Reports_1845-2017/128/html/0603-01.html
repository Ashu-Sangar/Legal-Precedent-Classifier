In the supplemental report of the appraisers, filed January 4, 1886, they say, “ they have been requested and respectfully do call the attention of the court to the testimony taken by the appellants for the purpose of showing that it was not possible to have had the estate of William Fagely appraised for collateral inheritance tax purposes, at an <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>earlier date than was done, without manifest injury thereto; and to the evidence taken by appellants to show that neither Reuben Fagely, Catharine Martz or Hannah Fagely, during the life of Reuben Fagely, received from John Haas &amp; Co. any revenue or income upon the interest of William Fagely therein, but that the same remained in and swelled the corpus of said estate.” Under such facts and circumstances I have come to the conclusion that it would be wrong to compel payment of any penalty. It would seem that it was almost impossible, and perhaps unsafe, for the executors to undertake to make an estimate. They allege, and from their known integrity and honesty, I have no doubt of it, that they have all along had the money in bank ready to be paid over at any time when the amount could be ascertained. The fact that when the appraisers re-examined the matter and came to make their last report, they reduced the value of the estate nearly $30,000, is evidence of the difficulty in ascertaining the amount of the estate at an earlier period. The sixth exception is, therefore, dismissed.</p>

L. 425, there are two absolutely binding rules to be observed in ascertaining the interest to be charged upon delinquent collateral inheritance tax: (a) If some “ unavoidable cause of delay ” be not affirmatively shown, interest at the rate of twelve per cent per annum must be charged “ from the time of the decedent’s death.” (5) If some “ unavoidable cause of delay ” be shown, then the interest is to be reduced to six per cent during such delay, to be computed “ from the end of the year ” after decedent’s death, but as soon as the cause of delay ceases to exist, interest at the rate of twelve per cent immediately ^taches, and continues until the tax is actually paid. In either case interest is absolutely chargeable at the rate fixed by tbe statute. The principle upon which the legislation from which these rules are deduced, is, that whether there be good cause for delay' or not, the estate in question is possessed of money which belongs to the commonwealth, and must, like every other debtor, pay interest so long as such money is withheld: Commonwealth’s App., <a href="/pa/34/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="34 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="418038" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0204-01">34 Pa. 204</a>; Commonwealth v.

The only question before the court below, and the only question upon the record here, is that raised by the commonwealth’s sixth exception, whether the estate was liable to the penalty of twelve per cent. It is contended here, as it was there, that owing to “ unavoidable cause of delay,” the tax could not be ascertained and paid sooner than it was, and the learned judge having found the facts from the evidence reported by the commissioners, his findings will not be disturbed unless clear error is shown. And even if that portion of the decree in relation to the tax payable by the remaindermen had not been amended in conformity with the request of the commonwealth, as it was, and if the question were properly raised upon the record here, as it is not, the court was right in fixing the amount payable by the remaindermen at $2,870.54, instead of $5,380.62, as now claimed by the commonwealth. The aggregate amount of the taxes, as fixed by the decree of the court, was $5,380.62, or five per cent upon the whole valuation. The tax must not be over five per cent of the entire estate: King’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Phila.%2026" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="11 Phila. 26">11 Phila. 26</a>.</p>

L. 79, is retrospective in its character, and that it embraces all cases not finally disposed of, is evident from its very terms. In its third section it provides that “in all cases where there <em>has leen </em>or shall be a devise,” etc. Its twentieth section repeals all laws inconsistent with its provisions. When an act giving the commonwealth the power of collecting taxes, together with penalties for non-payment, etc., is repealed, reserving to the commonwealth the right to collect all taxes accrued, the penalties cannot be recovered upon suits afterwards instituted to collect the taxes: Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b632-5" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[248,399,1178,1273]]]'>An examination of the testimony taken in this case satisfies us that the learned court below was right in holding that there was unavoidable cause of delay in the settlement of the estate of the decedent. The reasons for this finding are sufficiently set forth in the opinion of the court, and need not be repeated here. It follows that there was no error in refusing to apply the twelve per cent penalty for delay in the payment. But the law which relieves from the payment of this penalty also requires that six per cent per annum shall be charged upon the collateral inheritance tax, from the end of one year after the death of the decedent, in case the estate is not subject to the twelve per cent penalty. That being so, it follows that the learned court below was in error in not directing • the six per cent annual charge to be imposed, and to that extent, but to that extent only, the decree of the Orphans’ Court must be reversed. The provisions of the act of 1887 are scarcely more than a re-enactment of the substance of the previous laws relating to the collateral inheritance tax into one harmonious and consolidated law. So far as the substitution of the six per cent annual charge for the twelve per cent penalty is concerned, there is no inconsistency between the act of 1855, in •which this provision was originally contained, and the act of 1887, which merely repeats it. Hence it does not follow that the act of 1855, which was in force when this proceeding was commenced, was repealed by the act of 1887.</p>

When the other exceptions filed by the commonwealth were withdrawn, the sixth exception, which raised the question of interest was reserved, and there was no agreement by either party that the decision of the court on that exception should be final. When the money was paid to the register there was no agreement by any one that there should be no appeal by the commonwealth, nor was such a condition annexed to the payment by the parties who paid the money. While they, having voluntarily paid the money, could scarcely have been heard on appeal, we can see no good reason for holding the commonwealth estopped, simply because the <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>parties, indebted in any event to the .extent of their actual payment, chose to make that payment. It was a payment in their own ease, because it stopped the further running of a burdensome charge; and, as it was unaccompanied by any condition, and not induced by any promise on the part of the commonwealth, there are no circumstances of estoppel present. The register’s receipt is simply for the amount of money fixed by the court, and does. not express the idea that the money was received in satisfaction, discharge, or payment of the decree, or of the amount of tax claimed by the commonwealth. The second, third, and fifth assignments of error are sustained, and the remaining assignments are dismissed.</p>
