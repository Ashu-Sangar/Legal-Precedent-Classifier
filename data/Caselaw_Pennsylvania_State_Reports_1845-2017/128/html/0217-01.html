The jurisdiction of that court is unfettered by state lines, and they have decided to hold invalid all such contracts made within its jurisdiction, and if we were construing a contract of our own state» we would probably come to the same conclusion. But the position of a state court in passing upon the validity of a contract made and to be performed in another state, is quite different from that occupied by the United States Supreme Court, in which state lines are obliterated. We feel, that in passing upon this question, the comity between states requires us to hold this contract to be a valid one.

Nor is there any analogy to the case of a tug boat pulling a barge, in the possession of the owner, over a highway common to the world: New Jersey R. Co. v. Penna. R. Co., 33 Dutch. 100. The receipt offered in evidence subjected the defendant to the full liability of a common carrier. It did not refer to the antecedent contract, and the jury were at liberty to find that it embodied the whole contract, and by the failure to refer to one previously made the terms thereof were waived. The plaintiff was not obliged to, and did not prove this antecedent contract. The defendant offered it as evidence of a release, and in that light it must be considered.</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/83/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="83 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1050778" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0316-01">83 Pa. 316</a>, and Brooke v.

The New York courts have refused to recognize our law when opposed to their policy, though the transaction in question took place here between citizens of this state: Keller v. Paine, <a href="/ny/107/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="107 N.Y. 83" data-case-ids="2211839" data-case-paths="/ny/107/0083-01">107 N. Y. 83</a>. Moreover, the contract of release will not be enforced, because executed under circumstances amounting to duress. It is not binding because of the power of the carrier to extort what is unreasonable. This contract was as unreasonable and unconscionable as that condemned by Judge Shauswood in Sime v. Norris, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2084" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="8 Phila. 84">8 Phila. 84</a>. In determining the question of reasonableness, our courts are bound by decisions in no other state, because the question is one of conscience and morality, and what amounts to duress is a question of evidence settled by the law of the forum.</p>

The plaintiff is here asserting rights which he does not possess under the law of the place where the contract was made. The only exceptions to the rule of comity on this subject are cases where the enforcement of a foreign contract would be manifestly repugnant to the interests and policy of the state, either as injuriously affecting the commonwealth or its citizens, or, as exhibiting a pernicious example to the citizens of the state. This case is not one of such exceptions: Story, Confl. of Laws, § 38; Wharton, Confl. of Laws, § 401; Greenhood on Public Policy, Rule LXIV.; 2 Kent Com., 458; Bliss v.

There is no such thing as a general commercial, or general common law, separate from, and irrespective of a particular state or government whose authority makes it law. Law is defined as a rule prescribed by the sovereign power. By whom is a general commercial law prescribed, and what tribunal has authority or recognition to declare or enforce it outside of the local juris<a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>diction of the government it represents? Even the law of nations, the widest reaching of all, is a law only in name. It has but a moral sanction, and the only tribunal that undertakes to enforce it is the armed hand, the ultima ratio regum. The so-called commercial law is likewise a law only in name. Upon many questions arising in the business dealings of men, the laws of modern civilized states are substantially the same, and it is therefore common to say that such is the commercial law, but, except as a convenient phrase, such general law does not exist. There must be a state, or government, of which every law can be predicated, and to whose authority it owes its existence as law. Without such sanction, it is not law at all; w’th such sanction, it is law without reference to its origin or me concurrence of other states or people. Such sanction it is the prerogative of the courts of each state itself to declare.

There is a common law of England, and a common law of Pennsylvania mainly founded thereon, but with certain differences, and the only tribunal competent to pass authoritatively on such differences is a Pennsylvania court. To take a familiar illustration: In the United States the universal doctrine has always been that the English colonists brought with them and made part of their laws, all the common law of England that was not unsuited to their new situation. No part of the common law of England is better settled than the doctrine of ancient lights. The Court of Chancery of New Jersey, in Robeson v. Pittenger, 1 Green Ch. 57 (1838), held that the same doctrine was part of the common law of New Jersey. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, on the other hand, starting with the same premises and reasoning on the same principles, but proceeding cautiously from the dictum <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>of Rogers, J., in Hoy v. Sterrett, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wend.%20331" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="2 Wend. 331">2 W. 331</a> (1834), to the unanimous decision of the court in Haverstick v. Sipe, <a href="/pa/33/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="33 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="988395" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0368-01">33 Pa. 368</a> (1859), held that the doctrine of ancient lights by prescription was not part of the common law of Pennsylvania. No tribunals of any other state presume to question that the common law of New Jersey and the common law of Pennsylvania differ on this point. What is law in one state is not law in the other, not because it was or was not the common law of England, but because it is or is not the law of the respective .states. And, though it rests only on the decisions of the courts, it is none the less absolutely and indisputably the law than if it had been made so by statute.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[276,958,1164,1100]]]'>I have purposely selected an illustration from the law relating to real estate, because if I took one from the commercial law, it might seem like assuming the very question under discussion. But the example is none the less pertinent. The point is, the-force of judicial decisions on the common law, and the assumption that there is any tenable basis for holding them less binding upon such law than upon statutes. The so-called commercial law derives all its force from its adoption as part of the common law, and a decision on the commercial law of a state stands upon precisely the same basis as a decision upon any other branch of the common law. The only ground upon which any foreign tribunal can question either, is, that it does not agree with the premises or the reasoning of the court. But the same ground would enable it to question a decision upon a statute, because a different construction seemed to it nearer the true intent of the legislative language, and this it is universally conceded no foreign court can do. There is no difference in principle. The decisions of a state court, upon 'its common law and on its statutes, must stand unquestioned, because it is the only authority competent to decide, or they must be alike questionable by any tribunal which may choose to differ with its reasons or its conclusion.</p>

It is argued now that as to such questions the state courts also have similar liberty. It would be sufficient answer to this argument, that such a course, by reading into a contract a new duty not in contemplation of the parties, and not paid of it by the law of the place where it is made, is in principle and in practical effect impairing the obligation of the contract, which even the sovereign power of a state is prohibited from doing. But we prefer to rest the matter on the broader ground that the doctrine itself is unsound. The best professional opinion has long regarded it as indefensible on principle, and is thus very recently summed up by the most learned of living jurists:</p>

The state courts, on the other hand, adhere to their own precedents, and do not consider themselves entitled to impair the obligation of contracts that have been made in reliance on the principles which they have laid down through a long series of years. The result is a conflict of jurisdiction which there are no means of allaying.....Whether a recovery shall be had on a promissory note, which has been taken as collateral security for an antecedent debt, against a maker from whom it was obtained by fraud, is thus made to turn in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, not on any settled rule, but on the tribunal by. which the cause is heard; and if that is federal, the plaintiff will prevail; if it is local, the defendant. Such a result tends to discredit the law.....The enumeration might be carried further, but enough has, perhaps, been said to show that no uniform rule can be deduced from the decisions of the English and American courts under the commercial law, and that the certainty requisite to justice can be obtained only by following the local tribunals as regards the contracts made in each locality. . . . ■.

I will not notice them in detail further than to quote the terse and forcible summary made by Scott, J., in Knowlton v. Railroad Co.: “ As the contract was made within the jurisdiction of New York, and contemplated no action outside of that jurisdiction, it is clear that the question of its validity must be determined solely by the laws of New York. The rights and obligations of the parties to such a contract, <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>and in respect to the manner of its execution, cannot be affected by the laws or policy of other states. If no cause of action arose to the plaintiff under his contract when the accident occurred, the transaction cannot be converted into a cause of action by the fact that the parties have subsequently come within the jurisdiction of Ohio.”</p>
    <p id="b251-5" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[167,627,1176,862]]]'>Holding, therefore, that the validity of this contract is to be determined by the law of New York, as decided by the courts of that state, is there any reason why the courts of this state should not enforce it ? The general rule is, that courts will enforce contracts valid by the law of the place where made, unless they are injurious to the interests of the state or of its citizens: Story on Conflict of Laws, §§ 88, 244. The injury may be indirect by offending against justice, or morality, or by tending to subvert settled public policy: 2 Kent, 458; Greenwood v. Curtis, <a href="/mass/6/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="6 Mass. 358" data-case-ids="2000806" data-case-paths="/mass/6/0294-01">6 Mass. 358</a>; Bliss v.

But this does not imply that courts will not sustain contracts that would not be valid if made within their jurisdiction, or will not enforce rights that could not be acquired there. Thus, for example, the courts of Pennsylvania have always enforced contracts for a higher rate of interest than would be valid under the laws of this state: Ralph v. Brown, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 395" data-case-ids="1854685" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0395-01">3 W. &amp; S. 395</a>; Wood v.

Nor is it in any way contrary to justice or morality. It may be doubted whether it is even so far contrary to the policy of the state that it would have been invalid if it had been made here. It has some exceptional features, which, it is argued, take it out of the ordinary rules governing the contracts of common carriers, and the case of Coup v. Railroad Co., <a href="/mich/56/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="56 Mich. 111" data-case-ids="1430099" data-case-paths="/mich/56/0111-01">56 Mich. 111</a>, is a strong authority for that position. But without stopping to discuss that point, which our general view renders unnecessary, it is sufficient to say that even if it would not have been valid if made here, its enforcement as a New York contract does not in any way derogate from the laws of Pennsylvania, or injure or affect the policy of the state, any more than would a foreign contract for what would be usurious interest here, and that as already said the courts have never hesitated to enforce.</p>

There is no evidence that defendant was unwilling to accept the ordinary and usual rates for the transportation of plaintiff’s cars and property. If they had been offered by plaintiff and refused, there might-have been some ground for the present argument, though in view of the peculiar nature of the property and the special facilities required, even that is far from clear. But in fact plaintiff got a large reduction of rates, and part of the consideration for such reduction was the agreement that he should be his own insurer against loss by accident. There was nothing compulsory about such a contract, and plaintiff comes now with a very bad grace to assert a right that he expressly relinquished for a substantial consideration.</p>

The contract set up as a defence to this action is a release to a common carrier from liability for its own negligence. It is well settled in this state that such a release is against public policy. Comity does not require more of us than to give effect to the lex loci contractus, when not subversive of the public policy of our own state. This has been distinctly held by the Court of Appeals of New York, in which this release was executed, and in whose behalf comity is asked. I would follow the Court of Appeals, because comity can require no more of us in any given case than the courts of the place of the contract would yield to us for comity’s sake; and because I believe the rule to rest on solid ground.</p>
