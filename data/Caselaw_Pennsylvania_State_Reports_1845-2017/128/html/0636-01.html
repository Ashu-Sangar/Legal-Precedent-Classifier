The "plaintiff having given his title in evidence rested. If the defendant had given no evidence, the plaintiff would have been entitled to a verdict. In that point of view, and to that extent, the defendant has the burden of proof. It was necessary for the defendant to give evidence to show that the Richard Whitehead tract was not located where the plaintiff claims it to be, and hence the defendant’s evidence as to location came first.

You will remember, in this connection, the evidence as to the age of those trees, as testified to by them, from their counting the blocks and from the blocks themselves, as they were produced in court; you will also remember the evidence as to the location of the cranberry swamp. The defendant contends that that swamp is called for in the application of the Samuel Bryan, to be within the lines of the survey to be made upon that warrant, and that it is called for to be within the lines of the survey in the return of the survey of the Samuel Bryan. It is not depicted upon the survey, but in the return of the surveyor of the fact of having made the survey, he states he has included the cranberry swamp, and the defendant contends that that is evidence of the proper location of the Samuel Bryan, the warrant calling for the survey to include the cranberry swamp, and the survey made upon it, being said by the surveyor to include it. [You will remember that the Samuel Bryan is involved here, for the reason that it is necessary to locate the Samuel Bryan in order to locate the Richard Whitehead.

That is to say, that under the facts- and circumstances as to the nature of the applications and warrants, the surveys and the work of the surveyor, you might as readily expect to find the cranberry swamp on the Richard Whitehead as on the Samuel Bryan; in other words, that both those warrants and surveys belonging to the same person, he could divide them as he chose; draw the division line wherever he chose and could have them located as he chose ; and the calls would be satisfied if the swamp was found anywhere within the outer lines. That might be correct on the question of location of the whole block, between persons who were disputing as to the tracts, but we say to you that it is not quite correct, as to apply to the facts of this case.] 7 We say to you that under the calls of the warrant and return of survey, the finding of the cranberry swamp within the lines of the Samuel Bryan, if you so find, and that is a question entirely for you, would be some evidence of the location of the Samuel Bryan in the way the defendant has located it. It would be some evidence, it would not be strong evidence; not so strong as if you should find as a block, that the surveyor had run the lines between the Samuel Bryan and the Richard Whitehead so near to the swamps that you could readily and properly infer that he came within sight of them; it would not be so strong as it would be under those circumstances, but it would be some evidence.</p>

The location of these surveys has not been disputed in the case. There is also a survey as you see in the name of William King, which is laid down on that map as adjoining the Samuel Bryan, and there are certain other surveys marked upon that map. Some óbjection has been made as to that map, and we may as well call your attention to that here.

We admitted that deposition so far as to show, or so far as it tended to prove the fact, that the witness had pointed out to him a corner, which he, owning some of the land, understood to be the Bryan line, and which he claimed too as a corner, and as evidence that some thus claimed that to be a corner. He did not know it was a corner, and you are not to take it as conclusive evidence at all that it was a corner; you can take it as evidence, as far as you believe it, of the fact that a corner existed there, a pine tree being there and the persons having claimed it as a corner. In that connection the plaintiff gives further evidence of the fact that the owners of the land in that region, understanding it to be the line of the Samuel Bryan tract, and their deeds calling for it to be the Samuel Bryan line, claimed to that corner and to the line of which they considered that to be the corner.</p>

The plaintiff gave evidence which you will remember, tending to show that one Bernard Dougherty, was interested in the William King. [You must consider that evidence and determine from that whether the call for Mr. Dougherty was intended for the William King, for the reason that the surveyor understood that Mr. Dougherty was interested in the King, or for any other reason. If you so find, in that view of it, it would be some evidence of location. If that call for Mr. Dougherty, was a call for the King survey, and if the King is located there, that call would furnish some evidence of the Samuel Bryan.] 8 The warrant for the William King was taken out before the Bryan warrant, but the Bryan is returned as being surveyed a few days before the King, and the King was surveyed before the Bryan was returned into the office; and, therefore, the work being done by the same surveyor and within such a short compass of time, it would be a fair inference that the warrants were both in the surveyor’s hands at the same time; and we say to you, the call of the Bryan for the King, if it be for the King, if you find the call for Mr. Dougherty was for the King, would be evidence tending to show the location of the Bryan.

The defendant is in under a recent warrant and survey, and insists that the true location of the Whitehead does not include this land. The location of the Whitehead is therefore conclusive of the rights of the parties. It cannot be located by marks on the ground made by the deputy-surveyor to witness the lines, for no such marks are found on any of its boundaries. Resorting next to the adjoiners, we find the Whitehead calls for the Bryan, a survey of the same <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>date, on the north. We must therefore locate the Bryan, and, when this is done, locate the Whitehead by it, and along its south line. Turning, then, to the Bryan, we find two theories of location presented by the evidence: That of the plaintiff, which rests on the white pine corner at its extreme northern end and on the William King, as the adjoiner called for under the name of Dougherty, in the angle- on the west side. The other, presented by the defendant, rests on marks found upon what is claimed to be the east line, a marked tree found on the northwest line, running from the pine in the direction of the King, and upon a natural monument, a cranberry marsh, called for by the official return as lying within its lines and near its southern boundary. The question, which of the two extreme northern corners contended for was the place of the white pine returned by the deputy surveyor, was a controlling one; for from this corner, when settled upon, it was easy to locate the survey, and with it the Whitehead. Upon this question,—the location of the white pine, and the line south from it,—the plaintiff made its offers, the rejection of which is alleged as error in the first and second assignments.</p>
    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[182,1359,1169,953]]]'>It is very clear that, in a contest between two adjoining surveys, the junior must always give way. It may have a well-marked line of the proper age for its own survey inclosing it, but the senior will not be affected by it. It will reach to its own lines, appropriating all within them, and the junior survey will be restricted to what may be thus left for it. It is therefore correct to say that the lines of a younger survey cannot change, alter, or affect those of an older one when they come in conflict. Here the question raised is quite different. The lines of the younger survey, calling for the older as an adjoiner, are offered as showing the acts and declarations of a deceased deputy surveyor as to the location of the line of the older. There is no conflict between them. The younger survey asks nothing adverse to the older. The purpose for which the evidence is offered is not to disturb, but to sustain, the lines of the senior survey, by showing that the sureyor who located the younger tract recognized the lines of the older one as being where it is now claimed they are, and acted upon that belief in doing his work.</p>

The <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>former was well located by work on the ground. The latter was located with equal certainty by its adjoiners. It called for the Bryan on its west side, from the McKissiek to the white pine at the extreme north corner, and again on the south, extending between the London surveys and the Bryan to the King. At its interior corner a pine is called for, where the Bryan also calls for a pine. If, now, the spot where the survey of the Elliott places the pine can be ascertained, it shows wdiere the surveyor who located the McKissiek and the Elliott believed the pine of the Bryan to be, when he did his work in 1797. The fact that no marks of the Elliott were found along these lines, does not show that the surveyor was not upon them. The London surveys and the Bryan were older than the Elliott, and the latter could have no lines except those of the older surveys it adjoined along its entire line of contact with them. The legal presumption that the tract was surveyed as returned must prevail, where there is nothing on the ground to overcome it. The mere failure in surveying a younger tract to re-mark, or to mark in any manner, the line of an older survey, called for as an adjoiner, does not weaken the legal presumption in the slightest degree. If this be so, the offer should have been admitted as showing how the deputy surveyor, in 1797, located the pine corner and the east and north lines of the Bryan, when on the ground to locate the McKissiek and the Elliott. It does not follow that his opinion was correct, but its value is for the jury. He may have been mistaken. If there are marks on the ground that locate the lines elsewhere, the marks must control; but, if there are no sufficient evidences of original lines to locate them by, then the opinions of deceased surveyors and deputy surveyors, as shown by their acts and declarations on the ground, are some evidence upon the question of their true location: Sweigart v.

The surveys embraced in the offer are of much more recent date, but are nevertheless ancient, being of the ages of 71, 68, and 35 years, respectively, at the time of the trial. They show the official work of different deputy surveyors, made long before the present controversy began, in the location of warrants upon the ground which called for the Bryan or the Whitehead as <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>adjoiners. They may have been mistaken in their location of the east and south lines of these warrants, and the value of their opinions must .be determined, as the value of the opinions of a witness called to the stand would be determined; but the evidence should have been admitted.</p>
    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[182,592,1176,1635]]]'>The eighth assignment raises the only other question to which it is important to advert. The theory of location presented by the plaintiff depended, in part, on the King, which it was alleged was. the survey intended by the call for Dougherty, in the angle on the west of the Bryan. Upon this sdbject the court instructed the jury that, in case they should conclude that the King was the survey intended by the call for Dougherty, “ it would be some evidence of location. If that call for Mr. Dougherty was a call for the King survey, and if the King survey is located there, that call would furnish some evidence of the location of the Samuel Bryan.” This was true, but it was not a full presentation of the subject. The general rule is that a survey, in the absence of marks that restrain it, goes to its adjoiners and may be located by them. If, therefore, the jury had found, as this instruction supposed it possible they might find, that the King was called for as an adjoiner on two sides, and was located on the ground as contended for by the plaintiff, this would take the Bryan to the King, unless it was stopped short by work on the ground made for its own lines. Such a finding as was contemplated by this instruction would have located the Bryan against the King, and been a substantial adoption of the plaintiff’s theory of location. It was not enough to say, therefore, that a finding for the plaintiff as to the location of the King, and its identity with the Dougherty called for, was “ some evidence of the location of the Samuel Bryan; ” for such a finding would locate the west side of the Bryan, in the absence of marks on the ground to override the call. It may be, as is suggested by counsel for the defendant, that such a finding would locate the Bryan in such a manner as to exclude the land in controversy; but that was for the jury, and we cannot say that the plaintiff was not injured by the instruction complained of.</p>

The plaintiff asked the court to charge that “ the call of a younger survey for an older survey is some evidence of where the older survey is located; and this evidence becomes stronger as greater time elapses from the location of the senior survey, thus destroying the primary evidence of where such survey was originally located.” The court replied: “ TMs, we say, is an abstract proposition, and it may be correct, or it may not, depending upon the circumstances of the case. There are circumstances under which a younger survey may be evidence of an older, and there may be circumstances under' which it may not be.” But how was it as to the case trying ? What were the jury to understand as to their duty? Were the “circumstances” such as to justify them in applying the general doctrine of the point to this case, and treating the junior surveys as some evidence bearing on the question of the location of the Bryan ? Or, were the circumstances of this case of that sort that deprived the younger surveys of any value as evidence on that question? How were they to tell ? The answer was neither an affirmance nor a denial of the proposition of the point, as it was applicable to the case trying, and it left the jury with no definite instruction upon the question raised.</p>
