Claims for wages of manual labor are under the peculiar protection of the law: Section 1, act of April 9, 1872, P. L. 47; act of June 13, 1883, P. L. 116; § 1, act of April 20, <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>1876, P. L. 43; § 1, act of March. 22, 1877, P.

These acts confer upon aldermen and justices of the peace a peculiar jurisdiction, not previously existing, and operative only in favor of claimants or plaintiffs. In them, no reference is made to § 7, act of March 20, 1810, 5 Sm. L. 165, requiring defendants to set off their demands not exceeding $100, when sued before a justice, and therefore the provisions of that act do not apply to suits for labor claims governed by the later acts. Hence the court was in error in granting the nonsuit upon the authority of the act of 1810, which could not control the proceedings in this case: Chestnut Hill Turnp. Co. v. Martin, <a href="/pa/12/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="963757" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0361-01">12 Pa. 361</a>.</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[196,998,1173,753]]]'>2. Under the ruling of .the court below, the beneficent objects of the later acts could be defeated or evaded by a tricky debtor, bjr simply bringing a groundless suit against the wage-earner. In the case in hand, the defendant’s suit was brought, after receiving notice to settle from the plaintiff, merely to anticipate him. The act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 180, requiring the payment of wages in money, and that of March 4, 1887, P. L. 4, repealing the exemption law as to judgments for wages of manual labor, prevent the set-off of an ordinary judgment against such a judgment: Bosche v. Maurer, 5 Pa. C. C. R. 215. And yet we were expected to offer our claim for wages against the alleged claim of the defendant. The judgment of nonsuit practically repeals the acts relating to wages of manual labor, so far as respects the plaintiff: Rex v. Rex, 3 S. &amp; R. 535.</p>
    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[191,1769,1172,607]],["BL_610.1",610,[263,322,1166,93]]]'>3. But even if the act of 1810 should apply to this case, the nonsuit was error, because, though that act requires mutual claims to be settled in one action, it does not absolutely prevent parties from carrying on separate suits at the same time before a justice of the peace for their mutual demands, and when this is done without objection, both proceedings are valid: Groff v. Ressler, <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Pa.%2073" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="27 Pa. 73">27 Pa. 73</a>. In this case, no objection to the present action was made before the alderman by the defendant, and the decision cited is therefore applicable and shows palpable error in the judgment. The position of the defendant is the same as if he had entered the plea of lis pendens. That is a plea in abatement: 1 Tr. &amp; H. Pr., §§ 515, 516, After an <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>appeal from a justice a plea in abatement is too late, if none was made before tbe justice: Hinckley v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%20438" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 W. 438">4 W. 438</a>.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[260,423,1175,855]]]'>4. There can be no set-off where the plaintiff has no cause of action: Claridge v. Klett, <a href="/pa/15/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="408681" data-case-paths="/pa/15/0255-01">15 Pa. 255</a>. The evidence on the trial failed to show that the defendant had any cause of action in the suit brought by him before justice Wesley, which was cognizable before a justice of the peace. Before he would be entitled to a nonsuit, the defendant should have shown this affirmatively. If his claim for damages had reference to a contract of hiring, was it for negligence in the execution of the plaintiff’s duty under the contract ? If so it was for a tort, of which the justice had no jurisdiction: Zell v. Arnold, <a href="/pen-w/2/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 292" data-case-ids="8878412" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0292-01">2 P. &amp; W. 292</a>; Henion v.

Davidson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20516" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Phila. 516">1 Phila. 516</a>. Nor, if the action sounded in tort, could any set-off be allowed: Kater v. Steinruck, <a href="/pa/40/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="40 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="478088" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0501-01">40 Pa. 501</a>. A plea in abatement involves a matter of fact. There being no evidence to show 'that the justice had jurisdiction in the defendant’s suit, the nonsuit in this case was error.</p>

The defendant did not appear, but after judgment entered an appeal in the Common Pleas. At the trial, the defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit, upon the ground that a previous action had been brought by the defendant in this suit, against the present plaintiff before another alderman, for a claim of damages amounting to $50, arising out of the same transaction and ex contractu, which action was still pending and undetermined, and that the claim now in suit, must be set off in that action, under the act of 1810. A nonsuit was entered, and upon a rule to show cause the court refused to take it off; this is the error assigned.</p>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.7",611,[170,1443,1168,908]],["BL_612.1",612,[258,319,1158,84]]]'>In actions brought to recover for the services of manual labor, certain special provisions have from time to time been made by statute, for sure and speedy collection; and the wages of labor have been accorded a species of protection which has not been extended to any other kind of claim. For examples, when judgment is rendered for the wages of' manual labor, the defendant is entitled to an appeal only .upon entering bail to secure the debt, interest, and costs: Act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 43; no stay of execution is allowed: Act of May 14, 1874, P. L. 145; nor exemption of property from attachment, levy, and sale, where the amount does not exceed $100: Act of March 4, 1887, P. L. 4; suits therefor are preferred on the trial list: Act of March 22, 1877, P. L. 13; and labor claims have preference over claims for rent: Act of June 12,1878, P. L. 207. The plaintiff’s argument is, that if labor claimants are obliged to set off their claims under the act of 1810, they may be deprived of some of the protection to which by law they are thus entitled, and generally, that the provisions of the act of <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>1810 are inconsistent with the purpose of the later provisions mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b612-4" data-blocks='[["BL_612.4",612,[249,423,1171,1159]]]'>We cannot see any ground for this contention. The act of 1810, which is older than any of the special statutes referred to, certainly embraced a set-off for the wages of manual labor at the time of its passage; it has certainly been so understood ever since, and there is no statute which in terms in this respect abridges its effect. The act of 1810 is in no sense inconsistent with any of the provisions mentioned. It is urged that the act of April 20, 1876, P. L. 48, requiring bail for debt, interest, and costs on an appeal, applies only when the <em>defendant </em>appeals; and that if the wage-claimant is himself the defendant in the suit, and is bound to set off his claim of wages, the plaintiff may appeal without giving bail under that act, and then by a mere trick of an unscrupulous debtor, the labor claimant may be deprived of the security it was the plain purpose of the law to provide. But the difficulty is more apparent than real. A claim of set-off is in the nature of a cross action, and when judgment is entered upon it in the defendant’s favor, the relation of the parties is changed; the plaintiff in the suit becomes defendant in the judgment, and that changed relation continues until an appeal is entered, when the case proceeds in the Common Pleas de novo. It follows that the bail for an appeal, even in such a ease, must be according to the requirements of the act of April 20, 1876.</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[246,1591,1167,298]]]'>. The plea as to pendency of the suit is not in the nature of a plea in abatement.
