And I say to you that this accident, having happened in ascending the steps of the car from the platform of a station, it is the- duty of the plaintiff to show that it happened through the negligence of the company. You will see, therefore, that the question which first presents itself here is as to how this accident happened, whether the railroad company was in fault, whether there was negligence upon their part which caused this accident. If it appears to the satisfaction of the jury, bearing in mind that the burden of proving it is upon the plaintiff, that there was such negligence on the part of the company, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. But if the jury are not satisfied upon this point, and find that the accident was not caused by the conduct of the employee of the railroad, the plaintiff has no case. It does not follow that because a person is injured somebody must pay for it. There are accidents happening every day to persons, where there is no one who <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>can be asked to respond in damages, and where the person injured must suffer the effects of such injury, without recourse to others.</p>

Miss Alvord says that she was passing from the stairs which led down to the platform; that she walked across this platform to the car which was the rear car in the train, and was about stepping on to the steps of the car; that the brakeman was there, and that just at that instant of time when she was aKout getting a foothold upon the steps of the car, he brushed past her, hastily preceding her up the steps of the car, and that he pushed or jostled her so that she lost her foothold, her foot slipped or did not obtain a firm footing upon the step, and that she thus slipped down between the car and the platform and was injured as she describes; and she attributes this to the conduct of the brakeman in thus passing between her and the step, so that it prevented her from obtaining the foothold which she would otherwise have obtained.] 1 She says in substance :</p>

[Now, if the brakeman did thus interfere with her getting her foothold upon the step, and, if in consequence of his passing in in this way she failed to get a foothold which she would otherwise have obtained, and if the accident resulted from his thus passing in before her, then that would be negligence upon the part of the employee of the railroad for which the railroad would be responsible ; and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.] 58</p>

The brakeman says that he was standing on the side of the car step, which would be east of the step, as the train was heading <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>westward, to the right of the plaintiff as she was ascending the steps; that he was facing her as she came towards the steps of the car, and that in passing up the steps, in some way her foot slipped, or she did not get a foothold, or made a misstep ; and that he then passed up the step of the other car, on the left hand side of the car, to assist her. And he alleges that the accident happened in consequence of that misstep, and without any action whatever on his part. Now, if that is the way this accident happened, the railroad company would not be at fault. If she came down and took hold of the rail in the usual way to enter the car, and then went to step on to the steps, and the brakeman did nothing to impede her passage, of course the railroad company would not be at fault in the matter. If that is the way this accident happened, then the plaintiff cannot recover. However much we may regret the accident, however much the plaintiff may have suffered, if the fault was not the fault of the railroad company, it is one of those inevitable accidents which will occur and do occur where there is no responsibility.</p>

She being a regular rider, I had some idea that her intention was to come down and get in that car for West Chester, as it was a West Chester car. She came down and in attempting to get on she stepped on the step, and apparently made a short step, or stepped on her dress, I could not tell which, as I was right in the rear, or a little to one side of her, and the result was she slipped and fell on the step. I assisted her to her feet, and then as she was passing up the steps I came in the rear, back of her, up the steps, reached in front and opened the door for her. She passed in and was seated when the train started.”</p>

There was nothing in the evidence from which such an inference could be drawn. The plaintiff did not state, or hint even, that the brakeman ran against or pushed her. But the plaintiff’s fourth point and the answer to it, coupled with the misstatement referred to, allowed the jury to find a fact of which there was no evidence, and to rest a verdict upon it.
