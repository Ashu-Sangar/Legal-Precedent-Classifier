The alleged misrepresentation, that the corporation plaintiff had a paid-up capital of $50,000, was not per se such a fraud upon the defendant as would avoid the contract, as it appeared that although the capital was not all paid up, the stock was at that time all held by persons who were able to pay, whenever the uncollected part of the capital might be needed. Being thus an available asset which could be realized at any time, the financial standing was not affected or im<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>paired by its non-payment, and consequently the defendant could not have been deceived, in any legal sense, by Smith’s statement.</p>
    <p id="b603-4" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[187,520,1177,765]]]'>2. The insurance contract with Mrs. Weigle was a purely mutual one, by the express terms of which the death losses were restricted to the amount which might be realized out of the assessments upon surviving members: Seitzinger v. New Era Life Ass’n, 15 W. N. 348. The capital stock, therefore, could not in any event be required to respond for losses occurring upon mutual policies, but was presumably reserved to respond for losses under the other forms of insurance, in which the association was authorized to engage by § 28, act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 84. The alleged misrepresentation was therefore entirely immaterial, as it did not matter, so far as the value of Mrs. Weigle’s contract was concerned, whether the corporation had any capital at all or not. The case here presented is entirely unlike Sunbury F. Ins. Co. v. Humble, <a href="/pa/100/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="100 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="498466" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0495-01">100 Pa. 495</a>, relied on by the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[178,1294,1186,863]]]'>3. There was error in taking the case away from the jury and giving binding instructions for the defendant. Upon the refusal of the plaintiff’s point, the entire defence was resolved into questions of fact which were for the jury alone, and the court should then have submitted to them two questions: (1) whether the alleged misrepresentation was in fact made, •and (2) whether, if so, it was material as an inducement to enter into the contract. The witness liable, when first called, made an unequivocal statement that the words used by the agent were that the corporation “ had a capital stock of $50,000,” and this was shown to be literally true. It was not until he was afterwards recalled that he said the agent represented the capital to be paid up. The effect of this was to raise a doubt as to what the agent actually said, which could only be resolved by the jury. But even independent of this, the question of materiality should have been submitted to the jury, as in Sunbury F. Ins. Co. v. Humble, <a href="/pa/100/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="100 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="498466" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0495-01">100 Pa. 495</a>.</p>

But if <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>it be conceded that there is, the argument for the plaintiff ignores the circumstance that Mrs. Weigle was kept in ignorance of the facts, was allowed to infer from the representation made to her that the security of the policy she was bargaining for would be enhanced by the corporation’s paid-up capital of $50,000, and was thus fraudulently entrapped into paying her money for this worthless policy.

    <p id="b604-6" data-blocks='[["BL_604.5",604,[240,1281,1177,557]]]'>3. That the agent made the false and fraudulent representation in question, was not denied. Confessedly it was made. The plaintiff’s point virtually concedes this. The argument as to a supposed discrepancy in Mr. Kable’s testimony, is a mere quibble. It simply appears that, as any honest witness might do, he inadvertently omitted the words “ paid-up ” from his testimony, and, upon his attention being called thereto, asked to correct the error on the spot, though saying he felt sure he had used those words originally. This was not sufficient to “raise a doubt” as to what the agent said, or require a submission to the jury.</p>

A full disclosure of every circumstance material to the risk is required in writing, and an express covenant that <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>all the statements so made are true is added, which contains among many other provisions the following: “ I hereby covenant and agree that the above answers are true; that a misstatement or concealment of any fact touching my health or material to the question of longevity,” etc., shall render the policy null and void. The other side of the negotiations, the misstatements and concealments of facts “touching the health or material to the longevity” of the insurance company are not provided for. There is no express covenant that the representations of the experienced and persuasive solicitor shall be true. The insured is largely at his mercy, for he has ordinarily no other means of information in regard to the company, the contract, and its value to himself or his family, than that which the interested agent affords him. He represents the company in the negotiations, and his statements are as material to the validity of the contract as are those of the insured. Fraud and falsehood on either side, which induce the making of the contract, afford a ground of relief to the injured party, whether such party be insurer or insured.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[192,1325,1178,904]]]'>In the case now before us, the parties to the contract are an insurance company without capital, a mere shell; and a woman desirous to make some provision for her only soil. The representative of the company persuades her, as she testifies, to take a policy upon her life on the mutual side of the company, by telling her that it was in good financial standing in the business world, and had a paid-up capital of fifty thousand dollars. This paid-up capital she was made to understand would in some way provide for the mortuary assessments to be made on the holders of policies on the mutual plan, so that after the payment of her premium and first year’s dues, amounting together to thirty-nine dollars, she would have little or nothing to pay. Neither the agent nor any one else contradicts her in the statement of the representations made to her, but she is sustained by her employer, who testifies that he heard the assurance of the agent made to her more than once, that the company was in good standing and had a paid-up capital of fifty thousand dollars.</p>

    <p id="b606-4" data-blocks='[["BL_606.3",606,[245,344,1179,763]]]'>
      <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>We agree with the learned judge of the*court below that the solvency of the company proposing to insure was a consideration material to the insured, and that a misrepresentation upon that subject by the agent which induced the applicant to pay her money to a worthless company for a policy that did not insure, was a fraud which rendered the contract voidable by her. If Mrs. Weigle had understood that the company was without capital, without financial standing, and without ability to meet its contracts, she would not have paid her money for a policy in it; but her action was induced, as she states, by the representations made by the agent, and believed by her, in regard to the paid-up capital and financial standing of the company. The representations related to a material subject, and were a material part of the contract: Sunbury Fire Ins. Co. v. Humble, <a href="/pa/100/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="100 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="498466" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0495-01">100 Pa. 495</a>.</p>
    <p id="b606-5" data-blocks='[["BL_606.4",606,[240,1125,1181,1264]]]'>But ought not this uncontradicted testimony to have been submitted to the jury? If this had been asked in the court below, it would have been proper to submit the question of credibility to the jury, but it does not appear to have been asked. If not asked there, it cannot be complained of here. The point submitted to the court by the plaintiff below, shows that the reliance of counsel rested on the question of the materiality of the representations set up, rather than on the credibility of the witnesses by whom they were proved. The point is as follows: “It appearing by the uncontradicted testimony in the case, that the representation which is set up as a bar to the recovery is immaterial, and in no wise affected the financial standing of the company at the time it was made, it was not such a misrepresentation as would amount to a fraud or prevent a recovery, and the court is requested to so instruct the j.ury as a matter of law.” This is in effect a concession of the fact. The issue raised is over its materiality only. Granting the fact to be as alleged by the defendant below, the point asks a binding instruction that it is an immaterial one, and not sfieh “as would amount to a fraud or prevent a recovery.” It is now too late to complain that the facts should have gone to the jury for determination, when no such suggestion or request was made at the proper time or place. It would be unfair to the court and to the defendant to sustain this assignment of error upon this record.</p>
