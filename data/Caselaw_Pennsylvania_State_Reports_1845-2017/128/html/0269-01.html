In making up their account the executors added interest to the sums due by Abercrombie and Appleton from the dates assigned by the testator to those debts respectively up to the time of his death, and thence to the period at which the income began to accrue, to wit, one year thereafter; and they thus fixed the principal of the indebtedness as an asset of the estate. This course was dictated by the very clearly expressed thought of the testator. He describes the <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>sums so due as “ debts,” fixes tbeir several amounts, and assigns to each its separate date. The last circumstance is conclusive against the theory of an advancement, and would compel the imposition of interest, even if the testator had not immediately afterwards required that the interest on these debts should be included as a part of the current income of his estate. It may be objected that the debtor legatees are at the mercy of the executors, who may lengthen the time during which interest is payable by delaying distribution. But the testator must have foreseen this, and evidently did not regard it as a hardship to the legatees. The language with which he begins the fifth clause, “ So long as my said estate, or any portion thereof, shall be held undivided by my said trustees,” and the power in the trustees to continue the business, shows that he did not look for an immediate division. During that time the accruing interest was to be added to income, so that the two legatees would receive back as distributees a part of what had been imposed upon them as debtors. The capitalization of the debts necessarily ceased at the end of the first year, because at that time the distributable income commenced to accrue.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b293-5" data-blocks='[["BL_293.4",293,[165,1365,1181,1016]],["BL_294.1",294,[280,340,1169,145]]]'>The testator draws a sharp distinction between the sums •charged against the Abercrombie and Appleton shares, and those charged against the shares of the other distributees. In every instance he calls the first “ debts ” and the others “ sums charged.” That the latter are advancements and therefore not chargeable with interest is too clear to be doubted. This is true, of course, up to the time at which distribution is presumably to be made and the advancements are presumably refunded to the estate. The estate is entitled to repayment at that time, and if repayment is delayed, interest runs through the period of delay upon the advancements. The auditing judge cannot find in this will any intent to exempt these advancements from this rule. They, as well as the debts, are to be taken into account as assets. But all assets are computed as of the date of testator’s death, and the assets in question were distributable at the end of the year from the death, even if other assets were not then got into possession. By “ distributable,” the auditing judge means that they were apportion-.able, as of that date, among all the distributees, to be paid as ■soon as the estate should be divided. From the date of appor<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>tionment, therefore, the parties advanced, being in possession of their shares, should pay interest, in order to work equality with those who were compelled to wait.</p>

It was also ordered that in making a distribution of the principal there should be charged against the Abercrombie share the aggregate of the indebtedness of the estate of General Abercrombie and of Samuel Appleton, with interest, the indebtedness of Samuel Appleton, so far as that share would suffice, being first deducted from the Appleton purpart of the Abercrombie share.</p>

Upon reading the will, it is evident the testator realized the impracticability of the settlement of his large estate, with a due regard for the best interests of those he intended to benefit, within the period of time usually contemplated by law, namely, at the expiration of one year from his death, and therefore authorized the trustees to continue the business of any of his manufactories, for a time not exceeding three years thereafter.</p>

Furthermore, testator <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>was familiar, not alone with the details of his extensive business, but he also knew from its nature and character that the trustees would immediately upon his death be in receipt of a considerable income therefrom, which could be distributed among his beneficiaries. He accordingly directed that, so long as his estate or any portion thereof shall be held undivided by his trustees, the net income thereof shall be semi-annually divided between his surviving children, and the children or issue of a deceased daughter, in equal shares.</p>

But in the distribution of the income by the trustees, prior to the division or partition of his estate, he directed that, in computing the income for the purpose of such division, the trustees shall include the current interest for the preceding six months upon these debts, as if paid to them by the debtors; and, in the actual distribution then to be made, deduct the amount of interest from the share payable to the children of his deceased daughter and of his deceased granddaughter.</p>

And then, from tbe construction we place upon the will, the trustees are directed to add to the net income from other sources, interest for the preceding six months upon the indebtedness, in order to ascertain the total amount for distribution. In other words, the debts bear interest from the death of the testator. This we think to be his intention, and not that the indebtedness should bear interest from the date fixed by him in his will to the date of his death, nor that the sum thus ascertained, composed of principal and interest, should be again augmented by adding interest thereon, and thus compound the interest. Testator’s intention to convert these debts into advancements is clearly manifest by the subsequent provision of the will, and his power to do so does not admit of argument: Skinner’s App., 3 Penn. S. C. Digest 318. And the reason is “ because he may prescribe the conditions on which a child shall take the portion bequeathed him:” 1 Rhone’s O. C. Pr. 73. The debts thus converted into advancements are not chargeable with interest: Green v.

The impropriety of now determining whether the advancements are chargeable with interest, and from what date, if chargeable, and distributing the interest upon the advancements, when no distribution of the principal is to be made, is therefore apparent.

    <p id="b298-11" data-blocks='[["BL_298.10",298,[230,1473,1169,660]]]'>In view of the explicit language of the testator, there is no room for the construction put upon the will by the court below, which practically makes the above-mentioned sums debts due to the testator at the dates mentioned in the will, then converts them into advancements bearing no interest until the death of testator, and then immediately reconverts them into “ debts due the estate,” bearing interest from the testator’s death. It is submitted that the only construction consistent with the testator’s language is, that these sums were debts due to him calculated to certain dates, and, of course, bearing interest from those dates, and that upon testator’s death the amounts then due became debts due the estate, bearing interest under the express terms of the will.</p>

The soundness of this doctrine may well be questioned. An advancement is never taken into consideration until the distribution is made. If the distribution be unreasonably delayed, the executors may be compelled to file their account and may be surcharged for any loss occasioned by their delay. If the delay has not been unreasonable, there is no occasion for exacting any penalty from those to whom advances have been made, and there is no more injustice in failing to exact interest after testator’s death, than there was before it.</p>

To this, two answers at once suggest themselves: (1) The distribution of income is in itself a partial distribution of the estate, and necessarily involves the question whether the distributee has received advancements, the interest or principal of which should be set off; and, (2) the present account was an account of principal as well as income, and contained both cash and securities which it was the duty of the court to award to the parties entitled, and in so doing to decide the proportions in which their shares were payable.</p>

It is true, the testator describes the Abercrombie and Appleton debts as “debts,” and to that extent distinguishes them from the other advancements made to his children, but we have not urged that the distinction was accidental, though such may have been the case. Whether it was or not, the term was aptly used. These were not sums due by children, but by outside parties, as to whom they were undoubtedly debts. But call them what we will, when the testator came to charge them against the share of his child, they were converted into advancements, and as such do not bear interest. As debts, they were long since barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

It is also conceded that advancements do not bear interest for the period prior to the testator’s death.

They were debts in the common meaning of the word at the beginning. They were secured as-such, and treated so far as we know in all respects as debts, until the testator sat down to make his will. Then the subject of distributing his estate among his children was before him, and we are to consider what he has said upon that subjects The maxim that equality is equity among heirs is a cardinal rule of distribution : Miller’s App., <a href="/pa/31/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="31 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="985080" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0337-01">31 Pa. 337</a>. In the absence of expressions clearly indicating a contrary intention, the courts will presume that the testator intended equality of distribution <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>among his own children, in accordance with the settled policy of the law in this commonwealth: Weaver’s App., <a href="/pa/63/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="63 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1019033" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0309-01">63 Pa. 309</a>. As between a loan, a gift and an advancement, the presumption is in favor of an advancement, because of its tendency to equality: Sampson v. Sampson, 4 S. &amp; E. 329. With these principles in mind, we read the provision of the will on which this question depends:</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.4",301,[196,697,1167,864]]]'>“ I direct that the debts due me by the estate of my son-in-law General John J. Abercrombie, deceased, and by Samuel Appleton, Esq., respectively as aforesaid, and also any other sums charged on my books at the time of my death against my sons, daughters or sons-in-law, shall be taken into account as assets by the trustees or trustee on making partition or division of my estate as hereinbefore directed; and the said sums charged against a son shall be taken as a part of the share or shares to be set apart in the said division for or on account of such son or his issue ; and the said debts of General John J. Abercrombie and of Samuel Appleton, Esq., shall both be taken as part of the share or shares to be set apart in the said division for or on account of the issue of my said deceased daughter, Mary Ann Engle; and the said sums charged against any other daughter or her husband shall be taken as part of the share or shares to be set apart in said division for or on account of such daughter or her issue.”</p>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[193,1569,1169,862]]]'>The presumption that equality was intended by the treatment of all the several debts and sums charged as advances, is not weakened but strengthened by a careful examination of this provision. They are all treated in exactly the same manner, viz., as chargeable against the sons and daughters or their issue, on the general division of his estate, as so much already received. Mrs. Abercrombie’s share is not distinguished in any way from that of her brothers and sisters. All of the distributees are to be charged with what they have received, and the daughters are to be charged in addition with what has been received by their husbands, “ as part of the share or shares to be set apart in the said division for or on account of ” themselves or their issue. As these debts were thus turned into advancements by the terms of the will, they bore no interest during the life of the testator. The amount of each debt was ascertained as of the date given, and by the will it was in effect charged as an advancement as of that date.</p>
    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.3",302,[237,337,1167,756]]]'>
      <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>Second. “ Was interest chargeable upon the advances to the children from the expiration of a year after decedent’s death? ” Yes! Such seems to be the rule in Pennsylvania and it tends to equality: Yundt’s App., <a href="/pa/13/0575-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="13 Pa. 575" data-case-ids="964907" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0575-01">13 Pa. 575</a>; Ford’s Estate, 2 W. N. 113. The exception is the case of the advances to General Joan J. Abercrombie and Samuel Appleton. These were chargeable with interest from the death of the testator by the express direction of the will, and the interest whether received by the trustee or not was to be applied semi-annually to the payment pro tanto of the share of the income of the estate payable to Mrs. Abercrombie or her issue. Interest is to be charged on the advancements to her from the death of her father because he has so ordered; on the advancement made to the other sons and daughters of the testator, from one year thereafter, in accordance with the rule of law above referred to.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[236,1104,1167,595]]]'>Third. “Should the court below have decided both these questions on the present account ? ” Yes ! The total amount of income for distribution cannot be determined without such a decision, nor can the share to be awarded to each in cash. The income is to be distributed, until distribution of the principal or corpus of the estate can be made. The period covered is over three years. For the first year there would be no trouble in ascertaining the amount of the income, but after the first year its amount would depend on whether interest upon the other advancements was to be included or excluded. As the total sum would be thus affected, so would the share of each iu the several semi-annual distributions of the income.</p>
