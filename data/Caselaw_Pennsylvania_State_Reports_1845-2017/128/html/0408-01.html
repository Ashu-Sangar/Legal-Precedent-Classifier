If it was wholly insufficient to justify such a finding, there was no error in withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury and directing a verdict for defendant.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[237,592,1180,1668]]]'>The claim against the corporation defendant appears to have originated as follows: Plaintiff’s father, by the second codicil to his will, executed eight days before his decease, bequeathed his residuary estate, amounting nominally to nearly $20,000, to the defendant, in trust for charitable purposes. It is conceded that under our statute the bequest, thus made less than one calendar month before testator’s death, was absolutely void, and plaintiff as one of his lieirs-at-law was legally entitled to one third of said residuary estate. In due course of administration it would have been converted into money and she would have received her share of the proceeds; but, about three weeks after her father’s death she was induced to execute a paper releasing all claim thereto,, and requesting the executor “ to pay over to the several legatees named in the will the legacies therein devised, according to the terms therein expressed, and especially any balance that may be devised to the First Presbyterian Church and Congregation of Meadville, Pa.,” the defendant in this suit. In less than six months thereafter the executor assigned and transferred to defendant the residuary estate, nominally amounting to $19,257, consisting of mortgages, judgments, and other evidences of indebtedness, the real value of which is said to be about $13,000. Afterwards plaintiff discovered, as she alleges, that the release had been fraudulently procured from her by Mr. White, who was an officer and agent of the corporation defendant, and thereupon she determined to insist on claiming her interest in the residuary estate. The release, being regular on its face, was of course a sufficient warrant to the executor for disposing of the residuary estate as he did, and hence plaintiff had no recourse to him. She then brought this suit to recover the value of her interest in the residuary estate, which came into defendant’s possession by virtue of the release and assignment aforesaid.</p>

    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[200,513,1178,1057]]]'>It is not our purpose to refer in detail to the evidence relied on by plaintiff, but a careful consideration of it as a whole has led us to a different conclusion. Dr. A. McLean White, through whose active agency the release was procured, was a. trustee of the corporation defendant and secretary of the board of trustees. As the confidential friend of the testator he wrote and witnessed the will, and, as appears by printed exhibit contained in defendant’s paper book, he was present when the will was read, on the day after the funeral, and heard Mr. Bole, who had been general counsel for testator, announce that the second codicil, containing the residuary bequest to defendant, was void for want of time between the date thereof and the death of testator. A few days thereafter, with full knowledge of that fact, and, as he himself declares, knowing everything about testator’s property and how he disposed of it, Mr. White addressed a letter to plaintiff, in which he volunteered to furnish her “all the details frankly and carefully,” in relation to her father’s death and the disposition he made of his property. He also suggested that there was some interest coming to her on a certain note, which he would endeavor to secure for her, etc. The letter in full is as follows:—</p>

If such is the case and you will inform me, I will use my influence to secure what balance of interest may be yours, if you feel satisfied that you should have it. This will be without any expense to you.

He thought at first of making Mr. Northam the trustee, but when he remembered that the church was incorporated and perpetual in its duration, he made it his trustee. As he had many bad debts, some outlawed, it is hard to tell what the remainder may be. Everything else must be paid—his legacies, debts, a law suit, just begun against him by the Whit-mans, must be fought again, lawyers’ fees; but if we could get the estate settled without delay, and thus save executors’ and court fees, it would prove much more than if prolonged, and that brings me to the business and conclusion of this long letter.</p>

The executor, Mr. Northam, is perfectly willing to pay over to you everything that the board of trustees of the First Presbyterian Church instructs him to pay, which, of course, must be deducted from what your father left tbe poor of the church. Without the consent of the board, however, he cannot pay anything to you legally. I have no doubt as to either of your claims in equity; most probably under the will neither of them could be enforced, but I have this assurance from a part of the board of trustees, the secretary of which I <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>have been for quite a number of years, that having written your father’s will, and being fully conversant with his desires, that if I fully concur in recommendation to the board that this amount shall be given to you out of the fund entrusted to the church, and present a paper from you that will be satisfactory to the board, and also to the executor, as his voucher to be passed upon by the court when he closes his account, then I can get a resolution passed by the board to pay the $150 over to you, or rather have Mr. Northam do so, for he has one year to settle his matters, and I think I can get this from him at once and without delay.</p>

Let me add in confidence this: This is because I honored your father and desire to act justly towards <em>all </em>his children. I will write Lucy’s will soon. She has so requested me. I feel that it is her duty to make her sisters her residuary legatees. T shall use all my influence in that direction, for I believe your father would desire it, and it is just in every respect. I shall be the friend of yourself and Mrs. Bigelow, and anything you desire to know I will cheerfully communicate it. The paper inclosed after being dated and signed must be acknowledged before a notary public, not an alderman or justice. Please sign the receipt also.”</p>

These, of course, were questions of fact for the jury, and should have been submitted to them under proper instructions.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.4",440,[246,873,1189,914]]]'>The evidence tends to show that by strong professions of friendship, and expressions of desire to gratuitously render her all the assistance in his power, even to the extent of persuading her sister Lucy to make her one of her legatees, etc., he invited and succeeded in establishing, between himself and plaintiff, a ■ relation of trust and confidence which he was not at liberty to abuse, to her prejudice, by misrepresentation of facts or suppression of the truth in relation to her interest in the estate. His assertion, that without the assent of the corporation defendant, the executor could not legally pay her anything, not even the $150 that she claimed her father owed her, was not only untrue, but it was tantamount to a declaration that the residuary bequest to defendant was valid and binding. It is difficult to understand how he could have supposed there was’ any truth in either. But, whether he so believed or not, the evidence tends to show that plaintiff was misled as to the true situation of her father’s estate, and thereby induced to execute the release in question.</p>

It gave no consideration for plaintiff’s share of the residuary estate. The release, it is true, recites a pecuniary consideration of $150, but that represents the two items claimed by plaintiff as due from her father. On the trial she offered to prove in surrebuttal that $50 thereof was interest due on the $1,000 note, and the remaining $100 was money her father owed her on another matter. Defendant’s counsel waived the proof by admitting the facts as stated in the offer. Plaintiff is thus made to occupy the somewhat anomalous position of having provided the'pecuniary consideration for her own release. In point of fact, the defendant gave no consideration for the interest it <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>claims to withhold from plaintiff by virtue of her release. It is a mere volunteer and cannot claim exemption from the legal consequences of its agent’s acts.</p>
