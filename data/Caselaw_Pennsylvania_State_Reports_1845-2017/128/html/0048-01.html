    <p class="summary" id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[270,764,1168,1152]]]'>In the county of Lancaster, the county solicitor is elected by the people once in every three years, in accordance with the provisions of the act of February 18, 1870,' P. L. 160, which act provides that the salary of said officer shall be $500 per annum, and that he shall be the legal adviser of the board of commissioners of Lancaster county, and shall represent the said board in all proceedings in law or equity wherein the said county is a party or has any interest. Under this act the plaintiff was elected county solicitor in the fall of 1879 and served as such from January, 1880, until January, 1883. While so serving he entered into the contract with the commissioners of Lancaster county embodied in their resolution as quoted in his statement of claim. Acting under this contract, he proceeded to render the services it provided for, and continued therein after the expiration of his official term. In 1884 he obtained for the county a credit of $2,560 for over-payments of taxes into the state treasury, for which service he was paid by the county commissioners $640, being twenty-five per cent thereof. He still continued to prosecute the claim of the county for a further allowance of credit, and in June, 1887, a credit was allowed it for $20,823.50. All his services in connection with this claim were rendered under and in pursuance of his original contract with the commissioners.</p>

Now, we say to you that if these services had been rendered by Mr. Fulton while he was county solicitor, this position would have been true. The act of assembly provides that the county solicitor shall be elected. He is an officer elected by the people for the purpose of representing the county in any matter requiring legal advice or the services of counsel, and his compensation is fixed by the act of assembly. If, therefore, these services had been rendered while he was county solicitor, he would not have been entitled to recover beyond the amount fixed by the act of assembly, except for necessary expenses incurred by him; it would have been proper to have paid those.</p>

Now, it was within the power of the county to employ counsel for the purpose of endeavoring to recover the amount which the county thus claimed to be due it, at such reasonable sum as would be proper for the amount of labor and professional assistance rendered for the county. [If, after Mr. Fulton ceased to be county solicitor, and for years endeavored to collect the claim, and eventually succeeded, then it would be a ratification of the agreement which had been entered into while he was county solicitor, and he would be entitled to recover a reasonable compensation for the entire services which he thus rendered, commencing when the agreement was entered into in June, 1882.] 9 [Did the county thus ratify the agreement which they had made with Mr. Fulton, so far as his separate employment to collect these moneys was concerned?] 10 [There is testimony that on various occasions the county recognized him as an attorney specially emplojmd for the collection of these moneys.]11 In 1884, a year after Mr. Fulton had ceased to be the authorized attorney of the county under his election, and when another was occupying that position, [he collected from the state the sum of $2,560. Upon this being credited to the county, the county recognized Mr. Fulton as their attorney in this matter, and settled with him <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>on the basis of the agreement -which had been entered into,] 13 paying him twenty-five per cent of that amount, and at the same time they talked over the matter and the commissioners concluded that they were entitled not only to the sum thus paid by the state, but to the whole balance of their claim, and under this conversation Mr. Fulton went on in the service of the county. [Again, when the appeal was taken by the county commissioners from the action of the authorities at Harrisburg to the Dauphin county court, which as I understand was after he had ceased to be the authorized solicitor of the county generally, he was authorized by the commissioners to take that appeal, and by their action in this respect they again recognized him as counsel of the county specially employed for this purpose.] 13 In addition to that, there is testimony that when Mr. Fulton had occasion to go to Harrisburg upon this business, that on at least one occasion he was accompanied by the county commissioners. He testifies, as I understand, to that fact. In addition to that, when the accounting officer wrote to Mr. Fulton from Pottstown that he rejected the claim, and when. Mr. Fulton again had an interview with him at Harrisburg and the claim was again rejected by him, as I understand, Mr. Fulton, feeling that he was right and that the county was entitled to this credit, made a re-examination of the facts and got up another petition for a revision, which was signed by all the county commissioners; an affidavit was signed by the county treasurer; an affidavit was signed by the president of the board of commissioners, and armed with these papers he again went to Harrisburg, and then it was that he finally succeeded in convincing the authorities that the county of Lancaster was entitled to these moneys.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b72-5" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[278,1881,1168,352]]]'>This was in 1887, and you will see that as late as that year when the final battle for these moneys, if I may so term it, was to be fought, the county commissioners recognized Mr. Fulton as their attorney, by all of them signing the petition which he had prepared, embracing the facts in the case as they understood them, and by the president of the board of commissioners making the affidavit.</p>

[If, after his term expired, he rendered these services with their sanction and approval, it was a recognition of the employment which they had made in June, 1882, and would entitle the plaintiff to recover whatever his services would be reasonably worth.] 14</p>

[We say to you, that while the county had authority to employ Mr. Fulton, and that if they recognized this agreement after the confidential relation had ceased between him and the county, they would be bound by it so far as his employment was concerned]15 they would not be bound by the rate of compensation which was fixed, but the jury would have the right to say what amount should be paid to Mr: Fulton for those services and expenses. That may be twenty-five per cent, or it may be any other sum which the jury may find to be due him for these services. [There seems to be no room for any question that his services were thus recognized and repeatedly recognized, on until the final conclusion of the matter. Then what rate of compensation should he receive ? These services were professional in their character. Mr. Fulton was a member of the bar, and as such he was employed, and whatever those services are reasonably worth, considering the character in which he was employed or engaged, he would be entitled to recover.] 16</p>

The plaintiff claims that he should have one fourth of the amount recovered. This is the amount named in the agreement, but you will fix his compensation without reference to that. Several of the witnesses testified, after hearing Mr. Fulton’s statement of the services which he rendered, and basing their estimate upon that, that twenty-five per cent would be a reasonable compensation for his services and expenses. Others were called who had not heard Mr. Fulton testify, and what is termed a hypothetical question was put to them, embracing what the plaintiff said were the facts <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>in the case, and they were asked, assuming those to be the facts, what amount it would be proper to pay, and basing their answer upon the hypothetical question thus put, they said that twentj’-ffive per cent would be a fair compensation. In judging of the testimony of these witnesses, of course you will consider whether the hypothetical question embraced a fair and reasonable statement of the facts in the case. If the jury find that it did, then they will consider the testimony of these witnesses as bearing upon the amount of compensation.</p>

He says that it was through the efforts of Mr. Fulton that success was finally obtained by the county of Lancaster; that he had presented the claim; that it had been rejected on several occasions, and that the efforts made by him, the arguments made by him, and the facts produced by him finally satisfied the authorities that he was entitled to this money, and that credit was therefore due to Mr. Fulton for the final success which crowned the efforts of the county to obtain the repayment of this tax.</p>

Although the settlement is dated in April by some arrangement of the authorities in Harrisburg, yet the actual allowance was made, I think, June 18, 1887, or about that time.

Allowing for argument’s sake that the original contract was void, and that the plaintiff could not recover anything on it, or directly or indirectly receive anything beyond his salary while holding office, a ratification or renewal of the agreement, or a new contract, after his term expired, would not be illegal. The court below expressly directed the jury to disregard the contract. Leaving it entirely out of consideration, we find the plaintiff acting for the county after his official term had expired, with the knowledge and approval of the commissioners. On his securing a credit of §2,560, they accepted the fruits of his labor, owned him as their attorney, and agreed on a standard of compensation by paying him 25 per cent of the amount recovered. How could there be a- more distinct contract with him than these circumstances imply ? If it was not a renewal, revival, ratification or resurrection of the contract of 1882, then it was a new contract and bound the commissioners thereafter. If there was no contract, then the commissioners recognized his right to recover on a quantum meruit.

We are of opinion that they had none; that the act of the commissioners in undertaking to bind the county to pay the compensation provided for in the contract, was ultra' vires. Doubtless the very object of the act in creating the office of county solicitor, providing for his election and fixing his salary, etc., was to take the power out of the hands of the county commissioners and place it beyond their reach. But be that as it may, we think the contract was ultra vires and void, and that the first and second points for charge submitted by defendant below, should have been affirmed. Those points are as follows:</p>

    <p id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[194,1564,1170,756]]]'>In saying, as he correctly did, that if the services of plaintiff below “ had been rendered while he was county solicitor, then there could be no recovery,” the learned judge rightly assumed that the contract in question was unauthorized and illegal. All such contracts, whether intended to be so or not, are in effect evasive and subversive of law, contrary to public policy, and therefore void. They are no more capable of ratification than was the contract in Hunter v. Nolf, <a href="/pa/71/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="71 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1031274" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0282-01">71 Pa. 282</a>. Speaking of the illegal contract under consideration in that case, Mr. Justice Sharswood said: “ It is undisputed law that such a contract is illegal as against public policy, and cannot be enforced. Even if there had been an express contract on entirely different terms than those agreed upon before, it ought to be viewed with a considerable degree of suspicion as an attempt to evade a sound and salutary rule of public policy.”</p>

Barber, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%20456" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="97 Pa. 456">97 Pa. 456</a>. Barber, one of the plaintiffs below, was attorney for the county of Chester, but it did not appear whether he was serving under an annual salary fixed by act of assembly, or under a special agreement with the commissioners. The county commissioners, however, made a contract with him and two other attorneys to pay them fifty per centum of the amount they recovered from the state for taxes improvidently paid into the state treasury. Speaking for the court, the present Chief Justice said: “The commissioners had no power to bind the county by such a contract..... It was against public policy, and therefore null and void..... These commissioners were acting in a fiduciary character. They were but trustees of the money when received, for the use of the county. When, therefore, they contracted to give one half of it to the plaintiffs for their services they exceeded their power. They were giving what did not belong to them. As well might a trustee contract to give away one half of the trust estate as compensation to counsel for services in connection therewith. And, if he may give away one half, why not three fourths, or even a greater proportion ? Can it be doubted that a court of equity would strike down such a contract as improvident and "a legal fraud? .... Whether the plaintiff, Barber, can recover anything, will depend upon the terms of his previous engagement as solicitor to the commissioners.”</p>
    <p id="b82-8" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[258,1558,1171,705]]]'>If it had appeared in that case that Barber was acting under a salary, fixed by act of assembly (as was Mr. Fulton in this case), and that his defined duty was to act as the legal adviser of the commissioners and represent them in all proceedings at law or in equity wherein the county had any interest, it is not likely that any doubt as to his legal status would have been suggested. According to the reasoning of the opinion, the contract as to him would have been declared illegal, contrary to public policy, and absolutely void. We are, therefore, of opinion that the learned judge erred in holding that plaintiff below might recover, if the commissioners recognized his services after the expiration of his term of office as county solicitor ; that such recognition would be a ratification of the original illegal agreement, etc.</p>

In his cross-examination he said, in substance, that all he did was in pursuance of the contract. “I commenced under this contract.” “1 never rejected the contract, as a matter of course.” “I continued in this service, beginning on this contract.” “ I went on under this contract,” and many similar expressions in his answers to questions put to him on cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b83-5" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[200,744,1166,760]]]'>There is no pretence that any new agreement was entered into, or the terms of the original in any manner changed after the expiration of his term of office. Neither the subject of a new contract nor the modification of the original ever appears to have been considered by the parties. The services of plaintiff below were no doubt efficient and valuable ; but, so far as they were rendered during his term of office, his salary is all the compensation he can claim. As to services rendered after the expiration of his term of office, under and in pursuance of the original illegal and void contract, he cannot, under the pleadings and evidence in this case, recover. The ninth to nineteenth assignments of error, inclusive, are sustained. The first to eighth assignments are immaterial; but, aside from that, they are not according to rule, and therefore not entitled to any consideration.</p>
