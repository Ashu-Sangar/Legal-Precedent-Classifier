Lucas presented his petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions for the appointment of viewers to assess damages for injuries done to his property at the corner of Chestnut and Juniper streets, by the widening of Chestnut street. A master and a jury of six viewers were appointed under § 7, act of May 6, 1887, P. L. 87. On July 17, 1888, the jury filed their report awarding the petitioner the sum of $4,000.</p>

Subsequent to this appeal, on September 1, 1888, the city filed exceptions in the Court of Quarter Sessions to the report of the jury awarding damages to the petitioner, and on November 27, 1888, that court sustained the exceptions and set aside the report.</p>

Lucas, owner of lot at southwest <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>corner of Chestnut and Juniper streets, in the city of Philadelphia, viewers were appointed by the Court of Quarter Sessions to assess the damages he had sustained by the widening of Chestnut street at that point. In July, 1888, the report of the viewers, awarding him $4,000 damages, was duly filed in said court; and, on August 15th next ensuing, the city appealed from the award and demanded “that the lawful damages caused by the taking, injury or destruction of the property of John C. Lucas, for the widening of the said street between the points named, and the just and lawful compensation to be paid therefor, shall be determined by a jury according to the course of the common law, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of this commonwealth and the acts of assembly in such case made and provided.” Afterwards, on September 1, 1888, while that appeal was pending and undetermined in the Court of Common Pleas No. 3, exceptions to the report of viewers were filed on behalf of the city in the Court of Quarter Sessions, complaining that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive and contrary to the evidence, and that the petitioner was not entitled to any damages, etc. Without assigning any reason therefor, that court made an order sustaining the exceptions and setting aside the report, and afterwards refused to revoke said order. Whereupon this writ of certiorari was taken, and the action of the court in assuming jurisdiction and sustaining the exceptions, etc., has been assigned as error.</p>

In this case, the appeal was taken in due form by the city within the time named in the act. The effect of the appeal to the Court of Common Pleas was to vest in that court exclu<a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>slve jurisdiction of the question of damages: Pusey’s App., <a href="/pa/83/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="83 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1050807" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0067-01">83 Pa. 67</a>; Williams v.

It will be observed that when the appeal was taken from the Court of Quarter Sessions on August 15, 1888, and for more than two weeks thereafter, no exceptions had been filed in that court. The court was clearly wrong in assuming jurisdiction and sustaining the exceptions, while the case was pending on appeal in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
