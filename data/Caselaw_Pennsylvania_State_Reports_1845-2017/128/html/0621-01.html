The circumstances from which the master sought to deduce the power by necessary implication do not sustain it.

The charter does not indicate the position of the termini relative to the old road, nor is the master’s report explicit as to this point, but it appears in the evidence that the starting place is on the old road, “at the terminus of the Bridgeport &amp; Horseshoe Turnpike in East Lampeter township,” and the ending point is also on or near it, “ and end at the township line between East Lampeter and Leacock townships, near the village of Bird-in-Hand.” Assuming even that both termini are on the old road, the right to follow the course of that road between the two, would not be necessarily implied. As already said, the right of the new corporation to acquire an express authority under the act of 1874 is doubtful, and the right to create a necessity by its own act in fixing its termini, is equally so. But passing that, as the case does not call for its decision, it is entirely clear that the course of the old road is not the only and not even the most direct route between the given points. The master reports only that the line adopted for the pike, which is the bed of the old Philadelphia road, “ <em>is very nearly direct </em>between the termini; ” and it appears in the evidence that a straight road between the termini would not have occupied the old highway, though it would not have deviated far from it at any point. The intervening country offered no physical obstacles to a_new route, either perfectly straight or deflected to either side, for it was the fertile plain of the Lancaster valley. Notwithstanding the finding of the master, therefore, that “ draft No. 2, and the evidence, show it to be the only feasible, reasonable, and practicable route between the termini,” it is entirely clear from the evidence that this conclusion does not rest on any physical difficulties in the way of another route, but on what is the perfectly manifest animus of the appellee’s whole case, the saving of the expense of buying a new route through private property. This indeed is not disguised. There is scarcely a suggestion of any other ground on which the right claimed can be supported. How entirely insufficient this ground is, has been declared in Pittsburgh Junction R. Co.’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%20531" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="122 Pa. 531">122 Pa. 531</a>, in terms so forcible and <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>so pertinent to the present case that I could not hope to improve upon them: “ The location claimed for defendant,” says the present Chief Justice, “ is a matter of economy, not of necessity. It can construct its road and reach its terminus by another route. It is true it would be expensive, but it is a mere question of money and engineering skill. It is not entitled to run through plaintiff’s yard and cripple its facilities for handling its business, merely to save money. Upon this point, the language of our brother Gordon in Penna. R. Co.’s Appeal is so clear and forcible that I may well repeat it here : ‘ It is true that a franchise is property, and as such may be taken by a corporation having the right of eminent domain, but in favor of such right there can be no implication, unless it arises from a necessity so absolute that without it the grant itself would be defeated. It must also be a necessity that arises from the very nature of things, over which the corporation has no control; it must not be a necessity created by the company itself for its own convenience, or for the sake of economy.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[189,1309,1172,966]]]'>This is decisive of the present case. There is no real ground set up, except of economy. The master indeed finds that the old road, during part of the year, is in bad condition for travel; that the turnpike is really a continuation of the same use in a better form, and that the change will not work irreparable injury which should be enjoined. But these considerations are mere make-weights and of no validity. If the road is in bad condition there is an adequate remedy to compel its repair, but as it has been in use for a century and a half, there is a strong presumption that it is not altogether unsuited to the public requirements. But, however bad it might be, its 'condition would be no justification for taking it away from its owners, and the proposal to substitute a better article at a moderate price would not help the right claimed. It is the necessity for the new use, not the inadequacy of the old, that is the test of such a change.
