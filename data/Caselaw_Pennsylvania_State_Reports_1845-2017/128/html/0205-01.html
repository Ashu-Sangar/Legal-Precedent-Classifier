As the said building was then and is now subject to a possible lien for wort and materials done and furnished towards the erection and construction of the same, the saving fund society declined to pay said money borrowed to any one except the said Peter Boyd, who was to hold the same, and distribute amongst the different parties entitled to it upon receiving releases of liens. The defendant, Thomas Gamón, was the general contractor for the erection of the church building, and claimed that there was a sum due him of $1,981.69, which, prior to May 19, 1888, was reduced to the sum of $1,781.59. The trustees of the Scots’ Presbyterian Church claimed a set-off of about $400 on account of the unfinished and defective condition of the church building. Pending the settlement of this question and others, the said Thomas Gamón executed a release of lien, which was delivered to the said Philadelphia Saving Fund Society by the said Thomas Gamón, on condition that a sum not less than $2,000 should be held by the said Peter Boyd, the said garnishee, out of which the claim of the said Thomas Gamón should be paid when ordered so to be by the said trustees of the Scots’ Presbyterian Church, or by the judgment of a court of record. To this condition the trustees of the Scots’ Presbyterian Church assented, and on May 19th, there was money sufficient in the hands of the said garnishee, under the above arrangement, to pay to the said Thomas Gamón the sum of $1,781.59, or any smaller amount, when ordered to be paid by the trustees of the Scots’ Presbj'terian Church.

The board of education would not pay the $39,436.55 unless certain conditions were complied with, and on or about May 18, 1888, the creditors, including the said plaintiff, agreed with said defendant and with said board to accept 83 per cent of their claims, and all the creditors but plaintiff voluntarily agreed with said defendant and with each other to release said defendant from any further claim, in consideration, among other things, of the payment of the defendant’s notes not yet matured.

In consideration of receiving this claim, the parties for whose use it was transferred permitted the other creditors to be paid their full percentage in cash out of the money on hand. The words “ assign and set over ” are used in the paper, but there was no possible way other than by an assignment to transfer the title to the claim from Gamón. There was no evidence that he was insolvent, the arrangement being simply one by which the sub-contractors were to share the loss on the contracts, and the act of March 24, 1818, 7 Sm. L. 132, relating to assignments for the benefit of creditors, applies only to assignments of property to trustees on account of inability at the time to pay debts, not to cases where the circumstances import a sale : Wallace v. Wainwright, <a href="/pa/87/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="87 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1057836" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0263-01">87 Pa. 263</a>. McAvoy, to whom this transfer was made, had a beneficial interest in the fund, in which respect the case differs from Wallace v. Wainwright.</p>
    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[265,1300,1174,1004]]]'>2. The paper was not similar to an assignment with a preference. All the cases holding an assignment to one person, in trust for others, to be an assignment for creditors, are cases in which by the transfer a preference was created, which, under the act of April 17, 1843, P. L. 273, made the assignment enure to the benefit of all creditors. But here the object of the paper was to secure equality. The plaintiff participated in the fund equally with the other parties. On the principle of equitable estoppel, if on no other, the plaintiff ought to be precluded from attacking an arrangement to which he was a party, and in the benefits of which he participated. As in York County Bank v. Carter, <a href="/pa/38/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="38 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="994099" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0446-01">38 Pa. 446</a>, McAvoy and the other creditors, who took this claim, purchased it by relinquishing their claim on the fund to that extent, and the equity in favor of the transferee is stronger here than in that case. Wallace v. Wainwright, <a href="/pa/87/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="87 Pa. 263" data-case-ids="1057836" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0263-01">87 Pa. 263</a>, which goes farther than any other case in holding a transfer in payment of certain creditors to be an assignment for benefit of creditors, was rested on the view that there was a preference. Kern v.

The act of 1818 has reference only to a certain peculiar class of instruments, well known in legal and commercial practice: Beans v.

It is a characteristic of them that they are substantially unilateral arrangements, in which the assignor alone declares the conditions of the grant, the grantees being mere volunteers in the acceptance of the assigned property, and not actual purchasers of it: Fallon’s App., supra. McAvoy was as much a purchaser in this case as the Duke of Bainsares was in Fallon’s App. The substance rather than the form must be regarded.</p>

It is made to appear in the answer that the plaintiff received a dividend of 83 instead of 81 per cent, through an inadvertence which is corrected however, by the statement immediately following, that his judgment is for the unpaid 19 per cent of his claim. The single question is whether the assignment by Gamón of a part of his property to McAvoy for the benefit of his creditors, or such of them as McAvoy might designate, is an assignment in trust for creditors. To state it would seem to compel an affirmative answer, and hence the assignment is void for want of recording, under the act of 1818. The proposition that the transaction was a purchase by Mc-Avoy, is negatived by two facts: there was no consideration except the pre-existing debt due McAvoy, and the admitted intention was to give a selected class of creditors an interest in the fund 'through McAvoy as their trustee. But the circumstances, motives and intention of the assignor are of no importance, if the means employed are forbidden by law: Sutton v. Ashurst, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Phila.%20301" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Phila. 301">4 Phila. 301</a>; Murphy’s Assignment, 2 Pittsb. 271.</p>

This assignment, being in writing and free from ambiguity, and there being no allegation of fraud, accident or mistake, its language is to be construed by the court as matter of law. The case is the exact converse of York Co. Bank v. Carter, <a href="/pa/38/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="38 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="994099" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0446-01">38 Pa. 446</a>. There, the papers on their face imported a sale, not a trust for creditors; here, the assignment on its face imports a trust. And not only was there a trust for creditors, but there was also a trust resulting to the assignor, as the fund assigned was $1,781.59, while the debts to be pre<a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>ferred amounted to but $1,547. Wallace v.

Although the words, “ in trust for,” were there stricken out of the instrument before execution, and the words, “ in payment of,” substituted, from which it was argued that a trust was expressly disclaimed, this court held the instrument void for non-recording. In Driesbach v. Becker, <a href="/pa/34/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="34 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="417976" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0152-01">34 Pa. 152</a>, a case not unlike the present one, the proceeds of the property were held liable to attachment by creditors.</p>

The points that there was no evidence of Gamon’s insolvency and that no preference was created, were not raised in the court below and should not be considered here. But they have no bearing on the case, even if true in point of fact. The act of 1818 declares broadly that all assignments by debtors in trust for creditors shall be recorded or become void; it contains not one word relating to insolvent debtors or to preferences. In fact, however, the insolvency of Gamón was admitted in the court below, and the assignment shows on its face a preference of the most pernicious character, since the selection of the favored creditors is left to the assignee. There is no element of estoppel in the case. There is no averment anywhere that Gamón or any other person was deceived or misled by any word or act of the plaintiff.</p>

An agreement of all the creditors with Gamón and the board of education, was necessary to enable any creditor to receive any portion of this fund. In order to create a fund sufficient to pay the dividends agreed upon, it was at first proposed that Gamón should collect and pay to the board of education his claim against the Scots’ Presbyterian Church, and that the board of education should pay to the several creditors their <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>dividends in money. But as this plan involved delay, and a prompt settlement was desired, certain creditors consented to accept the claim as the equivalent of money and to apply it on their dividends in the proportion agreed upon between them. For their convenience it was transferred to one of their number to collect and pay to each accepting creditor his share of it. The board of education then paid to these creditors the balance of their dividends, and to the remaining creditors their full dividends, in money. All the creditors, except the plaintiff in this attachment, in pursuance of the arrangement under which the claim against the Scots’ Presbyterian Church was transferred and the money due from the board of education was paid, then canceled their demands against Gamón.</p>
    <p id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[165,1009,1170,1116]]]'>The agreement which governed the distribution was entire and all who shared in the distribution were parties to it. It was an agreement which blended in one fund the debts due Gamón from the board of education and the Scots’ Presbyterian Church, and distributed that fund as money. The creditor who has in his pocket the cash dividend which it gave him, cannot seize and appropriate to his own use the chose in action which other creditors accepted in lieu of currency. As he has his share of the fund, he cannot repudiate the agreement which created it and under which it was distributed. As between the parties to the settlement, the creditors who accepted the claim against the Scots’ Presbyterian Church have as valid a title to it, as the remaining creditors have to their cash dividends. If the plaintiff in this attachment received, as the answers allege, 83 per cent on account of his demand against Gamón, or as he contends 81 per cent of it, his relation to his fellow creditors is the same, because his dividend was such as the agreement gave him. An election by him to take 81 per cent and have a judgment against Gamón for the balance, rather than 83 per cent and satisfy his claim, did not enable him to seize and appropriate to the payment of that judgment the dividend of another creditor.</p>

The transaction disclosed by the answers was not an assignment for the benefit of creditors. It was a contract between them and their debtor by which their demands against him were satisfied. It created a fund, of which ninety-six per cent was money on <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>hand and the balance a chose in action. The creditors who accepted the latter allowed the rest of the creditors to receive their dividends in full from the cash portion of the fund. The contract of Gamón with his creditors divested all his interest in the fund transferred to them, and, with the exception of the claim of the plaintiff in this attachment, extinguished all their demands against him.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[255,701,1170,544]]]'>In the case of Wallace v. Wainwright, 87 .Pa. 263, “ Wallace &amp; Krebs had no beneficial interest whatever in the claims assigned to them. They were neither creditors nor purchasers; they had made no advances and they had no lien.” There was no element of contract between debtor and creditor in it. In the present case McAvoy to whom the claim was transferred was a creditor and purchaser; he and the other accepting creditors made advances from their cash portion of the fund and they satisfied their demands against their debtor. Regard must be had to the substance rather than the form of the transaction.</p>
