The viewers reported in favor of a bridge on May 5,1884, and on September 1,1884, the report of the viewers was approved by the grand jury and the court, and the bridge reported became a Cbunty bridge, and it became the duty of the county commissioners of Bradford county to erect and complete the same on the site indicated by the report of the viewers. The county commissioners proceeded to erect a bridge at that point, from bank to bank of the river, but at the eastern terminus they constructed no approach, so that it is impossible for those desiring to use it to get on or off at that end. On January 13,1887, at the relation of the attorney general of the commonwealth, a writ of alternative mandamus was issued by the Court of Common Pleas ■of Bradford county to the county commissioners, directing them to complete the bridge or make known to the court why the same should not be done. To this the commissioners made answer and the application for a peremptory mandamus is to be disposed'of on the petition and answer.</p>

There is, however, no public highway connecting with the eastern terminus of the bridge. The viewers in selecting the most suitable place for the bridge, where it could be erected with the least expense, as permitted by § 37, act of •June 13, 1836, P. L. 560, located the bridge at a point some <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>distance below where the road crosses the river. They had the power, under this section, to report whether any change in the bed of the road to be connected with the bridge was necessary, and if they had done so, the confirmation of their report would have laid out a road to the bridge according to the plot and survey returned by them. They failed to exercise this power, and left the eastern terminus unconnected with any highway. The land at the eastern terminus is private property. It belongs to Mr. G. H. Welles. The county commissioners have no power to appropriate it for public purposes. They cannot lay out a road to the bridge.</p>

The consent of Mr. Welles to the building of an approach, would relieve the commissioners of the charge of being trespassers, but his consent is qualified. They may erect piers across his flats, but are not to interfere with the natural flow of the water. The commissioners may determine to construct the approach in some other way.

Even if it were respondents’ duty to construct approaches to this bridge, we contend that the fact that there is no highway leading up to its eastern end upon which an approach could be constructed by them without becoming trespassers, is a sufficient reason for the non-performance of this duty. The road commissioners of Wyalusing township, under the provisions of the special act of April 13, 1843, P. L. 218, have the exclusive power to lay out and open such a road, and until they do so the respondents cannot be charged with neglect of duty. And the township, when such road is laid out, can also construct an approach, if the respondents are then in default, and charge the county with the cost. A mandamus will not lie to compel the performance of an unlawful act, and, to warrant the writ against a public officer, the relator must show a clear right: High on Extra. Rem., § 32; Commonwealth v. Pittsburgh, <a href="/pa/34/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="34 Pa. 496" data-case-ids="418009" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0496-01">34 Pa. 496</a>; Easton v.

The viewers of this bridge, as their report clearly shows, located the terminus of the bridge at the river bank, and contemplated that a road should be laid out to it. There cannot be any such thing as a temporary terminus. The agreement of Welles does not remove the difficulty here. The township road is too far away to be reached by a mandamus.</p>

The bridge built by the commissioners is complete and has been approved by the bridge viewers. The approaches at the end have not been built, but tbe reason given for not building them, in the return of the commissioners, seems to be quite sufficient. There is no road opened at the eastern end with which to connect, or upon which to erect proper approaches. The commissioners have no power to build such a road, nor has the court the right to order it opened except in proper proceedings, which have never been commenced.</p>
    <p id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.7",202,[257,1467,1182,868]]]'>The obligation of the county to build proper approaches, is clearly established in the case of Penn Tp. v. Perry Co., <a href="/pa/78/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="78 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1040419" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0457-01">78 Pa. 457</a>, but neither that nor any other case decides that the county must also open and construct roads over adjacent private property with which to connect the approaches. It would be a highly strained construction of the duty to build approaches, to extend it to the laying out, opening and construction of public roads. It is enough to say that the law does not clothe county commissioners with such power. A stretch of eight hundred and fifty feet over the private property of a citizen, cannot be regarded in any point of view as a mere approach to a bridge. When it is to be used as a means of public passage, it must be appropriated to that end as a road or highway; and when this has been done in a lawful manner, there will be no difficulty in securing the construction of proper approaches by proceedings against the county commissioners, if they shall fail to voluntarily perform their duty in that respect.</p>
