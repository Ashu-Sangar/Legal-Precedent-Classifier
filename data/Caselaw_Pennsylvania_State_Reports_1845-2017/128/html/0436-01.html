The plaintiff is- Mr. Stoddard, and if there is a recovery at all, it is upon his rights ; and unless you have the authority to show to the contrary, we shall hold that you must show that it was an unreasonable delay on the part of the defendant, not to put down the second well before the 7th of January, 1878. It seems to me that Mr. Stoddard can recover for the damages that he sustained, and probably Mr. Janes; that can be determined hereafter. But the recovery is the recovery of Mr. Stoddard. I cannot see how damages that accrued to Mr. Stoddard under this lease, up to the time he parted with his title, and damages that may have accrued to Mr. Janes afterwards, as one cause of action, can be brought together in one case. The recovery in law is Mr. Stoddard’s. If it belongs to Mr. Janes, of course it goes to his use. Now, the question is how Mr. Stoddard can recover after he parted with his title and ceased to have an interest in this.

It is perfectly well settled that when a parol agreement changing or adding to a previously executed sealed contract is subsequently made, the whole becomes parol, and the remedy is assumpsit, and not covenant.

The parties provided by the express terms of their contract how many wells should be put down, and that provision of the contract determines the question. When the number is expressed, there is no room for any implication that there should be some other number. Had there been nothing said in the contract on the subject, there would of course have arisen an implication that the property should be developed reasonably, and evidence of a custom of reasonable development by boring a given number of wells in a certain space of time, would have been competent and perhaps controlling. But that doctrine has no application in a case where the parties have expressly agreed in the contract how many wells shall be bored.</p>

If there were any breaches after the purchase of Janes, there would be no right of action in Stoddard, and there could be no recovery in an action brought in his name. The second proposition discussed by counsel for plaintiff in error is of no relevancy, because the only kind of breaches for which recovery is there claimed is breaches of implied covenants occurring before the sale. But we have already held there were no such implied covenants, and hence there could be no recovery for an alleged breach of them.</p>
