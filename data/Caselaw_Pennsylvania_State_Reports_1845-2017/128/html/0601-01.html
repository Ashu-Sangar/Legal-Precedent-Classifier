Kendig, as plaintiff, and the city of Lancaster and the county of Lancaster, as defendants, to ascertain the amount of damages sustained by the plaintiff, by reason of the opening of First street in the city of Lancaster. Judgment by consent was entered on August 81, 1886, in favor of the plaintiff against the city for $400, and against the county for $900.</p>

On September 5, 1888, the commissioners filed an answer in which they made substantially the same averments as in their answer filed to the petition of Jacob L. Frey; see Lancaster Co. v. Frey, ante, p. 593. After argument, the court, Patterson, J., made <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>the rule absolute and entered an order directing that the county of Lancaster pay to Kendig the amount of his judgment against the county.- The respondents thereupon took this writ assigning said order as error. The cause was argued with Lancaster Co. y. Frey, ante, p. 593.</p>
