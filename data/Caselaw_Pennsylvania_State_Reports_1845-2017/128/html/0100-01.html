The defendants undertake to justify themselves in doing this, by reason of what is called a landlord’s warrant. They claim that the plaintiff, William H. Davis, was indebted to Maria Davis for a considerable sum of money which, as they allege, was due to her from an interest under the intestate laws in the farm upon which William resided and which he claimed to own, and that they had a right to proceed by distress to collect this money.</p>

Davis, found upon his premises, for the payment of this sum which is due to Maria Davis. But, when they undertake to apply proceedings of this kind, it is their duty to comply with the requirements of the act of assembly regulating such proceedings; and it is claimed, on the part of the plaintiff, that they have failed to do this. It was their duty when they distrained the property, when they levied upon it, to give William H. Davis notice by a schedule of the articles which they distrained; William H. Davis then had five days from the time at which notice was given, in which to replevy this property. After the expiration of the five days, it is the duty of the constable, or of the officer distraining the property, to cause an appraisement of the property to be made; and if the officer executing this process fails to require that appraisement to be made at all, or makes it within the five days, he becomes a trespasser; has no right afterwards to sell the property; cannot justify under the proceedings.</p>

The act of assembly requires that it shall be made after the expiration of five days from the time of the levy; as the last of the five days fell on Sunday, notice of the levy having been given upon Tuesday, the five days would not be completed until after Monday following, and it was not a compliance with the law to make the appraisement on that day, the following Monday; it was one day too soon; and the defendants might as well have made the appraisement before they made the levy, or not to have made any appraisement at all, as to make it in a way or at a time not provided for in the act of assembly; and, therefore, we say to you that, in consequence of this, the proceedings were irregular and void; that the defendants cannot justify their conduct by these proceedings, and are trespassers; trespassers ab initio, or from the beginning. The plaintiff is therefore entitled to recover, and he is entitled to recover against the persons who seized and took away his property. Maria Davis signed the warrant of distress which was putin the hands of the constable. The constable executed the warrant. Some evidence has been given to the effect that Joshua Davis was there; whether he was there, aiding, abetting and assisting, so as to1 become responsible in damages for the injuries inflicted upon the plaintiff, is a question of fact for you.] 1</p>

It is the landlord that it is ordered and directed bj^ the act of 1772, an existing law, to do an act within a prescribed period of time, viz.: to appraise the goods of the tenant after the expiration of the five days next after the taking of the distress. There is no order or direction to the tenant to do any act; but the landlord must appraise, if he would lawfully collect his rent out of the goods distrained; he has no other alternative, an appraisement is a condition precedent to his right to sell the goods.</p>

But granting it to be true that Sunday is to be excluded in reckoning the five days within which William H. Davis had the right to replevy, both he and Maria Davis could have exercised their respective rights of replevying and appraising on Monday, July 28th.

It belongs to that class of remedies for a wrong suffered, which the injured party may administer by his own act: 3 Bl. Com., 10. But, a common law distress was levied in order to constrain or compel the payment of rent in arrears, and the dis<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>trainor could make no other use of the goods seized than to hold them. They could be kept impounded for an indefinite time, but they could not be sold, used, or appropriated in any manner to the payment of the rent due: Morris on Replevin, 29; Woods (5n Landlord &amp; Tenant, § 543. The right to sell the goods seized and to apply the proceeds to the payment of the rent, was first given in England by the statute of 2 W. &amp; M. c. 5, § 2, which provided that after holding the goods for five clear days exclusive of the day of seizure, to afford the tenant opportunity to pay the rent or replevy his goods, the landlord might sell the goods for the best price that could be got for them, and apply the proceeds to the payment of the rent. In this state, the right to sell was conferred by the act of March 21, 1772, on the following terms: “If the tenant or owner of the goods distrained shall not within five days next after such distress taken and notice thereof.....replevy the same, with sufficient security to be given to the sheriff according to law, then and in such case, after such distress and notice aforesaid and expiration of the said five days, the person distraining shall and may.....cause the goods and chattels so distrained to be appraised by two reputable freeholders, .....and after such appraisement, shall and may after six days public notice, lawfully sell the goods and chattels so dis-trained,” etc.</p>

The courts have no power to dispense with any one of these, for such power would be legislative and not judicial. For this reason it was held in England, under the statute of William &amp; Mary cited above, that a failure to comply with the statutory formalities, in any particular, rendered the landlord and his bailiff trespassers ab initio and liable to the owner of the goods seized for their full value, regardless of the rent due. The inconvenience and injustice resulting to landlords from the application of this plain legal principle was relieved against by the statute of 2 Geo. II. § 19, c. 19. It stated the mischief to be remedied as follows: “And whereas it hath sometimes happened that upon a distress made for rent justly due, the directions of the statute made in the second year of the reign of King William and <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>Queen Mary, entitled, etc., have not been strictly pursued, but through the mistake or inadvertence of the landlord or other person entitled to rent and distraining for the same, or of the bailiff or agent of such landlord or other person, some irregularity or tortious act hath been afterwards done in the disposition of the distress so seized and taken as aforesaid, for which irregularity or tortious act the party distraining hath been deemed a trespasser ab initio,” etc.; and it provided by way of remedy therefor that the landlord, his bailiff or agent, should not become a trespasser ab initio by reason of any irregularity or tortious act in the disposition of a distress seized, but that for any injury sustained by the tenant or owner of the goods, by reason of such irregularity or tortious act, such tenant or owner should recover the actual damage sustained and no more. This statute had been in operation in England for fifty years before our act of 1772 was passed, but its principle was not adopted. The act of 1772 was framed upon the statute 2 W. <em>&amp; </em>M., and the landlord was left under the necessity of strict compliance with its provisions, or of being held a trespasser ab initio and liable as such for the full value of the goods seized and sold. A failure, therefore, to make an appraisement of the goods, or the making of it before the lapse of five full days after the seizure, is a failure to follow the statutory requirement on which the right to sell is given, and a sale made under such circumstances, not being under the protection of the act, is unauthorized and void: Briggs v. Large, <a href="/pa/30/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="30 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="415621" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0287-01">30 Pa. 287</a>; Kerr v.

This being excluded from the count, the fifth juridical day was Monday, and the appraisement could not be properly made until Tuesday. The act gave no authority to make it until after full five days had elapsed after the seizure. It gave no authority to sell until after an appraisement made in accordance with its directions. As the appraisement was made on the fifth day instead of after, it was made one day too soon. So far as its legal effect is concerned, it might as well have been made on the day of the seizure, or not made at all. The sale of the goods was not made under the authority of the act of 1772, because its directions were not <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>followed, and, no other authority having been shown, the conclusion is inevitable that the sale was unauthorized and that the plaintiff below was properly allowed to recover.</p>
    <p id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[257,488,1166,602]]]'>This is a great hardship. There is no suggestion of any actual injury resulting from the appraisement on Monday instead of Tuesday: None could have resulted so far as we are able to see, but that is not for us to determine. The act requires that the appraisement shall be made after five dajrs, and authorizes a sale only after “such appraisement.” Relief from the consequences of an irregularity in the proceedings must come here, as it came in England, by means of a legislative provision. Until it does come, we have the unpleasant duty of enforcing a rule, which; though sound in law, is harsh in its application to cases like that under consideration, and in this works positive injustice.</p>
