You have heard it all from the stand, and you have heard it more fully and ably commented on by the learned counsel than is usual in courts of justice, and from it must form your own judgment. If the evidence has satisfied you that the prisoner has proved his alibi, that he, John W. Rudy, was at some other place, or at other places at and during the whole period of time when this murder was committed, and was not there at the place when it was committed, then your verdict should be not guilty; for, as we have said, a man cannot be in two different and distinct places at the same time. But, if the evidence presented in this case on this question of alibi does not prove an alibi, you will then from a full, fair, careful examination of all the testimony presented in the cause, say whether or not the prisoner killed the deceased, whether he committed the murder or not, and if he did, do all the circumstances presented and proved enable you to say beyond a reasonable doubt that such murder was committed by him, wilfully, deliberately and premeditatedly, with intent to kill?

The burden of proving it was clearly on the prisoner. If he failed <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>to do so to the satisfaction of the jury, the alleged alibi, as a substantive defence, was valueless; but that did not deprive him of the benefit of his evidence on that subject, so far as it, in connection with other testimony in the case, may have had a tendency to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Immediately after instructing the jury that an alibi “ is valueless as a complete defence,” unless it is proved “ to the satisfaction of the jury,” the learned judge said: “But, an alibi is as much a traverse of the crime charged, however, as any other defence, and proof tending to establish it, though not clear, may, with other facts of the case, raise a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, and therefore it must not be excluded from the cause and the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.4",528,[259,1004,1168,706]]]'>In Meyers v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=83%20Pa.%20141" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="83 Pa. 141">83 Pa. 141</a>, cited by the prisoner’s counsel, the court below had instructed the jury that they must “ be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,” etc. This court, commenting on that part of the charge, said: “ This statement is too stringent, and throws the prisoner upon a degree of proof beyond the legal measure of his defence. That measure is' simply proof which is satisfactory—such as flows fairly from a preponderance of the evidence. It need not be beyond doubt.....Where the evidence raises a balancing question, and the mind is brought to determine its preponderance, there may be a doubt still existing in the mind, yet the actual weight may be with the prisoner, and this proof should be considered satisfactory.” Other authorities to the same effect might be cited, but it is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[258,1717,1166,450]]]'>All the evidence, including that bearing on the question of alibi, was fully and carefully submitted to the jury, with special instructions that if, from all the evidence in the case, they had a reasonable doubt of the prisoner’s guilt, their verdict should be not guilty. If there was any error in the trial of the cause it was in the finding of the jury that the prisoner was the guilty agent. The court below, who heard the testimony and saw the witnesses, was satisfied with the finding of the jury. There is nothing on the record to justify us in setting aside the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b528-8" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[302,2172,908,45]]]'>Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
