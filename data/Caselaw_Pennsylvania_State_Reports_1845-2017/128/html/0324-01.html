    <p class="summary" id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[201,840,1173,1311]]]'>It will be well to give a moment’s consideration to the purpose of this provision regulating the mode of amending statutes. In a leading case upon the subject Judge Cooley says : “ The mischief designed to be remedied was the enactment of amendatory statutes in terms so blind that legislators themselves were sometimes deceived in regard to their effect, and the public, from the difficulty in making the necessary comparison, failed to become apprised of the changes made in the laws. An amendatory act which purported only to insert certain words, or to substitute one phrase for another in an act or section, which was only referred to but not published, was well calculated to mislead the careless as to its effect, was perhaps, sometimes drawn in that form for the express purpose. Endless confusion was thus introduced into the law, and the constitution wisely prohibited such legislation: ” People v. Mahoney, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Mich.%20497" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Mich. 497">13 Mich. 497</a>. The same eminent jurist, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, says: “ If this is a correct view of the purpose of the provision, it does not seem to be at all important to its accomplishment that the old law should be republished, if the law as amended is given in full with such reference to the old law as will show for what the new is substituted: ” p. 151. Again he says: “ The provision is fully complied with in letter and spirit, if the act or section revised or amended is set forth and published as revived or amended, and anything more than this only tends to render the statute unnecessarily cumbrous.”</p>

The legislature well understood the purpose of the constitutional provision, and manifestly intended to conform to its plain requirements.

The only question raised was, whether it repealed the fifth section of the act of 1874, as to Luzerne county. We held that it did, and the correctness of the conclusion, as the case was presented, is conceded. It <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>is now claimed that the act is unconstitutional for two reasons: (1) because it is special legislation; (2) because the title does not clearly express an intention to repeal the former act as to separate Orphans’ Courts in counties containing less than 150,000 inhabitants. It has been requested, and is important, that a speedy decision of these questions be given. Therefore, we shall not undertake to follow the able argument of the relator’s counsel, but briefly state our conclusions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[210,757,1176,458]]]'>1. Article XII., § 1 of the constitution, provides that: “ All officers whose selection is not provided for in this constitution, shall be elected or appointed as may be directed by law.” As the constitution provides how assistant clerks of the Orphans’ Court shall be appointed, legislation upon that subject was unnecessary : Article V., § 22. As we suggested in oür former opinion, the relator’s title to the office is derived from the constitution, and is not dependent on the act of 1874, or affected by the act of 1887.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[208,1223,1178,659]]]'>2. We do not think the act of 1887 is unconstitutional, because special or local in its operation. The legislature had power to repeal the fifth section of the act of 1874, and, having repealed it, to enact a law relating to the salaries of assistant clerks in counties containing over 150,000 inhabitants only. The enactment of such a law would be but a reasonable exercise of the legislative power, necessary to carry out the provisions of the constitution relating to the salaries of county officers, and the payment of the same and of the salaries of their clerks, out of the fees earned in such counties: Article XIV., § 5. Such a law cannot be declared special or local, simply because it reiterates the general and self-executing provision of the constitution relating to the power and mode of appointment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[210,1891,1176,508]],["BL_350.1",350,[255,344,1177,1055]]]'>3. “ No bill, except general appropriation bills, shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title: ” Article III., § 1. The title of the act of 1887 reads as follows: “ An act to amend the fifth section of [an act relating to the organization and jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court, and to establish a separate Orphans’ Court in and for counties having more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, and to provide for the selection of judges thereof], approved May 19,1874,’’etc. The part within brackets is a transcript of the title of the act of 1874, and simply in<a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>cates the act to be amended, and not the subject matter of the amendment. If it had ended here, the title would certainly have not been misleading, and, perhaps, by the same literal construction adopted in State Line etc. R. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/77/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="77 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="436268" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0429-01">77 Pa. 429</a>, would have been sufficiently full. But it proceeds to indicate the section to be amended as follows : “ as to appointment of assistant clerks of the said court and fixing the salaries of the same.” Of what court ? Clearly of the Orphans’ Court. Whether an Orphans’ Court is a separate court of record or not, its title is the same,—“the Orphans’ Court.” Strictly, the word “separate” is not a part of the'title by which the court is designated, and in no sense can the words “ in counties having more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants ” be so construed. The words, “ the said court,” are to be read as a part of the title of the officers whose appointment and salaries are to be regulated, which written out in full would be “ assistant clerks of the Orphans’ Court.” The reference back, then, is to no particular Orphans’ Court nor to the Orphans’ Court of any particular class of counties, but to Orphans’ Courts in general, and comprehends all such courts having assistant clerks.</p>

We do not say that the title, upon a careless reading, might not be construed otherwise, but we think the interpretation rve have given the more natural one, and the constitutional provision under consideration was not intended to entirely obviate the necessity for vigilance. It was proposed in the convention of 1838, and rejected because it was feared it would render legislation too difficult and uncertain and lead to-litigation. “It will not do therefore, to impale the legislation of the state upon the sharp points of criticism, but we must give each title, as it comes before us, a reasonable interpretation, ut res magis valeat quam pereat. If the title fairly gives notice of the subject of the act, so as reasonably to lead to an inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary. It need not be an index to the contents, as has often been said: ’ ’ Allegheny County Home’s Case, <a href="/pa/77/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="77 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="436309" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0077-01">77 Pa. 77</a>.

Both these acts must he taken together as enforcing and interpreting each other, in accordance with the rule laid down in Endlich on Statutes, § 40, in order to render the later one valid and effective. The act of 1874 was in strict conformity with the requirements of the constitution, but, standing by itself, that of 1887 will not bear the test which has been applied to the act of 1874, as both the title and body of it expressly restrict its operation to counties having 150,000 inhabitants. It does not profess to classify the counties of the state, but embraces within its scope only two of the counties of the commonwealth. A statute legislating for the separate Orphans’ Courts of counties having 150,000 inhabitants and increasing the salaries of assistant clerks therein, and discriminating by singling out the case of Luzerne county and abrogating all provision for the salary of the assistant clerk in that county, is special legislation in the legal acceptation of that term. An amendatory act having a local effect is as repugnant to the constitution as if it were an original act. The legislature might suspend the operation of the fifth section of the act of 1874 throughout the state, but such suspension cannot be made for Luzerne county alone: Morrison v.

The legislature had undoubted power to repeal § 5 of the act of 1874, so far as the officers’ salaries are concerned, and the section enacted in 1887 in lieu of it simply carries out the provisions of § 5, article XIV. of the constitution. These provisions read in connection with § 22, article V. of the same instrument, clearly make assistant clerks of the separate Orphans’ Courts officers under the organic law, and the act of 1887 is therefore not special or local, in a constitutional sense, because not relating to assistant clerks in counties not having separate Orphans’ Courts. If it did not embrace all such separate courts, now or hereafter to be established in counties having over 150,000 inhabitants, it might be special, but it embraces all these. Luzerne county’s population was <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>133,065 in 1880, and in legal contemplation was no greater when the relator was appointed to office: Luzerne Co. v.

It is simply the manner of the appointment and the amount of compensation of assistant clerks of the separate Orphans’ Courts in counties having a population in excess of 150,000. The title clearly gives notice of this and in nowise tends to avert inquiry into the contents of the act: Allegheny Co.

The act of 1887 repealed the fifth section of the act of 1874, at least so far as relates to the salary of the assistant clerk in Luzerne county. Both the original section and the section as amended are published at length. Whatever of the former is omitted from the latter is therefore repealed. This doctrine has been fortified by the court below with a number of authorities. Both Bishop and Endlich state and accept it as law: Bishop’s Written Law, 152; Endlich on Statutes, § 196. This method of amending laws has been pursued almost uniformly ever since the adoption of the present constitution, and the legislative practice is entitled to respect and weight as showing the construction placed by at least two co-ordinate departments of the government upon § 6, article III. of the constitution.</p>

A statute amendatory of another, declaring that the former shall read in a particular way, must, in general, be held to repeal all provisions not retained in the altered form. All matters not incorporated into the amendment, the latter must be held to have repealed. The authorities referred to in the opinion of the court are full upon this point, and many more might be cited in support of this general rule of construction. But <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>assuming this, and that the amendatory section of the act of 1887 is actually merged in the original statute of 1874, a question arises, we think, upon the power of the legislature to repeal the provisions as to the salary of the assistant clerk of any separate Orphans’ Court, duly established, without making any other provisions in that behalf.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[228,634,1174,959]]]'>The 22d section of the 5th article of the constitution provides that “in every county wherein the population shall exceed one hundred and fifty thousand, the general assembly shall, and in any other county may, establish a separate Orphans’ Court, to consist of one or more judges, who shall be learned in the law; which court shall exercise all the jurisdiction and powers vested in, or which may hereafter be conferred upon the Orphans’ Courts; and thereupon the jurisdiction of the judges of the Courts of Common Pleas within such county, in Orphans’ Court proceedings, shall cease and determine.” It further provides that “in any county in which a separate Orphans’ Court shall be established, the register of wills shall be clerk of such court, and subject to its directions in all matters pertaining to his office,” and that “he may appoint assistant clerks, but only with the consent and approval of said court.” By the 31st section of the Schedule, it was made the duty of the general assembly, at its first session, or as soon as may be after the adoption of the constitution, to pass such laws as might be necessary to carry the same into full force and effect.</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[225,1602,1169,758]],["BL_355.1",355,[204,321,1165,656]]]'>At the time of the adoption of the constitution, the only counties of the commonwealth containing a population exceeding 150,000 were the counties of Philadelphia, Allegheny, and Luzerne; and in obedience to this mandate of the constitution, provision was made by the act of May 19,1874, for the establishment of separate Orphans’ Courts in each of the three counties named; the salaries of the clerk and of the assistant clerk were adjusted, and separate Orphans’ Courts were thereupon duly organized under the constitution and laws of the commonwealth in the said several counties. The legislature in the passage of this act of May 19, 1874, simply complied with a command of the constitution, and thereby caused this provision of the constitution to come into effect. That act withdrew from the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of these respective counties the right to exercise the power of an Orphans’ Court, and <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>vested these powers in. an independent and exclusive jurisdiction. We think it would not have been competent for the legislature, by a repeal of this act, to defeat and set aside the constitutional tribunals thus established; for these courts, although put into actual operation by the legislature, were created by and now exist under the authority of the constitution itself. Having done what the constitution required, it would not have been in the power of the legislature wholly to undo it. The constitution itself set up this system of separate Orphans’ Courts, and it is for the legislature to regulate and maintain, not to destroy it. The constitution is the paramount law; it is above legislatures and courts; wh.at is therein ordained and established cannot be set aside by a simple act of legislation.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[205,985,1165,757]]]'>James McGreevy, Esq., the clerk of the Orphans’ Court of Luzerne county, had an undoubted right, by and with the consent and approval of that court, to appoint Henry A. Reid the assistant clerk. This right was vested in him by the very terms of the constitution, and upon receiving the appointment and becoming duly qualified, Henry A. Reid was entitled to perform the duties of that office, and to receive the emoluments thereof. It will not be seriously contended that the legislature had any power to pass upon the necessity for the appointment, for this discretion is expressly committed to the clerk, who is to act with the consent and approval of the court. Nor will it be pretended that the assistant clerk might be removed from his office' by a simple act of legislation; there was no power competent to remove him, save the tribunal which conferred the appointment.</p>
    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[204,1751,1169,603]],["BL_356.1",356,[253,319,1165,188]]]'>If the legislature may repeal the act adjusting the salary, without making any further or other provision in that behalf, it may practically abolish the office. If the assistant clerk may thus be deprived of the office, the clerk of the court and the judge are both liable to the same fate, and in this way, that might be done by indirection which could not be done directly. It is true that the salary is a matter which, by the constitution, is submitted to the discretion of the legislature. In the exercise of that discretion, by the act of 1874 the salary was fixed at $1,500, and this rule of compensation will continue until, by some other statute, it is changed. The salary first fixed may perhaps be increased or diminished, subject to the <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>restriction of the 13th section of the 3d article of the constitution, as the legislature should from time to time see fit to provide, but to repeal .the provision for a salary altogether, is to remove the clerk from his office.</p>
    <p id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[250,524,1168,1107]]]'>It may be said, however, that after the organization of the separate Orphans’ Court of Luzerne county, the county of Lackawanna was taken from Luzerne, thereby reducing its population, according to the census of 1880, below 150,000, and that in consequence thereof, although within the power of the legislature, the constitution did not require the continuance of a separate Orphans’ Court in Luzerne county. It may be, that, in view of the reduction of the population, it would have been competent for the legislature to restore the jurisdiction to the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, in all matters pertaining to the Orphans’ Court. We will decide that question when it arises, but the legislature did not do so. The judges of the separate Orphans’ Courts, as constituted under the act of 1874, at the time of the passage of the act of 1887, were and still are the judges of the only court having jurisdiction of the estates of decedents and minors, in the county of Luzerne, and it would be clearly incompetent to repeal the act authorizing the payment of these salaries, or the salaries of the clerks of that court, without making any other provision for them, or to expel them from office, without cause, and without providing the means for the exercise of these powers by some other lawfully constituted tribunal.</p>
    <p id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.5",356,[247,1639,1167,705]]]'>The constitution creates the office of assistant clerk, and the legislature fixes the salary; but the latter cannot deprive him of his office by refusing him his salary. In Commonwealth v. Gamble, <a href="/pa/62/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="62 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="1017281" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0343-01">62 Pa. 343</a>, there was an effort to remove a judge from his office by doing away with his district; and, although the apportionment of the districts was clearly within the power and discretion of the legislature, yet it was held that as the judge held his office under the constitution the general assembly could not, by a mere legislative act, remove him from the exercise of the duties and" jurisdictions attaching to his office. So in this case, the adjustment of the salary is given to the legislature, yet as the clerk derived his office directly from the constitution, the legislature cannot expel him from it by repealing the act fixing the amount of his salary.</p>

      <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>We are of opinion that the act of April IB, 1887, P. L. 22, already referred to, is not in conflict with the constitution, because special or local in its operation. The constitution recognizes a class of counties, in each of which it is the duty of the legislature to establish a separate Orphans’ Court, and the act plainly applies to all the counties of this class. Nor do we regard the title as defective; it is entitled “ An act to amend the fifth section of an act relating to the organization and jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court, and to establish a separate Orphans’ Court in and for counties having more than one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, and to provide for the election of judges thereof, approved May 19, 1874, as to appointment of assistant clerks of the said court, and fixing the salaries of the same,” etc. Under all the cases, this is amply sufficient. We are clearly of opinion, however, that the act of 1874, so far as it relates to Luzerne county, is not repealed thereby.</p>
