But there is another question comes up: Was the conveyance from John Martin to Catharine C. Fairchild a conveyance of the whole of the land as it would appear to be from the face of the deed? Another element comes in, [an article of agreement or license, as it has been variously termed by the respective sides, dated April 1, 1854, from John Martin to William J. Martin, wherein John Martin grants in the following words to William J. Martin : “ Doth agree to grant to said William J. Martin the right and privilege of digging all the ore on his place and lands; for which said William J. Martin doth consent and agree to pay said John Martin two hundred dollars, to be paid as follows:.....” In this it is claimed there was only a license. A license is a privilege to go upon the land of another for some purpose sought for by the grantee, as a right of way over his land, or to throw water back upon it, or to construct a mill-race through it. It may be a bare license, not accompanied with any expenditure on the part of the grantee. In such case, it is at any time and at all times revocable. In the case in point, if the license had been granted, and before any expenditure upon the faith of the grant by William J. Martin, John Martin had revoked it, the privilege would have ceased. But in this case we do not consider that this alleged contract, as offered and received and read in evidence, creates any interest in the lands of John Martin, but establishes a license for the purpose and intent expressed therein; and that intent, from the plain language of the instrument, was that <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>William J. Martin should have, on payment of the consideration therein named, a grant of the right and privilege “ to dig all the ore on his place and lands.” There is no dispute about the lands in question, neither is there any dispute that those two parties were competent then to make this agreement, or license, or whatever other name it may be called, but revocable as such, if revoked before any consideration therefor was paid, or any necessary expenditure made by William J. Martin in pursuance of it; but the paper covers credits thereon paid by the grantee, and if the uncontradicted, the "undisputed testimony of William J. Martin on this point be believed, corroborative of the paper itself, then all the consideration therein named was paid, has been paid, and it ceases to be a mere revocable license and becomes a contract not revocable at the will of the grantor.] 1</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b510-5" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[265,1107,1173,1114]]]'>[Then, gentlemen, having reached that conclusion, William J. Martin had a right to mine and remove the iron ore from the lands of John Martin, the lands upon which this trespass is alleged to have been committed. On October 12, 1855, William J. Martin by articles of agreement agrees to convey to Franklin Baldwin and Charles Cheney “ all his right, title, interest and claim in and to all the ore and mining privileges belonging to that certain piece of ground situate in Dunbar township, Fayette county, Pennsylvania, and known by the name of the John-Parker, Sr., tract, containing four hundred and twelve acres. ” Under' this, it is admitted that the defendant is the owner of whatever rights William J. Martin had. It has been argued with considerable force that that was a personal matter and not transferable by William J. Martin. Be that as it may, for the purposes of this issue it is immaterial. It is an undisputed fact that William J. Martin, the person named in that license or agreement from John Martin to William J. Martin, was in court and upon the witness stand, and he in person, or those who under him would take the ore out, would be protected so far as this agreement gives the right.] 8 [Then, gentlemen, the title to that ore as we hold, was in the defendant, and so far as that is concerned you need not give it any further attention.] 3</p>

During the life of their father, the life tenant, they had no claim to work the mines opened upon it, with those rights <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>that are incident and necessary for that purpose and that alone. In his agreement with defendant, or those under whom defendant holds, he reserved certain timber that did not by that agreement pass to the defendant. After his death the plaintiffs came into possession in fee of this land, subject to the ore right in the defendants. At that time, just how many of these parties claimed to be minors is .not shown; but when this suit was brought, one at least was under age. Then a covenant by Alexander Fairchild in this agreement with defendant was a covenant that was not within his power to carry out; for he agreed in that, if anything is clear, to convey an interest of a minor, which interest could not be conveyed save by and through the Orphans’ Court over which he was powerless, had no jurisdiction. This is right in the line of the title, and other references, other affirmative statements in this agreement, show that clearly in the line of title, so that defendant taking rights under that agreement belonging to the life-estate and remainder over to the children of Mrs. Fairchild, was apprised of the kind of title that the party, Alexander Fairchild, had. And the covenants in this agreement to convey, by each party, so far as appears, have not up to the time of bringing suit been carried into effect, but each party went into possession; but there doesn’t seem to have been any effort upon the part of any or either of the parties to carry out the covenants in that agreement, except to take possession. Then, when Alexander Fairchild died, he was in possession of the land, and the rights that he had would descend to his children; but what covenants descend to and are obligatory and binding upon the plaintiffs or any of them, is not clear to this court. Then, we hold, that while the parties defendant were upon the land mining ore as a matter of right—in other words, rightfully upon the land to do those things which were incident and necessary and granted them under the license from John Martin to William J. Martin which they held, any other things they chose to do while there, in the nature of a trespass, they are liable for.</p>

The plaintiffs never claimed damages for anything but their ore and timber. The question from first to last has been, as it stands now, how much shall the defendant pay for these ? This court said, when the case was here before, that a claim of the timber by the defendant, with the knowledge it had of the title papers, could not be regarded as a bona fide claim of right. It is not denied that the defendant converted the timber to its own use. Why then should not the plaintiffs have treble damages for it under the act of March 29, 1824, 8 Sm. L. 283, and treble the value of the ore taken under the same circumstances, according to the act of May 8, 1876, P. L. 142 ? These are beneficial laws, as the case of McCloskey v. Powell, 23 W.

Martin. By this agreement John Martin agreed “ to grant to said William J. Martin the right and privilege of digging <em>all </em>the ore on his place and lands; for which said William J. Martin doth covenant and agree to pay said John Martin $200,” etc. The learned judge of the court below was of opinion that this was a license merely, revocable at the outset, but which, upon payment of the consideration, became irrevocable. We are clearly of opinion, however, that by the terms of the instrument William J. Martin was in equity invested with the right and title to this ore. The agreement was not under seal, nor did it contain the formal parts of a deed, but it was in writing, and that was sufficient to relieve the transaction from the ban of the statute of frauds. It was in form an executory agreement only, yet in equity it was a conveyance of the title to the ore. It was effectual to pass the title in fee, for when the consideration evinces that nothing less than a fee is intended, equity will supply the words of inheritance. It was not only a grant of the right to dig ore; it was a grant of the right and privilege to dig “ all the ore on his place and lands,” and for a sum in solido, which was paid in full. The case bears the closest analogy in principle with Caldwell v. Fulton, <a href="/pa/31/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="31 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="985056" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0475-01">31 Pa. 475</a>; the only difference being that in that case the transaction was executed by a deed, whilst here it is contained in an executory agreement. As the rights of William J. Martin, by a series of conveyances, have become vested in the defendant, it follows that the court was right in refusing the plaintiffs’ claim for the price of the ore. This refusal was placed upon somewhat different grounds, but the result is right, and we will not find fault with the course of reasoning by which that result was obtained.</p>

The summons was issued August 25, 1881. The action, as defined by the declaration originally filed, was an action in trespass at the common law. The amendments of November 27 and December 2,1886, were to the same effect. Not until December 18, 1888, did the plaintiff declare specially upon the terms of the act of 1824 for treble damages. In Hughes v.

This action of trespass, being brought at the common law, was brought to redress the injury done, by an award of compensation ; but the action under the statute is not for a redress of the injury; it is to recover a penalty prescribed by the statute, which, as a police regulation, is intended for the protection of real property from waste by those who either negligently or wilfully intrude upon the lands of others. The cause of action accruing under this statute, although arising on the same matter, is different from that accruing at common law, and whilst, perhaps, they may be joined in one action, there can be but one'recovery.

The lien of the debt, or the damages sustained from the breach of the contract, remained after the deed as before. The deed, therefore, did nothing to the company’s injury, nor was the condition of the company thereby in any respect changed. -It is not pretended that the plaintiffs who were entitled in remainder allowed their father to hold himself out to the world as the owner, or that they misrepresented the title; that they stood by and encouraged the execution of the contract, or that they ever knew such a transaction was on foot. Indeed, it is not even alleged that they did anything which amounted to the suggestion of a <em>falsehood; </em>that they concealed their rights or suppressed the truth; that they were silent when they should have spoken, or that anything that they did influenced the conduct of the defendant, or misled them in any way to their injury. On the contrary, it is admitted that in the recitals of the Russell deed they sp,oke the exact truth, and concealed nothing. It amounts to this: that Alexander Fairchild, who was a tenant for life only, acting for himself, and for' himself alone, granted, or attempted to grant, for a certain consideration, certain privileges, the duration and extent of which the grantor and grantees well knew at the time were in excess of his right. The consideration, having been paid in hand, was, at the grantor’s death, a portion of his estate, and those entitled in remainder are sought to be estopped, simply because this consideration forms part of their inheritance from their father. No case has been brought to our notice which carries the doctrine of estoppel to this length.</p>

      <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>It is very plain that Alexander Fairchild intended to .convey, not only upon the basis of his own interest as tenant by the curtesy, but also of the interest of those in remainder; for he expressly agreed, “ without delay, to obtain such other deeds or assurances in the law as might be necessary to vesting the title in the company.” If, therefore, he had subsequently become seised absolutely of the estate, an estoppel would certainly have arisen, and rendered the contract effectual to its full extent, for that was its meaning as manifest in its language, and this estoppel would have extended to the heirs of Alexander Fairchild. But the difficulty is that the plaintiffs do not claim as the heirs of Alexander Fairchild, but as the heirs of his wife.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[261,1025,1181,656]]]'>Nor can we see any ground for the argument that, under the special facts of this case, an action of trespass would not lie. The right which Alexander Fairchild had granted to the Youghiogheny Iron &amp; Coal Company was a right to dig ore . and cut timber on this land. This right was consistent with the possession of the land by the grantors, and we find that Alexander Fairchild, in his lifetime, and the plaintiffs, at his decease, were in the actual and continuous possession of the land. The right granted by Alexander Fairchild ceased at his death. After that event, it is clear that the company had no further privilege of the timber, and any invasion of the tract for the purpose of cutting timber was a trespass upon the plaintiffs’ possession.</p>
