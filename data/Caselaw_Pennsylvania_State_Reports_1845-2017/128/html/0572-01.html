    <p class="summary" id="b593-6" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[194,780,1177,1584]]]'>On May 2, 1882, the West Lemon street property was purchased from Silas L. Tucker, and paid for by Christopher Daisz, who directed that the deed should be made to his daughter, Mrs. Anna Bush. The deed was duly executed and acknowledged and Mrs. Bush took possession of the premises. On September 5, 1884, Mrs. Bush bought another house in New street for $2,600, giving in part payment therefor a check for $575, drawn by Christopher Daisz to her order and dated September 4,1884. On the same day, she drew from bank a deposit of $1,000.21 which balanced her account, and on the following day obtained the money on a check drawn by Christopher Daisz to her order for $1,000. Some time before the death of Christopher Daisz, Matthew D. Bush, the husband of Anna Bush, brought the deed to Mrs. Bush for the West Lemon street house, to one Charles Frailey, a conveyancer, who drew a deed for the said premises from Anna Bush and Matthew D. Bush to Christopher Daisz, and took it, with the deed brought to him by Matthew D. Bush, to Christopher Daisz, and left both deeds with him. Frailey testified that he presumed he did this under instructions from Matthew D. Bush, but he did not remember their conversation, and that he thought it occurred two or three years prior to the date his testimony was given, but could not tell the exact date. After September 5, 1884, the rent from the West Lemon street house was paid to Christopher Daisz; after May 2,1885, it was insured in his name, and after 1886 it was assessed in his name and he paid the taxes, until his death on March 27, 1887. Among his papers were then found the deed to his daughter Anna Bush, for the West Lemon street property, and also the unexecuted deed for the -same, from her and her husband to said Christopher Daisz.</p>

Boone, a case from Lancaster county argued at this term and not yet reported, <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>[ante, p. 567], the auditor erred in not excluding the evidence of Matthew D. Bush, who, as the husband of Mrs. Anna Bush, an interested party, was incompetent. But, excluding this evidence, there was sufficient to justify the auditor’s conclusions, and the decree of the court. There was other evidence from which the delivery of the deed from Silas L. Tucker to Mrs. Bush might fairly be inferred. Charles Frailey testifies that he found the deed in her husband’s hands; that her husband gave him the deed, with instructions to prepare a deed to Christopher Daisz, which he did, and placed both the executed and the unexecuted papers in the hands of Daisz, where they appeared to have remained until the time of his decease. The deed having been passed out of Tucker’s hands and found in the hands of the daughter’s husband, it is fair to infer, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, that the deed had been delivered. There is evidence that, on September 4,1884, Daisz advanced $1,575 to his daughter, but apart from the fact that Daisz entered into, and remained in, the reception of the rents, there is absolutely no evidence that the daughter at any time in fact agreed to convey the property. The existence of a contract rests upon a mere implication which is supposed to arise from the facts stated. The terms of the contract, if any existed, are not shown ; the delay is not explained; the whole matter rests upon mere conjecture. Under such proofs, specific performance would not be decreed.</p>
