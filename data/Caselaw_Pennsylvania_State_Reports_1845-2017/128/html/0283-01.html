Perhaps it might be a question of fact. It is entirely immaterial whether the defendants were owners of the vessel, or Worden &amp; Evans, in the sense that they were contractors, parties.with whom the original contract was made, whether they are to be regarded as owners; because whether the contract was made by either the party for whom the vessel was built, or an owner in the sense of a contractor, is entirely immaterial. The question is, did the real owners, or Worden &amp; Evans, enter into a contract with the plaintiff under and by virtue of which these materials were furnished. Now I shall qualify that, perhaps, by saying that the plaintiff does not claim under the original contract of Worden &amp; Evans, and does claim to recover under an express contract, entered into between the owners of the vessel and Mr. Baizley, plaintiff in this suit, after the vessel was brought to Philadelphia; so that the question of the original contract between these parties, so far as the plaintiff’s right to <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>recover in the present case is concerned, may be considered as really out of the case.1</p>

Now, with the contract or understanding which had been entered into, that he was to be regarded as the captain or master, I leave it to you as a question of fact, whether -under the evidence, whether by the agreement of the parties and understanding entered into between the persons for whom this vessel was built and Captain Holland, there was that agreement which began at the inception of this vessel, which was to put him in charge of the vessel from its beginning as the captain and master—the managing master, but not sailing master.2</p>

Besides, the act of assembly does not contain tbe phrase, managing owner. It requires the contract to be made by the master or owners, the evident intention being that in case of repairs to a vessel regularly documented and engaged in trade, the master may make the contract, while if a vessel is to be built the owners, and all of them, shall make it.</p>

There is neither allegation nor proof that any of the other owners made or authorized the making of any contract. In some states authority is given to a part owner, and in others, to an agent, to bind the vessel for such a debt. Such statutes are strictly construed; the part owner can bind only his share and the agent must be such an agent as the act contemplates: Childs v. The Brunette, <a href="/mo/19/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="19 Mo. 518" data-case-ids="315466" data-case-paths="/mo/19/0518-01">19 Mo. 518</a>.

This was the view taken by Buddie, J., upon the first motion for a new trial. The evidence being almost exactly the same as on the second trial, he held the defendants not liable. But there was no sufficient evidence to submit to the jury that Holland ordered this work, either as master or owner. The only witness who pretends to connect him with a contract is Rudolph Baizley, and his testimony amounts to no more than that Holland was in some way superintending the work, and expressed to him a belief that it would be paid for.</p>

By suing Worden &amp; Evans for the same identical materials and work sued for in this libel, the plaintiff is estopped from denying that he furnished them on the order of Worden &amp; Evans, and from affirming that they were furnished on the order of the defendants or their agent. On the faith of a statement purporting to be a copy of his book of original entries, in which these identical materials and work were charged to Worden &amp; Evans, he obtained a judgment against them. Under the statute, the whole question is, who contracted for the material and work, and to whom was the credit given? This question is res judicata, for it was directly in issue in the common law suit. The foundation of his suit against Worden <em>&amp; </em>Evans was the giving of credit to them. The judgment in that suit may be set up as an estoppel in this proceeding in rem: Goodrich v. Chicago, <a href="/us/72/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Wall. 566" data-case-ids="3459155" data-case-paths="/us/72/0566-01">5 Wall. 566</a>; The Tubal Cain, <a href="/f/9/0834-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="9 F. 834" data-case-ids="3780473" data-case-paths="/f/9/0834-01">9 Fed.

The libelant is estopped by the allegations of his libel from saying that they were owners. It is only a debt contracted by the master or owners, that binds the vessel and gives rise to the proceeding in rem.</p>

    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[175,1585,1177,700]]]'>1. A contract with the managing owner is a contract with the owners. He is their agent. The argument for defendants on this point is the samé that was made when the case was here before and has been disposed of by the former opinion of this court. There is both allegation and proof that the owners ordered the work and material. The evidence shows that both Holland, owner, and Cain, the alleged managing owner, told the plaintiff to go on with the work and he would be paid, and were present while it was being done, Holland bringing orders, superintending and reporting to the owners. Ostensibly Holland was acting for himself and co-owners. He appeared so to the world and to Baizley, upon whom it would be a fraud for the owners to deny his authority after taking and keeping the work and materials.</p>

The statement negatives the idea of an <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>exclusive credit to Worden &amp; Evans, and shows that credit was given to the vessel and owners, the charge against Worden &amp; Evans being “for the brig Odorilla.” Worden &amp; Evans were the owners for all purposes of lien: Scull v. Shakespear, <a href="/pa/75/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="75 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="1036656" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0297-01">75 Pa. 297</a>; The Reany Engineers, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Phila.%20620" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Phila. 620">9 Phila. 620</a>. This b.eing so there is no substantial difference between that statement and the bill of particulars in this case, charging the brig Odorilla and owners. It is true, we proceeded at the trial on a contract made directly with the owners. Had we proceeded on the contract with Worden &amp; Evans, the vessel would have been liable.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[280,918,1171,698]]]'>3. A judgment in personam against the contractor does not bar a lien; they are concurrent remedies: Rush v. Fisher, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Phila.%2044" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Phila. 44">8 Phila. 44</a>; Hommel v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/104/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="104 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="452203" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0465-01">104 Pa. 465</a>. The question here is not whether credit was given to the contractor or to the owner, but whether the credit of the construction was relied on: Hommel v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/104/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="104 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="452203" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0465-01">supra.</a> The vessel is liable unless the plaintiff expressly agreed to look to the contractors alone: Church v. Allison, <a href="/pa/10/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="962727" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0413-01">10 Pa. 413</a>. The judgment against the contractor in no way militates against the right to recover from the present defendants. Such judgment was in their relief; if it had been paid, their engagement would have been discharged; if they pay Baizley, they shall have it marked to their use. Baizley had a right to hold, as he has done, the vessel, the owners and the contractors all for his claim.</p>

In a purely technical sense, perhaps she could have a master and a managing owner, properly so called, only by virtue of the laws of the United States; but she had owners, in the general sense of the word, from the time the work of construction and equipment began, and if any one of the owners had the superintendence and control of the construction, with power to bind his fellows, he might well be considered the managing owner or even the master, in the general sense of these terms. There is evidence to the effect <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>that William S. Holland was in charge of the construction of this vessel whilst she was at the Christian street wharf, in Philadelphia, and for some time before, when she was at Smyrna, in the state of Delaware. Rudolph Baizley says that Holland superintended the work and reported to the owners’, and that he said he was part owner of the vessel. It appears further, by the testimony of Holland himself, as well as by the contract with Worden &amp; Evans, that he was, in fact, part owner. The witness further says that Worden &amp; Evans, the contractors, became financially embarrassed, and that his father refused to proceed with the construction, until Holland told him to go on with the worK and he would see that he got his money. He further states that Captain Cain, who the defendants admit was managing owner, said to the plaintiff that his money would be all right for they had good security. He says, also, that Captain Holland frequently brought orders to the plaintiff’s store for the work, for sizes, shapes, etc., both before and after the vessel was brought to Philadelphia; that Holland gave almost all the orders. Holland’s declarations, it is true, are not evidence of his agency; but his continuous acts in and about the owners’ business, and their recognition of these acts, are evidence from which his agency may be fairly inferred. The testimony, certainly, is not strong, but we cannot see how the court could disregard the inferences which might reasonably be drawn from the proof. There is evidence to show that at the time Worden &amp; Evans ceased to comply with their contract, there was $4,000 of the price still remaining in the hands of the owners, and this sum they afterwards spent in the employment of others to complete the work, some portions of it being contracted for by Captain Cain and some by Captain Holland. In view of this evidence and of the facts alleged, as already referred to, that Holland was part owner of the vessel, of which he was to be the captain and master; that he superintended the work and reported to the owner; that he gave the orders and agreed that he would see that the plaintiff got his money; and that the work was done on the faith of this promise ; and, further, that Captain Cain, who, the defendants admit, was the managing owner, gave a similar promise to the plaintiff, we cannot see how the court could have withdrawn the case from the jury; for if all this were true the liability of <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>the owners was established, and the lien of the debt attached to the vessel under the act of 1836. Of course, there was counter-vailing proof of the strongest character, but that was for the jury. We have nothing to do with the veracity of witnesses, the conflict in the testimony, or the weight of the evidence; these questions were passed upon by the jury and the verdict is conclusive here. Nor can the judgment of Worden &amp; Evans be set up as an estoppel here. The judgment, it is true, was upon a claim for the same debt, but this was a proceeding in rem, and the cause was presented only as against the vessel, under the act of 1836 ; non constat, because the contractors were responsible for the debt, that the vessel may not be responsible also. We cannot find fault with the answer of the court to the defendants’ second point, as the plaintiff’s claim to recovery here was not under any contract with Worden &amp; Evans, although such a contract may have existed, but under an express contract entered into between the owners of the vessel and the plaintiff.</p>
