    "head_matter": "Forepaugh\u2019s Estate.\nWill\u2014Legacy\u2014Abatement\u2014 Widow.\n' Where a testator bequeaths to his wife in lieu of dower the interest of a sum, which turns out to be larger than his whole estate, with disposition over of the principal amongst his surviving brothers and sisters, and also bequeaths the interest of a smaller sum to an adopted daughter, and the whole estate is awarded in trust to the widow, her legacy not abating, the adopted daughter upon the death of the widow has the right to have awarded to her for life a proportion of the estate ascertained by comparing the amount of the daughter\u2019s legacy with the amount of the widow\u2019s legacy specified in the will. In such a case the privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, is purely personal, and does not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers.\nArgued April 2, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 60, Jan. T., 1901, by Mary Van Beil, Annie F. Thorne and the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company, Executor of Emma Sherburne, deceased, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., Jan. T., 1882, No. 458, sustaining exceptions to adjudication in the estate of Albert Forepaugh, deceased.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nAshman, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe testator bequeathed to his wife for life the interest of \u2022$25,000, with disposition over of the principal amongst his surviving brothers and sisters. He also gave to his adopted daughter the interest of $10,000 for her life, and at her death the principal to her children, and if she should leave no child, then equally to his said brothers and sisters.\nThe total personal estate amounted to $16,777.71, and that sum was awarded in trust for the widow, her legacy, because given in lieu of dower not being called to abate: Haddock\u2019s Estate, 16 W. N. C. 196.\nOn the death of the widow the stepdaughter claimed that ten thirty-fifths of the fund representing the ratio which the fund for her use bore to that for the widow, should be awarded to her for life.\nThere can be no doubt, we think, of the justice of this demand. The privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, was purely personal, and did not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers. The privilege died with the person whom it was intended to benefit, and as between the remaining parties the legacies abate proportionally, just as they would have abated if the bequest of the $25,000 had been to any other than a purchaser. The exceptions are sustained, and adjudication and award amended accordingly.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nRichard 0. Bale,for appellants,\ncited: Duncan v. Atl, 3 P. & W. 382; Reed v. Reed, 9 Watts, 263; McGlaughlin\u2019s Executor v.
