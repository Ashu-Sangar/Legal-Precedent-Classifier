It follows that if there was no error in the charge or in the answers to the defendants\u2019 third, sixth and seventh points, the verdict rendered and the judgment entered thereon should be sustained. An examination of the charge, and of the answers to the points referred to, have not convinced us of error in either. We therefore dismiss the specifications and affirm the judgment.",

Vulcan Iron Works, Appellant.\nNegligence\u2014Master and servant\u2014Defective chain.\nIn an action by an employee against his employer to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the breaking of a chain, a verdict and judgment for plaintiff should be sustained where the evidence for the plaintiff, although contradicted, tended to show that the chain was defective, that an inspection would have shown the defect, and that the link which broke was twenty-two feet above the place where plaintiff was working.\nArgued April 16, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 18, Jan. T., 1901, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., Oct. T., 1898, No. 653, on verdict for plaintiff in case of James P. Newton v. The Vulcan Iron Works.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Mitchell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Lynch, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff was employed as a molder in defendants\u2019 foundry at Tamaqua, and while at work on May 10, 1897, in lowering a mold into a pit, was injured by the breaking of the crane chain. The link which broke was twenty-two feet above the place where plaintiff was standing. The evidence for plaintiff, although contradicted, tended to show that the chain was in bad condition, had not been inspected for three years, and that if it had been inspected the defect would have been discovered.\nThe court submitted the case to the jury.\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $5,000. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned among others was in submitting the case to the jury.\nThomas If. Atherton and W. S. McLean, for appellant.\nJohn T. Lenahan, with him W. J. Whitehouse and Edward A. Lynch, for appellee.\nJune 4, 1901:"
