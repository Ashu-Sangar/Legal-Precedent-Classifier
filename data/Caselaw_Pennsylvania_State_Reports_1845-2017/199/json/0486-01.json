Robertson.\nEquity\u2014Rescission of sale\u2014Laches.\nA bill in equity for the rescission of an executed contract of sale will not be sustained where it appears that the sale was made four and one half years before the bill was filed, that under the agreement the defendant liad transferred to the plaintiff the right to letters patent and trademark, the good will of a business, and certain personal property, and that the defendant had committed no fraud or misrepresentation.\nArgued April 3, 1901.\nAppeal, No. 42, Jan.

Moorhead.\nBefore McCollum, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity for the rescission of a contract of sale.\nFrom the record it appeared that on June 15, 1895, John Robertson assigned to plaintiff letters patent and a trade-mark for a patent medicine known as \u201c Robertson\u2019s Nerve Food.\u201d He also assigned and transferred to plaintiff at the same tim\u00e9 the good will of the business previously carried on by him, and also certain personal property.
