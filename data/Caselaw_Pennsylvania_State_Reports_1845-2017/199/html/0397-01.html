It is not a statement that would bind anybody as to what took place with reference to the conspiracy. That is, the declarations of any one of the conspirators is based upon the same principle, as principal and agent, that while the <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>agency is going on, whatever declarations he makes are evidence against the principal but that after the agency is terminated, then his declarations no longer bind and are no longer evidence; and it is the same principle precisely that declarations of one conspirator are evidence against all until the consummation of the thing they conspired to do. Now the thing it is alleged they conspired to do was the making of a will or preventing Mr. McCorkle changing his will. That was consummated and finally concluded when Mr. McCorkle died and the will was probated. This is simply a narrative of that alleged past transaction given by one of the alleged conspirators to Mr. Newlin in the fall of 1895, after the death of Mr. McCorkle, and therefore it is incompetent on that ground.</p>
