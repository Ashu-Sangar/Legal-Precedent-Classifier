They are created, governed, and the extent of their powers determined by the legislature, and subject to change, repeal, or total abolition at its will. They have no vested rights in their offices, their charters, their corporate powers, or even their corporate existence. This is the universal rule of constitutional law, and in no state has it been more clearly expressed and more uniformly applied than in Pennsylvania. In Philadelphia v. Fox, <a href="/pa/64/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="64 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1021273" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0169-01">64 Pa. 169</a>, 180-81, this court, speaking through Shaes'WOOD, J., said: “ The city of Philadelphia is a municipal corporation, that is a public corporation created by the government for political purposes, and having subordinate and local powers of legislation. . . . It is merely an agency instituted by the sovereign for the purpose of carry<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>ing out in detail the objects of government, essentially a revocable agency, having no vested right to any of its powers or franchises, the charter or act of erection (creation ?) being in no sense a contract with the state, and, therefore, fully subject to the control of the legislature who may enlarge or diminish its territorial extent or its functions, may change or modify its internal arrangements or destroy its very existence with the mere breath of arbitrary discretion. . . .

The courts are not the guardians of the rights of the people of the state, except as those rights are secured by some constitutional provision wbicfi comes within the judicial cognizance. The protection against unwise and oppressive legislation, within constitutional bounds, is by an appeal to the justice and patriotism of the representatives of the people. If this fail, the people in their sovereign capacity can correct the evil; but courts cannot assume their rights. The judiciary can only arrest the execution of a statute when it conflicts with the constitution. It cannot run a race of opinions upon points of right, reason, and expediency with the lawmaking power. ... If the courts are not at liberty to declare statutes void because of their apparent injustice or impolicy, neither can they do so because they appear to the mind of the judges to violate fundamental principles of republican government, unless it should be found that these principles are placed beyond legislative encroachment by the constitution: ” Cooley on Constitutional Limitations, ch. 7, sec. 4 (6 ed. 1890, p. 201).</p>

But the range of the argument, and the energy with which it was pressed have seemed to make it proper to set forth clearly the only question before the court, the constitutionality of the statute in question. Much of the argument and nearly all of the specific objections advanced, are to the wisdom and propriety and the justice of the act, and the motives supposed to have inspired its passage. With these we have nothing to do, they are beyond our province and are considerations to be addressed solely to the legislature. This court is not authorized to sit as a council of revision to set aside or refuse assent to ill-considered, unwise or dangerous legislation.

The imperfection of the act in this respect is manifest, but that does not make it unconstitutional. The effect may be to leave the affairs of the cities in a state of very regretable confusion, but it has not been shown that the municipal government cannot be administered notwithstanding. Every city in passing from one class to another, and a fortiori in passing from one charter to another in the same class retains and carries with it all its ordinances and makes no change in its government except such as the law renders necessary to adjust it to the class into which it goes : Com. ex rel. v. Wyman, <a href="/pa/137/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="137 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="821459" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0508-01">137 Pa. 508</a>. It may require consideration by the courts to determine how much of the general system of municipal government under the <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>act of 1874 is compatible with the provisions of the present act, and how far the new system is self-sustaining, and not improbably legislative assistance will be required for a smooth and harmonious working under one or both. But these matters must be determined as they arise. For the present nothing has been shown against the practical operation of the act beyond great inconvenience.</p>
    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[174,700,1181,1340]]]'>Secondly, it is objected that the act attempts a classification in the method of filling municipal offices and of exercising municipal powers resting on no proper discrimination or foundation, in that it provides for methods of government and administration of cities of the second class different from those required in cities of the first and third class, in particulars where there is no real difference. It is sufficient to say of this that it is a legislative, not a judicial question. The very object of classification is to provide different systems of government for cities differently situated in regard to their municipal needs. It was recognized that cities varying greatly in population will probably vary so greatly in the amount, importance and complexity of their municipal business, as to require different officers and different systems of administration. Classification therefore is based on difference of municipal affairs, and so long as it relates to and deals with such affairs, the questions of where the lines shall be drawn, and what differences of system shall be prescribed for differences of situation, are wholly legislative. What is a distinction without a difference is largely matter of opinion. No argument, for example, could be more plausible than that there_ is no real difference in municipal needs, between a city of 99,000 and one of 100,000 population. It is a sufficient answer that the line must be drawn somewhere, and the legislature must determine where. So long as it is drawn with reference to municipal and not to irrelevant or wholly local matters, the courts have no authority to interfere.</p>

It would not follow that the legislature had exceeded its powers, if this feature had been made one of the permanent provisions of the act, but wc are not called upon to consider that question now, <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>for the appointment directed is only part of the temporary adjustments provided in the schedule for the change.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.4",570,[277,442,1188,1183]]]'>The substitution of a new system for one under which government has been previously carried on is always accompanied with some shifting of offices and duties, and some inconvenience. To reduce this to a minimum by temporary adjustment of the changes is the province of a schedule. In well considered legislation which involves such changes a schedule of temporary expedients is usually and properly added, and' the expedients provided would need to be very clearly unconstitutional to justify a court in overturning them. In Lloyd v. Smith, <a href="/pa/176/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="176 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="882204" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0213-01">176 Pa. 213</a>, it is said: “In an exchange of offices there may naturally be some overlapping of terms and duties, and if in the legislative view the need for a controller was immediate but the existing terms of the auditors prevented his present assumption of all the duties that would finally pertain to his office, it would not have been unwise, certainly not unconstitutional to meet the case by a temporary expedient.” The provision in the schedule of the present act, that the governor shall within thirty days appoint a recorder in each of the existing cities of the second class, is a temporary expedient, to put the machinery of the new system of government in immediate operation. We could not say that it is an unreasonable expedient for that purpose, even if the question of its reasonableness was not one for the legislature alone.</p>

These provisions are not part of the substantial and permanent features of the act, but of the temporary adjustment of the change. The reference to “ existing ” cities was in view of the existing but temporary situation. There are no other cities' about to enter the second class, and if by any unforeseen possibility there should be another before 1903, it is by no means clear that the proper construction of the word “ existing ” should not refer to that date. However that may be, a temporary and transitory provision that applies to all the present mem<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>bers of the class, meets all the requirements of the temporary situation and ends with the end of that situation, does not make the whole act local or special. In this connection the language of this court in Pittsburg’s Petition, <a href="/pa/138/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="138 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="11252075" data-case-paths="/pa/138/0401-01">138 Pa. 401</a>, 427 is very pertinent. It was urged that certain sections of the act then in question made the act local “ by fixing dates at which acts necessary to put the government in operation are to be done, which were possible only to one city, the city of Pitts-burg, and which are impossible to the city of Allegheny which has come into the class since the act was passed. The reply to this objection is, that, at the date when the act became a law, there was but one city in the second class. The provisions of the' act were general in their character. They related to all cities of the second class. If there had been several such cities, the terms employed would have applied to all alike. It was necessary, in order to give effect to the change in the system of municipal government, that a definite time should be fixed upon at which the change should take place and the new system be put in operation. The trouble with the act is not that it made such a provision for cities then entitled to a place in the second class, but that it did not also make similar provisions for cities that should thereafter be entitled to come into the class. We cannot hold, however, that the failure to provide a date for the organization of cities afterwards to come into the class, deprives such cities of the benefit of the law, or renders it local, and so, inoperative, in the cities to which it would otherwise be applicable.”</p>

But what is a reasonable or proper opportunity is a question for the legislature. That the prolongation of a temporary appointment to a vacancy beyond an election not unduly close at hand, is unusual and contrary to what citizens are accustomed to regard <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>as their moral and political rights, may be conceded, but that does not make it unconstitutional.

This again is an objection founded on the temporary expedients of the schedule, and would be sufficiently answered by the considerations already discussed under that head. That statutes making important changes in the law should provide definitely when they shall go into effect is desirable but not essential. The legislature may make them operative from a future date, or within certain limitations make them retroactive. The present act in its first section abolishes the office of mayor and substitutes that of recorder. This without more would operate, as the rest of the act does, from the date of its approval. But to prevent a gap in the government and the resulting confusion of the city business, the schedule in section 2 continues the office of mayor temporarily until the new office of recorder is filled by the governor’s appointment under section 1. There is nothing in this that is not entirely within the reasonable province of a schedule for the initial operation of necessary changes.</p>

The right to grant a new charter to the city, imposing a new form of government, is conceded, even though the effect is to abolish the office and to deprive the officer of his place. But it is argued that the merely nominal abolishing of the office by the substitution of one with the same powers and duties only under a different name is beyond the legislative power. It does not appear how this conclusion follows. There is no right to <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>a public office unless it is under the express protection of the constitution (Lloyd v.

On the contrary the universal rule is that, unless otherwise directed by the new act, the officers go out with the charter under which they held, and the officers under the new charter take their places whether under the same or a different name. Merely official positions, unprotected by any special constitutional provisions are subject to the exercise of the power of revision and repeal by the legislature: Kilgore v.

The office of district attorney is not one of those which are usually denominated constitutional. ... Not having been mentioned by the constitution the legislature was left with unrestricted power to prescribe what the duties of the office should be, what the length of its tenure, what its emoluments and how it should be filled. Having the power to create, they have also the power to regulate and even destroy. Undoubtedly the legislature may at any moment repeal the act of 1850 and abolish the office. They may provide a substitute for it: ” Strong, J., Com. v.

In the act under discussion the changes in the general scheme of government are many and important. With respect to the offices of mayor and recorder, each being the chief executive of a city, a similarity in their powers and duties <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>is natural if not essential, but the offices are not identical either in substance or in name. The recorder has far greater executive powers than his predecessor the mayor, and yet lacks some of the other powers that the latter had. The very argument of the appellants first noticed, on the impossibility of execution of the act, was based on the recorder’s want of the authority in the passage of ordinances which the mayor had, and which it was contended was essential to the operation of the new system.</p>

This is based on the last section of the schedule, which is a repealing clause. It is enough to say at present that the repeal of previous acts on the same general subject is always germane to the title. Usually the repealing clause is only declaratory of what would be the legal effect without it, but it is useful as preventing doubt upon the legislative intent. And a clause saving from repeal an act that is not within the intent but might have appeared to come within the language of the repealing clause merely operates as a proviso, and is in no sense a re-enactment or extension of the act so executed.

The article reads : “ From and after the passage <em>of </em>this act, all laws relating to cities of the third class shall continue to apply to cities of that class which have passed or may pass into a city of the second class by reason of increase in population, except so far as such laws are supplied by, or in conflict with, laws relating to cities of the second class.” It would be sufficient to say that even if this article cannot stand, it will not affect the rest of the act. It is an independent and easily severable provision. But the article is at least partly declaratory and it does not at present appear that it is anything more. Local and special laws are not repealed by subsequent general ones, unless such is the legislative intent, either expressed or unavoidably implied by the irreconcilability of the continued operation of both. How far this principle may be applicable to a city passing from one class to another is yet an open question. Thus for example when the city of Allegheny passed from the third to the second class it carried with it certainly all its local and special laws, enacted prior to 1874, which it had retained in the third class and which were not in irreconcilable conflict with the laws governing the second class. Whether it carried also the powers and privileges which it had acquired as a city of the third class, subject of course to the same limitation that they are not in conflict with the system prescribed for the second class, has not yet been expressly considered. There is <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>strong reason why that should be the rule. The sweeping away in one breath of a whole system, the growth of years and experience, and the substitution of an entirely new one, is fraught with great inconvenience if not with more serious consequences. This court has said in Com. v. Wyman, <a href="/pa/137/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="137 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="821459" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0508-01">137 Pa. 508</a>, and Com. v. Macferron, <a href="/pa/152/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="152 Pa. 244" data-case-ids="838153" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0244-01">152 Pa. 244</a>, that the changes in-the transition are to be confined to those absolutely necessary for adjustment to the new class. Some of the language used in Com. v. Macferron would appear to indicate a presumption that each class is so distinct that in leaving it a city leaves everything that it acquired while in it. But the principle of minimizing the changes was again stated by our Brother Fell in Shroder v. Lancaster, <a href="/pa/170/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="170 Pa. 136" data-case-ids="872314" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0136-01">170 Pa. 136</a>, without any such qualification. It is to be remembered that there is no constitutional requirement of uniformity. The mandate of the constitution is negative, that laws on certain subjects shall not be local or special. That means that they must be general, and the uniformity which is discussed in the decisions is not a necessary requirement, but only a test of the generality which is what the constitution commands. Article 20 of the present act settled the legislative intent in favor of the view that cities passing from the third to the second class shall carry with them all the laws not in conflict with the system provided for the second class. Whether such intent violates the required generality of the act may become the subject of consideration hereafter. But even if the article must fall on this account, it will not carry down the rest of the act, and that is all we need decide now.</p>

This objection is based mainly on the schedule and has been sufficiently discussed already, except with reference to the intimation in the dissenting opinion, that it is an abuse of the power of classification, and perhaps that the principle of classification itself may be a departure from correct constitutional construction. It is far too late to discuss this question. Classification was sanctioned deliberately and unanimously by our predecessors, more than a quarter of a cen<a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>tury ago and has never been shaken since. No judge now on this bench had any part in the original decision (Wheeler v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/77/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="77 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="436265" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0338-01">77 Pa. 338</a>), and to start a question of its correctness would be a most flagrant and unjustifiable violation of the salutary maxim stare decisis. Nor is there any disposition to do so. On the contrary every year’s experience and every new question presented, have vindicated the wisdom and correctness of the principle there enunciated, and the steady tendency has been to broaden instead of narrowing its applicability. As has been said by this court, the constitution of 1874 was a new departure in the history of American law. Instead of being confined as all previous constitutions had been, to the framework of the government, and to general principles for the protection of individuals and minorities against the oppression of irresponsible majorities, the people voluntarily tied their own hands, in the persons of their legislative agents by a binding code of particulars and details that stand in the path of much just, desirar ble and necessary legislation. The most emphatic expression of this limitation upon the powers of the legislature is found in article 3, section 7, under which most of the cases have arisen. The real evils, however, at which that article was directed, are pointed out in Com. v. Gilligan, <a href="/pa/195/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="195 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="914028" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0504-01">195 Pa. 504</a>, and Clark’s Estate, <a href="/pa/195/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="195 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="914073" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0520-01">195 Pa. 520</a>, and every decision in the last decade has shown the steady trend of the court, under the guidance of wider experience, not to extend that article to cases not really within the evil prohibited, though the form may have the appearance of coming within the words of the prohibition. As an illustration of the effect of a contrary view we may look at the case of the city of Philadelphia. The present charter, the act of 1885 commonly known as the Bullitt Bill, was undoubtedly framed and passed in the most honest and patriotic effort for reform in municipal administration, whatever its success may have been in that direction. But its intent was just as distinctly local as that of the act of 1901 is alleged to be, and the construction that would strike down the latter would as inevitably strike down the former, and send Philadelphia back irremediably to its former discredited system. The sound result, after all views have been considered, is that the control of the general subject of municipal administration is a necessary governmental power that has been left by the constitution where <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>it has always been, in the legislature, and that for any misuse of it the remedy must be applied by the constituencies in their dealing with their representatives.</p>

Article 3 is almost wholly prohibitory; it enjoins very few duties, but the ‘ thou shalt nots’ number more than sixty.” This incontrovertible evidence that the constitution is the result of a full, detailed, exhaustive consideration of the subject of legislative control over merely local affairs, is of itself a conclusive argument against any further additions by the courts to its sixty and more expressed prohibitions. There is no sounder or better settled maxim in the law than expressio unius ex-clusio est alterius, and when the authorities which have the right to control any subject, be they only parties to a private contract, or the sovereign people in the adoption of their constitution, have fully considered and determined what shall be the rights, the powers, the duties or the limitations under the instrument, there is no longer any room for courts to introduce either new powers or new limitations. To do so would, in the language of Chief Justice Black already quoted, “ be assuming a right to change the constitution, to supply what we might conceive to be its defects, to fill up every casus omissus, to interpolate into it whatever in our opinion ought to have been put there by its framers.”</p>

It does not touch Philadelphia city, nor any one of the many other cities of the state; nor is there a single provision • in it for any city which may hereafter reach the population of these three cities. It applies specially to these three; changes their charters; puts them under special provisions different from all other cities; to all intents and purposes for a long period governs them by a high executive officer of the commonwealth, resident at Harrisburg, many miles distant, necessarily ousting local officers elected by the people, whose terms have not yet expired. There is nothing peculiar in the geographical location of these cities, or in the character of their population, or business interests, which calls for peculiar legislation such as this ; nor is it intimated in the bill, that any reason existed for depriving them of self-government and subjecting them to a foreign one, that would not apply to every'other city in the state. It is given as the controlling reason in the majority opinion for declaring the act constitutional, that nowhere does that instrument expressly forbid such legislation, and therefore, not being expressly forbidden, the legislature has all power not withheld. This proposition has been stated more than once in like languagé by courts when discussing constitutional questions ; and while <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>the facts in the cases before them did not render the language inapplicable, it was never intended to be of universal or even of common application. It is conceded by all that the main reason for calling the constitutional convention of 1873 was to devise some means by which the annual flood of local legislation should be stopped; local laws were being passed every year for every imaginable selfish and sordid purpose without the least regard for the public good; the legislature was demoralized ; the people were becoming debauched.</p>

I always doubted the authority of this court to uphold this act; the reasoning in vindication of the judgment is not satisfactory or convincing; it is based upon the necessity for classification because of the inconvenience that would result if classification of cities was not held constitutional. It seems to me to be judicial legislation of the gravest character; it wrote into the constitution what was not there, and was not intended by the framers of it to be there. While I admit the inconvenience of enforcing strictly article 3 in all its provisions, it was but a temporary inconvenience, which could have been and should have been remedied by an amendment to the constitution, according to the method pointed out in it, and not, practically, by an amendment adopted by this court. The court gave way, and more than once since it has been placed in the same dilemma as it was on the question of retroactive legislation, discussed by Chief Justice Gibson in Greenough v. Greenough, <a href="/pa/11/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="11 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="404638" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0489-01">11 Pa. 489</a>, where lie says:</p>

This was a little too much for the court to stand. So it stopped just there, with the keen regret expressed by Chief Justice Gibson that it had not stopped sooner. In a very short time the whole series of retroactive laws were, in effect, swept from the statute book by the very court which had at first upheld them. By our decision in the case before us, we are going a step beyond anything heretofore allowed in the line of special legislation. It is purely a question of law whether section 7 of article 3 of the constitution has been violated, yet, we in effect say, it is the province of the legislature to decide the question and that we will not inquire into it. This, on our part, is a grave mistake. I would not encroach one inch on the authority of the legislature, but I would not allow that body, nor the executive, to encroach one inch on ours. We have now before us an act which, it is true, does not take one man’s land and- give it to another, but it does take from one set of men the offices given them by the people, hands them over to the governor, that he may confer them on others. Here we should call a halt upon such unconstitutional usurpation of power. What the next step in this direction will be we can only conjecture ; factional politics and partisan politics are not troubled by scruples; under the principle of this decision there is nothing to hinder a hostile partisan majority in the legislature from ousting the party in power in Philadelphia, a city of the first class, and placing its government in possession of the minority. The time is not very remote in the past, in English politics, when the victorious political party, as soon as it was seated in power, promptly proceeded to cut off the physical heads of their leading antagonists and confiscate their property; it is not very remote in the future <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>when the victorious political party will promptly proceed to cut off the political heads of its opponents where they hold office by the municipal votes of cities.</p>

Philadelphia) clearly indicates that the scope of the decision in Wheeler v. Philadelphia was either misunderstood or ignored.

Hence, when the legislature undertook to increase the classes to five, afterwards to seven, we declared the acts unconstitutional, because such increase was without the slightest foundation in necessity. This court, after having decided that necessity warranted three classes, soon found itself forced to decide that it warranted no more. It was thus in the inconsistent position of acknowledging the authority of the legislature to determine the necessity of three classes, but denying its authority to say that more than three were necessary. This was plainly passing on the merits of the acts, when it was attempted to increase the classes. And I do not disclaim the power or wisdom of the court in so doing after it had acknowledged the authority of the legislature to classify at all, in the total absence of such authority in the constitution. It was bound to prevent the abuse of its own decision.</p>

From its very terms it touches no subject which is not common to every other city in the commonwealth, and if there be a necessity for such legislation in these three cities, then there is the same necessity in all the others. This fact of itself stamps it as local and special legislation, for as is said in Ayars’s Appeal, supra, there must be a necessity for the legislation “ springing from manifest peculiarities, clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the others.” No peculiarities in cities of the second class demanding such a law are even pretended. Every member of this court concedes that this legislation is vicious. Why? They do not answer; but, to my mind, it is apparent that its vice consists in its flagrant violation of the fundamental law. We know its purpose was to oust one set of municipal officers in three certain cities, put in place, either directly or indirectly, by the people, and give their offices to others, through the chief executive of the state. This is the inevitable result from the bill itself. Can we assume that our lawmakers do not intend the obvious, results of their acts ?</p>

The majority opinion is, in the main, based on the authority of the <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>legislature to pass a general law for a class and a disclaimer of our authority to inquire into the merits, to ascertain whether the law was intended to be, and is in fact, a local and special law in its results. I concede, there is no express prohibition in the constitution forbidding such legislation if it be in general terms a general law, but, if it be only in terms general, nevertheless, in intent and results, special, then its unconstitutionality is a necessary implication, and we are not shut off in our inquiry by general terms.

In other words, in construing the constitution of the state, whatever is not expressly denied to the legislative power is possessed by it. The opposite of this rule, I may remark, is the construction of the federal constitution. I assent to this, but not that the inhibitions of the constitution must be always express.
