    <p class="summary" id="b615-7" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[175,1480,1181,397]]]'>It is by virture of the above recited provision in the last will of said William Weaver, deceased, that plaintiff claims title to the land in controversy. The contention of defendants is that said lot of land described in the writ of ejectment consists of three lots, each having a frontage on Main street of about fifty-two feet, and.that the devise can only apply to the lot at the corner of Main and Mill streets, and that such application fully satisfies the terms of the devise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b615-8" data-blocks='[["BL_615.7",615,[175,1895,1181,189]]]'>On the other hand the plaintiff alleges that there being no interior line which intersects Main street, the terms of the devise can only be satisfied by including all within the exterior lines.</p>

We find a building used as a store immediately on the corner, and a dwelling house in the rear on the corner of Mill street and an alley, and a fence separating this lot from the other lots, running between it and them, to a woodshed and ice house, which are squarely on the line, and the fence, if run through in the same direction, will intersect Main street at the distance of fifty-two feet from the northwest corner of Main and Mill streets. This fence existed in the same locality before and ever since decedent purchased the property. We find from the evidence in this case that this line fence was maintained by the decedent in his lifetime, having been repeatedly repaired and at least once reconstructed. We also find that at the time decedent purchased the lot at the corner, this fence extended to and intersected Main street at a point fifty-two feet distant from the corner, and was taken down for a short distance north of Main street merely for more conveniently getting to his store. We also find that the entire lot described in the writ is composed of three borough lots, each containing fifty-two feet front, and that these lots were purchased by decedent at different times and from different parties and that they are each of the dimensions known to be the dimensions of the town lots of the said borough of Montoursville. They appear on the plot of the borough as lots Nos. 9, 10 and 11—the one on the corner of Main and Mill streets being lot No. 9. We are therefore of the opinion and sov find, that the lot of land devised to the plaintiff by the last will and testament of William Weaver, deceased, and described in said will as the lot of land on the northwest corner of Main and Mill streets, vested in her on the death of testator lot No. 9 of the Charles Lloyd addition to the borough of Montoursville, having a frontage of fifty-two feet on Main street and a depth of 208 feet more or less to an alley, and a width on said alley of about eighty-nine feet, said lot being bounded on the east by Mill street, and that such devise was limited to the lot last described.</p>

    <p id="b617-9" data-blocks='[["BL_617.9",617,[168,937,1182,1131]]]'>While the findings of fact and the conclusions of law were assailed by the plaintiff there was nothing in the testimony or in the cases cited which in any degree qualified either of them. It is a fair and just inference from the testimony and the law applicable to it that the conclusion arrived at by the learned court below harmonizes with the devise to Annie E. Updegraff of lot No. 9. It was the “lot of land and buildings situate at the Northwest corner of Main and Mill streets,” that was devised, and not the other lots of land which the testator purchased long after he acquired lot No. 9. They formed no part of that lot, but were distinct from it, each having a frontage on Main street of fifty-two feet and a depth of 208 feet. There were three lots of land on the plan or plot in the borough which belonged to the testator, and “ the lot of land and buildings situate ” as aforesaid was the corner lot which was devised to Annie E. Updegraff. The testator died on or about March 14, 1894, and shortly after the executors delivered possession to the devisee of lot No. 9. This lot was sold by her in May, 1899, to Henry S. Weaver, who entered into possession before the institution of this suit. The suit was tried by the late Judge Metzger, whose clear and concise opinion affords a complete answer to the devisee’s unreasonable and unjust claim.</p>
