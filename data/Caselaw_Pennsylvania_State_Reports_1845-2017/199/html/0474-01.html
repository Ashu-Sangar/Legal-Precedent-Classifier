Simpson, Jr., Esq., as referee, from whose report it appeared that from April 2, 1895, to March 17, 1896, a series of letters passed between Hanson H. Haines, plaintiff and George E. Dearborn. It was claimed that in these letters there was a contract for the sale by Haines to Dearborn of a farm referred to in the letters as the “ Barnes Farm,” situated in Cecil County, Maryland. In a letter dated April 8, 1895, the price fixed for the farm and certain personalty was 19,000, and no variance from this price was made or suggested in any of the later letters. During the course of the correspondence Haines constantly averred a contract which <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>Dearborn did not deny. Dearborn’s sole cause of postponement was lack of ready cash, and he constantly promised that as soon as he got the cash in bank he would pay for the farm.</p>

    <p id="b499-13" data-blocks='[["BL_499.13",499,[175,1928,1179,510]]]'>We have examined and considered with care the report of the learned referee, together with the testimony and correspondence on which it is founded, and our conclusion is that no error appears in it which would authorize a modification or reversal of it in favor of the defendants. The exceptions filed to the report by the defendants were duly considered, passed upon, and finally dismissed by the court. As we are satisfied that a just conclusion was reached by the learned referee and approved by the court, we unhesitatingly affirm the judgment appealed from. We therefore dismiss all the assignments of error.</p>
