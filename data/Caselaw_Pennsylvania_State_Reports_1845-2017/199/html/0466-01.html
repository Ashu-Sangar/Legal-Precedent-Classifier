The contract called for peeled poplar. The defendants filed an affidavit of defense which was in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b491-8" data-blocks='[["BL_491.10",491,[201,930,1179,458]]]'>The defendants never agreed to furnish poplar wood wi fch the “ bark on ” and never consented with the plaintiffs that they should go into the market and buy wood such as they had not agreed to furnish them, and the defendants never allowed the plaintiffs the privilege of going into the market and buying the poplar wood with the “ bark on.” The purchase of poplar wood with the “ bark on ” to take the place of and be substituted for the peeled poplar wood is absolutely new to the trade, not in accordance therewith, and entirely contrary thereto.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b491-10" data-blocks='[["BL_491.12",491,[201,1605,1178,705]]]'>The average price of cord wood, which is solid wood with the “ bark on ” and usually consists of chestnut, oak, poplar, and other woods, is from $3.00 to $3.50 per cord, delivered on a corresponding freight rate to Philadelphia, Pa. Poplar wood is no more expensive than chestnut or oak wood. A charge of $2.00 per cord for peeling the said wood is an excessive price for the work, inasmuch as the entire cost of felling the timber, sawing into lengths, splitting the wood to proper size, and peeling the bark costs from seventy-five cents to one dollar per cord, and if the wood with the <em>“ </em>bark on ” had been bought by the plaintiffs at the market price, the plaintiffs would have obtained their wood at less than their contract price with the defendants, and consequently could not have any claim against the defendants under the said contract.</p>

But what is the best substitute is a question of fact which if disputed must go to a jury; and on this question, ordinarily, the general usage of the business, if there is such a usage, is controlling evidence.
