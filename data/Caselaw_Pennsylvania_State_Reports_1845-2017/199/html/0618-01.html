Beginning in 1877, Dr. C. C. Reichard, of Brownsville, was his attending physician until his death, visiting him at irregular intervals when suffering from attacks of the disease to which he was subject; Dr. Reichard attended him in the spring of 1895, and again in July or August of the same year some four or five times. His next call was in January of 1896, and in July and August of 1896, in decedent’s last illness, he visited him some five or six'times. These visits seem to have been paid when Mr. Lenhart was in much pain, and the conversation was principally in reference to his illness. Dr. Reichard testifies that the deceased gradually became worse during the last two years of his life, losing flesh, becoming melancholy and taciturn, and taking no interest in matters that formerly interested him, both mind and body being much weakened by age and disease; that in 1895 he was not competent to transact important business or to make a will. He admits that in his examination before the register of wills in 1896, he stated in reply to the question whether the decedent was capable of making a will, that he didn’t know, and his conclusion in his present testimony seems to be based on the extreme age, long continued suffering and changed characteristics above <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>noted.

These instances, however, occur generally during or just after attacks of the disease with which he was afflicted. These attacks were accompanied by great physical suffering, aud mental and physical prostration. For some four or five years before his death he had given up the active management of his business, farming, his affairs being looked after by his youngest son Leonard A. Lenhart, who had never married, and who had remained at home, and was, for some years prior to his father’s death the only child remaining at home.</p>

It was written at the residence of the deceased on that date by J. V. Thompson of this place, a man of great business experience, and who has frequently been called upon to perform similar services. He went there at the decedent’s request, for that purpose, and while there he had no intercourse with any other member of the family. He was accompanied by his wife, since deceased. He had known Mr. Lenhart for many years. A former will, written some ten years before, .by Mr. Thompson’s father, had been left at the bank, of which he is an officer, for safekeeping, and was in his possession. The testator’s second wife had died the preceding March, and this, with a different disposition of a portion of the surface of the farm, was assigned as the reason of rewriting the will. The former will was read twice, and the changes desired noted, the present will was then drafted, read to Mr. Lenhart, and signed by him, and the former will destroyed at his request. Mr. Thompson testifies that no suggestions were made to Mr. Lenhart, no member of the family was present or consulted; that he detected no change in his ability to transact business; that in view of his sickness he thought him remarkably strong; that he understood and talked about the property he possessed, the parties to whom he desired to will it, and the disposition he wished to make of it. The will, so far as the present beneficiaries are concerned, was practically a republication of the former will with the exception that sixty or seventy acres of surface were devised to Leonard <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>• A. Lenhart in addition to what had previously been devised to him. By the former will this land had been devised to Charles Lenhart. In its place he was bequeathed $3,000 of the proceeds of the coal in addition to the sum bequeated him by the former will. The bequests made to the other legatees, and payable out of the proceeds of the coal were unchanged. At the time the former will was made it is not alleged that the testator was not in full control of his business, and of his mental faculties; nor is it alleged that at that time he was subject to undue influence. Leonard A. Lenhart was then about nineteen years of age. He remained with his father until the latter’s death, and so far as the evidence shows, was the only one ■ of his sons who showed any taste or inclination towards farming. There is no proof that the testator’s intention to change his will was brought about by Leonard A. Lenhart or by anyone in his behalf, nor is there any proof that the changes actually made were made other than by the testator’s own wish and motion. And the fact that the sums bequeathed to the other legatees in the former will were undiminished in the will in contest certainly shows that no deception, artifice or undue influence was used to their prejudice in the mean time. It is not claimed that undue influence was exerted in behalf of Charles Lenhart, and yet it is evident that the increased legacy given to him by the will in contest almost, if not fully, equals the increased devise to Leonard. Nor is there foundatiyji for the charge that a fictitious valuation was placed upon the coal to the advantage of the devisee of the surface. The judgment of the' testator as to the value of his coal has been more than justified, and it is a well known fact which we feel that we can here state without impropriety, although it does not appear in evidence, that the proceeds of the testator’s coal would at this time pay nearly, if not fully, double the legacies named in the will. Nor is it difficult, with the knowledge that comes after the fact, to see the ground upon which the testator’s judgment was based. We are fully satisfied that at the time this will was made the testator possessed testamentary capacity, and that he exercised it without undue influence.</p>

But they fail to recognize his right to do as he deemed best with his own property, to prefer one child above another, or disinherit one or more at his discretion. This dominion and power conferred by statute and protected by the law is not to be interfered with for slight cause. And it is not for the courts to produce an equality where a testator has seen fit to make an inequality, merely to relieve the disappointment and chagrin of legatees whose equal or superior claims, in their opinion, have been unjustly disregarded.”</p>
