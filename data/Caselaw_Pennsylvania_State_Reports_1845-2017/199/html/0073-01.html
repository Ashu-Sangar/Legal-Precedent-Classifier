In such a case where full information was given as to the terms of the lease, it was immaterial that preliminary negotiations preceding and leading up to the offer of the lease were not communicated to the stockholders.</p>

W. Clark &amp; Company, to secure to the latter firm control of the property and franchises of the Reading City Passenger Railway Company for a grossly inadequate consideration and so to cheat and defraud the plaintiff and depreciate the value of his said stock. It then proceeds to detail how this alleged scheme was set going and carried out, averring that Owen submitted to certain stockholders controlling, with himself, a majority of the stock, a proposition from E. W. Clark &amp; Company’s attorney to lease the railway, etc., and procured first their oral assent and next a written agreement, dated November 23,1892, signed by a number of said stockholders, not representing a majority of the stock, pledging them to vote for such lease; all of this being concealed from plaintiff and other stockholders, and the former being told by Owen that the company would keep its railways, convert them into electric roads, <em>etc.; </em>that Owen and his associates procured the passage of an ordinance by the councils of the city of Reading granting the said company the right to make this change, and for the purpose of deceiving plaintiff and other stockholders, called a corporate meeting on March 16,1893, to accept the act of March 22,1887, and organized and obtained, after due notice by publication, a charter for a new corporation, the Reading Traction Company, which thereupon entered into and became a party to the alleged <em>conspiracy; </em>that Owen and his associates called a meeting of the Reading City Passenger Railway Company for March 27, 1893, to vote on a proposition to lease the railway, etc., to the said Reading Traction Company, and sent to the stockholders requests for and obtained nearly all their proxies authorizing Owen to vote their shares upon that proposition which was thus carried; that Owen concealed from them a more advantageous offer for the purchase of the railway, etc., and that he and his coincorporators of the Reading Traction Company had secretly, on March 13,1893, transferred the entire stock of that company to E. W. Clark &amp; Company, who thereupon increased the same from 1100,000 to SI,000,000 and issued 1900,000 thereof to themselves as a consideration for the agreement of November 23, 1892. Finally it avers that the property and franchises of the <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>Reading City Passenger Railway Company were worth, subject to all the covenants and stipulations contained in the lease to the Reading Traction Company, §1,000,000 and could have been readily disposed of for that sum, and that thus the defendants’ alleged acts have injured him to the amount of §30,000 in depreciating the value of his stock.</p>
