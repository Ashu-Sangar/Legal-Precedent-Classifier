While the work under this contract was progressing, the lines and grades of Pennsylvania avenue having been revised so as to involve a change of grade and a widening on both sides of the avenue, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets—that portion of the highway embraced within the plaintiffs’ contract—a road jury was appointed to assess damages to property occasioned by the change <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>of grade of Pennsylvania avenue. Before this jury a number of claimants—amongst them, Annie E. Stork—presented claims for damages to their respective properties, resulting not from the actual taking of the land, but from injuries consequent upon the construction of the retaining wall of the subway. The city notified the plaintiffs of the presentation of these claims. The jury awarded an aggregate of $10,115 to the claimants. The plaintiffs afterwards completed their work under the contract and sought a final settlement, but the director of public works retained the sum mentioned, asserting the right under the contract to do this until satisfactory evidence should be furnished him that the awards of the road jury had been settled. Plaintiffs thereupon brought this action to recover the amount so retained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[184,1031,1180,668]]]'>The awards of the road jury have not been settled. The city of Philadelphia took appeals therefrom, some of which are still pending. In the matter of the appeal from the award to Annie E. Stork, the case was tried in court of common pleas No. 4, of this county, and a verdict and judgment rendered for the claimant, from which the city appealed. The Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Mitchelu delivering the opinion, sustained the city’s appeal and reversed the judgment. The ground of reversal is that “ the injury complained of was not the necessary consequence of the improvement authorized and undertaken by the city.” “ The liability declared upon, therefore, arose if at all from negligence, and could not be enforced in this form of proceeding : ” Stork v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/195/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="195 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="914115" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0101-01">195 Pa. 101</a>,108.</p>

He finds that the awards made by the jury of view were a part of the compensation to which property owners were entitled for the right of way taken by the city under the right of eminent domain. In the light of Stork’s case, however, this position is not maintainable, and so much of the report must be amended in conformity with the decision in that case. By his supplemental report the learned referee answers the two questions submitted to him by reporting that there was no evidence presented which warranted a finding that the damage to the properties arose from the negligence of the contractors, and by finding as a fact that the damage was the result of the work done by the contractors, although without negligence on their part. By his original report, the <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>learned referee found as a fact that “ there was no evidence offered before the referee to prove that the work under the contract was not performed according to its terms in the ordinary and customary manner under the immediate supervision of the director of the department of public works and his authorized assistants and in accordance with the instructions of the city’s chief engineer or his authorized assistant, and there was no proof of negligence on the part of the plaintiffs or their agents.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[191,704,1175,201]]]'>“ Section 32.

Even a literal interpreration of the language, broad as it is, will not bear this construction, for, if the section were intended to be so all-embracing in its scope, the words “ by or from the contractors, his agents or servants ” would have been omitted: a purpose to include all such damages or injuries without exception being completely expressed without them. Those words are used to limit the universality of the provision and to confine it to those cases where the damage or injury is given or inflicted “ by or from the contractors, his agents or servants, in performance of the work,” that is to say, where through unskilfulness or carelessness or negligence or disobedience of orders the responsibility for the damage or injury rests fairly and properly with the contractor. This is the evident meaning of the contracting parties : to hold that it was their intention, by these clauses of the contracts, to bind the contractor to strictly follow, without delay, all orders or in<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>struetions from the city’s engineers, and yet to take upon himself the consequences of all the mistakes, errors and negligences of which those officials might be guilty, consequences which might result in a total of damages exceeding many times over the entire value of the contract, would be to make an interpretation repugnant to reason and to natural justice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[267,657,1187,1081]]]'>At the argument attention was called to section 13 of the specifications, entitled “ Responsibility for risks and damages,” in which the contractor is required to assume responsibility “ for loss or injury to persons or property arising out of the nature of the work,” that is, as it is argued, in the very cause found by the supplemental report of the referee. In my judgment, however, this section affords no aid whatever in deciding the question before me, first, because section 12 is the only section having reference to the retention of moneys, and if the matters specified in section 13 had any connection with those mentioned in section 12, they would have been incorporated therewith and not embodied in a distinct section; second, because, as already stated, interpretation cannot be safely made upon a phrase, a part of one general sentence isolated from its context and taken with absolute adherence to the letter; third, because the section, taken in connection with the other sections herein quoted, clearly refers to such matters and occurrences only as are casual, accidental and unusual in character. Reference to this section, therefore, is only made to prevent a possible inference that it has been overlooked or forgotten in considering the question at issue.</p>

The judgment entered in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant, together with lawful interest thereon from November 1, 1898, to the date of the entry of the judgment, amounted to $11,306.87, less one half of the fee of the referee to be paid by the plaintiffs in accordance with the stipulation of the agreement of reference.
