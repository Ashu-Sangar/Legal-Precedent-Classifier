In the summer of 1896 this bridge across the Loyalsock became in such a state of dilapidation, and the abutments were so cracked and dangerous, that the county commissioners undertook to replace the old wooden structure by a new iron bridge, and so took down the old superstructure and closed up the road on either side of the bridge, or the place where the bridge had been. Owing to the banks of the creek at and near the place where the bridge had been, it was impossible for any one to attempt even to reach the creek, with any kind of a vehicle, near the site of the bridge. The county commissioners, or at least some of them, went up the creek some forty rods and cleared out and opened up an old <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>ford road, that had been used some other time when the bridge was out of repair, or at its former construction.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b619-6" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[143,616,1181,1392]]]'>The plaintiff resided at Thorndale, and upon the day the accident happened, had driven from Thorndale to Dushore across the creek over this route opened by the county commissioners. And in returning in the afternoon, with two horses and light buckboard wagon, upon which he was riding, along with a lady passenger, together with some groceries and provisions, in descending the hill leading from the main public road to the fordway, it being some eight to twelve rods from the public road to the creek along the route opened by the commissioners, the neck yoke strap, or the leather strap on the neck yoke, through which the wagon tongue, or pole, passes, and which is the only means provided in light wagons for holding back the wagon, broke, allowing the wagon to run against the team; and in attempting to hold the wagon back off from the horses, by catching one of the wheels, the plaintiff injured the muscles of his arm, and perhaps received other injuries. The character of the injuries is not so material to this issue. From the evidence, it appears that this road, opened by the commissioners, leaves the public road near the bridge, on the Laporte side of the creek, going along up the creek bank in an old road leading to a grist and sawmill, for some thirty or more rods, then crosses the creek; coming out upon the Dushore side of the creek, it is opened for a distance of some eight to twelve rods from the creek to the public road, where it intersects the public road some forty rods or more from the bridge. The road between the public road and creek on the Dushore side of the creek is exceedingly steep, crooked and dangerous.</p>

There is no law authorizing the county commissioners to construct this road around the bridge and open it up for public travel, and that in so doing they could not bind the county <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>either for the work put upon it or for any injuries received by persons in attempting to pass over the road.</p>

It is very true that the evidence does show that the road where the accident happened was exceedingly, even dangerously, steep, and very crooked, having abrupt turns, or short curves, in the steepest portion of the road, thereby adding to the danger in traveling, especially in descending the hill. It is also equally true that the plaintiff was fully acquainted with the condition of the road, and that he was a man of judgment and an expert teamster. We cannot, however, in view of the fact of this being the only route between Thorndale and Dushore, say that plaintiff was guilty of negligence in attempting to pass over it at all. We feel it is for the jury to say, under all the circumstances in the case, considering the necessities the plaintiff was under to go to Dushore and return, whether his necessities were such as would justify the risk in attempting to pass over this road.</p>

In other words, the very foundation of the action is negligence. And it is incumbent upon the plaintiff to establish that the injury was received upon such a highway as the municipality against which the suit is brought was legally bound to keep in repair, and that it was through the negligence of the officers thereof, in not performing the legal duties devolving upon them, that the injury was sustained. This action, however, is not brought against the township of Laporte, but against the county of Sullivan, and we must consider the authority of the county commissioners to open, maintain and keep in repair the public roads and bridges of the county. The duties of county commissioners are entirely statutory. They have just such powers and authority as the statute confers upon them, and no more.</p>

We do not deem it necessary in this case to go over the various acts of assembly, giving the different acts conferring duties upon county commissioners in regard to bridges (there are no acts conferring any authority upon county commissioners in regard to the roads other than bridges and their <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>approaches), but shall content ourselves, rather, with giving the substance of the various statutes upon the subject. And that is, to erect and maintain such bridges, including the artificial approaches necessary to be constructed in order to use the bridge, as are declared county bridges, after the same have been located and recommended, by viewers appointed by the court of quarter sessions of the county, and approved by the court, the grand jury and commissioners of the county. Their whole authority consists in constructing and maintaining the bridge, including the approaches, at the point laid out by the viewers and approved by the court, grand jury and commissioners. Outside of this they have no more authority over the roads in the county than any other citizen of the county.</p>

As, for instance, where supervisors employed workmen to change a public road, the court allowed these employees of the supervisors to maintain an action against the township for their pay, because the supervisors had general charge of the roads of the township, and workmen employed by the supervisors were not required to inquire whether the supervisors were opening the road upon the proper route or not. They were agents for the township, and within the line of their supposed authority as officers of the township. The township could, however, surcharge the supervisors with the amount. For the same reason a person who rented a house to the county commissioners for use of a county officer was allowed to recover against the county. In the case before us there is nothing to indicate that the county commissioners were acting within the general scope of the authority conferred upon them. No law authorized the county commissioners to construct roads or change the route of public roads. And the plaintiff cannot set <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>up that he supposed the county commissioners had authority to make the change in the public road, as they did attempt to make temporarily, because every one is supposed to know the law.</p>
