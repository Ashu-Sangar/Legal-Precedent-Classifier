    <p class="summary" id="b188-9" data-blocks='[["BL_188.8",188,[276,1129,1186,1066]]]'>' This item makes an appropriation of $5,500,000 annually for the support of the public schools of the commonwealth. The constitution of 1874 provides that not less than $1,000,000 annually shall be appropriated for the support of the public schools of the state. The minimum amount -fixed by the new constitution was the maximum of legislative generosity from 1874 down to and including 1887 ; in other words, the legislature, for a period of thirteen years after the adoption of the new constitution, appropriated to the common schools the sum of $1,000,000 annually. Prior to 1874 the annual appropriation to the common schools was very much less than the minimum amount fixed in the constitution. In the early days of our system of popular education the common schools were supported almost entirely by local taxation. It was the thought of the early advocates of the public school system that the schools should be supported by the districts in which they were located, and that the people would have greater interest in them if taxed for that purpose. As the great business and material interests of the state developed it was deemed advantageous to the school system to make more liberal appropriations out of the state revenues.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b188-10" data-blocks='[["BL_188.9",188,[278,2212,1183,200]],["BL_189.1",189,[176,349,1181,1030]]]'>In 1887 an agitation was started that resulted in increasing the annual appropriation to $1,500,000, and for the two years following the public schools of the state received that amount each year. In 1889 the legislature increased the appropriation <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>to $2,000,000 annually, and this was the amount of aid extended by the state to the public schools for the two years following that session. Being so successful in having the appropriations for this purpose increased, the friends of our common schools continued the agitation during the session of 1891, with the result of increasing the annual amount set apart for school purposes to the princely sum of $5,000,000. This is a larger amount than is appropriated by any other state in our great country for the support of common schools, and it was very generally supposed that no further attempt to increase it would be made. In 1893, however, a bill was introduced into the legislature which authorized and required directors to furnish free text-books to the pupils in our common schools. At that time a very large number of the districts throughout the state did not provide free text-books for the pupils. The introduction of free text-books necessarily involved the expenditure of large sums of money, and the friends of this measure succeeded in securing an additional $500,000 for this purpose. Following these precedents each succeeding legislature has appropriated $5,500,000 annually for the support of the common schools.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[178,1388,1179,767]]]'>It must not be forgotten in this connection that the appropriation of $5,500,000 does not include the appropriations made for the maintenance and support of our orphan schools, normal schools, the expenses incident to the support of the department of public instruction, the payment of the salaries of county superintendents, and the appropriations made from time to time to other worthy educational institutions. Adding the appropriations made for the purposes last enumerated to the annual appropriation for the support of the common schools, we find that more than $6,000,000 are paid out of the state treasury each year in support of the cause of education. When we take into consideration the fact that the net revenues of the state amount to little more than $11,000,000 each year, it will be readily seen how generous the state has been in dealing with the school question.</p>

I am proud of our common school system and in hearty sympathy with every movement that has for its purpose the betterment of our schools. If a large deficit did not already exist in our treasury on account of these appropriations, and if the anticipated revenues of the state would justify their continuance, I should most cheerfully give my approval to this section of the general appropriation bill. I cordially commend the intelligent purpose and patriotic devotion of our citizens to the common schools of the state, but every honest man must concede that it is impossible for the state to give away more money than it receives, no matter how worthy the purpose for which the money is expended. It is absolutely necessary to reduce the appropriations made by the legislature, and it has seemed to me that, since free text-books have already been provided and paid for out of the general appropriations made since 1893, the annual appropriations could be reduced $500,000 a year without doing any injustice to the schools.</p>

I urged this both privately and publicly upon different occasions, but the legislature has adjourned without providing any additional revenue, except possibly an increase estimated at $200,000 per annum after the first year under the new mercantile tax law. The appropriations made will amount to as much as, if not more than, the estimated revenues of the next two years. On June 1—but a few weeks hence—the whole appropriation of $5,500,000 for the year ending at that time will be due, no part of which has as yet been paid. At that time there will not be $1,000,000 in the treasury to meet this obligation. In view of this financial condition it seems to me unwise to accumulate one appropriation upon another when there are no funds with which to pay them. I have carefully examined the general appropriation bill, as well as other appropriation bills, and have in every instance withheld my approval from items where I felt justified in so doing. In this way I have reduced the appropriations made <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>by the legislature and withheld my approval of bills amounting in round numbers to $500,000. It is my earnest desire to pay the obligations of the state which have been heretofore made, and which it is honorably bound to pay, to relieve the present embarrassment of the treasury, and preserve the credit of the state. No fair-minded and impartial citizen will justify me in approving appropriation bills in excess of the unpaid appropriations made by prior legislatures and the estimated revenues of the state for the two fiscal years next following. During the four years for which the people have honored me with the executive office I hope, by economy and care, even in the absence of additional revenue, to see these unpaid appropriations liquidated and the state placed upon a sound financial basis. A state, like an individual, cannot continue to pay out year by year more money than it receives and remain in a solvent condition. My purpose is to pay all appropriations made by the present legislature which receive executive approval and liquidate at least $1,500,000 of the obligations remaining from former legislatures during the next two years. In order to do this I am compelled to reduce the appropriation to the common schools $500,000 a year, amounting to $1,000,000 in two years, which, added to the $500,000 obtained by reducing other appropriations of the legislature of 1899, will enable the auditor general and state treasurer to reduce what would be called the floating debt $1,500,000 during the next two years. In my judgment the state should pay its pre-existing debts, incurred under the sanction and authority of law, before it assumes new burdens which it is impossible to pay.</p>

The legislature in framing and passing a bill had full control over every subject and every provision that it contained, and the governor as a co-ordinate branch of the lawmaking power, was entitled to at least a negative of the same extent. But by joining a number of different subjects in one bill, the governor was put under compulsion to accept some enactments that he could not approve, or to defeat the whole, <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>including others that he thought desirable or even necessary. Such bills, popularly called “ omnibus ” bills, became a crying evil, not only from the confusion and distraction of the legislative mind by the jumbling together of incongruous subjects, but still more by the facility they afforded to corrupt combinations of minorities with different interests to force the passage of bills with provisions which could never succeed if they stood on their separate merits. So common was this practice that it got a popular name, universally understood as log rolling. A still more objectionable practice grew up of putting what is known as a “ rider,” that is a new and unrelated enactment or provision on the appropriation bills, and thus coercing the executive to approve obnoxious legislation or bring the wheels of the government to a stop for want of funds.</p>

Omnibus bills were done away with by the amendment of 1864 that no bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in the title. But this amendment excepted appropriation bills, and as to them the evil still remained. The convenience if not the necessity of permitting a general appropriation bill containing items so diverse as to be fairly within the description of different subjects was patent. The present constitution meets this difficulty first, by including all bills in the prohibition of containing more than one subject except “ general appropriation bills ” (article 3, section 3) ; secondly by the provision that “the general appropriation bill shall embrace nothing but appropriations for the ordinary expenses of the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the commonwealth, interest on the public debt, and for public schools; all other appropriations shall be made by separate bills each embracing but one subject” (article 3, section 15); and thirdly, by the grant to the governor of “ power to disapprove of any item .or items of any bill making appropriations of money, embracing distinct items, and the part or parts of the bill approved shall be the law, and the item or items of appropriation disapproved shall be void, unless repassed according to the rules and limitations prescribed for the passage of other bills over the' executive veto: ” Article 4, section 16.</p>

By section 15 of the same article a bill can only be passed over a veto by a vote of two thirds of all the members elected to each house, instead of two thirds of a quorum voting as under the constitution of 1838. “ The power,” says Mr. Buckalew, “ has been tried and not found wanting; it has won popular confidence in a high degree, and is now justly regarded as an indispensable feature of American constitutions.

The general idea conveyed by the word is well understood and with that in our minds the precise meaning in the constitution is shown by the context to be the particulars, the details, the distinct and severable parts of the appropriation. The language is “ the governor shall have power to disapprove of any item or items .... and the part or parts of the bill approved shall be the law, and the item or items of the appropriation disapproved shall be void,” etc. It is clear that “ item ” and <em>“ </em>part ” are here used interchangeably in the same sense. If any special or different meaning was attached to the word “ item ” the natural mode of expression would have been to use that word throughout the section, but for the sake of euphony and to avoid the repetition of the same words three times in the same sentence, the draughtsman used the word “parts” as an evident synonym. This is also apparent from the plain purpose of the section. In ordinary bills the single subject is a unit which admits of approval or disapproval as a whole, without serious inconvenience, even though some of the details may not be acceptable. But every appropriation, though it be for a single purpose, necessarily presents two considera<a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>tions almost equally material, namely, the subject and the amount. The subject may be approved on its merits, and yet the amount disapproved as out of proportion to the requirements of the case, or as beyond the prudent use of the state’s income. The legislature had full control of the appropriation in both its aspects and the plain intent of this section was to give the governor the same control as to disapproval, over each subject and each amount. A contrary construction would destroy the usefulness of the constitutional provision. If the legislature by putting purpose, subject and amount inseparably together and calling them an item, can coerce the governor to approve the whole or none, then the old evil is revived which this section was intended to destroy. No better illustration is needed than is afforded by the ease in hand. Section 8 of the act of May 13, 1899, appropriated for the public schools $11,000,000 for the two years of 1899 and 1900, provided that “ out of the amount received by the city of Philadelphia there shall be paid the sum of three thousand dollars to the Teachers’ Institute of said city; the sum of three thousand dollars to the Philadelphia School of Design for Women for their corporate purposes, and the sum of ten thousand dollars to the Teachers’ Annuity and Aid Association of said city,” etc. In this portion of the section alone there are included four distinct and severable parts, each of which is an “ item ” within the purpose, intent and meaning of the constitutional provision under consideration, namely the public schools, the Teachers’ Institute, the School of Design for Women and the Teachers’ Annuity and Aid Association. The public schools being objects of appropriation by the express mandate of the constitution, the only question before the governor as to them was the amount, but the other three items presented the double consideration of the beneficiary and the amount. On each of these matters, quoting again the language of Judge Cooley, supra, “ the questions presented to the mind of the executive are precisely the same as those the two houses (of Congress) must determine in passing a bill; whether the proposed law is necessary or expedient, whether it is constitutional, whether it is so framed as to accomplish its intent, and so on, are questions transferred from the two houses to the president (executive) with the bill itself.” On each of these questions therefore the governor was entitled <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>to exercise his legislative judgment separately, and to approve or disapprove accordingly. Suppose for illustration that instead of the beneficiaries being worthy public institutions the city of Philadelphia had been directed to pay part of its appropriation to a sectarian school in violation of the express prohibition in section 18 of article 3. It would have been the governor’s imperative duty to veto such appropriation, and the legislature could not coerce him by putting him to the alternative of approving it or disapproving the entire section with its constitutional grant to the public schools. Or suppose on the other hand the appropriation had been to one of the institutions named of $1,000,000 or more. The governor might in his legislative judgment have approved the beneficiary as a proper object of state aid, but have found the amount excessive. He was entitled to approve as to the object, and to disapprove as to a portion of the amount. That is what he has done in the present case, and his action was within his constitutional powers.</p>

This, the appellants claim, prevents the governor from exercising his veto power at all against appropriations for the public schools. But this argument entirely ignores the constitutional requirement that “ every bill ” shall be submitted for the governor’s approval. The constitution makes no exception of school bills or any other, and such exception would permit easy and clear violation of the prohibition in section 4 of article 9, against the creation of a state debt exceeding $1,000,000 in the aggregate at any one time, to supply deficiencies in revenue. Suppose the legislature should appropriate a sum for school purposes exceeding by more than $1,000,000 the entire revenue of the state. It would be the governor’s duty to veto it to prevent the creation of a prohibited debt. And even if the appropriation for schools was only the constitutional $1,000,000, yet if that would increase an already existing debt from deficiency of revenue beyond the prohibited limit, there would at once be an inevitable conflict between two express provisions of the constitution, and it would become the <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>governor’s duty to exercise his legislative judgment which was of the lesser importance and should give way.

If the disapproval of part and the approval of the rest were not valid acts, then there was no appropriation at all, and the money already received by the schools was illegally paid. For there was no executive approval of an appropriation of $11,000,000. There are but three ways in which a bill can become law in this state, passage by the legislature, and approval by the governor, passage by the legislature, disapproval by the governor, and passage again in the mode prescribed by the constitution, or passage by the legislature and failure of the governor to return it with his objections within the required time.

Repr. 165, arose in Arizona where the governor has no power to veto single items of a bill, and the question therefore was the same as it would have been here under the old constitution. In Mississippi the governor has power to veto parts of appropriations. Under this power the governor approved the whole appropriation, but vetoed certain conditions appended to it. In State v.

But they all rest on the same principle, the right of the governor in the exercise of his independent legislative judgment to approve an appropriation in part, by reducing the amount fixed by the legislature. As to that principle the executive practice must be considered as settled. While the executive interpretation of his own powers is not binding on the judiciary, it has always been considered as persuasive and entitled to great respect. And where as in this instance the practice has been frequent and acquiesced in without objection for a number of years, it should be very clearly shown to be unconstitutional to justify the courts in declaring against it.</p>

The right of a party admitted by an act of grace to be heard as amicus curise, thus to attempt to set aside the formal agreement of the legal parties is not conceded, but as the question of jurisdiction is always open, it is proper that it should receive consideration even when brought forward in this irregular way.</p>

Objections to jurisdiction are of two classes between which there is a clear and well settled distinction, first those relating to the authority of the court over the subject-matter, and secondly those relating to its authority over parties. Objections of the first class cannot be waived nor jurisdiction obtained by acquiescence. Thus if the writ of mandamus had issued from the quarter sessions or the orphans’ court, the proceeding would be void ab initio for defect of authority in the court to issue such process and determine such controversies. It is of this class that it is commonly said that consent cannot give jurisdiction. But in the second class the rule is different. The <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>party exempt from jurisdiction may waive his personal privilege, and if he does so the jurisdiction of the court is complete. Thus if the defendant is not duly served with process, or is a nonresident beyond the reach of process, or if served while temporarily exempt as a juror or party or witness, or member of the legislature, the proceeding as to him will be void or voidable on showing the facts.

L. 626, sec. 18, the courts of common pleas within their respective counties were invested with “ like power with the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus to all officers and magistrates elected or appointed in or for the respective county, or in or for any township, district or place within such county, and to all corporations being or having their chief place of business within such county.” The jurisdiction thus granted to the common pleas was a common-law jurisdiction to be exercised according to common-law practice. But state officers not being among the subjects specifically enumerated in the grant, it is argued that no such writ can be issued to them. So far as it is a compulsory process this must be admitted, but it does not follow that it may not issue or become effective by consent. A writ against a nonresident as a compulsory writ is inoperative, not because the court has no authority to issue it, but because the person against whom it is issued is exempt from its operation. And the objection to the writ against a state officer belongs to the same class. The writ of mandamus itself is one which the court has full power to issue, but a state officer is exempt from its operation. This is a personal or official exemption, the manifest purpose of which was to protect a state officer from being taken away or interfered with in his official duties at the seat of government, <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>to answer the local courts throughout the state. He is exempt for the convenience of the public business. But if the convenience of getting a decision on a question of public importance outweighs the inconvenience of going to a local court for it, there is nothing in the statute or in the public policy on which it is founded, to prevent the officer from so doing, and of such convenience the officer himself must be the judge. We are of the opinion that the objection now made relates not to the authority of the court over the subject-matter, but only to the privilege, personal or official, of the defendant.

Where there is no jurisdiction there is no authority to pronounce judgment, and consequently a judgment so entered is so but in form and similitude, and has no substance, force or authority.” The powers conferred upon a court are those given it by the constitution, by the common law or by statute. When its authority is not supported from either source, it is the duty of the appellate court to so declare. It is well settled in this state <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>that want of jurisdiction in a court may be taken at any time: Stearly’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Grant%20270" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="8 Grant 270">8 Grant, 270</a>; Musselman’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/101/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="101 Pa. 165" data-case-ids="500957" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0165-01">101 Pa. 165</a>. It is never too late to attack a judgment for want of jurisdiction: Fowler v. Eddy, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20Pa.%20120" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="110 Pa. 120">110 Pa. 120</a>. The reason for this is that the action of a court wanting jurisdiction is without effect and wholly void. The judgment of the court below being void, it is the duty of this court upon its own motion or on the suggestion of an amicus curia; to determine the question. “ It is not matter of an adversary nature,” says Mr. Justice Foster in Olmstead’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20Conn.%20114" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="43 Conn. 114">43 Conn. 114</a>, “ to be regarded with disfavor, like a dilatory plea. It is for the interest of the court, and must be the desire of the court, to know as early as possible that it has no jurisdiction, if such be the fact. If the information does not come early, it must not be rejected if it comes late. Whenever and however it comes, it should be received as the suggestion of an amicus curia;, and the proper legal action promptly taken. . . . When once before that tribunal (Superior Court), no matter by what door they gain admission, the jurisdiction of the court must always be a legitimate subject of inquiry. The suitors can come in by no door which shuts off inquiry into the jurisdiction.” In Lansing v. Chicago, etc., Railway Co., <a href="/iowa/85/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="85 Iowa 215" data-case-ids="8647328" data-case-paths="/iowa/85/0215-01">85 Iowa, 215</a>, Mr. Justice Rothrook, speaking for the court, says: “ But it is a familiar rule of practice that the jurisdiction of a court may be challenged at any time in the progress of the cause, and, if not raised by the parties, courts will take notice of questions of jurisdiction. . . . The impropriety of determining any question without jurisdiction is manifest.” Mr. Justice Dorsey, in Berrett v. Oliver, 7 Gill. &amp; J. 191, delivering the opinion of the court of appeals of Maryland, says: “ Against the influence of such a defect (want of jurisdiction), you cannot shut your eyes, whether the defendant rely upon it as a defense, in his answer, by plea, or on demurrer, or not. It is a matter of law of which the court must judicially take notice. It admonishes them not to proceed in the trial: that they have no jurisdiction over the subject-matter thus illegally attempted to be brought before them!”</p>

The jurisdiction of the courts of Pennsylvania to issue the writ of mandamus is conferred by constitutional and legislative authority. The Supreme Court was established and its powers conferred by the Act of May 22, 1722, 1 Smith’s Laws, 112. The 11th section of the act required the courts to be holden twice in every year at Philadelphia, fixed the number of judges at three and conferred upon them “ full power and authority, by virtue of this act, when and as often as there may be occasion, to issue forth writs of habeas corpus, certiorari and writs of error, and all remedial and other writs and process, returnable to the said court, and grantable by the said judges by virtue of their office, in pursuance of the powers and authorities hereby given them.” The 18th section of the act conferred criminal and appellate jurisdiction on the judges and then provided that they “ generally shall minister justice to all persons, and exercise the jurisdictions and powers hereby granted concerning all and singular the premises according to law, as fully and amply, to all intents and purposes whatsoever as the justices of the courts of king’s bench, common pleas and exchequer' at Westminster, or any of them, may or can do.” The 1st section of the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 785, confers appellate jurisdiction oh the Supreme Court, and the 7th section provides that “ the judges of the Supreme Court shall have, full power and authority when and as often as there may be oc<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>casion, to issue writs of habeas corpus, writs of certiorari and writs of error, and all remedial and other writs and processes returnable to said court.”</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[231,510,1183,1805]]]'>Mandamus was a high prerogative writ and in England was issued only out of the court of king’s bench. Blackstone (3 Comm. 110) says that the “ writ of mandamus is, in general, a command issuing in the king’s name from the court of king’s bench, and directed to any person, corporation, or inferior court of judicature within the king’s dominion, requiring them to do some particular thing therein specified, which appertains to their office and duty, and which the court of king’s bench has previously determined, or at least supposes, to be consonant to right and justice.” The authority of the king’s bench in this respect was conferred upon the Supreme Court of this state: Commonwealth v. Commissioners of Lancaster County, <a href="/binn/6/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="6 Binn. 5" data-case-ids="1795101" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0005-01">6 Binn. 5</a>; Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.

No inferior tribunal could exercise jurisdiction in such cases. The courts of common pleas of the state were without authority to issue the writ: Commonwealth v. Commissioners, supra. In that case, Mr. Justice BeaCicbneidge said: “No subordinate court under the judicial system of this state ever had any power to issue a writ of mandamus.” Recognizing this lack of jurisdiction in the courts of common pleas and having a desire to remedy it to a certain extent, the legislature passed the Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 626, the 18th section of which provides as follows : “ The several courts of common pleas, the president judge being present, shall, within their respective counties, have the like power with the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus to all officers and magistrates, elected or appointed in or for the respective county, or in or for any township, district or place within such county, and to all corporations being or having their chief place of business within such county.” The authority of the courts of common pleas to issue writs of mandamus was limited to the cases enumerated in the act. This was expressly so decided in Wolf v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/64/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="64 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1021238" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0252-01">64 Pa. 252</a>, and in Commonwealth v.

Hence this jurisdiction was still confined to the Supreme Court and it alone could exercise the jurisdiction. The act of 1836 continued in force until 1893. Section 1 of the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 345, practically re-enacts the act of 1836, and in addition contains the following clause: “ And the court of common pleas of the county in which the seat of government is or may be located shall have the power, and it shall be required, to issue the writ of mandamus to the lieutenant governor, secretary of the commonwealth, attorney general, secretary of internal affairs, superintendent of public instruction, state treasurer, auditor general, insurance commissioner, and commissioners of the sinking fund.” This act, therefore, was the first to confer upon any court of common pleas of the commonwealth jurisdiction to issue the writ of mandamus to a state official. Until its enactment,' no authority was vested in any court of common pleas to issue the writ to a state officer: Commonwealth v. Wickersham, supra. In that case an application was made to the court of common pleas of .Dauphin county in 1879 for a mandamus against the superintendent of public instruction. Judge Peauson in the court below held that there was no jurisdiction in the common pleas of Dauphin county to issue the writ under the general act of June 14, 1836, or the special act of April 7, 1870, and in discussing the question of jurisdiction under the act of 1836, said: “ By the common law the writ of mandamus was looked upon as a high prerogative writ, which could be issued out of the court of king’s bench alone, where the king was originally supposed to be sitting in person. The power to issue it did not exist in any inferior tribunal, and generally it was only allowed to prevent a failure of justice when the relator had no other legal remedy or one attended with great delay. By an early statute, act of May 22,1722, the Supreme Court of this state was authorized to administer justice as fully and amply, to all intents and purposes whatsoever, as the justice of the court of king’s bench, common pleas and exchequer at Westminster, or any of them, may or can do. That law continued in force, and the process of that court to run throughout the state to secure justice to all men until the convention for forming a new constitution, in the plenitude of its wisdom, abrogated the power altogether without conferring it on any other tribunal. The 3d section of the 5th article gives <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>authority to issue writs of mandamus to all inferior courts, but takes away original jurisdiction in all other cases. See Butler v. Hartranft, Governor of Penna., 27 P. F. Smith, 154. No inconvenience was ever felt from the exercise of the power by the Supreme Court. We never heard of its abuse. The courts of common pleas in the state never were authorized to issue the high prerogative writ of mandamus until it was conferred in a very limited form by the 18th section of the act of June 14, 1836, which declares that they shall, within their respective counties, have the like power with the Supremo Court to issue writs of mandamus to all officers and magistrates elected or appointed in or for the respective county, or in or for any township, district or place within such county, and to all corporations being or having their chief place of business within such county. It is in these cases and over these persons and corporations alone that the courts of common pleas have jurisdiction.” The case having been removed to the Supreme Court, that court said: “ Upon the question of the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas of Dauphin county to issue a mandamus to a state officer, we adopt the opinion of the learned president of the court below.” The court not only approved Judge Pearson's conclusion, but adopted his opinion as the opinion of this court. It was, therefore, explicitly decided by this court that prior to the act of June 14, 1836, the courts of common pleas of the state were never authorized to issue the writ of mandamus, and that under the act said courts had jurisdiction to issue the writ only in the cases, and to the persons and corporations, therein named. Subsequent to the adoption of the constitution of 1873 and prior to the act of 1893.no court in the state had original jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to a state officer.</p>

As we have seen, under the decisions of this court, the courts of common pleas of the state have no general jurisdiction of the subject-matter and that whatever authority they possess was conferred upon them by statute. The counsel for the parties attempted to give jurisdiction to the court of common pleas of Centre county by an <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>agreement “ that all questions of jurisdiction and other technical defenses shall be waived.” It is evident that they doubted the authority of that court to issue the writ and hence they sought to confer jurisdiction by consent. This, of course, was necessarily abortive. As the court had no general jurisdiction of the subject, it should have occurred to them that they were powerless to grant jurisdiction of this cause by consent. This is elementary law and is supported both by reason and authority. The decisions of this court supporting the principle are numerous, among which may be mentioned: Morrison v. Weaver, 4 S. &amp; R. 190; Stoy v. Yost, 12 S. &amp; R. 385; Collins v.

The act of 1893 empowering the court of common pleas in which the seat of government is situated, to issue the writ to state officers, like many similar statutes, was intended to make a certain class of important litigation exclusively cognizable by the court of common pleas exercising jurisdiction in the district in which the state capital is situated, and to protect the state officials from the annoyance and inconvenience of being compelled to respond with the records of their offices to writs issued in other and remote jurisdictions. The wisdom of such legislation must be conceded. For the additional duties imposed upon the judges of that court, extra compensation is provided in their salaries. As the attorney general is the legal adviser of the executive department, we must assume that he was familiar with-the statutes enacted specially for the benefit and convenience of its officials. It is, therefore, not apparent why he left the jurisdiction of a court, created for these purposes, and consented to a determination of the cause by a court with no authority, or at least of doubtful authority, to hear and determine it. If a speedy decision of the question involved was desired, the most favorable opportunity was presented in the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, with two judges on the bench. And this is true regardless of the county where the question first arose. But it is a fact familiar to every one that school districts in all parts of the state were demanding their share of the whole appropriation, and hence there could have <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>been no difficulty in having a test case presented to the judges of Dauphin county at the pleasure of the attorney general. Nor does the reason appear nor the record disclose why the learned judge of the court of common pleas of Centre county entertained jurisdiction of the cause. He, like the attorney general, is presumed to know that his court was without authority over the subject-matter and that the consent of the parties could not confer jurisdiction upon it.</p>

Section 8 is as follows: “ For the support of the public schools of this commonwealth for the two years commencing on the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-nine, the sum of eleven million dollars, to be paid on warrants of the Superintendent of Public Instruction in favor of the several school districts of the Commonwealth: Provided, that the city of Philadelphia shall be entitled to a proper portion of this ap<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>propriation, and out of the amount received by the city of Philadelphia there shall be paid the sum of three thousand dollars to the Teachers’ Institute of said city, the sum of three thousand dollars to the Philadelphia School of Design for Women for their corporate purposes, and the sum of ten thousand dollars to the Teachers’ Annuity and Aid Association of said city: Provided further, that warrants for the above, and all other unpaid appropriations for common school purposes, shall be issued in amounts designated by the state treasurer, and whenever he shall notify the superintendent of public instruction, in writing, that there are sufficient funds in the state treasury to pay the same.” After having approved the general appropriation bill the governor excepted therefrom certain items, one of which was the item in section 8, and disposed of it as follows : “ I approve of so much of this item which appropriates five million dollars annually, making ten million dollars for the two years beginning June 1, 1899, and withhold my approval from five hundred thousand dollars annually, making one million dollars for the two school years beginning the first day of June, 1899.” The school district at whose instance the writ of mandamus was applied for, denies the authority of the governor to veto a part of this item of 111,000,000, and thereby reduce the sum appropriated by the legislature for the use of the public schools. The question at issue requires the construction of section 16 of article 4 of the constitution quoted above.</p>

It is sufficient to say that the royal prerogative of refusing assent to legislation possessed by the sovereigns of England does not belong to the governor, but only such portion of it as has been specially delegated to him. This is a consequence from the differences existing between feudal sovereignties and governments founded on compacts. There the sovereignty is lodged in the king, here it belongs to the people. There the veto power is inherent in the king as sovereign, here it remains with the people, except such part of it as they in their wisdom may clearly and distinctly grant to the executive. Such authority granted to the governor of Pennsylvania was conferred upon him by the constitution of 18T3 and its extent and nature must be determined by that instrument. Former constitutions of the commonwealth did not contain any provisions similar to those embraced in article 8, section 26 and article 4, section 16. They are new to the organic law of the state. Prior to the adoption of the present constitution, the governor was compelled to approve or disapprove the entire appropriation bill, and could not give his consent to some of the items, and withhold it from others, embraced in the bill. This frequently led to the executive being coerced to approve many unwise and improper appropriations, as public necessity would not permit him to disapprove the whole bill. To remedy this evil, the veto power was extended by section 16 of article 4 so that he might strike out such items of an appropriation as were improper and permit the others to become effective. The section must be construed in the light of the purpose for which it was adopted, and the people did not intend to go further than was necessary to effect that object when they made it a part of the constitution.</p>

(Wis.) 393. In Field v. The People, Chief Justice Wilson, speaking for the court, says : “ In deciding this question (power of the governor), recurrence must be had to the constitution. That furnishes the only rule by which the court can be governed. That is the charter of the governor’s authority. All the powers delegated to him by, or in accordance with, that instrument, he is entitled to exercise, and no others. The constitution is a limitation upon the powers of the legislative department of the government; but it is to be regarded as a grant of powers to the other department. Neither the executive nor the judiciary, therefore, can exercise any authority or power, except such as is clearly granted by the constitution. . . . Upon the principle of our government, that the sovereign power of the state resides in the people, and that only such powers as they have delegated to their functionaries, can be exercised, where a claim of power is advanced by the executive, the question is, not whether the power in question has been granted to the people, but whether it has been granted to the executive; and if the grant cannot be shown, he has no title to the exercise of the power.” “ The right of its exercise (veto power) by an executive,” says Hatch, J., in People v. Board of Aldermen of the City of Buffalo, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20N.Y.S.%2053" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="20 N.Y.S. 53">20 N. Y.

In construing this section it is well to remember the language used by Chief Justice Gibson in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. Coons, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20114" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 114">6 W. &amp; S. 114</a>: “ A constitution is made, not particularly for the inspection of <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>lawyers, but for the inspection of the million, that they may read and discern in it their rights and their duties, and it is consequently expressed in the terms that are most familiar to them. Words, therefore, which do not of themselves denote that they are used in a technical sense, are to have their plain, popular, obvious and natural meaning.” Section 16 confines the use of the veto power to bills making appropriations of money containing more than one item. Such bills are the only ones that may contain “ more than one subject.” As the school appropriation is, by the constitution, required to be embraced in the general appropriation bill, it is “ one subject ” of the many that the bill may contain. This could not be reached by the general veto power conferred on the governor by section 15 of article 4. That would authorize him to veto the whole bill, but not a single item of the bill. He must, therefore, resort to the power given him in section 16. The bill of 1899 “ embraces distinct items,” and therefore this provision of the constitution applies to it. The governor could under this authority disapprove of “ any item or items ” of the bill. By reference to the act it appears that the appropriations made for the several departments of the government, except that for the support of the public schools, are each divided into, and composed of, several items. The executive may, therefore, in his discretion, disapprove one or more of the items in each or all of the several appropriations. The part or parts of the bill composed of entire items, and not the part or parts of entire items, he may approve and thus make them the law. In other words, the executive has authority to select such of the many items contained in a general appropriation bill as he may desire and disapprove them, and the parts of the bill embracing separate and entire items, which he approves, shall be the law. Item, as used in the constitutional provision, signifies a specific sum appropriated to a specific purpose, and not a fractional part of said sum thus appropriated. Such is the plain language of the instrument, and in its interpretation there is no necessity for resorting to any technical rules of construction, or to the exposition of it by former executives. When the language of the constitution is plain it is not within the province of the court to speculate as to the purpose of its framers: 6 Am. &amp; Eng. <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 922.

This, as we have seen, is not the plain, obvious meaning of the language used in the instrument itself. To sustain the position it is argued for the respondent that, unless his construction be given the section, and the executive be thereby permitted to annul its requirements, the governor cannot obey the 4th section of article 9 and keep the appropriations within the revenues of the state. This interpretation may appeal strongly to the lay mind and convince the over-burdened taxpayer that the executive is enforcing the constitution by violating it, but it will find no support in the well established canons of constitutional construction. As was said by the late Chief Justice Gbeen in the very recent case of Commonwealth v. Griest, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20Pa.%20411" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="196 Pa. 411">196 Pa. 411</a>, in speaking of an alleged conflict between two articles of the constitution, “ each one contains all the essentials for its complete enforcement without impinging at all upon the functions of the other. And it follows further that because each of these articles is of equal dignity and of obligatory force with the other, neither can be used to change, alter or overturn the other.” But is such power necessary to prevent the state from becoming involved beyond its revenues ? Clearly not. The executive has the authority to veto the whole of any item of, or an entire bill making, an appropriation. Aside from the school fund, he could therefore have destroyed the entire appropriations if he had so desired and the emergency had required it. But it may be suggested that this would have stopped the wheels of the government, and would have been a violation of the constitution. Concede it. The executive would then have been placed in the position of violating another part of the constitution instead of infringing article 4, section 16. The difference is only as to 'what part of the instrument shall be violated, and in bestowing upon the governor the authority to determine which part of the organic law he will <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>enforce and what part he will annul. Such a construction is not in consonance with any rule in the books.</p>
    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[194,450,1179,1387]]]'>It is contended by the respondent that because the governor may disapprove of a distinct item of an appropriation bill, he may reduce that item to any sum he may desire to approve. The practical operation of such a construction of his veto power would be to annul section 1 of article 2 of the constitution which provides that “the legislative power of this commonwealth shall be vested in a general assembly.” It is well known that most of the appropriation bills are passed upon by the governor after the legislature has adjourned and consequently after it has had an opportunity to repass the bills over his disapproval. He could, therefore, under the authority claimed by respondent, determine the amount of every appropriation by reducing the various items embraced in general appropriation bills. This is solely a legislative function under the constitution which in no form is granted to him in that instrument. It places the legislature in the position of being able to fix the maximum of an appropriation to any object, subject, however, to the will of the governor whether he will permit the members of that body to exercise their judgment as to the amount of the item appropriated. Such was clearly not the intention of the people who adopted the constitution. The executive may, for any reason deemed sufficient by him, deprive the beneficiary of the item appropriated, unless subsequently passed over his veto, but he is not empowered to take from the legislature its constitutional prerogative of fixing the amount of the item to be appropriated. That is purely a legislative, and not an executive, function under the constitution of Pennsylvania.</p>

If this be true, what would the governor do if the $1,000,000 thus constitutionally required to be appropriated should, with other appropriations deemed necessary by the executive, exceed the revenues of the state ? His position seems to me to be illogical. His argument, as we have seen, is that the school appropriation of 1899 must be scaled down in order to keep it within the revenues. He con<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>cedes that he must arrest the scaling process when he arrives at the $1,000,000 point. Why stop there if the appropriations are still in excess of the revenues ? The object to be attained in reducing the appropriations is the same as when the process was begun on the $11,000,000 fund, to wit: to bring it within the revenues as required by section 4 of article 9 of the constitution. He cannot logically stop the reduction until the whole appropriation is wiped out if the condition of the state treasury require it. In other words, the construction he invokes in the case at bar which gives the governor the right to disapprove a part of an item to keep the appropriations within the revenues, necessarily leads to the conclusion that the executive may destroy the entire school fund in order to protect the credit of the state, This is directly antagonistic to the position of. the counsel for the respondent that article 10, section 1 is mandatory on the governor.</p>

It may be that he possesses that power, should the necessities of the occasion require the exercise of it. While I think it is clear that it was the intention of the framers of the constitution that at least $1,000,000 should be annually appropriated for the purpose, yet the language of the section is that “the general assembly .... shall appropriate at least $1,000,000 each year for that purpose,” and not that there shall be appropriated that sum for the purpose. Nothing is said in the section as to what action in regard to the appropriation the executive may, or may not take. His authority in the premises, therefore, must be sought in the other provisions of the instrument. However, I express no opinion as to the proper construction of the section. I may add that the necessity for the executive’s disapproval of the minimum sum thus required to be appropriated is too remote to be seriously' considered. As I have said, he could use his veto on all other appropriations first, and when he had done so, it is practically certain that he would have no occasion to attack the school fund and the constitutional provision which protects it.</p>

Such a condition of affairs can only arise on presumptions wholly unfounded and unwarranted. To justify the executive in vetoing a part of this appropriation he must assume that (a) the expenditures of the government will exceed its revenues, and that (6) the legislature, a co-ordinate and coequal branch of the government, will violate the constitution in making appropriations in excess of the revenues. I do not think it lies with one branch of the government to assume that a co-ordinate branch will violate the organic law of the state. As said by Chief Justice Black in Commonwealth v. Hartman, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Pa.%20119" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="17 Pa. 119">17 Pa. 119</a>, “ a decent respect for a co-ordinate branch of the government compels us to deny that any such danger can ever exist.” It is evident that the framers of the constitution and the people who adopted it never anticipated such a condition of affairs in the state. They presumed that the legislature, like the executive, would perform its constitutional duty. Above all, they never conceived the idea that the appropriations would so far exceed the revenues that the governor could not, by the use of the general veto power conferred by the constitution, bring them within the available funds of the state.</p>

Turning, however, to the respondent’s answer we find in paragraph seven the following: “ The respondent admits that there are sufficient funds in the state treasury to pay said school district its proportionate share of the amount to which it is entitled, whether made upon the basis of $5,000,000 annually or $5,500,000 annually, and he further avers that he is willing to designate the amount due said district on whatever basis the court shall decide it is entitled to receive the same.” This shows that the executive’s anticipation of a depleted treasury was groundless and that there are sufficient funds in the treasury to pay the school district on the basis of the full appropriation made by the legislature. The respondent, therefore, does not deny that he has the funds to comply with the demand of the writ if it is issued. But if the prospective deficiency in the revenues had been realized as anticipated by the governor, the act itself making the appropriation would have protected <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>the treasury from the demands of the school districts of the state, and would have afforded the state treasurer a complete and sufficient answer to this application. The proviso to the appropriation is as follows: “ That warrants for the above, and all other unpaid appropriations for common school purposes, shall be issued in amounts designated by the state treasurer, and whenever he shall notify the superintendent of public instruction, in writing, that there are sufficient funds in the state treasury to pay the same.” The appropriation, therefore, was not payable until the state treasurer notified the superintendent of public instruction that he had sufficient funds for the purpose. Until the money was in the treasury, the state treasurer could, under the proviso to the appropriation act, refuse all demands on him for the appropriation, and could successfully resist official action to compel him to pay it. This application is to require the state treasurer to notify the superintendent of public instruction that he has the funds to enable him to pay the appropriation, and is therefore in accordance with this provision of the act, and was a recognition of its effectiveness by the attorney general when he granted the school district permission to apply in his name for the writ of mandamus-.</p>

A similar reason was unsuccessfully invoked by the present executive and his attorney general in Commonwealth v. Griest, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20Pa.%20411" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="196 Pa. 411">supra,</a> in support of the governor’s right to veto a resolution of the legislature proposing an amendment to the constitution. Deference is accorded the construction of a statute or constitutional provision by the legislative or executive branch of the goverment, but it is only considered in aid of interpretation when the instrument to be construed is itself ambiguous and not free from doubt. When the language is plain and the intent of the provision is clearly deducible, extrinsic circumstances and practical construction are not permitted to have any force in its interpretation: Story on Constitution, sec. 407 ; Cooley’s Constitution Limitation, 84. The rule, therefore, cannot be invoked to aid in the construction of this section of the constitution. I think the section in question is not ambiguous nor susceptible <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>of two interpretations and hence its language is the sole guide to its construction. However, an examination of the veto messages referred to in the respondent’s brief shows that all of them do not support his construction of the constitutional provision in question. Some have no application by reason of dissimilar facts, others suggest necessity as the basis of their action and interpretation, while others distinctly recognize the lack of authority in the executive to disapprove of a part of an item. Such construction is worthless as a precedent to a court of justice in the interpretation of a constitutional provision.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[190,863,1185,1129]]]'>As the result of a consideration of the merits of the contention, I am clearly of the opinion that the executive was without authority to disapprove fl,000,000 of the total appropriation by the legislature for the support of the public schools. The bill having been approved by the governor, and the exception therefrom of a part of the school fund item being void, the entire amount became effective for the purpose for which it was appropriated. The propriety of appropriating such a large sum may be challenged, and the suggestion of the governor that it is “ a larger sum than is appropriated by any other state in our great country ” is doubtless true ; but with these be can have no concern. The people of the commonwealth adopted a constitution authorizing the general assembly to make the appropriation without granting the excutive authority to disapprove a part of it, and with them rests the responsibility for the sum appropriated. From the constitutional provision requiring a minimum sum to be appropriated for the use of the public schools, it is evident that the people regarded the fund so appropriated as sacred, and desired it to be beyond the control of the executive. It is so written in the organic law of the state and no power, judicial or executive, should be permitted to frustrate the clearly expressed object.</p>
