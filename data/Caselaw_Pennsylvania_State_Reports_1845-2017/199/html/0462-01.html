Between the house and Pennsylvania avenue there stood another dwelling house belonging to one Ryan. At the time the injury occurred, P. H. Flynn &amp; Company, independent contractors, were engaged in the construction of the subway on Pennsylvania avenue, and in the prosecution of the work it became necessary to tear down the Ryan house. It appeared that the city retained the right to determine when any underpinning or shoring up of foundations should be done. The city refused to authorize the shoring up of plaintiff’s house, when the excavation was first made, and this resulted in serious damage to the property.</p>

    <p id="b487-11" data-blocks='[["BL_487.12",487,[181,1859,1181,508]]]'>The undisputed evidence shows that the city not only retained the right to determine when any underpinning or shoring up of foundations should be done (such work being the subject of extra compensation to the contractor), but did in fact refuse or neglect to authorize the shoring up of plaintiff’s house when the excavation was first made. This omission was the negligence complained of as the cause of the injury. There was evidence, therefore, on which the case must have gone to the jury, and under the agreement of the parties, the court was right in entering judgment for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b487-12" data-blocks='[["BL_487.13",487,[226,2375,362,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
