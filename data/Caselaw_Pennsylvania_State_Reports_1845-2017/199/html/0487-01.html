The legal estate was given to trustees, upon whom the performance of active duties was carefully and minutely enjoined—duties which required the legal <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>estate to remain in them. A separate use requires no activity of duty on the part of the trustee, and is created, if the beneficiary is married at the time, by any words showing the intention to exclude marital authority or interference (Scott v. Bryan, <a href="/pa/194/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="194 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="912470" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0041-01">194 Pa. 41</a>) ; but the trust, while unnecessary to accomplish this part of the testator’s intention (and he is presumed to know the law on the subject), had a manifest purpose for which it was necessary, viz: the prevention of the coalescence of the life estate with the remainder to heirs. And here, again, it must be presumed that he knew that the separate use would not be efficacious unless his daughter should be married when the will became operative (Neal’s Appeal, 8 Outerb. 214, deciding that the execution of the will was the determining time, could not have been anticipated by him), and protection in that case could only be afforded by preserving the remainder as a distinct estate, not subject to the control of the beneficiary for life. In construing wills, courts are bound to give effect to every word and provision (ut res magis valeat quam pereat), where no rule or policy of the law is violated, and there is no more right in this case to say that the sole purpose of the father in giving to his daughter an equitable life estate was to create a separate use than there was in the case of the son, for whom, of course, a separate use was impossible, the language employed in each case being practically identical. Indeed, the necessity for supporting the trust is stronger in case of the daughter than in case of the son, irrespective of the separate use, since in the former it is expressly provided that “her receipt” for the moneys paid by the trustees shall “be the only discharge therefor”—words which, it would seem, create a spendthrift trust for her protection (Stambaugh’s Estate, 20 Crumr. 585; Winthrop Co. v. Clinton, <a href="/pa/196/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="196 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="916837" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0472-01">196 Pa. 472</a>. See, also, Yaux v. Parke, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 19" data-case-ids="481735" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0019-01">7 W. &amp; S. 19</a>), and this in itself furnishes an unanswerable reason for the separation of the life estate from the remainder : Rife v. Geyer, 9 P. F. Smith, 393. In this view of the case it becomes identical with Wolfinger v. Fell, <a href="/pa/195/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="195 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="914132" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0012-01">195 Pa. 12</a>, 14, where the subject is elaborately considered by the present chief justice.

The precise point was decided in Bacon’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith, 504, in an opinion by Judge <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>Strong, where a trust, with active duties on the part of the trustee, for separate use for life of a daughter, with remainder to her heirs, was held to continue after the death of the daughter’s husband (as it would not have done but for such duties, (Steacy v. Rice, 3 Casey, 75; Koenig’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith, 352, also an opinion by Judge Strong), and the life estate not unite with the remainder to her heirs, the distinction being between a mere dry trust requiring no duties on the part of the trustee after the purpose of the trust has ceased (Yarnall’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith, 335), and a trust for a purpose which continues: Earp’s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith, 119; Ashhurst’s Appeal, 27 P. F. Smith, 464. Utile per inutile non vitiatur.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[264,994,1184,817]]]'>But the plain words of the will are all that is required to show that the creation of the trust for separate use was not the only, or even the main, purpose of the testator. The trustees are directed to pay to the daughter “ during her natural life, for her sole and separate use,. support and maintenance, and without any control of any husband she may take, and her receipt to be the only discharge therefor.” Thus it will be observed the taking of a husband is spoken of hypothetically and contingently as an event which may or may not happen; any husband she “ may ” take, i. e., “ in case ” she should take; but the payment is to be during the whole of her natural life, and is to be for her “ support and maintenance,” the only discharge therefor during her whole natural life being “ her receipt,” whether she “ take ” a husband or not.

Her will (which showed her own understanding of the interest given by the father) gave, in execution of the power, the estate to a trustee to pay the income to her son in part during his minority, and the whole when he became of age for life— 125,000 of the principal being given to him absolutely at the age of twenty-five years; at his death the residue to his children or issue and widow, in such shares as he should appoint <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>by will, and in default of appointment, to the persons entitled to his estate under the intestate laws. But if he should leave a widow and no issue, then one third to such widow, f1,000 to the Children’s Hospital, $1,000 to the Southern Home for Friendless Children, one half of the residue to her husband and one half to the children of her brother designated in the will in equal shares.</p>

But are the limitations to persons in being in her lifetime, of ascertained portions of the estate, to be regarded as vested, and thus saved from the operation of the rule against remoteness ? If they were given simply in default of the execution of a power conferred upon the prior taker, they would be regarded as vested, subject to being divested, and the gift would be valid: 4 Kent, 204, 324; Perry on Trusts, sec. 250. But where interests are limited, not simply in default of the execution of a power, but on the failure, also, of a prior contingent estate, they are contingent. Thus in a devise to B, who is unmarried, for life, remainder to his children, but if he dies without children, to C (which is precisely this case), both remainders are contingent, though that to B’s children may become vested when a child is born, subject to open and let in afterborn children: Doe v. Perryn, 3 Term Rep. 484; 4 Kent, 205; Woelpper’s Appeal, 11 Crumr. 562. In the present case children of the son, had there been any, could not have taken under the primary appointment to them, because of the rule against perpetuities ; and yet, if the limitation to persons in being were good, the latter would take to the exclusion of the son’s chil<a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>dren, which would he a perversion of the will of the donee, and certainly not in accordance with her intentions.</p>
