Harmon, the defendant here, and that of Ezekiel Hewitt, the deceased. Quite a number of witnesses have testified that as far as their knowledge goes—and they have testified they were acquainted with the reputation of the defendant as being a peaceable and law abiding citizen in the community—that he was a good and orderly man. There are others who have testified that his reputation as a peaceable and law abiding citizen was not good. Now, in regard to evidence of this character, it is the duty of the court to say to you, that where it is shown to your satisfaction that the defendant was of good general reputation for peace and- good order in the community, that kind of testimony, if properly made out to you, is positive and substantive evidence and it should be weighed by you in consideration of this case. The courts of highest resort in this state have said, it is the evidence which may work the doubt of the acquittal of the defendant. If that evidence is properly made out to you, it should be sufficient in that line. It is not, however, to weigh against positive facts which should convince your mind that this .defendant did the deed which he is charged with committing here. Where the facts and circumstances are such as to leave no room for doubt, and the minds of the jury are thoroughly and fully convinced, this evidence itself would not then work the acquittal of the defendant, but it is to come in the consideration of the case the same as any other evidence as positive and substantive evidence and to be weighed by you in that line.]</p>

We have so indicated to you in what we have said before, and the proposition is affirmed.” It is plain that the judge did not see any inconsistency in these two instructions, nor do we think they are fairly open to that objection.</p>
