We did not think so at the trial, and are now still of opinion that we are sustained by reason, common sense and decisions of the highest court of the state. Conceding the right to recover if a loss is sustained, how do we ascertain and what is a loss, in the sense contemplated by the act ? A son who is receiving nothing from his father living, may be said to be benefited pecuniarily by the parent’s death, but we have yet to learn that a railroad company by negligently causing death, can in this way become the gratuitous and unsolicited benefactor of children, who prefer their father living ; and it is a novel proposition that a yearly allowance with a certainty of an inheritance of an estate constantly increasing in value by the parent’s prudence and financial ability, can be cut off by the killing of the parent, and the children be told that it is for their benefit. If this is the law, what security have the wealthy against the negligence of others ? All inducements for the use of care and caution as to such are removed. The only reasons why a verdict in pure negligence cases can be justified are as an inducement appealing to self interests to use care and caution, but these are taken away if we hold that no damages can be recovered by the children of wealthy people because they get the estate as a result of the unlawful act. As the jury were told, at request of defendant, that nothing could be allowed for the suffering of the deceased or the feelings of the surviving members of his family, and if in addition we hold that nothing can be recovered for the reason now urged, the defendant, although confessedly guilty of negligence resulting in death, suffers no loss or punishment for its unlawful act, simply because of the financial standing of the deceased. If this is law it might be well for the legislature to provide a new criminal offense and substitute imprisonment for damages, and thus induce the same degree of care and caution in the transportation of the rich as of the poor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[267,604,1185,614]]]'>The true question is what had these plaintiffs the right to expect to receive from the parent during his life, and for the loss -of this they are to be compensated; what they got after his death does not enter into the case. The loss spoken of is the taking away of that which they were receiving and would have received had he lived. It is the destruction of their expectations in this regard that the law deals with and for which it furnishes compensation. To say, “true it is we have taken from you his benefactions, but you get by law, not from us, but from his estate which we thus make available for you, something better,” is to substitute the heirs’ legal right under the law for the company’s liability.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[265,1225,1185,564]]]'>We think, however, that the question was squarely decided in North Penna. R. R. Co. v.

The offer was rejected, the court saying, “ The admission of this testimony would have been a violation of what is understood to have been the principles of construction uniformly applied to the acts of 1855 and 1868.” Counsel have endeavored to draw a distinction between an insurance and an inheritance but we can see no difference in the application of the principle.</p>

The point was made that none may recover in a joint action but such as are injured by the death. “ If such be the rule, we should have the indecent spectacle of an investigation whether the loss of a parent or child was or was not in fact an advantage rather than a loss; for certainly, if none be allowed to recover but such as are able to show a pecuniary loss, the defendants would, with great apparent reason at least, be entitled to claim the right to prove the contrary, and to show peradventure that, by the death, the party suing may have succeeded to an estate, or, on the other hand, had been relieved from the burden of maintenance. <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>In case of the death of aged persons or helpless infants, we might expect in the application of such a rule to have the point discussed, whether the death was an actual loss or gain. The law does not open the door to anything so shocking.” This is what defendants are attempting now to show, that the death of the father was a gain to the sons in direct violation of the cited decisions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[170,718,1179,720]]]'>To the same point is Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.

J., said: “ But there is another aspect of it which will result from the principle insisted upon, viz: that the test of the right to recover being the ‘ pecuniary damages clearly proved to have been suffered,’ it will follow that all those who from youth, old age or other circumstances, are nonproducers, may become the victims of negligence without any compensation to survivors. Nay, more, the corollary of the postulate would prevent compensation where the survivors are absolutely benefited by the death, either as gainers by a distribution of the property of the deceased, or by the riddance of a troublesome charge. The controversies which would arise if this were the rule, would be repugnant and offensive to the sensibilities of every person.”</p>
