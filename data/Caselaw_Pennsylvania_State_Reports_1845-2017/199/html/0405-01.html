In such a ease the transaction had lost its contractual character and become a tort, and an action at any time within the statutory period of limitation was the most effectual rescission.</p>

Defendant claimed that all that plaintiff asked for was copies of certain mortgages and assignments from the record, and that he had furnished these. It appeared that the’ mortgages in question had belonged to the estate of A. Taylor Hoopes. After Hoopes’s death, one Bradley produced a paper which purported to be a will, but was subsequently decided to be a forgery. Harris took an assignment of the mortgages from Bradley, and subsequently prepared an assignment from himself to plaintiff. These assignments he placed of record, and subsequently wrote to plaintiff “ Everything is complete on the record.” Plaintiff understood that the papers represented valid securities. Defendant admitted that he had appropriated nearly all of the money which he had received from plaintiff to his own use.</p>

    <p id="b431-10" data-blocks='[["BL_431.11",431,[190,1192,1179,862]]]'>Plaintiff’s suit is based on fraud committed by defendant in appropriating to himself money placed in his, hands for investment and furnishing plaintiff with fraudulent copies and assignments of mortgages to represent the money. Under a charge putting the burden of proof fully upon the plaintiff, the jury have found the fraud. The facts are scarcely disputed, but appellant complains of error in the refusal to affirm his point that on the discovery of the fraud the plaintiff was bound either to ratify or rescind the transaction within a reasonable time, and his failure to do so was evidence of affirmance or acquiescence. As was well said by the learned judge below, it is difficult to “ see how an executed contract in which the money has been paid over, appropriated and used, can be rescinded by notice.” The transaction had lost its contractual character and become a tort, and an action at any time within the statutory period of limitation was the most effectual rescission.</p>
