The assessments from 1884 to 1891 show that Hamlin &amp; Gilpin were assessed for a saw mill and two dwelling houses and barn, but there was no assessment of any land in connection with these improvements, there are no acres designated in the description, simply a saw mill and improvements. Nor does the evidence offered show that this assessment to Hamlin &amp; Gilpin applied to either of the warrants in question. Nor does the evidence show that these taxes in the seated list were paid to the collector, but on the contrary the tax collector of Jones township for the year 1891 was called as a witness, and he testified' that he was exonerated from these taxes. Had there been sufficient personal property on the premises at the time the tax collector had his duplicate he would have been able to collect the taxes, and would not have been exonerated from them; and the presump<a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>tion is that the tax collector did his duty, and that when he returned this tax as uncollectible it was in accordance with the facts. Even if the saw mill was erected upon one of these tracts the preponderance of the evidence shows that the mill and improvements had been abandoned, and after such abandonment the assessment of the land as unseated would constitute a valid assessment: Gibsonv.

The record of the deed creating a separate estate in the minerals would not be notice to the assessor or the commissioners as they were not bound to search or examine the records. The covenants contained in the contract made by Hamlin &amp; Gilpin with Hyde &amp; Thayer of March 20, 1889, and in the deed from Hamlin &amp; Gilpin to O. B.

There is no obligation existing by reason of these covenants which imposes upon the grantees in these several conveyances the duty of paying the taxes on both estates, surface and minerals. The evident intent and purpose of these covenants was to prevent a sale of the surface on which the timber was growing that was sold by the conveyance to Hamlin &amp; Gilpin. There was nothing in the agreement by Hamlin &amp; Gilpin nor in the covenants contained therein which obligated Hamlin &amp; Gilpin to pay any other taxes than those that would protect Hyde &amp; Thayer in the possession of the timber under their contract. The same may be said of the provisions and reservations on the part of the grantor contained in the deed from Hamlin &amp; Gilpin to O. B. Lay and from O. B. Lay to M. S. Kline. They were for the protection of the title conveyed which only pretended to cover the surface exclusive of the minerals. Lay’s deed was executed and delivered long after the surface and minerals had been separated and the two estates created. There was no privity nor any contractual relation existing between Kline and the plaintiffs in this case. The plaintiffs were strangers to all these agreements and covenants.
