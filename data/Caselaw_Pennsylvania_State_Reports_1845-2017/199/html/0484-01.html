In such a case the privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, is purely personal, and does not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers.</p>

The privilege accorded to the widow, who, by virtue of her dower, is regarded as a purchaser, was purely personal, and did not extend to the brothers and sisters, who are volunteers. The privilege died with the person whom it was intended to benefit, and as between the remaining parties the legacies abate proportionally, just as they would have abated if the bequest of the $25,000 had been to any other than a purchaser. The exceptions are sustained, and adjudication and award amended accordingly.</p>
