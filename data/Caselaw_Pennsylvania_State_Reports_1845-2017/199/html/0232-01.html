If a merchant sends his driver upon the street to deliver a load of goods, that driver is in the discharge of a duty and services of his employ, and if he negligently runs over anybody upon the highway the employer must pay the bill, he must respond in damages; but if the employer sends a man out on the highway to deliver a lot of goods and the driver sees a man upon the highway that he has a grudge against and says to himself, “ I have a horse and loaded wagon and I am going to run that man down,” and whips the horse up and runs down the man, the driver is responsible, criminally and civilly, and the employer is not, because, that is a wilful and malicious act of the driver and not an act done in the discharge of his duty to his <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>employer. Whether the facts in this case fit that principle of law, I leave for you to decide. The plaintiff testifies that the engineer laughed at him after the first blast of the whistle and that in point of fact, even after the second blast of the whistle he had his horse well under control; that this man seeing the predicament he was in, laughed at him and discharged this cloud of steam. If you were sitting in the court of quarter sessions and the engineer was on trial for having done that thing, and it was admitted that the engineer had laughed at this man when he saw the horse rearing and had blown the whistle the second time and still continued to enjoy the predicament this man was in, and absolutely regardless of his safety and the danger he was in, let off steam, so that the accident was bound to happen, you would be justified in finding that engineer guilty of a criminal act. If you find such to be the case here, you have the right to find what the engineer did was criminal on his part, wanton on his part, and that the company is not responsible for that act of his. I want to add to that: when the engineer was asked, when his attention was called to the statement of the plaintiff that he was laughing at him when he blew the whistle the second time and let off steam, while he did not say he was not laughing at him, he made the reply that seemed to me to be the reply of a manly man, he saw nothing in the position of that man to make him laugh at him.

The learned trial judge first commented on the testimony offered upon the part of the plaintiff, and after-wards upon that offered upon the part of the defendant. An examination of the charge, shows that the rather sweeping terms used in referring to the persons testifying, were fairly limited to the evidence for the defendant, by the classification employed. These assignments are therefore overruled. The trial judge further instructed the jury that the fact of the safety gates having been lowered and kept down for a period of time longer than that allowed by the city ordinance, had nothing to do with the case. His instructions in this respect are assigned as error in the third and fourth specifications. The learned trial court was right. The lowering of the gates and keeping them down, could not be considered as the proximate cause of the accident. According <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>to the plaintiff’s own testimony, and that of his witnesses, the horse was frightened by the escape of steam from the engine and the blowing of the whistle. The authorities cited by appellant in which certain ordinances were properly offered in evidence, were cases in which the proximate causes of the accidents lay in acts which were in themselves violations of the ordinances. In Foote v. American Product Company, <a href="/pa/195/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="195 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="914024" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0195-01">195 Pa. 195</a>, the accident was caused by the failure to observe the rule of the road and the ordinance was introduced as evidence as to what the law of the road was. In Lederman v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/165/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="165 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="862050" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0118-01">165 Pa. 118</a>, the allegation was excess of speed, and, the ordinance was offered as evidence of what the lawful rate of speed was. For such purposes as these, ordinances are properly admitted ; but never for the purpose of showing that the violation of the terms of an ordinance in itself constitutes negligence. In the present case, the use of safety gates is manifestly a measure of prudence, intended for the prevention of accident. The fact that plaintiff was delayed by the lowering of the gates, and their being kept down for an unusual length of time, can have no bearing upon the question of defendant’s negligence in sounding the whistle of its engine, and in blowing off steam. There is no merit in the third and fourth assignments of error and they are, therefore, overruled. The instructions of the court upon the question of the defendant’s alleged negligence, are the subject of complaint, in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth assignments of error. They were argued together, and will be so considered here. Great stress is laid by appellant upon the statement by the trial judge in the course of his charge, that the reply of the engineer seemed to be that of a “ manly man.” We see no reason for criticism here. The court has a right to express an opinion as to the evidence or as to the witnesses; providing nothing is said to bind the juiy or preclude them from deciding the case for themselves on the evidence.</p>

The question was fairly left to the jury to determine whether or not the act of the engineer in blowing the whistle and in letting off steam, was in the line of his duty. Since the scope of the servant’s employment is necessarily dependent on circumstances, a hard and fast rule cannot be laid down as to the scope of any particular employment; and it is ordinarily a question for the jury whether or not a particular act comes within the scope of a servant’s employment: Schimpf v. Harris, <a href="/pa/185/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="185 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="897994" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0046-01">185 Pa. 46</a>; Guinney v.

Under the circumstances of this case the only basis upon which the jury could conclude that the engineer was acting outside the line of Ms duty, was by finding that he blew the whistle and let off the steam, in absolute disregard of the dangerous predicament of the plaintiff; and that his action in so doing, was wilful and malicious and for the gratification of his own wanton purpose. But considered in connection with other parts of the charge, it is manifest that the court did not intend to give the jury any bindmg instruction as to the question of the engineer acting without the scope of his employment. It is very evident that the charge as a whole, could not have been misleading to the jury.</p>

    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[272,1756,1188,457]]]'>And again in the fourth point: “ That if the jury believe from the evidence that the engineer discharged, or blew off steam from the engme, while on a common crossing, and in an unusual and extraordinary manner, and that same caused the fright of plaintiff’s horse and subsequent injuries to plaintiff, then defendant is guilt of negligence and plaintiff is entitled to a verdict.” This latter point being properly qualified by calling the attention of the jury to the fact, that they must in addition consider whether plaintiff had exercised due care for his own safety.</p>
