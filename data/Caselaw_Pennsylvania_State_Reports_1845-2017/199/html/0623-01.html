A reasonable and the most conservative construction carries with it these rights, and they must necessarily authorize and empower the person who owns, uses and enjoys such real estate to contract such obligations as attend such improvements as are necessary to adapt the premises to the uses and -wants of the owner. To say that a married woman shall not have the power under the act of 1848, to contract for such necessary improvements is to say that she shall not have the ordinary means of controlling, using and enjoying her separate estate, and thus the very spirit and intention of the act are destroyed. Her power to contract for improvements as well as for repairs, is inseparably incident to her right to take and hold real estate for her own use; consequently in 1883, Mrs. Birch was capable of contracting for the erection of a house on her separate estate: Lippincott v.
