Coates; that February 14, 1857, Joseph Wells, administrator of W. B. Coates, deceased, by order of the orphans’ court of Fayette county, sold and conveyed by deed of that date to Henry Cooke, for the consideration of $5,350.84, a tract of land situate in Franklin township, containing 155 acres; (Fourth.) “ that the said Henry Cooke paid the said purchase money to the said Joseph Wells, administrator as aforesaid, in part by delivering to him a receipt of the said Henry Cooke, as agent for the said Sarah H. Cooke and Clarissa Hazen for said judgment debt and interest thereon, amounting to $2,159.24, one half of which was the separate property and estate of the said Sarah H.

Cooke of an interest in said described lands equal to the proportion which the one half of said judgment with interest bore to the whole of said purchase money, which proportion was 20^^- per centum, and said land was held by him subject to said resulting trust to the day of his death, which occurred on the 27th day of October, 1887; ” that said Sarah H. Cooke died on or about March 21,1896, leaving to survive her five children, viz: William B. McCormick, Elsie I. Cunningham, David H. Cooke, Esther E. Patterson and Clara H. Cooke, the first and heirs of the second being the complainants herein; that the said Henry Cooke by his last will devised the surface of the said tract to John A. and David H. Cooke in fee and directed that the coal underlying the same should be sold by his executors and the proceeds divided share and share alike among William H. Cooke, Jane D. Turner, Elizabeth Shearer, Esther E. Patterson and Clarissa H. Cooke; that said coal was never sold by the executors, and by due and legal conveyances from John A.

Cooke, who, by deed dated June 15, 1900, conveyed the nine-foot seam of coal to the Cochran Coal Company. Pursuant to which allegations, the complainants prayed for a decree declaring the said trust in their favor as heirs of the said Sarah H. Cooke, deceased, and that the said defendants account to them for their proportionate share of the purchase money paid by the Cochran Coal Company, and for a like part of the mortgage debt for the balance of the said purchase money, and for a pre' liminary injunction restraining the defendants from selling, assigning or transferring the said mortgage debt, and for general relief.</p>

R,epr. 258, holds, that unless the money with which the property is purchased is at the time of the purchase impressed with a trust that the purchase should be for the person furnishing the money, no resulting trust arises as to the land purchased. • In the master’s report, concerning which the court says, “ It is so clear and well stated both as to facts and law, that we are relieved from the necessity of a further discussion of the matter in controversy,” we find, “the <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>master is of the opinion that if any resulting trust arose in favor of Adam Moyer, Sr., in the premises in controversy, it arose on the 2d. of January, 1882, when Adam Moyer, Sr., gave his check to John Moyer, one of the defendants, for the sum of $1,000. .... The master holds and so reports that the plaintiff has failed to show that the $1,000 given by him to his son John on the 2d of January, 1882, (though used afterwards in the payment of the balance of the purchase money) was at that time impressed with a trust that John should purchase the property for his father or as his agent by any contract or agreement, verbal. or otherwise.”</p>

This she released to the master, who made a deed to the husband alone; it was held a trust resulted in favor of the wife to the extent of her interest. In discussing which, Mr. Justice Clark says, “But there is evidence to show that the share of Sarah Bigley,” (the wife) “ thus reduced to personalty, actually went into the purchase of this land; that it was applied as purchase money at the time of the conveyance; that it.was not advanced as a loan or gift to her husband but as her own; not as a general contribution but the contribution of a specific, definite sum to procure a correspondent interest or aliquot part of the estate. Now, it may be conceded that the alleged agreement ” (that prior to the sale the husband and wife agreed that he should buy the property and she would take her share in land and he bid the property in on that understanding) “ as a means, per se, of making title in her was of no consequence, but if at the time of the conveyance she paid a part of the purchase money under it for a proportionate interest in the purchase, under the circumstances stated, the trust would naturally result in' her favor to the extent of the purchase money thus paid. The agreement is nothing, except as it discloses the intention of the parties at the time. The trust results from the acts and not from the agreement of the parties, or rather perhaps from the acts accompanied by the agreement.”</p>
