Crotzer was engaged in the drug business, and in 1893 became financially embarrassed. F. T. Bittenbender purchased a judgment on which certain executions had issued against Crotzer, and at a sheriff’s sale bought in the goods. The understanding was that Bittenbender should make a bill of sale of the goods to Crotzer’s wife when he had been reimbursed the advances which he had made to purchase the judgment. Subsequently at Crotzer’s request Bittenbender sold the goods to a third party. On January 10, 1893, before the advances were repaid in full, Crotzer executed an absolute deed of the property in controversy to Bittenbender. Contemporaneously with the execution of the deed, another paper was executed signed by Bittenbender, which contained the following clause:</p>
