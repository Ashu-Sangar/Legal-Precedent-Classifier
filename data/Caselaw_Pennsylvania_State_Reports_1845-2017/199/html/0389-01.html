Newhard left to survive her no relations, or kindred on the part of her deceased father, John New-hard, Jr., and that her heirs at law and next of kin surviving her at this time are Elemina Kramer, an aunt, who was the sister of the deceased mother of the intestate, and A. H. Horn and A. J. Kemmerer, who are children of Henry Horn, deceased, who was a brother of the mother of said intestate; and A. H. Snyder, Jacob S. Snyder, Dallar Snyder and Sallie B. Worman, who are the children of Sarah Snyder, now deceased, who was married to Nathan Snyder and who was a sister of the mother of the said intestate. Your auditor is prompted to this conclusion particularly since the Ginkinger claimants to the estate have offered no evidence showing the pedigree through which they claim, and in the opinion of the auditor the burden is on them to show that they are the heirs of the intestate. The heir-ship or kinship of the Ginkinger as maternal relatives of the deceased is not disputed, but they have no claim, in the opinion of the auditor, upon this estate, since John Newhard, Jr., was clearly an illegitimate son of John Newhard Sr., having been born at a time when his father, and recognized by him as such, was married to Margaret (Shoener) Newhard, and Franie Miller, his mother, was a servant in the said John Newhard, Sr., family. The presumption in law, unless proven to the contrary, is that a child when born is legitimate, and this seems to have been in the minds of the counsel for the Ginkinger claimants, but it is so clearly proven, in the opinion of your auditor, that John New-hard, Jr., was illegitimate, even by his own admissions, that this presumption in his case could not arise.</p>

    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[262,412,1189,1386]]]'>The decedent died intestate, unmarried and without issue. Appellants claim through the father, and appellees are relatives in the same degree, claiming through the mother. Whether all shall share in the distribution or only the appellees depends on the single question of fact whether the father was of legitimate birth so that inheritable blood might be traced through him to collaterals. The auditor found against the appellants, and in reviewing his finding on exceptions the learned judge said : “ Exceptants’ counsel have urged that every intendment shall be made in favor of the legitimacy of John Newhard, Jr., the father of the intestate ; that the court shall regard the evidence (all of which was introduced by the opposing party) as if called upon to pass upon it originally, that the auditor’s findings are mere inferences; that much of the evidence ought to be rejected because improperly received; that it ought to be taken that the value of the testimony of witnesses who were admissible, is seriously impaired by the fact that against repeated, almost constant objection, questions leading and suggestive of the desired answer were permitted. If the case is viewed in the manner above suggested it is manifest still that the exceptions cannot be sustained. The single question is whether it is proved that John Newhard, Jr., was illegitimate. An examination of the testimony of the witnesses who were competent, and a consideration of what they meant to say and did say leaves no room to doubt the illegitimacy of John Newhard, Jr. That is so plain that discussion is unnecessary.” We affirm the decree on this finding.</p>
