He also made similar devises of real estate to other daughters. In a subsequent clause in his will he directed as follows: “ It is my will that neither of my children shall sell or convey any part of the real estate hereby willed to them, but shall receive the rents, issues and profits thereof during their natural lives, and after their or either of their deaths, their portions shall be equally divided among their children and their heii-s; and if either of my children should die without issue, their portion shall be equally divided among the survivors.” After the death of the testator, a-daughter, E. A., instituted proceedings which had for their purpose the construction of the will, and obtained a decision in Williams v. Leech, 4 Casey, 89, and Naglee’s Appeal, 9 Casey, 89, that she took an estate in fee simple under her father’s will. Upon E. L.’s death, E. A. claimed to share in the proceeds of the real estate devised to E. L., on the ground that E. L. took a life estate only on the theory that Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">1 Wright, 9</a>, had overruled William v.

The limitations over are not inconsistent with a fee, as it seems to us, for they are limitations to the heirs of the devisee, first to the lineal heirs, and second to the collateral heirs; that is, all together, to her heirs general. But the cause is presented on another ground, assuming that there is a life estate in Mrs. Williams with remainder to her children. Then, following the usual form of such devises, this one may be stated thus : A devise to Emily <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>for life, with remainder to her issue and their heirs, in equal shares (she being unmarried) ; and if she die without issue, then over to her surviving sisters (who would be her collateral heirs). Of course, the remainder to the children was contingent, until at least one of them was born. But then it became immediately vested, and for this counsel have cited many cases, and there are numerous others, .... and when it once becomes vested in the children, it is transmissible as theirs, and this is clearly expressed in many cases; . . . . the devise over is to take effect only in case the first remainder should not. . ... If the first remainder once vests, it must in this case vest in fee, and descend as such, for there is nothing to divest it in favor of another estate. ... It may be thought unreasonable that the devise over should be defeated by the birth of children who may have died within a few months ; but we are only following the testator’s law of descent, and not making one. Besides, it is quite as reasonable that the mother should succeed in title to her children, as that their aunts should. . . . This land vested in the children, on their birth, and descended on their death to their parent, but subject to open again to let in the right of other children, when born, for their shares; and the devise over fell entirely, never to rise again. . . .</p>

Leech and in Naglee’s Appeal, which were not in accordance with his own views, but the only point decided, and the only question presented for consideration, was that an estate expressly limited to the first taker for life, was not enlarged by operation of the rule in Shelley’s Case by a limitation to his children, as Judge Lowbie had suggested, in Price v.

Oldfield, 4 DeG. and J. 30; Reichard’s Appeal, 1 Crum. 232; Whelen’s Estate, <a href="/pa/175/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="175 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="880511" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0023-01">175 Pa. 23</a>. There was no limitation of the estate, in express terms, to the lives of the daughters, and the attempt to take away the power of alienation so far as their shares of real estate were concerned, was simply void (Reifsnyder v. Hunter, 7 Harris, 41), while the limitation at the deaths of the daughters to those who would take their estates under the intestate laws, was, as the court held, consistent with the absolute estates given in the first instance. It is certainly clear that the interests given in so much of the estate as was personalty were absolute, and the gifts of the real estate were in the same terms. The codicil, which contains the final expression of the testator’s intentions as to the lands given to Mrs. Devine on Greenwich Island, part of which was the subject of the sale to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, expressly declares that if they should be sold by his wife the proceeds at her death should go absolutely to Mrs. Devine and Mrs. Bruner in equal shares; and it is only in the event of their not being sold by the wife that the daughters, who are to “ receive the rents, issues and profits,” without limitation as to time, are not to “ have the privilege to sell and convey the same.”</p>

Newman and other cases which followed it on questions of trusts, and as no question of trust was involved in either of them, it is evident that he was not speaking with his usual care and accuracy. Dodson v. Ball, it may be remarked in passing, is the only case, so far as known, in which a fee was held to have passed under a deed without the use of the word “ heirs ”—the distinction between a deed and a will in this respect having apparently been overlooked.</p>

As was said by Mr. Justice Kennedy, in Marsh v.
