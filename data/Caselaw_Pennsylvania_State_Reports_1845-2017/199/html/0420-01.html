At the end of the day the excavation was from twelve to fifteen inches in depth. There was evidence that stakes in the form of an X had been placed at each end of the excavation, and that a board had been laid upon them. It appeared, however, that this board did not extend all the way across the sidewalk. No lights were placed at or near the excavation. Plaintiff fell into the excavation about seven o’clock in the evening, as he <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>was proceeding to a polling place. Plaintiff had frequently used the sidewalk, but had no notice of the danger. The evidence also tended to show that the night was very dark. The court submitted the case to the jury.</p>

    <p id="b445-10" data-blocks='[["BL_445.10",445,[166,1059,1184,604]]]'>The plaintiff alleged that he received a serious injury through the negligence of the defendants. The evidence presented on the trial related to questions of fact which were for the determination of the jury. The instructions which the jury received from the court in its general charge, together with its answers to the defendant’s points, were impartial and free from error. It was shown by the verdict of the jury that the plaintiff’s allegation of negligence was sustained by the evidence, and that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff which contributed to the injury he received. As there is, therefore, no cause for reversal of the judgment, the assignments of error are dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b445-11" data-blocks='[["BL_445.11",445,[216,1682,362,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
