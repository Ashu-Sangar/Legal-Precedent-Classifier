It is alleged in them that the learned judge of the court below erred in appointing William Righter Fisher, Esq., as the trustee of the real estate late of Freeman Scott, deceased. It is also alleged therein that the court was without jurisdiction to appoint a trustee upon the petition of the plaintiff as a creditor of distributees under the trust, and that he erred in not dismissing said petition. To the third specification of error we may add that the appellants allege that the court erred in entering a decree without finding that the plaintiff is a trustee, or co-trustee of the estate of Freeman Scott, deceased, or in declining to assert that the plaintiff is in any manner a trustee of the estate of the said Freeman Scott, deceased.</p>
