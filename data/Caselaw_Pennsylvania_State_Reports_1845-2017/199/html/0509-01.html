He said: “ In order to work a conversion, there must be either, first, a positive direction to sell, or second, an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will, or third, such a blending of real and personal estate by the testator in his will, as to clearly show that he intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath the said fund as money.”</p>

There is no blending of real estate and personal property by the testator, to show an intention to create a fund; for to his son, Robert Oil ver, he gave one half of his real estate and. household furniture, and the other half to be divided, etc.</p>
