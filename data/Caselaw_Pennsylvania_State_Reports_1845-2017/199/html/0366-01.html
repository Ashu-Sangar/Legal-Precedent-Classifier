Up to the day of their marriage he was possessed of an estate of considerable amount, in the neighborhood of $75,000, which he had inherited from his father. This was all personal property. Upon the day of the marriage, prior to the ceremony, and without the knowledge or consent of his wife, Mr. Potter executed a deed of trust to the defendant, the Fidelity Insurance, Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Company, of all the said estate in trust to pay the income to himself during his life, “ so that the same shall not be assigned or anticipated by him, nor be subject to or liable for the debts, contracts or engagements of the said George Van Hook Potter, and without any liability to execution, attachment, warrant or legal process of any kind.” This deed was, according to its express provisions, irrevocable.</p>

There is no doubt that it is well settled that when a woman, in anticipation of an intended marriage, without the knowledge of her intended husband, executes a transfer or conveyance of her property in such a way as to deprive him of all benefit in it, and her of her control over it, such a transaction will be declared to be a legal fraud upon him.</p>

It undoubtedly, in the first instance, grew out of the more absolute dominion which a husband possessed over his wife’s property than exists at the present day, but, as in the case already cited, the doctrine still stands notwithstanding the great enlargement which has come to a woman’s rights over her own property, and the greater assimilation in those rights to the dominion which a man can exercise over his own estate. No case, however, has been cited, and we have not been able to find any, in which that doctrine has been applied to the same degree or with the same rigor to the case of a wife asking to have a conveyance made by her husband before marriage, and in anticipation of marriage, set aside.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-4" data-blocks='[["BL_392.4",392,[294,1020,1189,1436]]]'>Baird v. Stearne, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Phila.%20339" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Phila. 339">15 Phila. 339</a>, is a case which was tried in this court, in which a man who had once been married, and who had three children, made a deed of trust in favor of himself for life, and the remainder to his children, a few days before he announced his engagement to a lady who subsequently became his wife. After his death, she filed a bill in this court for the purpose of setting the same deed aside so as to enable her to take'that interest in her husband’s estate which she would have been entitled to if he had died intestate, and that relief was afforded to her. The opinion of the court was written with the customary virility of the former' president, Judge Thayer, and the relief which was afforded was based, not upon there being any intentional fraud perpetrated upon his wife, but upon the ground that the deed made under the circumstances narrated was a fraud in law. It will be observed, however, that the relief which was given in that case was given after the death of the husband. The question arises for consideration here whether the plaintiff, Mrs. Potter, is entitled to any other relief than that, or whether she is entitled to have the deed of trust made by her husband set aside and the property which was covered by it replaced in his hands for such uses as he may see fit to make of it. It is, of course, quite apparent that if the possession and control of the property be again vested in him he might the next day execute another deed of like terms, just as he might, in the exercise of the full dominion over his estate, which every man possesses, give it away. See Ellmaker v. Ellmaker, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%2091" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts 91">4 Watts, 91</a>, and Lines v. Lines, <a href="/pa/142/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="142 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="976735" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0149-01">142 Pa. 149</a>.</p>

      <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>That may he said with additional force in this case because all the property which was covered by the deed of trust was personal property. It is, however, urged upon the part of the plaintiff, that, while this may be true, she yet had the right, which any wife would possess, of attempting by persuasion and proper influence to induce her husband to make such use of his property as would be for their mutual benefit, and would give to her greater enjoyment than she can presumably derive out of his control over the income of the property which is held by the trustee. It does not seem to me, on reflection, that that sort of influence which a wife might exert over her husband, is a substantial right which ought to be protected by a court of equity. It has a little too much of the element of sentiment and romance in it to bring it within the scope of a solemn court. The thing which the remedy of the law should seek to protect for the wife’s benefit is an interest in the property to be enjoyed at the time when the death of the husband might impose upon her circumstances of dependence and need, when the customary support and protection of her husband are removed. To place the full control of an estate of personal property in the hands of a married man, particularly if he were of a spendthrift disposition, might in many cases be a very serious calamity to his wife. Even if he were not a spendthrift, the ordinary risks of business, and the uncertainties of investment would necessarily imperil her ultimate interest in his property. These are considerations which, in a case like the present, are entitled to weight, when the question arises as to whether a wife should be permitted to set aside a deed of trust which her husband has deliberately made, and which, if it continues to operate, will presumably preserve the corpus of the estate during his lifetime. I do not intend by anything which I have just said to intimate that Mr. Potter is a spendthrift, or that ho would in any unworthy or unmanly way dispose of his property, if he had it in his control, to the disadvantage of his wife. The case must be treated on general grounds, and with reference to questions which may frequently arise in this class of eases.</p>

Under that deed as it stands, her husband derives the income which accrues from securities belonging to the estate. That income can be used, and no doubt is, for the comfort and advantage of the plaintiff in due proportion. As has already been said, if he had the entire corpus of the estate in his possession she could have no legal control over its disposition, and any actual or controlling interest in it could only come to her upon his death; and that, too, only with reference to such portion of the corpus of the estate as might then remain.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[274,1194,1186,553]]]'>In coming to this conclusion, I, of course, do not intend to decide that the plaintiff would have no right, upon the death of her husband preceding her own death, to ask that the deed of trust should be annuled to the extent of enabling her to take that share of the principal of the estate which would belong to her under the intestate laws, if no such deed of trust had been made. In my opinion she undoubtedly would have that right, but I think that until that time shall come she has no ground upon which she can successfully attack the validity of the deed in question. It is therefore my conclusion that the plaintiff’s bill must be dismissed with costs.</p>
