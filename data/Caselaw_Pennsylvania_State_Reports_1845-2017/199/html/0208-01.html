It was brought into close relations with the plaintiff through their common employment in the construction of a glass furnace at Williamstown, N. J., during the winter of 1894-1895. In the spring of 1895, negotiations were opened between plaintiff and defendant looking to the acquisition by the latter of the former’s plans for a glass furnace, which embodied the idea of the location of the regenerators together at one end instead of on both sides, as usual, a convex front (“ round-nose ”) for the convenience of the workmen engaged in blowing, and the use of oil for fuel. These negotiations were conducted, on the side of the defendant, by its secretary and treasurer, Charles F. Cox, a civil engineer.

The defendant’s acceptance introduced a new term uncontemplated by the plaintiff, and was, as its secretary and treasurer puts it, a mere “ offer,” hot binding until accepted by a “ letter ” from the plaintiff “ in accordance ” therewith. Mr. Gantt, however, testified that within a few days after receiving the letter last quoted, he assented to its terms, but could not say whether he had done so verbally or in writing. It is admitted that all oral communications that passed in this matter were between Charles F. Cox and the plaintiff, and that none of their interviews took place in the presence of witnesses. Now, Mr. C. F. Cox testified that “ after the correspondence the company did not see fit to go to take it (the plans) up any further,” and that at a conversation held in Philadelphia, but just where he couldn’t say, some time in May or June, 1895 (“I should say within two weeks after that letter ” of May 15), he told the plaintiff that he would personally “ go into it,” with plaintiff, “ for any future business.” This witness through all his testimony assumes that there was no contract between plaintiff and defendant, because the former had failed to accept the latter’s counterproposition ; and insists that the only “ arrangement ” extant for the use of the plaintiff’s plans was made with himself individually. But this assumption is without foundation. Along with a mass of other letters, produced by the defendant on call, and offered in evidence for the plaintiff (without, apparently, having been read by counsel on either side), we find the following letter written by Mr. Gantt to the defendant:</p>

There is nothing in the correspondence produced or in the acts of either side which is at all inconsistent with the existence of such an arrangement. Even the letter of Charles F. Cox, written November 17, 1898, is so weak a denial as to be tantamount, almost, to an admission that Gantt had made the contract he claims; and the failure of the defendant to deny Gantt’s assertions of his right to an accounting with promptness and emphasis is a circumstance persuasive of the justice of his contention. In view of the very close relation borne by Mr. Charles F. Cox to the defendant company, the payment of the S100 received by Gantt in June, 1896, by Cox’s check, is absolutely without bearing on the question to whom the plaintiff is to look for his money; while Gantt’s acceptance of a less sum on the Millville furnace than that to which his contract entitled him is susceptible of a satisfactory explanation, without resort to the theory that his contract with the defendant had been rescinded or never made.</p>

Cox, the defendant’s secretary and treasurer, called as under cross-examination, testified that since the Gantt plans had come into his hands, the defendant had built seven round-nosed oil-fired day tank furnaces, and furnished plans for the construction of another. These all, except one, are alike. The plan in each case was prepared by the witness, who, having incorporated many improvements or modifications of the plans originally ob* <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>tained from the plaintiff, regarded the design as entirely original.

If, then, an officer of a corporation was at common law disqualified to testify in its behalf because of his interest therein, it certainly follows that the law now permitting the party to summon as witnesses any persons whose interest is adverse permits the summoning as such witnesses of officers of all adverse corporations.</p>

    <p id="b240-5" data-blocks='[["BL_240.6",240,[249,408,1182,198]]]'>The answer of a corporation sworn to by the proper officer having personal knowledge of the facts, is within the equity rule as to the weight of a responsive answer as evidence : Kane v. Ins. Co., ante p. 198.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.7",240,[247,614,1184,818]]]'>The general proposition therefore on which the learned judge below rejected the answer in this case as evidence and treated it as mere pleading was erroneous. But the application of the rule to the case was correct. An answer in equity gets its responsive force from the personal knowledge of the witness. The matters in issue between the parties here were first, the terms of plaintiff’s contract, secondly, the parties to it, that is, was his contract with the corporation defendant, or with Charles F. Cox, its secretary, in his individual capacity. On these issues it was specifically found by the judge that the president by whom the answer was sworn to, had no knowledge except by hearsay, not having been present at any of the oral negotiations, which took place entirely between plaintiff and the secretary. The rule requires that the officer mailing oath to the answer, to give it responsive force, must be one having knowledge of the facts: Riegel v. American Life Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/153/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="153 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="840309" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0134-01">153 Pa. 134</a>.</p>
    <p id="b240-7" data-blocks='[["BL_240.8",240,[242,1443,1189,663]]]'>But even if the answer be given full force as responsive to the bill, it was overcome by the evidence on the other side. The oral negotiations were conducted entirely by the plaintiff and the secretary of the defendant, whose testimony was directly conflicting and there were no other witnesses. But the correspondence amply corroborated the plaintiff. His written proposition was addressed to the company, it was answered by the company per its secretary, suggesting a modification, and this was agreed to by plaintiff in writing addressed as before to the company. This was of itself sufficient to establish a contract in writing with the company, and the judge found that there was nothing in the subsequent oral communications between plaintiff and the secretary at all inconsistent with the writings.</p>

This was technically an error. The ófficérs of a corporation not shown to be stockholders prima facie are mere agents or servantshaving no direct interest in the'suit which prevented them from being witnesses at common law, or <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>enables the opposite party to call them under the statute as if for cross-examination. But the error did appellants no harm, for the officers so called might readily come under some of the classes of necessary unwilling or adverse witnesses as to whom there is a very large discretion in the trial court to permit leading questions and even contradiction. The rule that a party calling a witness is not permitted to ask leading questions and is bound by his testimony, is liberally construed in modern practice, with a large measure of discretion in the court to permit parties to elicit any material truth without regard to the technical consideration of who called the witness. It is a discretion not susceptible of exactly defined limits beforehand, but to be exercised in the interests of justice and a fair trial under circumstances as they arise.

The technical error was harmless.</p>

It was not for the purchase or use of a patent right or an invention, but for a set of plans and working specifications for a glass furnace of a particular type. The novelty, etc., of the design was not material. The judge found that the furnaces for which the decree charges the defendants were built on plaintiff’s plans, with variations which the defendant’s secretary considered sufficient to make them original but which the court finds substantially followed the plaintiff’s design. The defendant therefore got what it bought and agreed to pay for, and the subordinate matters on which no specific finding was made were immaterial.</p>
