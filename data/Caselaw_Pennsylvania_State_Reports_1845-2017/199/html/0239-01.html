This alleged excess represents the price of certain machinery, etc., which originally belonged to the defendant, but which the plain<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>tiff alleges was purchased by it under a contract in writing dated October 3, 1893. But that was a contract between the plaintiff and Lane, Doney &amp; Company to which the defendant was not a party, and it could not, therefore, operate directly to divest the defendant of his title in the machinery. The plaintiff, recognizing this difficulty, claims that the defendant is es-topped by his conduct from setting up this defense. In the making of the contract the defendant acted as the plaintiff’s agent. It is claimed by the plaintiff that at that time the defendant said that the contract included all the machinery on the premises, and it is undisputed that the machinery in controversy was on the premises at the time. If the defendant so stated, and the statement was the inducing cause of the contract, his title to the machinery was gone and with it his right to the $858. Whether he so stated and if so whether the statement was the inducing cause of the contract are questions of fact for your determination.] [4 D.]</p>

This $4 per share specified is on the stock held by you, namely, 250 shares.' Yours truly, A. O. Allen.” You will notice this is a contract between A. O. Allen, the defendant, and F. Hussey. The general rule of law is, that no person can sue upon a contract except the parties to the contract. So far as the contract itself shows the plaintiff was not a party to that contract. There are some exceptions to the general rule which I have just stated to you, but, in my opinion, the present case does not fall within any one of these exceptions, and my instruction to you is that you cannot allow the plaintiff a credit for the $1,000 mentioned in this contract in the present action. You will, therefore, so far as the Hussey item is concerned, dispose of it by not giving the plaintiff credit for it.] [IP.]</p>

Allen, the appellant in the first appeal, was the owner of the principal part of the stock of the Crown Slate Company before its reorganization, and was also a member of the firm of Tins-man &amp; Company who leased and operated its quarry. Representing the slate company he negotiated with Lane, Doney &amp; Company, who owned an adjoining quarry, for a consolidation of the interests of both parties, to be effected by a reorganization of the company and the issuing of additional capital stock to Lane, Doney &amp; Company in payment for the quarry they were to convey. The negotiations resulted in a written agreement for the consolidation of the properties “ with all the improvements thereon.” There was a verbal understanding that the personal property of Tinsman &amp; Company, of which Allen had become the sole owner on the dissolution of the firm, should be appraised and purchased by the slate company. Allen became the treasurer of the slate company after its reorganization, and paid to himself the amount at which Tinsman &amp; Company’s property had been appraised. The plaintiff’s contention at the trial was that Allen had included in the inventory certain fixtures and machinery which either were the property of the slate company, or had during the negotiations been representéd as belonging to the company, and that his payment to himself of the appraised value of these items was wrongful.</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.7",268,[274,1659,1186,509]]]'>This was the issue of fact raised, and the attempt upon the part of the plaintiff to establish its claim was resisted on the ground that the written agreement fixed the rights of the parties in the absence of evidence that something had been omitted from it through fraud, accident or mistake. All the specifications of error which need be considered relate to the admission of testimony offered by the plaintiff to show that certain items should not have been included, and to the failure of the court to give adequate instruction as to the standard of evidence necessary to vary a written agreement.</p>

The attempt was not to vary a written agreement. The action was not on the agreement nor between the parties to it. The inventory <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>was made after the agreement was executed, and the testimony-objected to was offered to show that certain articles included in the inventory and for which the defendant had paid himself with the funds of the company, after he became treasurer, came properly under the head of “ improvements,” or were represented by the defendant as being part of the improvements which passed under the agreement. It was clearly competent to identify by parol testimony the things which passed by the purchase, or as to which the defendant was estopped by his representation from asserting title in himself.</p>

Several months before the reorganization of the company was effected, but at a time when it was contemplated, Allen sold 250 shares of his stock to F. Hussey, and entered into an agreement in these words: “ In consideration of your purchasing from me two hundred and fifty shares (250 shares) of tbe capital stock of the Crown Slate Company, Bangor, Pa., par value fifty dollars (150) per share or twelve thousand five hundred I agree with you to pay into the treasury on each share four dollars or one thousand dollars immediately upon the call for same by the regular board of directors for the purpose of improvements, after the new organization of the said The Crown Slate Company. This four dollars per share specified is on the stock held by you, viz : 250 shares.” This agreement on its face was clearly not made for the benefit of the company, but as an inducement to Hussey to purchase the stock. He was the only party to be benefited by it, and the company was a stranger to both the agreement and its consideration, and could not maintain an action on it: Blymire v. Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">6 Watts, 182</a>; Guthrie v. Kerr, <a href="/pa/85/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="85 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="440525" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0303-01">85 Pa. 303</a>; Adams v. Kuehn, <a href="/pa/119/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="119 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="558086" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0076-01">119 Pa. 76</a>. It was sought by averments in the statement, to bring the claim within the rule that when the promisor has received money, or property to be converted into money, in trust for a third person, an action may be maintained by the latter. These averments were denied by the affidavit of defense, and no attempt was made to sustain them by proofs. A few days before the trial an <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>amended statement was filed, setting ont more fully and particularly the facts which, it was alleged, gave rise to the trust, and it is now contended that as no answer was filed to the amended statement, the averments must be considered as admitted, and the trust thus established. It appears that the rules of court do not provide for an answer to an amended statement, and the practice has been for the court to specify the time for filing an answer when an amend mentis allowed. No order was made in this case, but the court on the statement of defendant’s counsel that all the averments of the amended statement were denied, directed the plea of non assumpsit to be entered. The case was not tried on the theory that the pleadings made any admission on this subject, and the point is first raised in this court. The case will be treated here as it was tried in the common pleas. The only evidence offered by the plaintiff in support of this claim was the agreement, and its right to recover depended on the legal effect to be given to it.</p>
