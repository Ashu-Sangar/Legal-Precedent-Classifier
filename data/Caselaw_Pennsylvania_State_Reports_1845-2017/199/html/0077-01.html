    <p class="summary" id="b101-9" data-blocks='[["BL_101.15",101,[187,1549,1179,874]]]'>On June 27, 1895, Ida E. Keiser, wife of Abner S. Keiser, a son of David Keiser, made and executed a judgment note to the said David Keiser for $13,384.66. After the death of the said David Keiser, Hannah Keiser, his executrix, entered up the judgment note and issued various executions thereon. Whereupon Ida E. Keiser, alleging that under the will of the said David Keiser she was not expected or required to repay the said money into the estate, but that the same was to await the settlement of the estate, and was then to be deducted from the share coming to said Abner S. Keiser or his representatives, presented her petition and obtained this rule. The rights of the parties, therefore, involve a construction of the will of the said David Keiser. His will and codicil were both made and executed on August 7,1895, and upon his death, March , 1897, were, upon March 29, 1897, duly probated. In his will, after the usual directions for the payment of his just debts and funeral expenses, there is, inter alia, set forth the following items:</p>

The intention of the testator must be gathered from the four corners of the instrument, and the will must receive such a construction, if possible, as will enable every clause in it to have its full force and effect. The mere technical rules of construction must give way to the plainly expressed intention of the testator: Wright’s App., <a href="/pa/89/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="89 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1063275" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0067-01">89 Pa. 67</a>; Eichelberger’s Est., <a href="/pa/135/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="135 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="817393" data-case-paths="/pa/135/0160-01">135 Pa. 160</a>; Newbold v.

    <p class="summary" id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[171,1546,1179,251]]]'>If the intention of the testator was to make the different charges of bonds referred to in this will advancements, it is immaterial whether they were called advancements or debts. The two first above cited authorities conclusively show that the two words are sometimes used interchangeably.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_103.6",103,[170,1804,1178,612]],["BL_104.1",104,[270,357,1185,250]]]'>When the testator made his will, it is clear that he firmly believed he was the possessor of a large and valuable estate, large enough to permit the payment of all moneys charged against or owing him by any daughter-in-law or son-in-law, from the shares of their respective husbands or wife, and leave a handsome surplus for investment as a trust estate. The creation of the trust estates mentioned in the will are necessarily predicated upon the assumption of the existence of funds for that purpose. For example, in the case of Abner S. Keiser, the interest of this trust fund was considered an available fund for him for life, for his wife for life, and then for his children. That after his death this assumption may or may not have been <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>dissipated, does not do away with this evident belief on his part. It is immaterial whether, as contended for on the one hand, the estate is worth more than $80,000, or, on the other hand, very much less than this figure. In either event the amount now will not help us in the determination of the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[270,617,1184,302]]]'>He desired to be fair to all his children. Although some were improvident or unfortunately in debt, necessitating the creation of spendthrift trusts for their protection, there were no favorites. Perfect equality in the distribution between them seems to be his first and prominent thought. He says, “ after her (the wife’s) decease, to my children in equal shares.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[270,926,1184,508]]]'>He contemplated keeping a family book wherein charges were entered against children, daughters-in-law and son-in-law. “ Moneys charged ” and “ moneys owing ” seem to be used interchangeably. The statute of limitations is not a bar to such claims. Combining all these matters in one item, he seems to us to have stamped upon all of them the character of advancements. Thus to construe this item would be in accordance with that equality of distribution which seems to be the keynote of this will; and if an advancement, the executrix must be restrained from any proceedings upon the judgment note.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-7" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[270,1443,1182,293]]]'>But it is not even necessary to construe it an advancement to restrain execution. The testator has in his will indicated his intention as to the indebtedness in question, and by positive direction indicated his wishes in this respect. He has, in plain words, required, not its collection, but its deduction from the share of Abner S. Keiser.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-8" data-blocks='[["BL_104.7",104,[269,1752,1184,550]]]'>If it is to be collected, how can it be deducted from the son’s share ? The executrix must carry out the provisions of the testator’s will, and this positive provision and direction is just as binding as any other part of the will. Keeping this direction in view, the language whether the statute of limitations shall have barred such claims or not has great force in corroborating this position. There is no distribution to children until the widow’s death. This might come after the statute of limitations had barred the claim. Contention might arise. If he had intended the charges or indebtedness should be collected, it would not have occurred to him to mention the statute of limitations.</p>
