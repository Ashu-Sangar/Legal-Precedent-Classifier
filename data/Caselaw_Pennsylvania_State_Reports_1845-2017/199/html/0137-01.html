L. 532, the further objection is made to the appellee’s right to recover, that the devise to the father had become absolute and the property had passed under his will, as therein directed. The paper presented to the register for probate as the will of Abi C. Shaw was her will, and that officer could not have refused to admit it to probate. It had not been revoked by the birth of the appellee, but was still the will of the mother, the provisions of which, however, did not affect the appellee nor her right to inherit all the real estate of the testatrix, subject to the life estate of the husband and father. There was, therefore, nothing in the decree of the register admitting this will to probate from which the appellee could or should have appealed. It was, we repeat, the will of her mother when admitted to probate, is so to-day, and always will remain such, except as to her child, as to whom, in the words of the statute, she died intestate. Within the five years, or after, at any time, the child, in disregard of this will, of no effect as to her, could have claimed, and can claim, from the mother’s estate what the intestate laws gave her. Its probate was for the register. <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Its effect, under the statute, is, at all times, for the court in which that question may arise: Miller’s Estate, <a href="/pa/159/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="159 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="850198" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0562-01">159 Pa. 562</a>.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[274,464,1189,1698]]]'>On the question of the distribution of a testator’s estate, the validity of testamentary provisions depending on matters dehors the record may be inquired into, notwithstanding probate : Craft’s Estate, <a href="/pa/164/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="164 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="860280" data-case-paths="/pa/164/0520-01">164 Pa. 520</a>. In Broe v. Boyle, <a href="/pa/108/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="108 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="539250" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0076-01">108 Pa. 76</a>, relied upon .by the appellant, the will had been absolutely revoked by the marriage of Jane <em>Boyle; </em>but, in the absence of a contest over it within five years from its probate by those who might have insisted upon its absolute revocation by the marriage of the testatrix, it was held to be conclusive. That testatrix, after the death of her husband, had power to devise her real estate as she pleased and to republish her will revoked by her marriage. This one could not devise hers away from a child that might be born to her afterwards. Such a child is here, raising no question about her mother’s will, nor its probate by the register, but pointing to the statute, which declares that the mother did not have power to do what she did, and that, as to her, she died intestate. What we said in Broe v. Boyle, <a href="/pa/108/0076-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="108 Pa. 76" data-case-ids="539250" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0076-01">supra,</a> sustains her, and we now repeat it: “ It is true the register’s jurisdiction in the probate of wills is confined to the question whether the paper has been legally executed as the will of the testator. It does not determine his title to the property,, nor his power to devise or bequeath the same at the time, nor in the manner indicated by the will. Hence it was held, in Hegarty’s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith, 508, in case of the devise for a religious use, and the testator died within a month after the date of the will, the heirs at law of the testator were not concluded by the act of 1856 from claiming the property thus devised, although no caveat nor action at law was entered within five years after the probate of the will. The -probate does not give additional power to do an act which the testator was not authorized to perform, but makes conclusive such a disposition of his property as he was authorized to devise, and did devise, according to the forms of law.”</p>
