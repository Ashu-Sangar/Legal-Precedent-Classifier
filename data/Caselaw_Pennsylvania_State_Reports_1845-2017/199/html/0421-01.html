    <p class="summary" id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.13",446,[275,1025,1183,870]]]'>At the trial it appeared that plaintiff had paid over by check at various times sums of money aggregating about $6,000 to Burd S. Patterson, the solicitor of the defendant, upon the understanding that the money was to be invested in certain mortgages. Patterson embezzled the money, and the plaintiff never received the mortgages. It appeared that Patterson had an office with the trust company in which he attended to the company’s business as well as his own. In his correspondence with plaintiff he used the trust company’s letter heads, and signed himself solicitor. In one of his earlier letters to plaintiff he sent her a copy of the by-laws of the company. Plaintiff had no authority under the by-laws to sell or negotiate the sale of securities to customers, nor to receive moneys from them for the company, and he had no such authority either by the general practice of the company, or by express authority from the company. The evidence failed to disclose any subsequent ratification by the company of Patterson’s acts.</p>
