It is tobe regretted that in a case like the present the court is powerless to grant relief on the ground of inadequacy of price alone. If there were no other reasons why this sale should be set aside, the property of the debtor, who for the time was perhaps rendered financially helpless, would be taken from him and the indebtedness for which it was sold would still remain unpaid.</p>

      <em>We </em>deem the misdescription sufficient to be noticed by the court. The description of the improvements is very unsatisfactory, to say the least. It is further alleged, and we so find, that the attorney who represented the exceptant at the sale was under the impression that the real estate in question was being sold on a different writ from that upon which it was sold, and that the mortgage held by the plaintiff, which was a lien on said property, was not discharged. Whereas, in fact the property was sold upon a fieri facias issued upon a judgment, entered upon a bond with warrant of attorney to confess judgment, <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>which was secured by the said mortgage of said plaintiff. The plaintiff’s attorney having issued both writs, should have been aware of what property was being sold under each writ, but he says he was laboring under a wrong impression, otherwise he would have bid, and would now bid, over $3,000.</p>

It is the policy of the law that the highest price should be obtained at the least expense. It is against the interest of debtors and creditors that the property should be sold for less than its value.”</p>

The misdescription of the property taken in connection with the gross inadequacy of price and the misapprehension of the plaintiff’s attorney concerning the sale was quite sufficient to justify the court in setting it aside. The motion to set aside the sale was followed by the rule prayed for which was subsequently made absolute and resulted in setting the sale aside. It is not necessary to specify the proceedings in detail or to refer to all the <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>testimony pertinent to the question raised by the rule to show cause.
