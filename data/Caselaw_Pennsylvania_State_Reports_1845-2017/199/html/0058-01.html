Rules of law, such as the rule in Shelley’s case, the rules against perpetuities and accumulations, and the rule governing lapsed legacies, etc., are of absolute authority, and against them intention is unavailing; but where there is no rule of law, in the strict sense of the examples mentioned, to prevent the operation of the testator’s intention, that intention, when sufficiently expressed, must control the court in the distribution. While the court is not permitted to dispose of a testator’s estate upon a mere con jecture as to his meaning, and is bound to find the intention clearly expressed in what the testator has written, yet, in the ascertainment of that intent, every' part of the will having relation to the question, may be consulted, considered and compared. In this process, the utmost freedom of investigation into the evidences of intention contained in the will, is possessed by the court. Nowhere has this power been better stated than by Judge Penrose in Duffy’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=36%20W.N.C.%20200" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="36 W.N.C. 200">36 W. N.

No two wills are in all respects alike. Where indeed the same precise form of expression occurs as may have been the subject of some former adjudication, unaffected by any indication of a different intention in other parts of the instrument, the courts, with a view to certainty and stability of titles, will follow the precedent. Counsel can thus be enabled to advise with confidence. Nevertheless, the cardinal canon still holds good, that the intention of the testator of each will separately, is to be gathered from its own four corners. Hence almost every general rule has its recognized special exceptions, with exceptions to such exceptions which bring us back to the general rule again, and this may be and sometimes has been carried even further, in the vain attempt to generalize and classify all the decisions upon this most difficult and doubtful subject—the ascertainment of the intention from the words of a man, who in many cases had no intention at all, the question not being present in his mind at the time the words were used. These remarks are particularly applicable to the controversies which have arisen as to whether future legacies give present vested or contingent interests. The determinations are very numerous—not always reconcilable—and in the nature of the subject this was inevitable. Vice-Chancellor Sir LauncbLOT Shad well has remarked very justly: ‘ The question is one of substance and not of form. The question in all the cases has been whether the testator intended it as a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies, and the answer to this question has been sought for out of the whole will and not in particular expressions.’ ”</p>

Death is certain to happen, and is therefore not a contingent event; but whether or not any of the grandchildren of Frederick Schuldt would attain the age of twenty-one years, was uncertain; and as that age, as appears from a consideration of the whole will, was a part of the original description of, those grandchildren entitled under it, their taking an indefeasible interest was dependent on the condition of their reaching that age. The very terms of the rule as to fractional parts to be enjoyed in succession, precludes its application where there is uncertainty as to objects. The rule is thus stated by Shabswood, J., in Provenchere’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20Pa.%20469" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="67 Pa. 469">67 Pa. 469</a>, “ When the .enjoyment of an entire fund is given in fractional parts, at successive periods, which must eventually arrive, the distinction betwixt time annexed to payment and time annexed to the gift, becomes unimportant.” As declared in the original opinion filed in this ease, the clearly expressed intention of this testator that only those grandchildren who reached the age of twenty-one years should share in the $40,000, brings this case within that class of cases treated in Smith on Executory Interests, secs. 281, 282, under the head of “ Cases where an uncertain event is made part of the description of the devisee or legatee; ” and the attainment of that age was therefore a condition precedent to an indefeasible vesting of a share.</p>

In Smith on Executory Interests, the rule is stated, and its application illustrated, in the 4th section of chapter 8, under the head of “ Cases where a devise or bequest has reference to a future age, or event not forming part of the original description of the devisee or legatee; and there are indications of, or grounds for supposing an immediate <em>vesting; </em>” and, as rule 2 of the 4th section of chapter 8, its terms are thus stated in section 328: “ Where the testator gives the whole of the intermediate income of real estate, or of personal estate, not arising from a charge on real estate, to the person to whom he devises or bequeaths such estate on the attainment of a certain age, but the attainment of that age does not form part of the original description of the devisee or legatee, the interest of the devisee or legatee is vested in right before that age, even though there is no prior distinct gift—no gift at that age; it being considered that the testator merely intended to keep the devisee and legatee out of possession or enjoyment, until he should have become better qualified to manage and more likely to take care of the property.” By the terms of the rule, it does not apply where the attainment of a given age forms part of the original description of the legatee, and like all the presumptions dealt with in the 4th section, the gift of interim income is only an “ indication of or ground for supposing, an immediate vesting.” From the terms of the bequest in question, considered in connection with the other dispositions to grandchildren, I am clearly of the opinion that the objects of the bequest intended by the testator are sufficiently described as grandchildren who reach the age of twenty-one years; and if I am correct in this interpretation, the rule as to presumption from gift of income, has no application.</p>
