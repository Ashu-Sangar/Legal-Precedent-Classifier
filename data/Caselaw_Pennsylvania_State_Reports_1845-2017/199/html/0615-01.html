    <p class="summary" id="b640-6" data-blocks='[["BL_640.6",640,[264,830,1184,871]]]'>The principles governing this case are well settled and have been so long established that we do not feel called upon to enter into a lengthy or elaborate discussion of them-. The defendant is here charged with negligence in failing to prohibit the running at large of dogs in the borough, when it was known to the burgess and councilmen that dogs were bitten by others having the disease known as hydrophobia. Plaintiff’s counsel conceded at the argument - that if any discretion in the matter was left to the burgess and council an action would not lie. Where as here legislative power is vested in them to prohibit the running at large of dogs, and to authorize and direct them to he killed when at large, it is of necessity at all times within their discretion whether or not any restraint shall be placed upon the animals. Upon failure to do so a borough could not be held liable in damages, because that would be equivalent to saying that by this delegation of power to legislate an absolute duty to legislate in a particular wajr was imposed upon councils.</p>

Professor Jackson’s manufactory of fireworks located within the city caught fire, exploded and injured the plaintiff, who claimed damages on the ground that it was the duty of the city to have suppressed the- manufactory; that this duty was neglected, and in consequence of the neglect, he received his injuries. The language of the statutes incorporating that city is almost identical with that of the general borough law, and it was held to be plainly permissive only, and that by the words “shall have power” to cause the removal of any nuisance, etc., were not imperative, and no absolute duty was imposed on councils to suppress the manufactory.</p>

They were found guilty and their conviction was sustained by the Supreme Court. That case is easily distinguishable from the one now under consideration. That was a criminal prosecution of the public officers for the maintenance of a common nuisance upon a public street. This is a private action for civil injuries received, as alleged, by reason of the failure of the borough authorities to exercise its charter powers to prohibit that for which it was in no wise responsible.</p>
