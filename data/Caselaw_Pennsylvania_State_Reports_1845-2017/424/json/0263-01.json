        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nAnsby Y. Purnell died April 12, 1941 leaving a will dated September 21, 1939. He was possessed of a substantial estate. In his will he left his residuary estate \u201cto my wife, Anna S. Purnell, for . . . her natural life, with remainder upon her death to my son, Yerner S. Purnell.\u201d Ansby further provided: \u201cI direct that my personal estate be distributed to my wife, Anna S. Purnell, as life tenant without requiring her to give bond therefore.\u201d Yerner survived his mother, who died February 5, 1962. Anna left all her residuary estate to their son Yerner S. Purnell, who was not only her executor but, as above mentioned, was also the remainder-man under his father\u2019s will.\nUpon Anna\u2019s death, Yerner brought a declaratory judgment proceeding against the District Director of Internal Revenue. The District Director filed an answer to the executor\u2019s petition, the averments of which will hereinafter appear. As the question involved is the determination of the liability of Anna\u2019s estate for a tax claimed by the United States of America, which rarely ever appears at the audit of an account but assesses the tax or brings a separate proceeding to collect the tax it believes to be due, we hold that a declaratory judgment proceeding will lie.\nAnsby\u2019s executors\u2014his son, Yerner, and Anna\u2019s brother, S. H. Smith\u2014filed an account in 1943 showing a residuary estate available for distribution of approximately $98,000, which was awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court \u201cto Anna S. Purnell, life tenant.\u201d At the audit of that account, the Court did not decide or even consider the questions which are raised in this declaratory judgment proceeding.\nExactly what property Anna took at her husband\u2019s death and in what capacity is important, because between 1941 and 1962, Ansby\u2019s property had very greatly enhanced in value as a result of stock dividends, stock splits and the increase in the market value of the stocks and securities which Anna received from her husband\u2019s estate. The District Director of Internal Revenue claimed an estate tax on the increase in the value of the stocks and securities which had been part of Ansby\u2019s residuary estate, under the theory or legal proposition (a) that Anna was the owner of her husband\u2019s entire residuary estate and (b) was merely a debtor to Ansby\u2019s remainderman, and (c) as such, a debtor only in the amount she actually received at the time of distribution of Ansby\u2019s estate. Ansby\u2019s remainderman contended that his mother took his father\u2019s residuary estate as a trustee, and consequently no tax was due the Government on the increased value of Ansby\u2019s securities.\nAt the time Ansby (a) made his will and (b) when he died, the Fiduciaries Act of 1917 (P. L. 447, 20 P.S. \u00a7635) was in effect, and the law governing bequests such as were made by Ansby was well settled. More particularly, where a legal life estate in personalty was bequeathed with remainder to others, and with no power of consumption given to the life tenant, a life tenant could receive absolutely and as her own, all the property of which the testator gave her a life estate, thereby creating merely a debtor-creditor relationship between herself and the remainderman for the value of the property she actually received at the date of distribution. This amount, and only this amount, was payable to the remainderman upon the death of the life tenant. Kirkpatrick\u2019s Estate, 284 Pa. 583, 131 Atl. 361; Weir\u2019s Estate, 251 Pa. 499, 96 Atl. 1086; Letterle\u2019s Estate, 248 Pa. 95, 93 Atl. 935; Reiff\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 145, 16 Atl. 636. We find no testamentary language in Ansby\u2019s will which shows an intent to create a different relationship or result.\nWe further note that in such cases a life tenant could enter security for the value of the property she actually received at the date of distribution, unless the testator provided\u2014as Ansby did\u2014that no security was required; in which event the failure to enter security would not affect the rights of the life tenant or the remaindermen. Kirkpatrick\u2019s Estate, 284 Pa., supra; Strawbridge\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. D. & C. 703 (per Gest, J.); Gillett\u2019s Estate, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 309, 197 Atl. 517.\nWe deem it necessary to discuss several facts since they are somewhat unusual. Ansby\u2019s widow elected to take under her husband\u2019s will; moreover, she also elected to take in kind the stocks and bonds which were listed at their value at the time of distribution to her. On April 28, 1943, the auditing Judge entered a Decree of Distribution which directed Ansby\u2019s executors to distribute to \u201cAnna \u00a13. Purnell, life tenant\u201d the stocks and bonds contained in his residuary estate, which were valued at $97,785.50. No exceptions were ever filed to this Decree. Anna\u2019s election did not expressly state whether she accepted all of her husband\u2019s residuary estate as her own, thereby creating (as above mentioned) a debtor-creditor relationship between herself and Ansby\u2019s remainderman, who was their son; nor did she ever expressly elect to accept Ansby\u2019s testamentary bequest to her as a trust for her life.\nHowever, the parties point to an oral agreement and various actions of the parties which each side claims support their respective contentions.\nAnna S. Purnell was ill a great part of her life, and although her mentality was not impaired, she was confined to her home. Her brother (S. H. Smith), who was one of the two executors of Ansby\u2019s will, virtually managed Anna\u2019s affairs. The shares of stock which were part of Ansby\u2019s residuary estate were registered by him in the name of \u201cAnna S. Purnell, life tenant under the will of Ansby Y. Purnell\u201d and were placed in a safe deposit box which was registered in his name. Anna had no possession, custody or control of these securities or of the safe deposit box. Smith kept two account books and also had another safe deposit box in Anna\u2019s name; the address given was Anna\u2019s home address, and all dividend checks therefrom were sent to her at her home. It was never claimed by any of the parties until after Anna\u2019s death that Anna was a trustee. Verner, the executor of Anna\u2019s estate and the remainderman under the will of both Ansby and Anna, filed a Federal Estate Tax return in which he stated that he had no knowledge of any trusts in which Anna had any interest. However, in the income tax return of Anna S. Purnell for 1953 (which was prepared by an accountant who was employed by Verner), she listed as part of her income a $1,313.50 capital gain which was realized on the redemption of the preferred stock of the Philadelphia Company, which she had received from Ansby\u2019s residuary estate, and paid a tax thereon.\nWe deem it unnecessary to discuss any of the many additional facts which we believe offer no aid in the solution of the question here involved. The Orphans\u2019 Court, in a very able Opinion by Judge Cox, held that Ansby\u2019s will created a debtor-creditor relationship between Anna S. Purnell, life tenant, and Verner S. Purnell, remainderman, and that this relationship was not changed nor her interest increased during her lifetime by her or by any of the parties or by any Court. Cf. Kirkpatrick\u2019s Estate, 284 Pa., supra; Rumsey's Estate, 287 Pa. 448, 135 Atl. 119; Chesnut v. Chesnut, 300 Pa. 146, 151 Atl. 339. With this interpretation and conclusion we agree.\nDecree affirmed, each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Eagen is of the opinion that the Court below lacked jurisdiction to entertain declaratory judgment proceedings and therefore the decree should be vacated and the proceedings dismissed.\nThe record does not disclose whether this proceeding was brought by Verner as executor, or Verner as remainderman under his father\u2019s will.\nSection 23 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1917 provides that if the life tenant refused or was unable to enter security, the Court upon petition of any person interested, should appoint a trustee whose duty was to hold the property in trust, pay the income thereof to the life tenant, and upon her death pay the corpus of the trust fund to the remainderman entitled thereto. In such an event, the life tenant (the widow), would be entitled only to the income therefrom for her life, and after her death the remainder would be awarded to the remainderman. Cases, infra.\nThis was changed by \u00a713 of the Estates Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, 20 P.S. \u00a7301-13, which for all practical purposes made the life tenant a trustee for herself and for the remainderman.",
