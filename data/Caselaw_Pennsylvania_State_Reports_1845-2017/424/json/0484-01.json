Albright Estate, 404 Pa. 152, 154, 171 A. 2d 169, 170 (1961).\nThere is not the slightest suggestion that the decedent received these payments other than under an honest mistake nor that decedent realized that the corporate form which he had created to handle his personal business made his receipt of a government annuity improper. Still, since decedent adopted the corporate entity and undoubtedly secured the benefits therefrom in other situations, the executor cannot now reject the corporate entity and hold it to be a mere fiction and treat the corporate activity as decedent\u2019s personal activity.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.\nMr. Justice Roberts dissents.",
