In <em>Coleman’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/75/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1036659" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0441-01">75 Pa. 441</a> (1874), Justice (later Chief Justice) Shaeswood, construing the Act of 1859, supra, said: “. . . it has not been the policy of our jurisprudence to bring non-residents within the jurisdiction of courts unless in very special cases. . . . We may congratulate ourselves that such has been the policy, for nothing can be more unjust than to drag a man thousands of miles, perhaps from a distant state, and in effect compel him to appear and defend under the penalty of a judgment or decree against him <em>pro confesso. </em>The Act of 1859 ought, therefore, to receive a construction in harmony with this policy. There exists no good reason why courts of equity should be invested with a more enlarged jurisdiction against non-residents than courts of law”, (p. 457). After noting that “there is certainly some uncertainty, in knowing what the legislature [under the Act of 1859, supra], meant by a principal defendant”, (p. 458), the Court concluded that what the legislature intended by the language “principal defendant” was an “active party”, i.e., one so necessarily involved in the subject in controversy that no decree could be made without his being before the court as contrasted with a “passive party”, i.e., where complete relief could be provided in the litigation without affecting the rights of such party, (p <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>459).
