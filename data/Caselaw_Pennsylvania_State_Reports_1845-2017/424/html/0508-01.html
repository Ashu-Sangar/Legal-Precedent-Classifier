In practice, that official discharged the duties imposed on him by the appointment of deputy attorneys general empowered to act as his agents within the several counties. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

In 1850 the General Assembly enacted legislation transferring the duties performed by such appointed deputy attorneys general to an official elected by the voters of the county and designated “district attorney,” Act of May 3, 1850, P.L. 654, §1. Interestingly, the only description of the duties of district attorneys in that act was as follows: “the officer so elected shall sign all bills of indictment, and conduct in court all criminal or other prosecutions in the name of the commonwealth, or when the state is a party, which arise in the county for which he is elected, and perform all the duties which now by law are to be performed by deputy attorney generals. . . .”</p>

An examination of the entire language of Article XIV, as it stood at the time of its adoption, shows that it was concerned solely with the election and compensation of the various “county officers” named in §1.

Germane to the instant question was the following language of §17 (53 P.S. 13131) of the act: “the city . . . shall have and may exercise all powers and authority of <em>local self-government </em>and shall have complete powers of legislation and administration <em>m relation to its municipal functions, </em>including the power and authority to prescribe the elective city officers, who shall be nominated and elected only in the manner provided by, and in accordance with, the provisions of <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>the Pennsylvania Election Code and its amendments, for the nomination and election of municipal officers. The charter . .. may provide for a form or system of municipal government and for the exercise of any and <em>all powers relating to its municipal functions </em>. . . .” (Emphasis supplied.) as well as the following language from §11 (53 P.S. §13111) of the act: “Any new charter or amendments to the charter... shall become the organic law of the city at such time as may be fixed therein. ... So far as the same are consistent with the grant of powers and the limitations, restrictions and regulations hereinafter prescribed, they shall supersede any existing charter and all acts or parts of acts, local, special, or general, <em>affecting the organization, government and powers of such city, to the extent that they are inconsistent or in conflict </em>therewith.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[204,1321,1151,805]]]'>It is clear from an examination of the quoted language that the changes authorized by the First Class City Home Rule Act were restricted to matters affecting local and municipal government. Nowhere is there any intimation that changes in the performance of state functions, which as we have seen the district attorney performs, were authorized. Indeed, nowhere in the First Class City Home Rule Act is there even a reference to the power of the city to affect “county officers” as the district attorney was designated in Article XIY, §1 of the Constitution. Therefore, as far as this legislation is concerned, the General Assembly in no way disturbed pre-existing laws regarding the nature of district attorneys’ functions and duties or the powers of local government with regard to them.</p>

In this case, an attempt has been made to draw from this language the conclusion that the district attorney is a “city officer” for purposes of giving him the subpoena powers created under §8-409 of the Charter. We believe such a result is not warranted because nothing either in the language of Article XIY, §8 or the cases decided under it suggests that the city or its electors were thereby empowered to alter the functions, duties or powers of the offices in question.</p>

The phrases abolishing county offices and stating the “city shall henceforth perform all functions of county government” certainly do not have this effect. For, while the district attorney may have been a “county officer” by virtue of Article XIV, §1, in the sense that he was elected on a county basis, and while his “office” qua “county office” may <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>thereby be abolished, since his functions, powers and duties were never those of “county government”, a phrase vesting such functions, powers and duties in the city has no effect on him.

    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[140,557,1152,1301]]]'>Further support for the conclusion that the designation of an official as a “county officer” in Article XIV, §1 of the Constitution does not, by virtue of Article XIV, §8 make him subject to the Charter in all respects, is provided by the decision of our Court in <em>Lennox v. Clark, </em><a href="/pa/372/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="372 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1238062" data-case-paths="/pa/372/0355-01">372 Pa. 355</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=93%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="93 A.2d 834">93 A. 2d 834</a> (1953). There we held that despite the designation of the prothonotary and register of wills as “county officers” in Article XIV, §1, the adoption of Article XIV, §8 did not convert them into city officers for purposes of making their employees subject to the civil service provisions of the Charter. While this conclusion was based on a reason somewhat distinguishable from the instant case,8 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
      <em>Lennox </em>does indicate that this Court has on a previous occasion eschewed a literal and insensitive interpretation of the designation “county officer” in Article XIV of the Constitution. Moreover, the decision in <em>Lennox </em>is particularly pertinent since we there held that what at first seemed to be the alteration in the character of the offices of prothonotary and register of wills by constitutional language adopted in 1951 had not in fact occurred in light of a careful consideration of the language of Article V, adopted in 1874.</p>

That act cannot be cited as authority for lodging in the district attorney the power to issue subpoenas in the course of his conduct of an investigation. For one thing, the statute vests in the county detectives the power to investigate the magistrates and limits the authority of the district attorney to that of an appointing power.

Thus, when a witness is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury, he appears before a body of sworn arbiters and he enjoys protection because of the very multiplicity of the auditors; when he testifies in court, he does so in an open courtroom under the watchful and protective eye of a judge. But if he is brought before a district attorney, he stands before an accusatory officer, is subjected to an ex parte proceeding, and can call on no one to protect him.
