Six weeks after the accident—-when the child was in a condition of complete physical helplessness—an adjuster called at Walters’ home. Certain nursing bills were discussed and were turned over to the adjuster by the Walters; the adjuster then told Walters that the insurance company did not pay bills “piecemeal”, that it would have to be a “lump sum settlement”, that by reason of the child’s minority, any settlement would have to be <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>approved by the court and that no settlement could be made until the child was “rehabilitated”. Two days later, the adjuster returned the nursing bills to the Walters. <em>Until April 17, 1961—two years and nine months after the accident—there was no further contact between the insurance carrier or its adjuster and the Walters.</em>

When Walters filed their complaint, Ditzler, acting through his insurance carrier, filed an answer containing new matter which raised the defense of the statute of limitations to which new matter Walters filed a reply alleging Ditzler was estopped to raise the defense of the statute by reason of the conduct of the insurance company adjuster when he visited the Walters’ home on August 16, 1958. Ditzler filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings which was dismissed. Walters then filed an amended reply wherein the allegations <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>as to the adjuster’s alleged fraudulent and misleading conduct were particularized and wherein there was an additional allegation that, by reason of the minority and incompetency of the child, the bar of the statute was tolled.

There is no factual dispute that the negotiations were merely toward an amicable settlement.

    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[146,891,1154,1194]]]'>A review of this record convinces us that there is not even a scintilla of proof of any fraud, concealment or deception such as would justify the invocation of the doctrine of estoppel to toll the running of the statute. On the contrary, this record, clearly and distinctly, indicates that Walters slept on their rights and took no steps whatsoever toward the recovery of compensation for the injuries suffered by their child. They made absolutely no effort to contact the insurance company after the initial and sole visit of the adjuster. They finally contacted the insurance company approximately two and three-quarter years after the happening of the accident. Highly significant and indicative of Walters’ supine negligence, lassitude and lack of diligence is the uncontradicted fact that, even after they had been notified that the insurance company could not aid them in the matter, they waited for approximately fourteen months before they instituted this action. It is indeed unfortunate that the severe injuries suffered by this child cannot be redressed; the fault however, lies not with the insurance carrier or Ditzler but with the parents of the child.</p>

The children would drop flowers into the brook on the upstream side of the bridge and then joyfully race to the other side of the bridge to see the flowers pass by on the bosom of the stream on its way to river which would eventually pour into the parent body of waters far away. While darting from the upstream to the downstream side of the bridge, Daniel was struck by a car being driven by A. F. Ditzler, the nominal defendant in this case.</p>

Walters knew nothing about the statute of limitations. He had an eighth grade education. He had five small children; he lived in a renovated garage. Neither his sociological status nor his limited studies would acquaint him with a statute of limitations.</p>

The whole record in this case points to but one conclusion and that is that William Walters honestly believed that the insurance company would take care of the ease and that there was nothing for him to do until the insurance company took action. The driver of the offending car, Ditzler, told him, not only shortly after the accident that the insurance company would be responsible for damages, but even at a time which happened to be subsequent to the two-year period following the accident. At no time did the insurance company inform Walters that they would not be liable until, of course, their letter of April 28, 1961.</p>

In the first place, the insurance adjuster had led Walters to believe that the company could make no payments until there was an approval in court. Walters could well have believed that the insurance company would take the initiative. When the insurance company then informed him of its disinclination to do anything, he felt himself in a fog of bewilderment: “Q. . . . Will you tell us now why you didn’t bring it to them—this matter—until June 4, 1962—almost fifteen months later? A. Well I didn’t know I could do anything. Q. . .

It is true, as the Majority Opinion states, that, in order to toll the statute of limitations, the aggrieved person must show fraud, deception or concealment of facts.

Strez said, as clear as language can make it, that the insurance company could not pay the Walter’s claim until the disabled boy had been rehabilitated.

Is justice to be denied them because they accepted at face value what the insurance company, through their agent, had said, the same insurance company which had received the premiums of Ditzler to cover just such a situation as this one? Ditzler, the Walters parents, the Lancaster Society for Crippled Children were all waiting for the insurance company to take up its responsibilities. In the meanwhile, the days and months, like the flowers Daniel had dropped in Sieglock Brook, were floating out on the sea of time. The insurance company, through passive deception, were allowing the parents of the wrecked boy, to look for the return of a ship the insurance company knew would not sail into the port of contractual fulfillment.</p>

The defendant pleaded statute of limitations. The evidence revealed that the insurance company, through its agents, had talked settlement with the plaintiff. The adjuster, as is true in this case, told the plaintiff that it could not make interim payments and that only one lump sum could be paid when all the facts were ascertained. This Court, in reviewing the record in that case, said: “He [the adjuster] concealed the fact that the carrier considered the case one of nonliability. Admittedly, he did not mention the statute of limitations because before this visit he had discussed this point with a superior and was specifically instructed not to do so. He inquired of and noted the additional expenses that had been incurred. Upon leaving, he said that he would see her again and that she should phone him if anything turned up.
