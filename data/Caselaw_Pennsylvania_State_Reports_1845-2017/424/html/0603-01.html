    <p id="b628-12" data-blocks='[["BL_628.19",628,[210,1793,1151,315]]]'>In 1959, the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the City of Philadelphia (Board) granted to Jerome Gross two variances: one to use a property owned jointly with his wife, zoned “R-10” Residential,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> as a bowling alley; and, the other to increase the size of the building so as to cover one hundred per cent of the lot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b628-13" data-blocks='[["BL_628.20",628,[210,2119,1148,96]],["BL_629.1",629,[125,390,1154,317]]]'>In 1965, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board approved the transfer of a liquor license to the prem<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>ises, subject to the construction of appropriate facilities. Gross then partitioned off a part of the building interior from the bowling alley area, and installed therein facilities necessary for the operation of a restaurant, snack bar and luncheonette. This restaurant area measures twelve feet by fifty-one feet.</p>
    <p id="b629-3" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[128,719,1156,1193]]]'>Shortly thereafter, Gross applied to the Board for a permit to operate a restaurant, snack bar and luncheonette on the premises, including the sale of alcoholic beverages for the convenience of his bowling customers. The permit was denied. On appeal, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County concluded that the proposed restaurant facility constituted an “accessory use” to the bowling alley, as that term is defined in the Philadelphia Zoning Code,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that the Board erred as a matter of law in denying the permit for this facility. However, the court further ruled that the sale of alcoholic beverages is not such an accessory use to a bowling alley and affirmed the Board’s action in denying the permit to use the premises for this purpose. Upon petition of both Gross and the City, we granted certiorari under Rule 68% and both filed timely appeals. Since no additional testimony was taken in the court below, our review is limited to the determination of whether or not the Board committed an error of law or was guilty of a manifest abuse of discretion: <em>Brennen v.

    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[224,822,1152,480]]]'>The record also discloses that the proposed restaurant facility will not be a new or independent enterprise, but merely ancillary to the main business; that it will entail no expansion of the present building; that it will occupy only 3.5% of the business premises; and, that the income will constitute only a small fraction of the gross business income. Under these facts, we agree with the lower court that the proposed restaurant facility is an accessory use under the particular code.</p>

Pitt. L. Rev. 747</a> (1961). Pennsylvania’s ruling in this respect is premised upon the view that the owner of property to which a lawful nonconforming use has attached enjoys a vested property right thereto which may not be abrogated, unless it is a nuisance, or abandoned, or is extinguished by eminent domain (See <em>Eitnier v. Kreitz Corp., </em>supra, and <em>Penn Township v. Yecko Bros., </em><a href="/pa/420/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="420 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1898570" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0386-01">420 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=217%20A.2d%20171" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="217 A.2d 171">217 A. 2d 171</a> (1966)), and that a zoning ordinance cannot preclude a natural and reasonable expansion thereof. It appears to us that a use permitted by variance or special dispensation is comparable and establishes in the property owner a vested right similar to that in the lawful nonconforming use situation. If this be <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>so, then logic and fairness compel the conclusion that the granted use may be added to by a normal and reasonable use flowing therefrom. The contrary would be similar to giving one a cake but denying him reasonable frosting therefor.</p>
