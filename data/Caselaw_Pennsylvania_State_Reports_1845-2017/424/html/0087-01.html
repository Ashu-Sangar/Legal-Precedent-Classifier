I see nothing wrong with that charge. The majority do not dispute the principle that the burden is on the condemnee to prove his damages. But that is no different from requiring the condemnee to overcome the Commonwealth’s evidence as to damages. Actually, the lower court’s charge was favorable to the instant con<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>demnees because it lessened their burden to proving only that they suffered damages in excess of the amount testified to by the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses. In effect, the charge established a plateau below which the jury could not find, but did not in any way establish a ceiling on damages. Under <em>Ray v. </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/344/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="344 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1210940" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0439-01">344 Pa. 439</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20145" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="25 A.2d 145">25 A. 2d 145</a> (1942), this constituted usurpation of the jury’s function, but only the condemnor may complain. In the instant matter, the Commonwealth has not raised the issue, and we should not permit it to be raised by the condemnees.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[213,992,1150,479]]]'>I would further point out that although a Commonwealth expert witness referred to a legally opened street as a “paper street” he explained that in evaluating plaintiff’s right in the street he gave full consideration to the rights of ingress and egress. Moreover, the court charged that the street should be considered as legally opened, and it was so described by other witnesses. I am satisfied that any error was cured and that we should affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>
