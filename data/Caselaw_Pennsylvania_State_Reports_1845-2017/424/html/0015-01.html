On April 4, 1955, when he entered a plea of guilty and also at his trial he was represented by counsel. No objection was made at the trial to the admission of his confession. Even more important, petitioner took the witness stand and testified to substantially the same facts as were contained in his confession. We have frequently and consistently held that such circumstances preclude a subsequent challenge to the admission of the confession on habeas corpus. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Parker v.
