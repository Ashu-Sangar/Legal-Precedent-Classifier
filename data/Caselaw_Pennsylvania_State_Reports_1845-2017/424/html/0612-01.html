That question is whether a new trial should be granted because of a secret communication between judge and jury without the presence of counsel.</p>

After breaking for lunch, the jury at 2:00 p.m. sent the following note to the trial judge: “Judge Catania: We have made a verdict and we would like to know if the same figure goes on both verdict papers or do we split the amount?” The trial judge replied in the following writing: “If you find Defendant ‘A’ negligent then you have a duty of fixing the extent of ‘A’s’ liability. If you find Defendant ‘B’ also negligent then you must fix the damages to which the Plaintiff is entitled from Defendant ‘B’ ”. At the very time that this communication occurred counsel for appellants was present in the trial judge’s courtroom engaged in the trial of a different case.

(The Jury retires from the Court Room at 3:09 P.M.) (The Jury returns to the Court Room at 3 .TO P.M.) The Court: All right. May I have the note; I would like to make this part of the record. At 2:00 P.M. the Jury sent out the following note addressed to me. ‘Judge Catania: We have made a verdict and we would like to know if the same figure goes on both verdict papers or do we split the amount?’ And the answer I sent back: ‘If you find Defendant “A” negligent then you have a duty of fixing the extent of “A’s” liability. If you find Defendant “B” also negligent then you must fix the damages to which the Plaintiff is entitled from Defendant “B”.’ Then I signed it. All right, will you take the verdict.

It is by no means a novel concept that after the jury have retired to deliberate on their verdict any communication between them and the trial judge in the absence of counsel for the parties is reversible error. This was the holding of <em>Bunn v. Croul, </em>10 Johns. R. 239 (N.Y. <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>1813), and <em>Sargent v.

The unsavory overtones of clandestine instructions from judge to jury are so obviously unfair to judges, lawyers and litigants that no other approach than an absolute prohibition is warranted. To approach this problem on an ad hoc basis, as some members of this Court have advocated, is to expose the judicial system to baseless speculation by the general public as to the honesty and integrity of its members. I can cite no more appropriate language than the words of Chief Justice Bell, speaking for a unanimous Court in <em>Glendenning v. Sprowls, </em><a href="/pa/405/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="405 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1303618" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0222-01">405 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=174%20A.2d%20865" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="174 A.2d 865">174 A. 2d 865</a> (1961), to the effect that: “It has been wisely stated that ‘next to the tribunal being in fact impartial is the importance of its appearing so’: Shrager v. Basil Dighton Ltd., (1924) 1 K.B. 274, 284. This applies in a special way to the Judge and his relationship with the jury. Without doubting the worthy motives or the well-intentioned solicitude of the Judge for the wishes and welfare of the jurors, private communication by a Judge to or with the jury in the jury room and in the absence of counsel is almost certain to create suspicions and a belief of unfairness in the minds of many people. It opens wide the door to possible fraud and to unintentional or possibly intentional influence of a jury and thus impairs confidence in the Court: Sommer v.

At the conclusion of his opinion in <em>Glendenning, </em>the Chief Justice stated: “We cannot safe<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>ly leave a Judge’s intrusion into a jury room to a consideration of his motives, or the language of a Judge’s private communication to the memory or to the subsequent recollection or interpretation of the trial Judge and a possibly different recollection or interpretation thereof by jurors. <em>We strongly condemn </em>any intrusion by a Judge into the jury room during the jury’s deliberations, or <em>any communication by a Judge with the jury without prior notice to counsel, </em>and such practice must be immediately stopped!” (Emphasis supplied).

That was a case in which the Judge’s actions could not possibly be justified, and prejudice might easily have resulted and have influenced the jury’s verdict. In <em>Q-lendenning, </em>the Judge visited the jury room no less than six times and allowed a juror to leave the jury room in the company of the Judge to telephone the juror’s allegedly jealous wife.

Mr. Cherry: Before the panel is discharged, so the Court may properly mold the verdict, would your Honor ask the Foreman whether or not the amount of that verdict is the amount of the total amount figured together?

Let us look at <em>Glendenning </em>to see how much it resembles the facts in the case at bar. The <em>Glendenning </em>case had absolutely nothing to do with a judge sending a message to the jury. In that case the judge physically went into the jury room. And not only once. While the jury was deliberating, he entered into their sanctuary of deliberation six different times! On one of these visits <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>he spoke to a juror and escorted him to the telephone so that the latter could talk to his wife. In explaining how it came about that he almost turned the passage between his chambers and the jurors’ quarters into a revolving door, the judge related that he went into the jury room to provide the jurors with a pitcher of water; to arrange for a ride home for a juror; to tell the jury to refrain from arguing too loudly because they might be overheard; to allow a juror to leave the jury room and telephone his jealous wife(!); and to tell a juror that it was none of the jury’s business when a juror asked him if insurance had anything to do with the case. Short of swinging a hammock in the jury room and undulating in it to the rhythm of the jury’s animated discussions, it is difficult to visualize a more companionable association between judge and jury than in the <em>Glendenning </em>case where the judge played water boy, transportation clerk, and heart salver.</p>
