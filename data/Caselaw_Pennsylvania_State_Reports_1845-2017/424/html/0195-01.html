Summers (Summers), appeals from a decree of the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County, No. 132- of 1963 refusing and dismissing his petition which prayed that an order be entered directing William Patton (Patton) and/or Hufstader-Oadillac, Inc. (Hufstader) to return one 1963 Cadillac coupe to the estate of Summers or, in the event of its resale, to account for its selling price. The orphans’ court found both possession and <em>actual </em>ownership of the Cadillac to be vested in Patton.</p>

Patton owned a 1961 Chrysler titled in his wife’s maiden name, Eva McDaniels, and which, in May, he wanted to trade in for a 1962 Cadillac from Hufstader. After discussing the proposed purchase with a salesman and being advised that, while no sale could be made to him personally, a purchase could be made in the name of a person with a good credit rating, Patton contacted Summers. Summers agreed that the 1962 Cadillac should be pur<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>chased in his name and he would sign the installment sales contract and this was done. The Chrysler was traded in, Summers signed the installment sales contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> the balance of the purchase price was financed by the Mellon National Bank and Trust Co. (Mellon Bank) and Patton took possession of the car and made finance payments or supplied the money for finance payments made by Summers to the Mellon Bank.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[132,826,1151,479]]]'>In June of 1963, Patton again went to Hufstader to purchase a 1963 Cadillac. The 1962 Cadillac was traded in and the balance of the purchase price on the 1963 Cadillac was financed by the Mellon Bank. Both Patton and Summers signed the installment sales contract and, again title was taken in Summers name and, as is standard practice as part of the financing plan, an insurance policy was issued on Summers’ life. Again, Patton made the finance payments.</p>
    <p id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[133,1317,1152,359]]]'>On December 8, 1963, Summers died intestate, survived by his widow, Lulu Summers. The insurance company paid the balance of finance payments on the 1963 Cadillac ($4,246.13) and the Mellon Bank marked the title “Encumbrances satisfied” and on January 3, 1964, mailed it to “James M. Summers: attention of Mrs. Summers”.</p>

There he was informed that before Hufstader could accept title to the 1963 Cadillac there would have to be an assignment of the certificate of title by whoever was executor of Summers’ estate. Thereupon started a series of startling events. Somehow Patton came into possession of the title. On December 31, 1963, two persons allegedly ap<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>peared before a notary public, represented themselves to be James M. and Lulu Summers, and executed an assignment of certificate of title.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In February 1964, Hufstader reassigned the title to one V. I. Mahdich who, upon learning of the fraud, returned the car to Hufstader. Hufstader later sold the Cadillac to a New York dealer.</p>
    <p id="b222-5" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[200,764,1151,1235]]]'>Our Vehicle Code, Act of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, §201, §3201 (a), 75 P.S. §201 provides: “(a) No person who is a resident of this Commonwealth shall own a motor vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer, in this Commonwealth unless a certificate of title therefor shall have been obtained as provided in this act.” Petitioner argues this statutory provision proscribes any such thing as equitable ownership of motor vehicles and that no ownership can exist in one who does not hold a Certificate of Title. This argument is without merit. The mere fact that The Vehicle Code was violated by not placing title in Patton’s name per se does not render void the transaction between Patton and Summers so as to result in ownership of the Cadillac being in Summers. Although an indicium of ownership, a certificate of title is not conclusive evidence of ownership, of a motor vehicle but rather establishes the person entitled to <em>possession: Speck Cadillac-Olds, Inc. v.

Restatement 2d, Trusts, §404 (1959). The evidence clearly, precisely and convincingly establishes that Summers had bare legal title only while Patton had the beneficial interest together with possession.</p>

Where one purchases property and for the purpose of defrauding his creditors takes title in the name of another upon a secret trust for him, the purported trust is invalid.

Title was here taken in Summers’ name because Hufstader would not allow Patton credit and no intent to defraud has been shown. The inference that the transaction was for such purpose is rebutted by the fact that Patton raised his mortgage and paid off all his creditors.</p>

Citing our Insurance Law, Act of May 17, 1921, P.L. 682, as amended, 40 P.S. §512, which provides “no person shall cause to be insured the life of another, unless the beneficiary named in such policy or agreement of life insurance . . . has an insurable interest in the life of the insured . . . .” and petitioner maintains that Patton, in paying the premiums, in effect in<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>sured Summers’s life with himself as the beneficiary— a life in which he had no insurable interest.

Mayer, </em><a href="/pa/256/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="256 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="1030781" data-case-paths="/pa/256/0151-01">256 Pa. 151</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.%20587" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="100 A. 587">100 A. 587</a> (1917) which does not support him. <em>Haberfeld </em>states (at pp. 153-4) that the personal representative of an insured can recover back the amount paid to a beneficiary where the person <em>who took out the insurance </em>and paid the premiums, or took an assignment of a policy already issued, has no insurable interest on the life of the insured. Patton did not take out the insurance nor did he take an assignment of it. Summers, not Patton, took out the insurance as part of the installment sales contract, and we note, parenthetically, that both Summers and Patton were liable on that contract.</p>
