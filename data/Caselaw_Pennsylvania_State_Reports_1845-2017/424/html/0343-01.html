    <p id="b368-9" data-blocks='[["BL_368.14",368,[184,1697,1151,696]]]'>In both cases, the appellants, Borg-Warner Corp. and Textron, Inc., purchased tracts of realty, and at the time the deeds were recorded, affixed realty transfer stamps. Thereafter, the Dept, of Revenue, ascertaining that the proper tax had not been paid, made assessments for additional realty transfer tax against the appellants. The appellants then filed petitions for redetermination with the Dept, of Revenue, and later, petitions for review with the Board of Finance and Revenue. Appellants’ petitions were refused, and, following this refusal, appellants filed their respective appeals with the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County.</p>

Appellant concluded its petition by contending that if a favorable decision to appellant was forthcoming in a case <em>(Commonwealth v.

This same procedure was followed by Textron, Inc.</p>
    <p id="b370-5" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[213,1099,1149,589]]]'>Subsequent to appellants’ respective petitions to the Board of Finance and Revenue, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County handed down its decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

L. 1742, as amended, with regard to any transaction occurring prior to September 3,1957. This was exactly the issue in appellants’ cases prior to the entry of the Stipulation for Judgment.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.7",370,[208,1700,1151,368]]]'>Appellants, in January of 1965, requested the Board of Finance and Revenue to act on their respective petitions for refund, and, by an order dated April 23, 1965, the board refused their petitions. Appellants then filed with this court petitions for the allowance of an appeal, pursuant to our Rule 68%, and we granted the petitions.</p>

L. 343, 72 P.S. §503,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> averring that the Board of Finance <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>and Revenue bad jurisdiction to bear appellants’ petition for refund; that tbe termination of tbe litigation and entry of a stipulation for judgment is of no conse-. quence; and that tbe doctrines of res judicata and esstoppel are inapplicable and cannot be invoked to defeat tbe appellants’ right to a refund. Appellants further contend that under our decision in <em>Hotel Casey Co. v. Ross, </em><a href="/pa/343/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="343 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1208315" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0573-01">343 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="23 A.2d 737">23 A. 2d 737</a> (1942), tbe board’s duty to grant tbe refunds is mandatory in tbe circumstances of appellants’ cases.</p>

Ross, </em>supra, we said: “While tbe Board of Finance and Revenue is authorized to determine whether a tax or money has been paid to tbe Commonwealth to which it was not ‘rightfully or equitably entitléd’, or, more specifically, as here, may find whether a tax or money has been paid under an interpretation of law subsequently held to be erroneous by a court of final jurisdiction,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>if such facts are found in favor of the taxpayer the duty to order a refund or credit is mandatory.” “The act refers to taxes which have been paid but to which the Commonwealth is not <em>rightfully </em>or <em>equitably </em>entitled. It thereby recognized a moral obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to return moneys which, under the decisions such as the Shenango Furnace Company case, supra, were not legal obligations. Clause (a) (4) of Sec. 503 conclusively shows that the legislature had in mind something more than taxes paid involuntarily, for it established a longer period of limitation for the filing of a petition for refund when any tax or other money had been paid to the Commonwealth under the provisions of an act subsequently held by the court of final jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or paid under an interpretation of a provision subsequently held by such court to be erroneous.” (Emphasis in original)</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[223,1375,1150,752]]]'>Assuming, then, that the contentions of appellants as to their being entitled to refunds are correct, would the stipulation for judgment entered into by both sides and subsequently satisfied become a binding contract on both parties disposing in fact of all issues and questions and constituting res judicata? One needs no citations for the proposition that once an agreement or stipulation is entered into, a later decision more favorable to one side than the other does not allow the side so favored to withdraw from the prior agreement or stipulation, totally disregarding all that had transpired, and begin to relitigate a settled case. We must determine whether §503 of The Fiscal Code makes the principle of res judicata inapplicable here.</p>

Rather, the taxes were paid as the <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>result of stipulations entered into between the taxpayers and the Commonwealth, in settlement and compromise of litigation then in progress between the taxpayers and the Commonwealth. There is much more than a tacit admission by the taxpayers that the determination made by the Commonwealth was proper and legal, inasmuch as the stipulations state on their face that the taxpayers agreed to abandon such contentions. We will not permit the taxpayers in these circumstances to withdraw from the agreement previously entered of record in the earlier litigation.</p>
