The connotations of the term “duty” in such a context are such that the jury may well conclude that a guilty verdict is the only choice they have, and thus such an instruction would effectively interfere with the jury’s right to solely determine the question of guilt or innocence.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

      <em>Ott </em>is controlling and requires the grant of a new trial in the instant case. While it is, therefore, unnecessary to reach the remaining assignments of error, we deem it expedient to discuss another portion of the trial court’s instruction to the jury in order to discourage similar practices in the future.</p>
    <p id="b73-3" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[121,1250,1152,801]]]'>In compliance with the jury’s request, the trial court defined the penalties for voluntary manslaughter, second degree murder and first degree murder. The jury has nothing to do with the punishment of an offense, except in the single situation governed by the so-called “Split-Verdict Act,” Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, amending §701 of The Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, 18 P.S. §4701. In all other instances punishment is a matter solely for the court and not for the jury to know or consider during its deliberations. While no objection was voiced by counsel when the explanation under discussion was given in the instant case, we advise trial courts to refrain from such discussion with the jury in the future, regardless of counsel’s position in the matter.</p>

In other words, the verdict is entirely and completely a matter for the jury in their uncontrolled discretion, irrespective of any opinion which the Judge may have in the case.
