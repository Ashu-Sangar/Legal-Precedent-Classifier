Obviously the manner in which to provide these youthful wayfarers with a fair measure of protection against highway mishap is to keep them pedally off the roads and to transport them in vehicles so formidably constructed that they may ward off and parry, to the maximum extent possible, aggression from other vehicles. The school bus with its large heavy wheels and steel fabricated body seems to be the answer to the worrisome problem. Pennsylvania Secretary of Public Welfare, in testifying on House Bill 381 (later to become Act 91) before the Senate Education Committee, said: “. . . school bus transportation clearly involves the safety and health of our children.

They point to the First <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which declares, inter alia, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and argue that Act 91 offends against it.</p>

And even if the children are transported to a school which, in addition to teaching state-approved subjects, offers guidance in the world of faith, this still does not establish a religion. Our whole body of school law is predicated on the proposition that once children are served educationally according to State criteria, their extracurricular activities cannot adversely affect the State, constitutionally. Indeed, the Public School Code specifically embraces the concept of nonpublic schools, the title explaining that the law relates to “the public school system, including certain provisions applicable as well to private and parochial schools.”</p>

The State awards to nonpublic school students the same scholastic credits as those which are earned by public school students. It would be grossly illogical, therefore, to say that the State which does not differentiate between public and nonpublie pupils, so far as grades, promotion, and graduation are concerned, cleaves a line of distinction between them according to whether they arrive at the school on school buses, in private motor cars or on foot.</p>

The huge budgets required to maintain our public school system is a matter of concern to everybody. The imperative need for the best in education for the youth of our Commonwealth convinces the civic-minded citizens of the inevitability of heavy taxes to meet the expense, but it does not lessen the weight of the financial burden he must carry. Therefore, any procedure which may lighten that burden, consistent with maintaining the highest State educational standards, is warmly welcomed by the taxpayers. Thus, for every nonpublic school pupil picked up on the road by a public school bus, that much weight is lifted from the back of the taxpayer because the maintenance of nonpublic schools, of course, does not depend upon public funds.</p>

In 1911 the Pennsylvania Legislature enacted a law <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> providing for the establishment of manual training schools for all children, public and nonpublic. It specifically stated that “no pupil shall be refused admission to the courses in these additional schools or departments, by reason of the fact that his elementary or academic education is being or has been received in a school other than a public school.” When a 13-year-old pupil of a private school endeavored to obtain this manual training, taught in a public school in Altoona, the school district involved refused him admittance, arguing that the Act was unconstitutional in that it would give “to private and sectarian schools the use of moneys raised for the public schools, contrary to Article IX, §7, and Article X, §2, of the Constitution.” The Act specifically stated that the manual training school was to be “an integral part of the public school system in such school district.” Despite this language which <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>went much further in linking public and private schools in an educational undertaking than Act 91 here being discussed, our Court held that the Act was constitutional, stating: “The benefits and advantages of these additional schools and means of education and improvement are not restricted to the pupils in regular attendance at the elementary public schools and pursuing the entire prescribed elementary courses, but are intended to be free to all ‘persons residing in such district’. . .” <em>(Comm. v.

The Public School Code provides that school district funds may be used for traffic safety purposes: “The board of directors of any school district acting alone or with another district or districts, may contribute funds to another political subdivision for the erection and maintenance of stop and go signal lights, blinkers or other like traffic control devices.” (1949, March 10, P.

Board of Education, </em><a href="/us/330/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="330 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="353633" data-case-paths="/us/330/0001-01">330 U.S. 1</a>, where the constitutionality of a New Jersey statute was attacked because it authorized reimbursement to parents for fares paid for transporting by public carrier children attending public and Catholic schools. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the statute did not offend against the Federal Constitution: “. . . we cannot say that the First Amendment prohibits New Jersey from spending tax-raised funds to pay the bus fares of parochial school pupils as a part of a general program under which it pays the fares of pupils attending public <em>and other schools. </em>It is undoubtedly true that children are helped to get to church schools. There is even a possibility that some of the children might not be sent to the church schools if the parents were compelled to pay their children’s bus fares out of their own pockets when transportation to a public school would have been paid for by the State. The same possibility exists where the state requires a local transit company to provide reduced fares to school children including those attending parochial schools, or where a municipally owned transportation system undertakes to carry all school children free of charge. Moreover, state-paid policemen, detailed to protect children going to and from church schools from the very real hazards of traffic, would serve much the same <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>purpose and accomplish much the same result as state provisions intended to guarantee free transportation of a kind which the state deems to be best for the school children’s welfare. And parents might refuse to risk their children to the serious danger of traffic accidents going to and from parochial schools, the approaches to which were not protected by policemen. Similarly, parents might be reluctant to permit their children to attend schools which the state had cut off from such general government services as ordinary police and fire protection, connections for sewage disposal, public highways and sidewalks. Of course, cutting off church schools from these services, so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function, would make it far more difficult for the schools to operate. But such is obviously not the purpose of the First Amendment.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

The State contributed no money to these schools; it did not support them. The legislation which provided for the busing of the parochial children did “no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from accredited schools.” Therefore, the law was not at odds with the First Amendment. The same is true of Pennsylvania’s Act 91. In its discussion the Supreme Court referred to the case of <em>Pierce v. Society of </em>Sisters, <a href="/us/268/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="268 U.S. 510" data-case-ids="13076" data-case-paths="/us/268/0510-01">268 U.S. 510</a>. There, the State of Oregon had passed a law requiring parents, under penalty of punishment for disobedience, to send their children to public schools.

The Court said: “The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>Ms destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.” (p. 535)</p>

When the Constitution of 1874 was being debated in convention, no reference was made to the subject of pupil transportation. Supporting a place of worship meant providing funds for the maintenance of a church. The phrase certainly could not have referred to motor transportation. The concept of a horseless buggy was as unimaginable in 1873, as walking on air 150 miles above the earth was inconceivable in 1946. The first automobile to awe human beings, excite communities and startle animals did not honk a horn or turn a wheel until 1892.

The general gayety, levity and juvenile frivolity which prevails among children riding any transportational vehicle rules out the solemnity of a place of worship. Nor can transporting a child to a church-connected school be regarded as supporting a place of worship. The purpose of the school bus is to take children to a structure where they will receive a secular education.

We can take judicial note of the fact that in recent years noble efforts have been made in establishing inter-faith councils, leading to the hope fulfillment of wiping away antagonisms between different churches and beliefs. Bringing children together in buses on their way to the temple of learning can only help to hasten the eventual attainment of the true brotherhood of man. The friendships made by children as they travel side by side and in conversational intimacy, to and from school and home, in the most formative years of their lives, will grow stronger with the passing of the years, increasing the mutual understanding which is the most potent welder in a common cause for peace and happiness.</p>

It is the inevitability of these points of contact which has undoubtedly permitted to exist, without significant successful challenge, the provision of many governmental services—fire, police, sewage—which in some sense benefit the conduct of religious institutions.

I also agree with the Court that such a conclusion is a crucial factor in determining the constitutionality of Act 91. It is my belief, however, that the constitutionality of legislation which benefits directly or indirectly a church-related institution may not be held constitutional merely because it is determined that the purpose or effect of the legislation is the welfare of children or, for that matter, any other proper object of legislative concern. Our Constitution’s prohibition of any compelled support of a place of worship, maintenance of a ministry or preference of religion encompasses not only the proscription of financial aids to religion, but also any other governmental action creating special government approval of or involvement with religious activities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> And, the background of the Commonwealth’s constitu<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>tional pronouncements on freedom of religion suggests strongly that prohibition of such aid to religion is, if anything, stricter than the proscription of financial aids.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Moreover, for such non-financial governmental involvement or approval to be constitutionally proscribed, a measure need not be as blatantly violative as a statute compelling weekly attendance at a house of worship. Far less overt forms of involvement and association would, in my view also be constitutionally void, and I can imagine measures which, though they arguably come within the child benefit theory, would bring government and religious institutions in such close association as to constitute, by virtue of implicit sanction of the government presence, the proscribed “support”, “maintenance”, and “preference”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_6" id="ref_footnote_3_6">6</a>

In other words, though I accept the conclusion that not only actual teaching of religion, but also the conduct of many other programs in parochial schools, is infused with religious significance, it seems to me clear that the process of transporting parochial students in a public bus is so devoid of any psychological, let alone religious, significance, that it does not bring the government into an association with the school which implies the approval or sanction proscribed by <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>our Constitution. Indeed, the mere geographical distinctness of the facility being provided out of public funds and church-related institution underscores the lack of involvement of government with religion that Act 91 creates. The simple fact is that Act 91 does not even envision the use of a public facility within the confines of a religious institution; on the contrary, the language of Act 91 suggests that in many instances parochial school students will not even be carried to the doors of their schools.</p>

It must be remembered that “courts may not question the wisdom of the legislative classification unless there can be found no reasonable ground for it”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a> and that “the reasonableness of the classification made is for the Legislature in the first instance.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_9" id="ref_footnote_3_9">9</a> The Legislature’s exclusion of children attending schools operated for profit may have been motivated by a judgment that families of means sufficient to afford such schooling are not, like families of students attending nonprofit schooling, deterred by cost from ensuring that their children travel to and from school by a safe method of transportation. I fail to see why that would not be a basis for classification reasonable within this Court’s above mentioned test. As to Mr. Chief Justice Beli/S contention that Act 91’s exclusion of children attending schools operated for profit reveals it as solely intended to benefit sectarian education, the answer is simple: Act 91 includes not only children attending <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>sectarian schools not operated for profit, but also children attending wow-sectarian, <em>non-public </em>schools not operated for profit.</p>

The statute authorizes busing “over established public school bus routes” and requires nonpublic school pupils to be transported to and from “the point or points on such routes nearest or most convenient to the [nonpublic] school which such pupils attend.” The Attorney General, apparently realizing that as enacted the statute remained too vague to be implemented, outlined in a letter to the Acting Superintendent of Public Instruction several guidelines for the implementation of the act. In it the Attorney General declared that a school board may make deviations from established routes, may make <em>new </em>routes and <em>re-routes, </em>and may reestablish routes in order to accommodate nonpublic school children. In addition, he defined as part of the established public school bus route any distance which a school bus is required to travel beyond a public school in order to complete its trip or reach its place of storage. In effect, the Attorney General assumed the role of an overseer of the legislature and rather than <em>interpret </em>the act, saw fit to write his own version simply because the statute passed by the General Assembly was incomplete and unworkable. Neither the Attorney General nor the Courts may write legislation for the General Assembly, and when that body has failed to include certain essential requirements in an enactment, neither the executive nor the judiciary may under the guise of interpretation add the missing requirements. <em>Altieri v.

It is obvious that that theory is merely a subterfuge by which its supporters justify the enactment in question. For one thing, the act does not provide free transportation for all pupils. It excludes from the enjoyment of its benefits students who attend private schools operated for profit. I can see no basis for omission of these children if the statute was truly enacted for the safety and welfare of the children of our Commonwealth. The reason is clear, however, because an examination of the statute indicates that safety was not the predominant motive for its passage. The act, as passed, will actually <em>marease </em>the danger to children who formerly were transported from their homes to the private or parochial schools in privately operated buses. The act provides for transportation of such pupils to and from points on established school bus routes “nearest or most convenient to the [nonpublic] school. . . .” This statute completely ignores the additional hazards that imperil these children, and cannot be sustained by reference to a makeshift “child welfare” theory. The only way this provision can truly serve the welfare of the children of the Commonwealth is that it be implemented by providing to the nonpublic school children the same service accorded to those that attend public school. That means taking them to and bringing them from their schools and by so doing, clearly violating the Pennsylvania and Federal Constitutions. As I have indicated, bus transportation has become an integral part of the process of education and any improvement in the transportation of pupils must be considered as an aid to the schools. In fact, the statute in question, in addition to the provisions herein considered, pro-<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>Tides for free transportation of public school pupils for tours “connected with the educational pursuits of the pupils.” The act was passed as an aid to education and that is all. Since it grants tax supported benefits to sectarian educational institutions it is unconstitutional. That is all there is to it.</p>
