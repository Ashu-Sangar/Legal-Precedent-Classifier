Thereupon defendant-relator got up, pulled a knife out of his pocket, chased Clemens into another room or outside the house' (the testimony is conflicting on this point) and stabbed Clemens in the chest twice. The wounds admittedly caused Clemens’ death. The evidence, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, strongly support the conclusion of the trial Judge who saw and heard the witnesses as well as of the Court below in the habeas corpus proceedings that the defendant-relator’s attack with a knife (1) was made while he was the aggressor and (2) was not necessary for self-defense or to protect defendant-relator from further bodily harm, and (3) was not made under the influence of legal passion or provocation sufficient in law to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter.

        <em>Com. ex rel. Newsome v.

Where the record does not disclose whether a defendant knowingly waived his right to such an appeal, a hearing ordinarily should be held to determine the issue. Although no hearing was held on this point by the Court below, no remand for a hearing on this point is necessary because although several of defendant-relator’s contentions are not raisable in and by a writ of habeas corpus this case is so unusual and sui generis that we shall treat it as if it were a direct appeal.</p>
