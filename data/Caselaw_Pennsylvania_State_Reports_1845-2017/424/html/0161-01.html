As the result of stock splits, stock dividends and the increased market value of some shares of stock, Mr. Moltrup’s unconsumed residuary estate had increased at the death of his wife Mary to $206,658.88. Mary’s testamentary appointees contend (1) that Mary occupied the position of a debtor in a debtor-creditor relationship and (2) that she was the debtor to <em>Mr. </em>Moltrup’s remaindermen only in the sum of $45,794.37, which represented the sum of $52,132.36, the value of Mr. Moltrup’s residuary estate at the time of the award or distribution to her, less $6,337.99, which was the value of the property she had consumed during her lifetime. To support this contention, appellants rely on <em>Powell’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/340/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="340 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1203365" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0404-01">340 Pa. 404</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20391" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="17 A.2d 391">17 A. 2d 391</a>, which, five years after Mr. Moltrup’s will and several months after his death (followed still later by <em>Hays Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="358 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="8844920" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0038-01">358 Pa. 38</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.2d%20763" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="55 A.2d 763">55 A. 2d 763</a>), <em>decided for the first time in Pennsylvania </em>that a gift of a legal life estate <em>with power to consume </em>created a debtor-creditor relationship,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> and <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>the life tenant or her executor owed to the remainder-men only the value of the estate at the time she inherited it less the amount she consumed.

      <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>First, the majority opinion states: “In the clearest language testator expressed his intent that this unconsumed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> residuary estate should go (after the death of his wife Mary) to his son Merle or Merle’s surviving lawful heirs [the remaindermen]; in other words, to the testator’s son or his surviving lawful heirs and not to Mary [testator’s wife] or her heirs or relatives or her testamentary appointees. . . .” What the majority says, in effect, is that, since testator clearly provided that the gift over be to his son and the son’s legal heirs, i.e. blood relatives,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> 6then testator must have intended that the debtor-creditor relationship should not apply. The majority opinion errs, in my view, because the instant factual posture presents a classic posture for application of the debtor-creditor rule. Moreover, the majority further falls into error in equating “blood relatives” with “legal heirs”: <em>Leopold Estate, </em><a href="/pa/356/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="356 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="470670" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0543-01">356 Pa. 543</a>, 546, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%20458" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="52 A.2d 458">52 A. 2d 458</a> (1947).

As criteria of a contrary intent, this premise is obviously untenable. Had testator given his wife a fee or a general power of appointment, then clearly the debtor-creditor theory would not apply. This rule of construction <em>never </em>applies where a fee or general power of appointment has been given but only where the first taker is given personalty for life, with or without the power of consumption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a>

Assuming arguendo, the majority opinion is correct in its statement that until the decision in <em>Powell’s </em>Estate_, supra, the gift of a life estate in personalty with the power to consume was not considered to create a debtor-creditor relationship— a statement with which I completely disagree—then, since the instant testator did not include in his will a provision for the establishment of the debtor-creditor relationship, the majority concludes testator did not intend that such relationship be established. Reliance on this premise reveals a misunderstanding of the rule of construction. Our research does not reveal a single instance in our case law where the debtor-creditor relationship was recognized because of provision therefor in the testamentary instrument; were it otherwise, there would be no necessity for the application of the rule of construction.</p>

The majority thinking is that to give the remainderman this entire amount produces the result which the <em>supposed </em>intent of the testator dictates. The majority opinion would hold the life tenant’s estate responsible not only for the value of the personalty when distribution was made to the life tenant but also for that value <em>plus </em>the increase in value up to the time of her death. Such a result could not possibly be reached under the rule of testamentary construction; to avoid such rule the majority of this Court finds what it considers a testamentary intent but what in reality is a <em>supposed </em>or <em>invented </em>intent. To me the majority opinion finds intent where none exists and completely fails to demonstrate the source or sources in the will upon which a finding of such intent can be rationally bottomed.

It does not seem logical to hold a life tenant with power to consume to the same restrictions imposed on a life tenant without power to consume.

      <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>The majority of this Court now overrules <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hays </em>under the guise of finding in this will a testamentary intent, an intent the basis of which the majority opinion fails to reveal. We hear much of the doctrine of stare decisis; in no area is such doctrine more important than in the construction of wills which involve valuable property rights. If the majority of this Court believe that <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hays </em>are incorrect, courageously <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hays </em>should be held no longer authoritative. What the majority opinion does, however, is to avoid following <em>Powell </em>and <em>Hays </em>by the use of a fiction of a supposed testamentary intent. To do so renders meaningless the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>
