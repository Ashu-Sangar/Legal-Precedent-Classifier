    <p id="b530-9" data-blocks='[["BL_530.14",530,[215,1230,1150,361]]]'>Robert Brown was indicted for murder and tried before a Judge and jury. On June 15, 1955, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree and Brown was sentenced to serve not less than six years nor more than fifteen years at Eastern State Penitentiary. Brown did not appeal from that judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>

L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §§1180-1-1180-14. On August 19, 1966, this petition was dismissed by the lower Court without a hearing, and from that Order Brown filed this appeal.</p>
