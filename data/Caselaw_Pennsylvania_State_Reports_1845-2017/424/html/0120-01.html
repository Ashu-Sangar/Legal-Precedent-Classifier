The instant record portrays not simply the normal display of confidence of a wife in her husband but of a wife who trusted to the extreme her husband in handling her business affairs and in the conduct of commercial transactions. Throughout the entire period during which the parties resided together the wife relied entirely upon the husband’s advice and judgment in all business affairs relating to the properties which she owned either solely or jointly with her husband. The chancellor found—with evidentiary basis—that she allowed the husband to use and supervise her property because she relied on his business judgment, honesty and integrity and placed her faith in him as her agent and fiduciary.</p>

As stated in <em>Darlington’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/86/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="86 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1056584" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0512-01">86 Pa. 512</a>, 518 (1878)—■ a landmark decision—: “A transaction between persons so situated [as wife and husband] is watched with extreme jealousy and solicitude, and if there be found the slightest trace of undue influence or unfair advantage, redress will be given to the injured party.” The Court went on to state that: “Owing to the near connection between the parties . . ., the transaction in itself is considered so suspicious as to cast the burden of proof upon the person who seeks to support it, to <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>show that he has taken no advantage of his influence or knowledge, and that the arrangement is fair and conscientious.” (at p. 518). Moreover, where a husband obtains his wife’s property without adequate consideration, a rebuttable presumption arises that a trust is created in her favor, and, if the husband claims a benefit arising from the transaction, he must <em>show affirmatively </em>that he acted in good faith and took no undue advantage of his wife: <em>DeBernard v.

On the other hand, where a husband purchases real estate or personal property with his own funds and places it in his wife’s name or transfers such property to his wife without consideration, there is a factual presumption that a gift was intended and, in order to rebut that presumption and establish a resulting trust in his favor, the husband must support his claim by clear, explicit and unequivocal—though not necessarily uncontradicted —evidence: <em>Lapayowker v. Lincoln College Preparatory School, </em><a href="/pa/386/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="386 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1268307" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0167-01">386 Pa. 167</a>, 171-172, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20451" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="125 A.2d 451">125 A. 2d 451</a> (1956).

When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest equity converts him into a trustee. ... A court of Equity in decreeing a constructive trust is bound by no unyielding formula. The equity of the transaction must shape the measure of relief.” <em>Chambers v.

Because of gifts made by the wife to the sons and by reason of a later stock dividend, the wife’s holdings stood at 1138 8/9 shares as of July 1, 1951. In 1956, the husband requested that the wife transfer this stock to him so he could obtain a bank credit, promising its return after its purpose was served. Accordingly, on November 21, 1956, the wife transferred her 1138 8/9 shares of Keystone to the husband. These shares were transferred back to the wife on April 9, 1958.</p>

The husband now claims that he provided the purchase money for this stock and that the wife is merely his “straw”. However, the evidence supports the chancellor’s finding that the husband did not pay any money when the stock was acquired by the wife and, furthermore, since the stock was never the husband’s, there can be no presumption that he made a gift of it to his wife or that there existed a resulting trust in his favor.</p>

To induce this transfer, the husband promised that he would transfer his own stock in Keystone and Welford to the parties as tenants by the entireties and that he would transfer to the wife stock which he owned in Eric Corporation of America. The husband also promised that the transfer would be temporary and he would re-transfer the stock as soon as he obtained the credit he sought. Relying on these representations, the wife made the requested transfers on September 18, 1961. At the time of the transfers, the evidence fully supports a finding that the wife was the sole and exclusive owner of these stocks and did not hold them in any trust or as a “straw” for the husband. The husband failed to keep his promises and never returned these shares of stock to the wife despite her repeated demands. The chancellor decreed that the Keystone and Welford stock be returned to the wife and the evidence fully supports this portion of the decree.</p>

Lieberman as trustees of Keystone and that a declaration of trust was executed to that effect. Keystone paid the $20,000 consideration. On November 15, 1945, the board of directors of Keystone passed a resolution authorizing the sale of the 16th Street property to the wife for $20,000 with Keystone taking a purchase money bond and mortgage in that amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Pursuant to that resolution, on December 28, 1945, the husband, Magaziner and Lieberman executed a deed for the property to the wife, which deed was duly recorded. Two years later, on August 18, 1947, the husband obtained from the wife a transfer of the property to the parties as tenants by the entireties. Thereafter, the husband increased the mortgage on the premises over a period of years and used the proceeds of the mortgage for his own purposes. The husband contends that, while a transfer from a wife to a husband alone creates a rebuttable presumption that a trust is created in favor of the wife, a transfer from a wife to husband and wife as tenants by the entireties created a gift to the husband. However, the husband overlooks two facts: first, since a confidential relationship existed between the parties, a transfer from her to him creates a <em>rebut-table </em>presumption of a trust <em>(Lapayowker v. Lincoln College Preparatory School, </em><a href="/pa/386/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="386 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1268307" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0167-01">386 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20451" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="125 A.2d 451">125 A. 2d 451</a> (1956)); second, in <em>DeBernard v. DeBernard, </em>supra, pp. 196-197, although the Court held that the wife created no tenancy by the entireties because her husband’s fraud vitiated the transfer, it reiterated the rule that where a husband obtains his wife’s property without adequate consideration the law creates a rebuttable presumption that a trust is created in her favor. Thus, whether the transfer was from wife to husband solely, <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>or from wife to husband and wife as tenants by the entireties, the same legal result obtains.</p>

He argues that the chancellor’s view that the wife is entitled to one-half the income from the entireties’ property for her own individual use is erroneous and that she is entitled only to have the income from the entireties’ property applied to her benefit as well as the husband’s, citing <em>Reifschneider v.

This argument is presently inapplicable since the chancellor, on adequate evidence, found that the wife is the exclusive owner of the property. The record supports the chancellor’s finding that it was the wife who provided the consideration for the purchase of the property, that she continued to claim individual ownership of it after it was transferred to a tenancy by the entireties, and that the husband, in securing a mortgage, executed an affidavit acknowledging that he was the “husband of the owner”. The husband thereafter deprived the wife of any part of the rental income of the premises for her own individual use and enjoyment and failed to account for such rentals. Moreover, the husband failed to overcome the presumption that a trust was created in the wife’s favor. We concur with the chancellor’s decree that the wife is the exclusive owner of this property and is entitled to a reconveyance of it; the evidence points unerringly to this conclusion.</p>
