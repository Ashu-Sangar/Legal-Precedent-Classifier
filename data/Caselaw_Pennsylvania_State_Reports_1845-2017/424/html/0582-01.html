Dravecz was employed as a laborer by the Caisson Corporation which owned a trailer in which were stored many items of equipment being used on a construction job near Airport Exit No. 22 in Le-high County. Some of this equipment disappeared and part or all of it was found on a farm owned by the parents of Dravecz. A couple of days later State Police questioned a Eugene Stockley, labor foreman for the Caisson Co., who gave the police a signed, notarized statement in which he said that Dravecz had appeared on a certain day at Stockley’s residence with some of the missing Caisson equipment and asked Stockley to sell the equipment for him.

He may be charged with the most serious of offenses, including murder and high treason. A cloud of witnesses may testify to circumstances, events, episodes which wrap him in a serpent’s embrace of incrimination, but no inference of guilt may be drawn from his failure to reply or to take the witness stand. Indeed, and properly so, if the prosecuting attorney or the judge makes the slightest reference to the fact that the accused failed to reply to the accusations ringing against him, and a verdict of guilt follows, a new trial is imperative. And yet, under the <em>Valione </em>holding, an accusatory statement made in any place chosen by the accuser, whether on the street, in the fields, in an alley or a dive, if unreplied to, may be used as an engine in court to send the defendant to prison or to the electric chair.</p>

Especially when one reflects on the fact that the rule is founded on a wholly false premise. One can understand how a principle of law built on solid rock might incline to slant from the perpendicular because of over-heavy superstructure piled on it as it rises higher and higher into the realm of hypothesis, but the tacit admission rule has no solid foundation whatsoever. It rests on the spongy maxim, so many times proved unrealistic, that silence gives consent.

The framers of our Bill of Rights were too aware of the excesses possible in all governments, even a representative government, to permit the possibility that any <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>person under the protection of the United States flag could be forced to admit to having committed a crime. In order to make the protection hazard-proof, the framers went beyond coercion of confessions. They used the all-embracive language that no one could be compelled “to be a witness against himself”. What did the trial court in this case do but compel Dravecz to be a witness against himself? Dravecz had said nothing, yet because something was read to him, to which he made no comment, the prosecution insisted that Dravecz admitted guilt. If Dravecz could not be made a self-accusing witness by coerced answers, he should not be made a witness against himself by unspoken assumed answers.</p>

It is more gentle because it is silent, but it is as insidious as monoxide gas which does not proclaim its presence through sound or smell. A forced confession is a steam-chugging locomotive moving down the track, blowing its whistle and clanging its bell with the victim tied to the rails. A tacit admission is a diesel locomotive silently but relently moving forward without audible signals and striking the victim unawares. The approach is different, the effect is the same.</p>

Yet, under the <em>Vallone </em>doctrine, a third person may utter anything he pleases, charging the defendant with any crime at all, and if the defendant fails to answer, then that third person’s unmonitored, unauthenticated declaration may doom him. No system of law should countenance so blatant an illogicality, so untrust<a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>worthy a procedure, and so unsportsmanlike and unfair a practice.</p>

Otherwise, their inflammatory, unsworn reproaches and denouncements may become formal swords of indictment. This is not rule by reason but by unrestrained babblement.</p>
    <p id="b613-5" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[104,1042,1155,917]]]'>A confession is defined by Wigmore as “one species of admission, namely, an admission consisting of a direct assertion, by the accused in a criminal case, of the main fact charged against him or of some fact essential to the charge.” (IV Wigmore, Evidence, §1050, p. 7 (3d ed. 1940)). A tacit admission, according to <em>Valione, </em>is an “implied admission of the truth of the charges thus made.” It is more or less admitted that, without the tacit admission presented in the <em>Valione </em>case, there could have been no conviction. The same could be true in the case at bar. As above stated, Dravecz voluntarily went to the police to be questioned, but he did not ask to be confronted by Stockley, nor to have any Stockley statement read to him. Springing a statement on him in this fashion suggests artifice. Requiring him to answer to it under pain of penalty spells illegality and injustice.</p>

Stockley’s statement was a long one. It could have contained averments with which Dravecz agreed, and averments with which he disagreed as not being the truth. Was he sufficiently educated and trained in expression to analyze the wordy paper and specify what he regarded right and what he regarded wrong? The Supreme Court of the United States said in the monumental <em>Escobedo </em>case “. . . No system of criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens’ abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights.” (<a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a>)</p>

In the <em>Valione </em>case itself, Chief Justice Maxey filed a 20-page dissenting opinion bristling with authority, precedent and logic devastating to the rule. He called attention to the case of <em>Moore v. Smith, </em>14 Sergeant and Eawle, 388, where this Court said anent tacit admissions: “That presupposes a declaration or proposition made to him, which he is bound either to deny or to admit . . .

Just as the decisional seed which later bloomed into <em>Griffin </em>is impliedly imbedded in <em>Malloy, </em>so. too is <em>Miranda’s </em>clear proscription of “tacit admission” evidence genealogically connected to <em>Malloy. </em>However, while the proscription against adverse comment on the accused’s silence at trial was implicitly promulgated by <em>Malloy, </em>it was not explicated therein. This was left to <em>Griffin. </em>Likewise, while the proscription against evidentiary use of “tacit admissions” was implicit in <em>Malloy, </em>it was <em>Miranda </em>that first spelled it out. Hence, it logically follows from <em>Tehan </em>that the ruling banning the evidentiary use of “tacit admissions”, first <em>explicated </em>in <em>Miranda, </em>need only be applied to those cases wherein the judgment was not finalized as of the date <em>Miranda </em>was announced.</p>
