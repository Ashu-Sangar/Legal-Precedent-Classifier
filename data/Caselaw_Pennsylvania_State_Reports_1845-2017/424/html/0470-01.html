The prayer of the petition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was that the court direct distribution to the claimant of the U. S. Government bonds in payment of the family exemption and as a partial reimbursement to claimant of decedent’s debts paid by her.</p>

The Orphans’ Court of Bucks County took testimony and, after the taking of such testimony, granted the prayer of claimant’s petition, overruled the exceptions filed thereto and directed distribution of the TJ. S. Government bonds to claimant as a family exemption and on account of her claim as a preferred creditor of decedent’s estate. From that decree the present appeal was taken.</p>

The court below further noted: (1) that, if it were to uphold the exceptions and deny claimant’s petition, such action as a practical matter would accomplish nothing toward the actual collection of the alleged loan for the benefit of decedent’s estate and would only result in repetitious litigation; (2) that, if the exceptions were not upheld and the prayer of the petition granted, other parties in interest, such as possible creditors, in decedent’s estate would not be bound by the court’s determination and its action as to them would be interlocutory. Nevertheless, the court decided the matter on its merits and ruled that, if decedent had made a loan to claimant, such loan would be barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

Some years prior to decedent’s death, decedent and her husband had separated. On October 12, 1955, she and her husband had entered into a written property settle<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>ment under the terms of which the family farm was to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between decedent and her husband, the farm equipment, livestock, etc., were to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between decedent, her husband and their three children and decedent and her husband mutually agreed to release their respective interests in each other’s estate. On February 14, 1956, claimant purchased the farm property for $11,500 and exceptant contends that decedent loaned claimant the money to effectuate the purchase of the farm and that, shortly after the family settlement, claimant acknowledged this indebtedness but had never repaid the loan. Thereafter, decedent lived on the farm with claimant until she died.</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[114,1153,1151,536]]]'>Initially, we must inquire into the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the Orphans’ Court to entertain this proceeding. Of course, the court below had jurisdiction to entertain the petition for family exemption and for the distribution of decedent’s assets without administration. However, the exceptions filed raised an entirely different issue before the court, i.e. the existence of a debt allegedly owed to the estate and, if such debt did exist, its present validity. To pass upon that issue did the court below have jurisdiction?</p>

If so, it is simply a debt due to the estate. But what Act of Assembly has given the Orphans’ Court jurisdiction to determine that question, and order the debtor to pay the administrator or to pay into court—an order, of course, to be enforced by attachment or execution? ... It may be readily conceded, that the Orphans’ Court has all the power of a court of equity in regard to matters clearly within its jurisdiction. But the question recurs, was <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>this a matter clearly within its jurisdiction? In the settlement of the administrator’s account, they certainly could decide that this was an asset of the estate which the administrator ought to have collected, and if he had negligently lost it, could surcharge him with the amount. But surely it could not cite the debtor and enter a decree or judgment against him. That would be to draw into [the Orphans’ Court] . . . the trial and determination of all claims by decedents’ estates against third person. . . .”.

While I believe that the majority is correct in its conclusion that the orphans’ court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action to recover a debt claimed by a decedent’s estate against another, that is not what the orphans’ court decree necessarily entailed here. The effect of a decree such as the one below is to distribute the assets of a small estate without requiring the formality of a complete administration. Thus there is no reason why the determination by the court below that the debt claimed by appellant was not owing to the estate either insulates the alleged debtor from further legal action or prevents the appellant<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a>, or any other proper person, from taking out letters and then proceeding against the debtor in the name of the estate.</p>
