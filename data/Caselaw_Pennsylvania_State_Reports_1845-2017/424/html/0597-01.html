In <em>Watson, </em>supra, the Court concluded that where public officers are appointed to a legislatively created commission or board, for a statutorily fixed term with staggered expiration dates, the presence of the staggered term provisión indicates a legislative intent that the holders of the office are not to be removed at the pleasure of the appointor.

    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.5",624,[205,508,1149,1506]]]'>In the instant case the city solicitor and assistant solicitors were appointed for a term of four years under the provisions of The Third Class City Code, Act of June 28, 1951, P. L. 662, §§16 and 16.1, 53 P.S. §‘§36601 and 36609. No staggered terms are involved, and likewise no appointments to a board or commission. Nevertheless, appellants contend that the history and changes in the provisions of The Third Class City Code, providing for the office of a city solicitor indicates a strong legislative intent that such appointees are not now removable at the will of the appointing power. They point out that §16 of the Act of 1951, supra, which presently authorizes the appointment of a city solicitor for a third class city, repealed and superseded Article XVI, §1601 of the Act of June 23, 1931, P. L. 932, and both legislative enactments had their roots in Article X, §1 of the Act of June 27, 1913, P. L. 568. They note that the pertinent sections in the Acts of 1913 and 1931, supra, specifically included a provision stating that the city solicitor could be removed at the pleasure of the appointor, but no such reference or provision is included in §16 of the Act of 1951. They maintain that the failure of the legislature to re-enact this provision in §16 of the Act of 1951 means that the city solicitor was not henceforth to be removed at will. They also note that the commencement of the solicitor’s term was changed from January to May by the Act of 1951.</p>

Article IX, §901 of the Act of 1931, supra, provided: “Council shall have the power of appointment and dismissal of all employes and <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>subordinate officers of the City . . . .” As re-enacted and amended in 1951, this portion of the act provides: <em>“Council shall have the power of appointment and dismissal of all city officers and employes other than elected officers </em>. . . .” Act of June 28, 1951, P. L. 662, §9, 53 P.S. §35901. (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b625-4" data-blocks='[["BL_625.5",625,[109,720,1154,424]]]'>The above quoted section of the Act of 1951, and §16 thereof, both deal with the appointment of municipal officers and must be read in conjunction with each other. See, 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction §1935 (3d ed. Horack 1943). So read, the conclusion is inevitable that the legislature clearly intended that all appointive city officers, including the city solicitor, were subject to the council’s dismissal power.</p>
    <p id="b625-5" data-blocks='[["BL_625.6",625,[110,1158,1152,424]]]'>Both public policy considerations and common sense dictate the wisdom of the legislature in vesting such control in the council. The solicitor is an important confidant of the council and the mayor in the administration of the city’s business. To hold that one who is unacceptable must be retained in such a position would lead to a seriously disturbed municipal situation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Schofield v. Lindsay, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b625-6" data-blocks='[["BL_625.7",625,[111,1594,1154,693]]]'>Since we rule that the appellants have no right to reinstatement to the posts involved, their claims for the emoluments of the office must also be denied. An appointment to a public office for a fixed term and salary is not a contract within the protection of the Constitution. See, <em>Vega v. Burgettstown Borough, </em><a href="/pa/394/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="394 Pa. 406" data-case-ids="1280942" data-case-paths="/pa/394/0406-01">394 Pa. 406</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=147%20A.2d%20620" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="147 A.2d 620">147 A. 2d 620</a> (1958). The compensation is incidental to the office and is governed by the right thereto. The emoluments are annexed to the office and not to the person; hence the salary belongs to the officer, de jure. If the officer is properly dismissed, the salary ceases. See, 4 McQuillin, Municipal Corporation §12.205 (3d ed. 1949).</p>

Our ruling in reference thereto necessarily determines the right of the assistant solicitors to also continue in office. In view of this, we deem it unnecessary to determine whether or not an assistant city solicitor is a constitutional public officer or merely enjoys the status of a professional employee.
