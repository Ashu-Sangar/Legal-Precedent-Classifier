The privilege, if properly invoked in a state proceeding, is governed by federal standards. In other words, the standards to be now used in determining whether or not the silence of one questioned about the commission of a crime is justified are the same in both state and federal proceedings. See, <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em><a href="/us/378/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="378 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6164855" data-case-paths="/us/378/0001-01">supra.</a> And, under the more recent and now controlling federal decisions, it is not necessary that a real danger of prosecution exist to justify the exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination. It is sufficient if the person questioned has reasonable cause to apprehend such danger. See, <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em><a href="/us/341/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="341 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="1148003" data-case-paths="/us/341/0479-01">341 U.S. 479</a> (1951). Moreover, the privilege extends not only to the disclosure of facts which would in themselves establish guilt, but also to any fact which might constitute an essential link in a chain of evidence by which guilt can be established. See, <em>Hoffman v. United States, </em><a href="/us/341/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="341 U.S. 479" data-case-ids="1148003" data-case-paths="/us/341/0479-01">supra;</a> <em>Blau v.

It is always for the court to judge if the silence is justified, and an illusory claim should be rejected. However, for the court to properly overrule the claim of privilege, it must be <em>perfectly clear </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances, that the witness is mistaken in the apprehension of self-incrimination and the answers <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>demanded <em>cannot possibly </em>have such tendency: <em>Hoffman v.

    <p id="b578-5" data-blocks='[["BL_578.6",578,[221,888,1149,650]]]'>Assuming arguendo, as the Commonwealth contends, that the victim cannot be prosecuted for her part in the abortion,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> there is nothing in the law to prevent her prosecution for a crime unrelated to the abortion itself, such as fornication. Further, unless unusual circumstances exist as, e.g., rape, common sense dictates that an unmarried female who admits an abortion has been performed upon her acknowledges and admits she has committed fornication. This, in itself, was sufficient reasonable cause to give the appellant apprehension of the danger of prosecution. Remote though it may be, it still existed.</p>
