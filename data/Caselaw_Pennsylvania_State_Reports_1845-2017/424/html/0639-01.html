A non-jury trial occurred wherein no evidence was offered or any record established, except for a series of statements by counsel. Nevertheless, a voluntary nonsuit was suffered as to part of the plaintiffs’ claim and a motion for a compulsory nonsuit entered. Weeks later, a motion was filed to strike certain averments in a pretrial pleading from the record. In short, orderly procedure was completely ignored.</p>
