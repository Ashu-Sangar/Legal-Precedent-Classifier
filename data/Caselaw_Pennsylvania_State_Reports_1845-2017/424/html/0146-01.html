The mere fact that the agency’s finding is not erroneous on its face, does not insulate it from review by this Court, for in that event the commission could phrase its finding in nondiscriminatory terms so that even if the appointing authority admitted that the employee was fired for discriminatory reasons, political or otherwise, this Court would nonetheless be powerless to intervene. Such a view would run counter to one of the essential rationales of <em>Hunter v.

However, the purpose of the hearing was not to determine the quality of appellant’s work but only to determine whether there was any substance in appellant’s charge of discrimination. Unless he could prove this, the commission had no authority to question the validity of the unsatisfactory work determination. <em>Hunter v.

The commission reserved its ruling at which time the authority presented as its witness, J. C.

Mr. Whalen denied saying anything which could have led appellant to so believe and testified to the contrary that appellant was dismissed because his immediate superior was not satisfied with the quality of his work. On the basis of Mr. Whalen’s testimony the commission’s finding that the dismissal was not for discriminatory reasons was clearly not capricious.</p>
