After hearing, the Board filed its report on May 3, 1966, wherein it awarded the condemnee damages of $70,500. On May 31, 1966, the Commonwealth filed an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County.</p>

It is condemnee’s position that, under §515, the filing of the appeal, the service of notice and the filing of the proof of service of notice must all be done within thirty days. Condemnee’s construction of §515 is erroneous. All that is required under §515 is that the appeal itself be filed within the thirty day period. Had the statute required that the appeal be filed <em>and </em>perfected within the thirty day period, as does for instance the Act of March 5, 1925, P.L. 23, §1, 12 P.S. §672, then condemnee’s position would have validity. See: <em>Goldstein v. Stadler, </em><a href="/pa/417/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="417 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1893975" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0589-01">417 Pa. 589</a>, 592, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20850" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="208 A.2d 850">208 A. 2d 850</a> (1965).

Nothing therein provides that service of such copy be made within the thirty day period. Section 516 (b) also provides that proof of service of a copy of the appeal shall be filed but it does not provide that such shall be filed within the thirty day period. In the absence of a time requirement for the filing of proof of service of the copy of the appeal, such filing must be accomplished within a reasonable time subsequent to the filing of the appeal.

    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[139,559,1154,744]]]'>The condemnee next urges that the appeal was defective because a copy of the appeal, although served within five days of the filing of the appeal, was served upon condemnee’s counsel who had represented condemnee throughout the proceedings. Rule 1027, Pa. R.C.P. provides for service of pleadings other than a complaint “. . . by leaving a copy for or mailing a copy to [the party] at the . . . address of the party’s attorney of record, . . .”. We agree fully with the court below: “We feel that an attorney who has entered an appearance is in fact the representative of his client for the purpose of receiving service of notice of an appeal.” A copy of the appeal in this case was properly served.</p>

Section 516, sub-section (b) provides: “proof of service of a copy of the appeal shall be filed by the appellant.” Condemnee’s objection that the Commonwealth’s affidavit “that he caused to be sent” to the condemnee’s attorney a copy of the appeal and that such affidavit was not in strict compliance with the Code lacks any validity.</p>

Section 515 of the Code provides that the appeal shall raise all questions of law or facts to the Board’s report. This provision was inserted in the Code to obviate the preCode confusion between exceptions and appeals. We do not read §515 as requiring an appellant to <em>specifically </em>object to the award of the Board. Section 516 of the Code supports this position. Section 516 provides, inter alia: “(a) the appeal shall set forth: ... (4) objections, <em>if any, </em>to the viewers’ report, <em>other </em>
      <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>
      <em>than to the amount of the award ” </em>(Emphasis supplied). Where the only issue is the amount of damages awarded by the Board in its report, the appeal need not set forth objections to findings of law or facts. See also: §517 of the Code: “It should be noted that the Eminent Domain Code contains no specific requirement that the appeal set forth an objection to the amount of the award, although . . . the appeal is required to set forth a demand for jury trial, if desired. If such a demand is set forth, the appeal will, without more, give notice that an objection to the amount of the award is relied on because, under the Code, an objection to the amount of the award gives rise to the right to a jury trial.”: 14 Standard Pennsylvania Practice, p. 549.</p>
