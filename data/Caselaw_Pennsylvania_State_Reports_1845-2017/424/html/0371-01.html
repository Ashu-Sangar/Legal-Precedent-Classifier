Given the <em>pre-Escobedo </em>date of Price’s interrogation and trial, the mere denial of counsel, does not ipso facto make his confession constitutionally inadequate, <em>Commonwealth v. Negri, </em><a href="/pa/419/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="419 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1896837" data-case-paths="/pa/419/0117-01">419 Pa. 117</a>, 129, <a href="/citations/?q=213%20A.2d%20670" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="213 A.2d 670">213 A. 2d 670</a>, 676 (1965) ; <em>Commonwealth ex rel.

As to Price’s bare allegation that he “lacked mental capacity to comprehend and competently make decisions,” we do not believe that it is sufficiently specific to require us to remand for a factual hearing. Nowhere in Price’s petition is there the slightest suggestion of any intoxication, feeblemindedness or mental disease at the time of interrogation. It may be that Price’s claimed lack of “mental capacity” has reference to the indications in the record that he was virtually illiterate at the time of his interrogation. But even under decisions most sensitive to the rights of de<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>fendants during interrogation,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> *we do not feel that Price’s statement to the police could be deemed constitutionally involuntary. It must be remembered that the statement was given less than three hours after Price had been taken into police custody. The record indicates, without contradiction, that Price was warned of his right to remain silent and that anything he said might be used against him in court. Price was not the young and inexperienced individual whose will could easily be overborne in an interrogation situation <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">

      <em> </em>from his own testimony at trial, it appears that at the time of interrogation Price was about sixty years old, had raised more than a dozen children, worked in a coal mine and as a woodcutter, purchased real estate, prepared it for farming and supervised the building of a house on his land. Against this background, we do not believe that denial of a request for assistance of counsel and Price’s partial illiteracy made his confession involuntary.</p>

Defendant himself admitted purchasing the murder weapon a few days prior to the shooting, practicing with it, loading it the day of the shooting, and firing the fatal shots. Defendant also admitted that he had had disputes with his wife over her returning to live with him and over the disposition of certain property. Several Commonwealth witnesses, uncontradicted except by the defendant himself, testified to statements made by the defendant consistent with the premeditation and intent <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>requisite to murder in the first degree. Thus Price’s son Donald testified that defendant stated to Mrs. Price and some of their children one week before the shooting that “he [defendant] would guarantee that nobody would have a happy Christmas.” Price’s son-in-law testified that on the evening before the shooting defendant asked him whether “if I [the son-in-law] was called on the stand if I would say he ever made any threats.” Sheldon Coons, a bystander unacquainted with defendant, testified that immediately after the shooting the defendant said of his wife that “she deserved it and she had it coming to her,” and defendant’s son Leroy’s housekeeper, testified that four days before the shooting defendant had told her that he was going to buy a gun because “there was three people he was going to get rid of---- his wife, Maggie; his son Dan, and his son-in-law, Ruby.”</p>
