Faden, brought suit in her capacity as a taxpayer of the City of Philadelphia against the Philadelphia Housing Authority, seeking to set aside a contract between the Authority and H. Gold, Inc., a contractor, and for such other relief as would be just and equitable. The gravamen of her complaint was that the contract in question, which was for the replacement and conversion of coal-fired boilers at an Authority housing project, had not been awarded to the lowest responsible bidder as mandated by the Housing Authorities Law, Act of May 28, 1937, P.

Appellant’s prayer for relief in the court below did not seek only to restrain the defendant contractor from performing its duties under the contract, it also sought to restrain the defendant Philadelphia Housing Authority from performing its duties and in addition “such other and further relief as may be deemed just and reasonable.” Thus it may be that appellant is still entitled to restrain the Housing Authority from making some part or all payment to the appellee-contractor, cf. <em>Yoder v.

By saying this we in no way intimate any view as to the type of relief, if any, which could appropriately be granted by the court below in this case; all we do say is that, absent any argument by appellant showing why such further relief is not available, this Court cannot say that completion of performance renders this case moot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

And although many reasons have been advanced for granting standing to taxpayers, the fundamental reason for granting standing is simply that otherwise a large body of governmental activity would be unchallengeable in the courts. Note, Taxpayers’ Suits: A Survey and Summary, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Yale%20L.J.%20895" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="69 Yale L.J. 895">69 Yale L.J. 895</a>, 904 (1960). Moreover, it has been recognized that “the availability of such litigation is insurance against the instances in which responsible prosecutors, usually political officers, are themselves allied with the action challenged or are overly burdened to identify and rectify every . . . illegal practice.” <a href="/citations/?q=69%20Yale%20L.J.%20895" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="69 Yale L.J. 895">Id. at 911</a>; see also Jaffe, Standing To Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201265" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="74 Harv.

Rather than recognize the fact that public policy favors judicial review of the statutory and constitutional validity of the acts of public bodies and officials, courts too often require strict compliance with the traditional requirements, developed long before the advent of the public authorities, that the taxpayer establish a direct pecuniary loss. Merely because a governmental unit has chosen to perform its public functions through an authority rather than directly affords no basis for granting such an authority greater immunity from taxpayer challenge than the body which created the authority. Nor does a rule permitting taxpayers to challenge in court the conduct of public authorities create the possibility that public functions will <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>be unduly disrupted by the groundless legal challenges of isolated individuals. The courts’ proven ability to deal effectively with such challenges to governmental bodies receiving direct tax support can just as easily be employed to protect public authorities receiving indirect tax support.

Dist., </em><a href="/pa/386/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="386 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1268326" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0507-01">386 Pa. 507</a>, 511, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20911" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="126 A.2d 911">126 A. 2d 911</a>, 913 (1956).</p>

To the extent that the activity of the Philadelphia Housing Authority creates tax exempt property, which benefits from the provision of municipal services it would seem that the taxpayer has a pecuniary interest in seeing that its functions are not improperly conducted.

The need to subject the actions of authorities to judicial scrutiny has become vital and to deny such judicial scrutiny when requested by taxpayers is not in the public interest.</p>

The majority state that even assuming the correctness of appellee’s averment that all of the work contracted for had been completed and the contract wholly performed, <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>this appeal -would not be moot. That statement is patently incorrect. If the averment is true, neither the court below nor this Court can render a judgment which will in any way affect the rights of any of the parties. Any judgment rendered would be merely an opinion on an academic question and would be fruitless. 9 Standard Pennsylvania Practice §135. Accordingly, under the accepted rule that when no judgment rendered can be carried into effect, a cause is moot and should not be considered on appeal (See Words and Phrases, “Moot Question” for universality of this rule), we held in <em>Smith v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em><a href="/pa/407/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="407 Pa. 122" data-case-ids="1307338" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0122-01">407 Pa. 122</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=179%20A.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="179 A.2d 192">179 A. 2d 192</a> (1962) that where an appeal is taken from an order refusing to restrain the completion of a building and to grant a supersedeas, and the building is completed prior to the hearing of the appeal, the appeal from the order refusing the supersedeas is moot and will be dismissed.</p>

I cannot agree. Rule of Civil Procedure 1029(c) provides: “(c) An averment shall be deemed to be denied if proof thereof is demanded and the pleader states either (1) that after reasonable investigation he is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the averment, or (2) that he is without such knowledge or information because the means of proof are within the exclusive control of an adverse party or hostile person. The pleader shall not be required to state what investigation he had made or to rely upon information received from an adverse party or hostile person.” Appellant alleges that all means of proof of appellee’s allegation are within the exclusive control of appellee. That is not correct, simply because all of the <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>facts required for proof are matters of public record. Under such circumstances, an answer under Rule 1029(c) is inadequate because it is inherently incredible. Goodrich-Amram, Pennsylvania Rules Service, §1029(c)-l (Supp. 1965).</p>
    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[104,645,1151,526]]]'>The majority opinion points out that Rule 41 requires appellee to take depositions after the filing of a motion to dismiss when the allegations are contraverted. I have already indicated that the allegations herein involved have not been contraverted, but assuming that they are, the majority should have remanded this matter to the court below with instructions that depositions be ordered for the purpose of determining whether or not appellee’s averments are correct. If they are, the cause is moot and should be dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[105,1190,1155,915]]]'>The majority further speak about “some other relief in the nature of restitution of moneys to the Housing Authority” which may be available to appellant. If such relief should take the form of an action to surcharge the individual members of the Housing Authority, nothing may be done toward that end in the instant action because those individuals are not named as defendants herein. Indeed, the majority opinion recognizes the weakness of its “some other relief” contention by studiously refraining from indicating what other relief could be granted. Worse than its vague approach toward that question is the majority opinion’s establishment of the proposition that a case can never be moot so long as the plaintiff has made a general prayer for “ ‘such other and further relief as may be deemed just and reasonable,’ ” which is a stock prayer in every practitioner’s equity form file.</p>

In my opinion <em>White </em>is good law and should not be overruled. The legislature has seen fit to leave in the hands of the Attorney General the responsibility of implementing the safeguards by which the citizens of Pennsylvania may protect themselves against any improprieties on the part of the Housing Authority. Compare <em>Sherman v. Yiddisher Kultur Farband, </em><a href="/pa/375/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="375 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1244387" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0108-01">375 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=99%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="99 A.2d 868">99 A. 2d 868</a> (1953) ; <em>Wiegand v.

As I review this matter, it becomes obvious to me that the majority have disregarded the concept of mootness solely in order to indulge themselves in the forbidden luxury of second guessing the General Assembly and superimposing their judgment for the will of that body.</p>
