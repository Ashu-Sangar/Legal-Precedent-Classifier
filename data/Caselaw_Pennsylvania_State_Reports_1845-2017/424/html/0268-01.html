    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.8",294,[217,604,1150,588]]]'>On March 12, 1965, appellee confessed judgment against appellant on a certain installment sales contract dated February 1, 1960. Ten days thereafter appellant filed a petition to open judgment, averring, inter alia, a previous action in trespass arising out of the same facts brought by appellant against appellee and the discontinuance of that action together with the delivery of a release from appellant to appellee in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000). The Superior Court affirmed the order of the court below refusing the petition to open judgment. We granted allocatur.</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.9",294,[213,1203,1149,583]]]'>This matter grows out of a contract whereby appellant agreed to purchase from appellee 11 dairy cows for $4,816 to be paid in agreed installments. When the unpaid balance had been reduced to $1,543, appellant learned that his dairy herd had been infected with Brucellosis as a result of contact with a Brucellosis reactor cow purchased from appellee. The spread of the disease forced appellant to dispose of most of his dairy herd as beef cattle at a substantial loss. Appellant instituted the aforementioned suit in trespass against appellee.</p>
    <p id="b294-7" data-blocks='[["BL_294.10",294,[211,1799,1149,424]]]'>Appellee argues that having received and retained a monetary consideration in settlement of the trespass action and having executed a release discharging appellee “from all claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action, or suits at law or in equity, of whatsoever hind or nature” for all tortious acts, appellant is precluded from pleading as a defense to a judgment by confession, the same tortious acts. We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b294-8" data-blocks='[["BL_294.11",294,[209,2230,1148,151]],["BL_295.1",295,[124,393,1151,371]]]'>The right to assert a defense survives the releasor’s execution of a release unless that instrument expressly purports to preclude the assertion of defenses.

In <em>General </em>Mills, <em>Inc. v. Snavely, </em><a href="/pa-super/203/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="203 Pa. Super. 162" data-case-ids="767988" data-case-paths="/pa-super/203/0162-01">203 Pa.

An examination of the written release<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> reveals that <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>the parties obviously contemplated only the surrender by appellant of his right to pursue a cause of action by complaint or counterclaim, and not of his right to defend an action brought by appellee against him. By so holding, we remain consistent with those cases which allow the maintenance of a suit for property damage following the settlement of a prior claim for personal injuries sustained in the same accident where the written release expressly precludes only a subsequent personal injury claim. <em>Erie Insurance Exchange v. Gouse, </em><a href="/pa-super/180/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="180 Pa. Super. 488" data-case-ids="730841" data-case-paths="/pa-super/180/0488-01">180 Pa.

American Stores Company, </em>87 Superior Ct. 498 (1926). It is inconceivable to us that a release otherwise silent may be construed so as to deprive only one party of rights arising from a given transaction. In the instant matter, the settlement of the trespass action was neither an admission by appellee of the truth of appellant’s claim, nor a waiver by appellant of his right to assert those matters in defense of a subsequent claim brought by appellee against him.</p>

In the instant matter, appellant filed his petition ten days after judgment was confessed and averred several meritorious defenses, including the failure of consideration caused by the same tortious acts which gave genesis to the settled <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>trespass claim. A petition to open judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and is an appeal to the court’s equitable powers. <em>Atlas Aluminum Corporation v. Methods Research Products Company, </em><a href="/pa/420/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="420 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1898522" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0407-01">420 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=218%20A.2d%20244" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="218 A.2d 244">218 A. 2d 244</a> (1966). The action of the lower court will not be reversed unless a clear abuse of discretion appears or an error of law was committed. <em>Alliance Discount Corp. v. Shaw, </em><a href="/pa-super/195/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="195 Pa. Super. 601" data-case-ids="753568" data-case-paths="/pa-super/195/0601-01">195 Pa.

We believe that the trial court’s holding that the release in question was an absolute bar to the raising of defenses by appellant constituted an error of law. Since appellee’s answer to the petition to open judgment put at issue the existence of a meritorious defense, we will order that depositions be taken or a hearing held on that issue.</p>
