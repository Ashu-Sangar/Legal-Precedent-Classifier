Tyson (Tyson), vice-president and general manager of Consolidated. This oral agreement provided that Consolidated would purchase Uni-Clean’s inventory for $2,500, assume certain of Uni-Clean’s outstanding obligations and employ Gillian in a supervisory capacity in the L. H. Parke Division of Consolidated at a salary of $15,000 per year plus $3,000 expenses and 3% commissions on certain sales and certain fringe benefits.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.8",433,[129,1300,1155,860]]]'>After entering upon such employment, Gillian became concerned that he did not have a fixed term of employment, it being his desire to secure a five-year term of employment. On February 17, 1964, Gillian entered into an agreement in writing with Consolidated, this agreement being signed by Tyson on behalf of Consolidated. This agreement recited that in consideration of “annual remuneration ... in the amount of $15,000 salary and $3,000 expenses plus a 3% commission of all Uni-Clean detergent sales”, Gillian would cease any activity in the name of Uni-Clean and give to Consolidated unlimited use of the brand name “Uni-Clean”. The agreement contained no mention of any fixed term of employment. Gillian bases his claim on this written agreement as well as an oral agreement with Tyson.</p>

Upon issue joined, the matter was heard by Judge James T. McDeemott. After hearing, the chancellor found (1) that Gillian was employed, under an oral and written contract, for one year commencing February 17, 1964, (2) that Gillian was wrongfully discharged on September 11, 1964, and (3) that Gillian sought to mitigate the damages but such efforts were unsuccessful. Upon such findings, the chancellor awarded Gillian damages from September 11, 1964 to February 17, 1965 in the amount of salary Gillian would have received during such period plus interest—$6,-863.77—and directed Consolidated to account to Gillian for all sales under the written contract during the period from February 17, 1964 to February 17, 1965. Exceptions to the chancellor’s adjudication having been dismissed by the court en banc and a final decree entered, an appeal was taken to the Superior Court which certified the appeal to this Court.</p>

That he had the authority to employ and discharge the personnel in his division of Consolidated is uncontradicted; in fact, it was he who discharged Gillian from employment and his authority to do so is unquestioned. That Tyson had the authority to purchase a business and its assets and to assume liability for its outstanding obligations is undisputed. True it is that Tyson disclaimed the authority to enter into a contract of employment of a year’s duration; however, the credibility of Tyson was for the fact finder, i.e., the chancellor in this, instance, <em>(Girsh Trust, </em><a href="/pa/410/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="410 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1884593" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0455-01">410 Pa. 455</a>, 471, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.2d%20852" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="189 A.2d 852">189 A. 2d 852</a> (1963) and cases therein cited) and the chancellor, having seen and heard Tyson, characterized his testimony as “most unsatisfactory” and his “manner and demeanor evasive”.</p>

The consideration that passes to Gillian consisted of certain cash, the assumption of certain liabilities and his employment in supervisory capacity. To adopt Consolidated’s construction of the purpose of the employment contract and the intention of the parties would be unrealistic; it would permit Consolidated to discharge Gillian at its whim and at any time for any reason after Gillian had sold his entire business to it, a construction which not only negates the real purpose of the oral agreement and <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>subsequent written contract, but ignores tbe common sense of the transaction.

Tbe record facts and circumstances are sufficient to rebut tbe presumption tbat tbe Tyson-Gillian understanding contemplated simply a hiring at will of Gillian.

So far as the future employment entered into the contract, it was of the largest concern to him who was to be employed.” (Emphasis supplied) We find no error in that which the chancellor stated or in his reliance on such inference; on the contrary, the inference which the chancellor drew was entirely rational and sound under the circumstances presented.</p>

In support of this argument, Consolidated points to a question its counsel addressed to Gillian concerning an alleged default in his accounts with National Milling Company. A reference to the record clearly indicates that the chancellor did permit Gillian to be questioned on this subject and that Gillian testified that he owed National Milling Company $4,700, that he had a $5,000 credit at a named bank to cover for anything he owed and that he had a 60 day arrangement for the payment of this <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>account.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The record does not support this argument of Consolidated.</p>

In denying the motion, the chancellor stated that he at no time instructed Tyson that he had better do anything but simply suggested that “there were certain methods that he might employ to avoid further litigation and he chose to reject them:”.

Gillian testified that, subsequent to his discharge by Consolidated, he operated his own commercial detergent business; in September, October and November, 1964, his sales approximated $1,700, the profit on which aggregated $300-$400 or 30% of the sales; that further sales were made in December 1964 and January and February 1965. There was no testimony as to profits, if any, made on such later sales.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> On the <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>theory that Consolidated had failed to carry its burden of showing that, if Gillian, after his discharge, had used reasonable efforts to secure employment, such employment would have been available, <em>(Savitz v.

Our reading of the record indicates that Gillian’s own testimony revealed he did earn money after his discharge from employment and that any profits from the sales of detergents should have been taken into consideration in arriving at the amount of an appropriate award. For this reason, the decree must be vacated and the matter remanded to the court below solely to determine the extent of profits, if any, realized from the sale of detergents by Gillian during the period from September 11, 1964 to February 17, 1965, and, upon such determination made, to credit Consolidated with the amount of such profits, if any, in arriving at the amount of the award to Gillian.</p>
