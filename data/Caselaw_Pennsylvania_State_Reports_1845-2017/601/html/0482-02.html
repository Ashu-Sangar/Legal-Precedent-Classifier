When a police car activates lights and sirens behind “a reasonable person,” that is a definite and unmistakable “show of authority” that is to be obeyed — it is not a mere suggestion for one’s consideration, but an unequivocal statement of authority and a demand to stop. It may not be as dramatic as displaying a gun, but this is a manifest, undeniable, universally recognized show of authority and intention — indeed, flight is positively indicative of appellee’s recognition of that authority, and of his decision to decline to honor it. For the Superior Court’s theory to be correct, one must find that “lights and siren” is something less than a “show of authority,” and I cannot so conclude. To affirm such a notion is a mistake.</p>
