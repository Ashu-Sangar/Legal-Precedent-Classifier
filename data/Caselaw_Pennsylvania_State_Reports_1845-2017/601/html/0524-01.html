More broadly, Claimant attempts to draw a bright-line distinction between adding an injury, even where the additional injury was present as of the issuance of the notice of compensation payable, and correcting a notice. <em>See </em>Brief for Claimant at 15 (“It is only when the [notice of compensation payable] does not reflect all of the actual injuries sustained by a claimant in a work-related accident, or does not enumerate all of the injuries sustained in a work-related incident that a claimant must file a petition to review notice of compensation payable.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In this arena, employers are <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>confronted with some inherent difficulties. First, although there may be some perceived unfairness, the Legislature has made a policy choice to impose liability on employers in the aggravation scenario. <em>See RAG (Cyprus) Emerald Resources, L.P. v. W.C.A.B. (Hopton), </em><a href="/pa/590/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="590 Pa. 413" data-case-ids="3851599" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0413-01">590 Pa. 413</a>, 429-430, <a href="/pa/590/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="912 A.2d 1278" data-case-ids="3851599,8447964" data-case-paths="/pa/590/0413-01,/a2d/912/1278-01">912 A.2d 1278</a>, 1288-89 (2007). Second, the task of assessing the contribution of a work injury to structural impairments in these scenarios can be difficult and, as here, may involve medical impressions which entail a degree of subjectivity. Hence, it is not surprising that the expert witnesses presented by claimants and employers express conflicting perspectives concerning causation. The competing opinions generally present credibility matters to be dispositively resolved by workers’ compensation judges. <em>See Marks v. W.C.A.B. (Dana Carp.), </em><a href="/a2d/898/0689-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="898 A.2d 689" data-case-ids="8418733" data-case-paths="/a2d/898/0689-01">898 A.2d 689</a>, 694 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006) (“There is absolutely no doubt in workers’ compensation jurisprudence that the WCJ has the sole power to evaluate the evidence and to determine witness credibility and that the WCJ may accept or reject the testimony of any witness in whole or in part, including a medical witness.” (citations omitted)).</p>

Claimant's approach in this regard is somewhat confusing and inconsistent with other of his contentions, particularly since the WCJ found as a fact that he had suffered a lumbar strain/sprain, in addition to the disc herniation and nerve impingement. Beyond Claimant's observation that the latter conditions were localized in the area of the body addressed by the NCP, he does explain why the disc herniation and nerve impingement should not be regarded as injuries beyond the lumbar strain/sprain identified in the NCP. <em>See City of Philadephia v. WCAB (Smith), </em><a href="/a2d/946/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="946 A.2d 130" data-case-ids="8377954" data-case-paths="/a2d/946/0130-01">946 A.2d 130</a>, 137 &amp; n. 15 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (treating disc herniation and nerve impingement as distinct injuries from lumbar strain, for purposes of Section 413(a)). Indeed, later in his brief, Claimant references <em>Smith </em>and indicates "[i]n the instant case the NCP was materially incorrect because <em>it did not list all the injuries </em>sustained in the work incident.” Brief for Claimant at 17 (emphasis added).</p>
