The treatment involved the insertion of a tube into Flanagan’s chest wall. According to Flanagan, following the insertion of the tube, the hospital’s nursing staff failed to document his complaints of pain and responses to medication, and failed to monitor his breathing and palpate his chest, measures which would have led to earlier detection of the onset of subcutaneous emphysema.

The tavern owner objected to the portion of the coroner’s testimony that would have constituted expert opinion, including his opinion as to the time of the decedent’s death, and the trial court sustained the objection. At the conclusion of trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the tavern owner, noting that even though the estate had proven by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the tavern had served the decedent while he was visibly intoxicated, by failing to establish the time of death the estate failed to establish a causal link between the negligence of the tavern owner and the fatal accident. The Superior Court affirmed, noting an absence of case law to support a finding that a lay coroner could be qualified to render an opinion as to time of death.</p>

We note that, of those cases, only North Carolina has a nursing statute similar to Pennsylvania's, in that it generally prohibits a nurse from making a medical diagnosis. <em>See </em>N.C.G.S.A. § 90-171.20(7)(e) defining the practice of nursing to include, <em>inter alia, </em>"[cjollaborating with other health care providers in determining the appropriate health care for a patient but, subject to the provisions of G.S. 90-18.2, <em>not prescribing a medical treatment regimen or making a medical diagnosis, </em>except under supervision of a licensed physician.” (emphasis added). However, consistent with our decision herein, it does not appear that the North Carolina nursing statute has been interpreted to preclude an otherwise-qualified nurse from offering expert testimony. For example, in <em>State v. Fuller, </em>the defendant, who was on trial for rape, objected to the admission of expert testimony by a sexual assault nurse examiner who examined the eleven-year-old victim the morning after she was sexually assaulted by the defendant. The trial court allowed the nurse to be qualified as an expert and testily that her examination of the victim "presented conditions consistent with vaginal penetration.” <a href="/citations/?q=603%20S.E.2d%20569" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="603 S.E.2d 569">603 S.E.2d at 577</a>. On appeal, the defendant challenged the trial court's admission of the nurse's testimony on the grounds that the nurse failed to meet the second prong of the state's tripartite test for evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony, namely, that the witness qualified as an expert in the area of the proposed testimony. After setting forth the nurse’s education and experience, including experience examining victims of sexual assaults, the appellate court ultimately held that the trial court properly found her qualified to testify as an expert. The nursing statute was not raised as an impediment to the nurse's testimony.</p>

Flanagan, </em>at 185 (emphasis added). The nurse in <em>Flanagan </em>was precluded from rendering an expert medical opinion because “the normal test of competency is constrained by a statutory provision limiting the deemed competency of nurses.” <em>Id. Flanagan </em>reasoned nurses may not testify concerning a medical diagnosis because the Professional Nursing Law expressly prohibits them from doing so. <em>Id., </em>at 186; 63 P.S. § 212(1), (4). Despite Pennsylvania’s liberal standard for the admission of expert testimony, because the legislature has prohibited nurses from rendering a medical diagnosis in the scope of their profession, it simply does not follow that a nurse would be qualified to render expert opinion as to a medical diagnosis in a court of law.</p>

Additionally, <em>Flanagan </em>relied on <em>Miller </em>in carving out an exception to the normal test of expert competency as applied to nurses. <em>Flanagan, </em>at 185. <em>Miller </em>and <em>McClain </em>are easily distinguishable from cases invoking the Professional Nursing Law, such as <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[288,581,1155,1064]]]'>The majority reasons expert testimony offered in a court of law does not implicate a nursing regimen — “there is no patient under treatment, no actual or potential health problem, no diagnosis or treatment, and no care is affected.” Majority Op., at 248, 971 A.2d at 1210. In this context, however, as the majority concedes, a nurse would not qualify as an expert to offer testimony on medical diagnosis or causation in light of the MCARE Act. <em>Id., </em>at 251 n. 8, 971 A.2d at 1212 n. 8 (“We recognize that our decision to overrule <em>Flanagan </em>may have limited impact in light of the legislature’s enactment of the MCARE Act____”). Prior to this concession, the majority cites the MCARE Act as supporting its finding “[h]ad the legislature intended that the Professional Nursing Law supersede the common law and duly enacted rules with regard to the standard for admission of expert testimony, it could have expressly indicated this intention, as it subsequently did in its enactment of the [MCARE Act]____” <em>Id., </em>at 247, 971 A.2d at 1210. In my view, the MCARE Act only serves to support <em>Flanagan’s </em>reasoning that the Professional Nursing Law’s limits extend to apply to nurses in the courtroom.</p>
