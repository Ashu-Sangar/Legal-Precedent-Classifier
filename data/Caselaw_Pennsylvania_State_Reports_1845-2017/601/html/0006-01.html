The dissent did not address the sufficiency claim actually raised.

The dissent argued that Section 6312(d) was ambiguous because reasonable minds can differ over the issue presented for review and reasonable arguments can be made that appellant did not knowingly control child pornography. <em>Id. </em>at 176. The dissent concluded that when the statute is construed strictly in favor of appellant, he was not given fair notice that simple viewing of child pornography via the internet violated Section 6312(d). <em>Id. </em>Further, the dissent took issue with the majority’s discussion of the definition of the term “control” and argued that if it had applied the definition of the verb “control,” “there was no evidence that [appellant] exercised any directing influence,” over the images of child pornography “on his computer screen, <em>e.g., </em>by downloading, saving, or printing them.” <em>Id. </em>at 177. Thus, the dissent concluded that while appellant may “have had the ability to ‘control’ the images” of child pornography by downloading, saving or printing them, “he did not exercise his potential control over them.” <em>Id. </em>at 176.

The verb control is commonly defined as: “[t]o exercise power or influence over[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 353 (8th ed.2004). An individual manifests such knowing control of child pornography when he purposefully searches it out on the internet and intentionally views it on his computer. As the testimony in this case showed, in such a situation, the viewer has affirmatively clicked on images of child pornography from different websites and the images are therefore purposefully on the computer screen before the viewer. Such conduct is clearly exercising power and/or influence over the separate images of child pornography because the viewer may, <em>inter alia, </em>manipulate, download, copy, print, save or e-mail the images. It is of no import whether an individual actually <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>partakes in such conduct or lacks the intent to partake in such activity because intentionally seeking out child pornography and purposefully making it appear on the computer screen— for however long the defendant elects to view the image— itself constitutes knowing control. The use and operation of computers are not the novelty they once were. Control via a computer is little different from the control one exercises by viewing a book or a magazine — whether one purchases the tangible image or not. It is clear that Section 6312(d) should not and cannot be read to allow intentional and purposeful viewing of child pornography on the internet without consequence.</p>

However, under the statute, the Commonwealth need not establish that a defendant possessed child pornography to prove a violation of Section 6312(d) if the Commonwealth can prove that a defendant knowingly controlled child pornography; the statute employs the disjunctive “knowingly possesses or controls,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 6312(d)(1) (emphasis added). It is reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly employed the terms “possession” and “control” in the disjunctive purposefully and that they were meant to have different applications. It would be nonsensical to assume that it was the intention of the General Assembly to have utilized two terms — “possession” and “control” — interchangeably. A contrary interpretation would be absurd and lead to unreasonable results — a gigantic loophole in the statute, never intended by the General Assembly, that would allow individuals to intentionally access and view child pornography via the internet with impunity, which would make the statute toothless.</p>

Specifically, appellant contends that the statute is not clear that intentionally accessing and viewing child pornography via the internet — sans the intent to download, copy or send the images — constitutes "control" of such material under Section 6312(d).

To bolster this argument, the Commonwealth includes a brief discussion of three cases from other states which address the issue of possession and/or constructive possession of child pornography.
