Two weeks later, Appellant’s counsel appeared on the date scheduled for the preliminary hearing, waived the hearing on Appellant’s behalf, and signed the notice of arraignment, scheduled for April 25, 2003.

However, she disagreed with the majority’s broader, bright-line holding that the “onus and consequences” of such an omission falls upon the defendant. Rather, Judge Ford Elliott believed that the determination should be case-specific, thus suggesting a broader assessment of the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Baird, </em><a href="/a2d/919/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="919 A.2d 258" data-case-ids="8325598" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/0258-01">919 A.2d at 264</a> (Ford Elliott, P.J., concurring).</p>

He reasoned that Appellant’s failure to appear did not constitute a willful failure for excludable time purposes. Additionally, the dissent suggested that the majority’s approach conflicted with the applicable state and local court rules, which require that notice be provided by the court, not by counsel. <em>See Baird, </em><a href="/a2d/919/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="919 A.2d 258" data-case-ids="8325598" data-case-paths="/a2d/919/0258-01">919 A.2d at 266-67</a> (Bender, J., dissenting).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Appellant’s argument substantially tracks Judge Bender’s dissenting opinion in its emphasis on the proposition that a defendant who fails to appear for a court proceeding is deemed unavailable only when he has been properly notified of that proceeding. <em>See Cohen, </em><a href="/pa/481/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="481 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1747279" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0349-01">481 Pa. at 355</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="481 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1747279" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0349-01">392 A.2d at 1331</a> (“Where ... the accused is <em>aware </em>of his <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>obligation to appear and fails to do so, he may legitimately be held accountable for any resultant delay[.]” (emphasis added)). Appellant avers that the delay did not result from his willful failure to appear at the required time. Because he was never properly informed of the arraignment date, Appellant contends that his attorney’s knowledge of that date should not be imputed to him. Appellant also argues that the Commonwealth failed to exercise the required due diligence in attempting to locate him by merely issuing a bench warrant. Appellant notes that, on the date of the scheduled arraignment, he was incarcerated in the Allegheny County Jail, and when he was released, he participated in drug rehabilitation and fully cooperated with a county task force, requiring him to appear in court as a witness for the Commonwealth on at least two occasions. Therefore, according to Appellant, it would have taken very little effort to locate and bring him to trial within the time constraints of Rule 600.</p>
    <p id="b705-5" data-blocks='[["BL_705.5",705,[210,1250,1157,847]]]'>In opposition, the Commonwealth avers that by posting bond and agreeing to “appear at all subsequent proceedings,” Appellant assumed the responsibility of making himself available for any court appearances required of him. <em>See Cohen, </em><a href="/pa/481/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="481 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1747279" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0349-01">481 Pa. at 354</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="481 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="1747279" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0349-01">392 A.2d at 1330</a> (“Where a defendant undertakes to accept the status of bail during the pendency of court proceedings he assumes the responsibility of making himself available for any court appearances required of him in connection with the action, upon receipt of reasonable notice.”). Further, the Commonwealth observes that Appellant’s counsel appeared at the preliminary hearing and signed and accepted written notice of the formal arraignment on Appellant’s behalf. Because the attorney is Appellant’s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, the Commonwealth contends that Appellant was on reasonable notice as to the arraignment for purposes of Rule 600.</p>
    <p id="b705-6" data-blocks='[["BL_705.6",705,[210,2121,1153,255]],["BL_706.1",706,[295,326,1154,770]]]'>As an extension of its argument, the Commonwealth submits that Appellant received notice as required by the Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Commonwealth explains that Rule 571 provides that “[n]otice of arraignment shall be given to the defendant as provided in Rule 114 [‘Order and Court Notices: <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>Filing; Service; and Docket Entries’] or by first class mail.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 571(A). More specifically, the Commonwealth notes that Rule 114 sets forth seven methods by which proper notice is rendered, one of which is delivery to “the party’s attorney.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 114(B)(3)(a)(i). Similarly, the Commonwealth observes that the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct state that a lawyer shall “promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance [and] keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter....” Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4 (“Communication”). The Commonwealth suggests that these rules are intended to encourage communication between lawyer and client and provide the court and community a reasonable expectation that the actions of lawyer and client are, for purposes of litigation, one in the same.</p>
    <p id="b706-5" data-blocks='[["BL_706.5",706,[295,1118,1154,769]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth submits that Rule 600 should not be read to encourage a defendant to deliberately render himself ignorant of his court obligations and thereby form a basis for a claim that he lacked notice. In support of its argument, the Commonwealth relies on <em>Barker v.
