After receiving permission to abandon service, Conrail entered into an agreement with Appellee Armstrong County Conservancy (the Conservancy) to convey the right-of-way to an organization nominated by the Conservancy. The Conservancy nominated a rails-to-trails organization, the Allegheny Valley Land Trust (the AVLT), to receive the right-of-way. In early 1992, Conrail conveyed the right-of-way to the AVLT by quitclaim deed; the <a id="p659" href="#p659" data-label="659" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*659</a>AVLT appended a Declaration of Railbanking to the quitclaim deed upon recording it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Conrail turned over responsibility for maintenance of road crossings and bridges on the right-of-way to the AVLT, the Conservancy, and Armstrong County.</p>

      <em>Amici </em>Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and Rails-to-Trails Conservancy each emphasize the strong policy reasons supporting recognition and enforcement of rail-banking. They point to the legislative concerns underlying both the National Act and the Pennsylvania’s Rails to Trails Act, 32 P.S. §§ 5611-5622 (the State Act), which authorizes Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Resources to develop rail-trails, and also authorizes counties and municipalities to accept title to railroad rights-of-way by quitclaim or warranty deed. Both the National and State Acts “display a strong legislative policy encouraging the preservation of railroad rights-of-way by using existing rights-of-way for interim recreational trail use.” <em>Buffalo Township, </em><a href="/pa/571/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="813 A.2d 659" data-case-ids="1070133,9380819" data-case-paths="/pa/571/0637-01,/a2d/813/0659-01">813 A.2d at 667</a>. <em>Amici </em>point out that rail transport is extremely efficient and is currently undergoing its largest development boom in more than a century. Revitalization of rail lines may well be essential to revitalizing the nation’s economy in the coming years. The legislative intent of the National and State Acts expresses an interest in preserving railroad easements even where rail service is no longer active, and Section 1247(d) of the National Act places appropriate conditions on when preservation of such easements can be effective.</p>

Subsequent holders of the easement may not transgress its boundaries, but they do not transgress the use for which it was granted when they use it for hiking and biking.

R.R. 76a. In broad terms, the document grants the easement holder the right to have and maintain a right-of-way through Appellants’ property for that easement holder’s purposes. The deed contains no language specifying that the easement terminates upon cessation of rail service. During the interim period when it is railbanked and used as a trail, it is still to be used as a right-of-way, to get from the same point A to the same point B, and points in between them. Appellants, as owners of the servient estates, still have the same rights and responsibilities as they did when the trains were running, just as they will have the same rights and responsibilities when rail <a id="p667" href="#p667" data-label="667" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*667</a>service resumes. Just as a bank preserves deposited funds, railbanking preserves the relationship between the easement and the servient estate — this is a primary purpose of the National Act.</p>
    <p id="b741-4" data-blocks='[["BL_741.5",741,[217,549,1149,627]]]'>Importantly, Conrail’s intent to abandon rail service on the right-of-way must not be confused with Conrail’s alleged intent to abandon the right-of-way itself, an intent that is incompatible with the actions Conrail took in selling the right-of-way. It is beyond dispute that Conrail intended to abandon its rail service on the right-of-way, and took steps to effectuate that by, among other things, selling the right-of-way to AVLT. However, as the Superior Court wisely observed, the evidence presented cannot support both the conclusion that Conrail meant to extinguish the right-of-way via abandonment and that it meant to sell the right-of-way to a qualified railbanking organization such as AVLT. <a href="/a2d/930/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="930 A.2d 505" data-case-ids="8349494" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0505-01">930 A.2d at 507</a>.</p>

Here, the trail is and must be maintained in rail-ready condition, and must be relinquished for rail service should the need arise. The current owners of the servient estates purchased those estates long after the easement had been granted to Conrail’s predecessor railroad, and the amounts the owners paid surely reflected that fact. To limit the right-of-way’s terms strictly because of the burden placed on the servient estate would needlessly degrade the easement.</p>

The deed’s <em>habendum </em>clause grants the easement for “so long as the same shall be required for the use and purposes of said Road, in as full, perfect and ample a manner as may be necessarily required for the purposes hereby intended.” R.R. 76a. Railbanking provides conservation of this right-of-way in a rail-ready state during a period when <a id="p668" href="#p668" data-label="668" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*668</a>rail service is not feasible, and this is not a departure from the intended “use and purposes” of the easement. On the contrary, consistent with the terms of the easement and the policies behind the National Act, railbanking preserves rail networks for the purposes of rail service in the future. Preservation of a resource for the purposes of using that resource as it was used initially is not a departure from the broadly-stated terms of the easement. This would be true if Conrail were simply halting train service for a period of years in order to update track hardware, and it remains true here. The fact that hikers and bikers will be allowed to use the easement in the interim period is not only beneficial from a policy perspective, it also allows investment in the upkeep of rail networks-for rail purposes-that would not otherwise be available. Although we, like Justice Saylor, wish to protect the constitutional rights of the Appellants, we cannot agree that those rights are transgressed when the language of the deed’s <em>habendum </em>clause is broad and the purposes of railbanking are so beneficial for rail service, which is of course the very purpose for which the easement was sought and granted in the first place.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The property rights of the Appellants have in no way been changed by this railbanking.

Moreover, while the relevant instruments of conveyance are not models of clarity, the references to “Road” are to a particular road (via the use of the phrases “said Road” and “the Road”), commencing immediately after the identification of “Allegheny Valley Rail Road Company.” Certainly, it is at least a reasonable interpretation that the reference “said Road” is to the Rail Road that is the subject of Allegheny Valley Rail Road Company’s business, since no other references to any other “road” appear on the face of the instrument. Moreover, the instruments enable “the Company to construct and repair the Road, and the right to conduct and carry water by aqueducts and pipes, and the right to make proper drains.” It is difficult to envision that property owners would have foreseen a railroad company coming onto their property to construct and repair a recreational trail for hikers and bicyclists as opposed to a railroad.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Indeed, in <em>Baltimore </em>
