Bennett looked into his side rear view mirror and saw [Appellee’s] car approaching. Bennett testified that he saw [Appellee’s] car spray some “liquid” out of its passenger-side, rear-quarter panel behind the right rear wheel onto his car. [Appellee’s] car sprayed the liquid onto the whole length of the driver’s side of Bennett’s car in a “steady stream” from four or five feet away. Bennett testified that the liquid “sort of smelled like WD-40 or like paint thinner.”</blockquote>

The chase resulted in a circuitous tour that <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>ended back at Kreiser’s Truck Stop. The police arrived shortly thereafter, followed by the local Mifflinville Volunteer Fire Company, the Bloomsburg Volunteer Fire Company HAZMAT Team, emergency medical technicians and the personnel and staff of Minuteman Spill Response, Inc. The police arrested [Appellee], the authorities quarantined Bennett’s car, and an ambulance took Bennett and his family to Berwick Hospital’s emergency room decontamination area. Upon examination of [Appellee’s] car, the police discovered that it was rigged up with an intricate system to pump and spray a liquid substance from two different ports in the right side. A pump was connected to the electrical system of the vehicle and was operated by a switch that was installed in the dashboard. Because [Appellee] would not disclose the chemical composition of the liquid, the HAZ-MAT team secured the liquid from his car and had it tested. John James Tobin of Seewald Laboratories used a mass spectrometer and confirmed that the liquid was highly toxic and flammable, being composed of aromatic and aliphatic solvents, acetone, tolu[e]ne, methylene chloride, ammonium hydroxide, and isopropyl alcohol. The police also executed a search warrant at [Appellee’s] residence and found Tough Job remover, acetone, rubbing alcohol, paint stripper, and other milky, unknown substances. Fortunately, no one was injured during these events and Bennett’s car was not damaged.</blockquote>

Furthermore, after the trial court reduced appellee’s bail for the specific purpose of making $20,000 available to appellee to retain new counsel, appellee still appeared at his previously scheduled jury selection on November 2, 2004, without retaining a lawyer.

For purposes of this appeal, however, I will not go so far in light of <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Davido, </em>the appellant claimed he had been denied his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation when the trial court denied his request to proceed <em>pro se </em>without first conducting a colloquy. The Commonwealth argued that the issue should have been raised as an ineffectiveness claim because the appellant was represented by standby counsel at trial and counsel failed to object to the lack of a colloquy. However, over the disagreement of this author, a majority of the <em>Davido </em>Court held that the claim was “properly addressed as the error of the trial court, since Rule 121 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure [set] forth the procedure a judge must follow to determine whether the waiver of counsel was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.” <em><a href="/pa/582/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="868 A.2d 431" data-case-ids="650302,9177582" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0052-01,/a2d/868/0431-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/582/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="868 A.2d 431" data-case-ids="650302,9177582" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0052-01,/a2d/868/0431-01">at 437</a>.

Thus, the very fact that appellee was permitted to pursue the no-colloquy complaint for the first time on appeal obviously eviscerates appellee’s present claim that the Commonwealth waived its forfeiture argument — an argument which directly rebuts appellee’s Rule 121 complaint raised on appeal — by failing to raise it in the trial court. Additionally, while appellee insists that the Commonwealth should have argued the doctrine of forfeiture of counsel at the trial court level, it is unclear how the Commonwealth was supposed to have done so. At trial, appellee, who clearly could afford counsel, proceeded without counsel and without objection. A defendant has as strong a constitutional right to self-representation as he does to counsel. <em>See Faretta v.

The Commonwealth is not obliged to rescue a non-indigent defendant from his own perilous decisions. I would decline to place the burden of prescience on the Commonwealth.

In the counsel denial/forfeiture area, there is obviously a difference between an indigent defendant desiring self-representation and a defendant with the means to retain counsel.

The notion, accepted by the Superior Court majority below, that a trial court somehow “denies” a non-indigent defendant his right to counsel by failing to offer a waiver colloquy is a misperception.

Thus, the trial court informed appellee in July that “we’ll reschedule this for September for sure, whether you have an attorney or not. That will give you plenty of time to get one and be ready to go.” N.T. 7/13/04, at 6 (emphasis added). In October, the trial court, after reducing appellee’s bail by $20,000 precisely to ensure that he would have sufficient funds to retain another private attorney, told appellee that “I’m going to keep Mr. Trathen in as standby [counsel], if you don’t get an attorney, to answer any questions you might have because you’re going to proceed by yourself, otherwise.” N.T. 10/7/04, at 3 (emphasis added). These clear warnings served to bring home to appellee that the obligation <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>was on him to secure counsel and that the consequence would be self-representation. The fact that appellee chose to ignore the trial court’s warnings and failed to secure private counsel clearly supports a finding of forfeiture. I do not believe that the absence of a colloquy in the face of a non-indigent defendant’s unexcused refusal to secure counsel, despite ample opportunity to do so, can be said to operate as a state-sponsored “denial” of the right to counsel. Constitutional law is not so paternalistic, and criminal defendants, like all other litigants, may fairly be charged with responsibility for the consequences of their actions.</p>

I express that preference solely as a supervisory matter; as I have explained above, I do not believe that the constitutional right to counsel requires that a non-indigent defendant be fully colloquied concerning the obvious consequences of his refusal to secure counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

I conclude this requirement prevails whether a defendant explicitly seeks to waive the right to counsel, or by his conduct suggests the same intention. Regardless of how a defendant’s intention is manifested, a colloquy is the only way to determine whether a defendant understands the risks and implications of waiver of his right to counsel. Accordingly, except in those cases where the defendant’s conduct is so egregious as to constitute forfeiture, I would hold that a colloquy is required before the defendant is held to have waived his right to counsel.</p>

In that case, Szuchon repeatedly indicated that he would retain private counsel, but failed 1o do so. One week before his scheduled trial, Szuchon agreed to be represented by court-appointed counsel, but against counsel’s advice, refused to waive his speedy trial rights to allow counsel more time to <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>prepare. The trial court conducted a colloquy and explained the ramifications of his refusal to waive his speedy trial rights. Following his conviction, Szuchon argued on appeal, <em>inter alia, </em>that the short period of time court-appointed counsel had to prepare resulted in a <em>per se </em>violation of his right to effective representation of counsel. In rejecting Szuchon's ineffectiveness claim, we acknowledged <em>Faretta, supra, </em>and noted:</p>

Thus, <em>Szuchon </em>is not a waiver of counsel case because Szuchon chose to go to trial with appointed counsel.
