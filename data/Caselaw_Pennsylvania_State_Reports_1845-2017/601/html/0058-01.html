However, there was no on-the-record discussion of the support for such an amount. The $10,000 figure selected by the court appears to derive from an oblique reference by Appellant’s attorney to the limits of a policy of automobile insurance pertaining to one of the accident vehicles. <em>See </em>N.T., December 15, 2004, at 5-6, 9. Such figure, viewed in the abstract (as it was at the sentencing proceedings here), obviously bears no meaningful <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>relation to the subject of Section 1106, namely, the “fullest compensation” to victims for their losses. 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(l)(i). In the absence of some record explanation supporting the victims’ claims, the sentencing court does not appear to have been in a position to accomplish its statutory duty to evaluate the district attorney’s recommendation, and the $10,000 figure appears essentially to have been used as little more than a placeholder. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T. December 15, 2004, at 9 (reflecting the sentencing court’s explanation that, “[rjestitution to be payable ... in the amount of $10,000 <em>for today’s purposes only, </em>subject to my request that you each provide me with the statement ... to what restitution should actually be” (emphasis added)).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">1</a>

The majority aptly highlights that, particularly in cases involving personal injury, the victims' full losses may not yet have accrued as of the time of sentencing. Therefore, there are situations in which full restitution cannot be determined. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 64, 970 A.2d at 1134. As the Superior Court has recognized, however, this does not excuse common pleas courts from making the best assessment possible of the losses accrued to date. Similarly, the Legislature’s prescription from modification of restitution orders at any time, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 1106(c)(3), which may be primarily to account for later-accruing losses, does not alter the statutory directives plainly requiring a meaningful assessment of existing losses.</p>
