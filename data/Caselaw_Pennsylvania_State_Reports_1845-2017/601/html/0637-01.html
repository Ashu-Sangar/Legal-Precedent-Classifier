Shortly after negotiations began, the third-party landlord sold Four Gateway Center to the present owner, Trizechahn Gateway LLP (“Trizechahn”). After further negotiations, T &amp; M and Trizechahn reached an agreement and, subsequently, executed the ten-year master lease that is the principal subject of this litigation. Trizechahn’s director of leasing testified that the master lease was originally drafted by the third party who sold Four Gateway Center to Trizechahn, that Trizechahn’s lawyers reviewed the master lease before it was executed, and that certain terms of the original draft were changed after negotiations with T &amp; M. The lease ran from October 1, 1995, through June 30, 2005. In June 1998, the parties entered into a second lease for an additional storage area in the basement of the building. The term of the storage lease ran from June 15, 1998, until June 30, 2005.</p>

To this end, Appellee Paul Titus sent a letter to Trizechahn’s general manager advising of the impending dissolution and offering to work toward subletting the master lease premises. A formal plan of liquidation was executed on that same date. Shortly thereafter, T <em>&amp; </em>M vacated the master lease premises, but left behind office fixtures in the office space and files in the basement storage spaces. T &amp; M continued to pay rent through January 2000, when all rental payments ceased. More than five years remained on the lease term at the time of default.</p>

After T &amp; M did not formally respond to this letter, Trizechahn sent a second letter notifying T &amp; M that it had failed to remit rental payments for February and March of 2000. The letter stated Trizechahn would forego adding interest or penalty charges to the outstanding balance as a professional courtesy. In mid-July 2000, Trizechahn sent a third letter to T &amp; M, notifying it that Trizechahn was attempting to relet the master lease storage space, and requesting T &amp; M to remove any miscellaneous files left there after the firm’s abandonment of the space. Four days later, T &amp; M replied by agreeing to remove the files; however, T &amp; M still did not remit any rent payments that were by this time overdue.</p>

Trizechahn’s complaint was amended several times to add additional parties and to advance a claim for re-letting and alteration expenses. Protracted litigation ensued in the trial court based on Trizechahn’s amended complaint. After motions and argument, the court held a non-jury trial and issued a memorandum opinion setting forth its findings and conclusions. The issues centered on whether Trizechahn had a duty to mitigate damages; whether Trizechahn had terminated the lease by re-letting the space or had merely acted under the lease terms to obtain proceeds that could be deducted from the amount owed by T <em>&amp; </em>M; and whether various partners of T &amp; M were individual<a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>ly liable for any award in favor of Trizechahn.

    <p id="b717-7" data-blocks='[["BL_717.8",717,[210,1023,1155,854]]]'>The trial court awarded damages to Trizechahn for unpaid rent, expenses, interest, and counsel fees, ultimately entering judgment for approximately $3,274,000, a figure that included Trizechahn’s renovation and re-letting costs, pre-judgment interest, and counsel fees. In reaching its verdict, the court reasoned that, once T &amp; M breached the master lease, Trizechahn had no duty to mitigate and, additionally, had the option, under Paragraph 15(b) of the master lease, to re-let the premises without terminating the lease, and deduct the proceeds of such re-letting from the balance owed by T <em>&amp; </em>M. On appeal to the Superior Court, T &amp; M and the individual Titus Appellees asserted various grounds of error, including that the trial court had improperly held the partners who signed the master and storage leases individually liable notwithstanding Subclause (i), and that it should not have allowed Trizechahn to recover legal fees.</p>

Titus, </em><a href="/a2d/930/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="930 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="8349622" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0524-01">930 A.2d 524</a> (Pa.Super.2007). After rejecting several of T <em>&amp; </em>M’s allegations of trial court error not presently relevant, the court turned to the issue of which partners, if any, were shielded from personal liability under Subclause (i). The court first stated that the clause facially could apply only to partners Thomas Arbogast and Thomas Wettach, as they were the ones who executed the two <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>leases on behalf of T &amp; M. Although the court found the clause ambiguous on the question of whether it relieved these partners of liability in their individual capacities, it agreed with the trial court’s decision not to entertain any parol evidence on the question, because the clause was drafted by the original property owner, and not Trizechahn, thus rendering any inquiry into Trizechahn’s “intent” in drafting the clause meaningless. Further, the court indicated that any parol evidence from Trizechahn would have little credibility — because Trizechahn would simply assert that it did not intend to release Arbogast and Wettach from liability — and that, therefore, only Arbogast and Wettach could offer testimony worthy of belief. <em>See <a href="/a2d/930/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="930 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="8349622" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0524-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/930/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="930 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="8349622" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0524-01">at 538-39</a>. Ultimately, however, the Superior Court found that the trial court had erred in imposing individual liability upon Arbogast and Wettach. Its determination in this respect rested on its ultimate resolution of the ambiguity in Subclause (i). Specifically, it construed the provision as shielding Arbogast and Wettach from liability due to its “broad language” in providing that no person acting as a representative shall be held individually liable for “any reason or cause whatsoever.”</p>

The only such challenge germane to the present proceedings relates to whether the common pleas court erred by including counsel fees in the award. In this respect, the Superior Court referenced Paragraph 15(g) of the master lease, which provides for an award of attorney’s fees where “legal action is required to enforce performance by Tenant of any condition, obligation or requirement hereunder.” The court deemed the word “hereunder” to be ambiguous, as it was not apparent whether that term referred to the master lease as a whole — in which case fee shifting was appropriate — or only to Paragraph 15(g) — in which case fees could only be awarded if Trizechahn forwarded payments on behalf of T <em>&amp; </em>M “for operating costs and taxes for which [the Titus Appellees] were liable under the master lease terms.” <em>Trizechahn Gateway, </em><a href="/a2d/930/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="930 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="8349622" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0524-01">930 A.2d at 545</a> (quoting Paragraph 15(g) of the master lease).

Trizechahn notes, in this regard, that such a clause, if applied as Arbogast suggests in the context of a partnership of two, would allow the partner who took responsibility for finding rental space and entering into a lease to make the other partner solely liable for damages resulting from a subsequent breach, which would “turn the idea of a partnership on its head.” Brief for Appellant at 21.

In the alternative, Trizechahn argues that, if the Superior Court was correct in suggesting that the lease provision was ambiguous, it should have remanded for the admission of parol evidence to resolve the ambiguity rather than determining from an appellate posture that only Appellees’ evidence would have been credible.</p>

It simply is counterintuitive to presume a landlord would relieve one of several partners from individual liability merely by the fortuitous circumstance that he was selected to represent the interests of the partnership (and, concomitantly, the other partners) in executing the lease. Arbogast’s argument is colorable, however, since the precise wording of Subclause (i) is extremely broad and, facially at least, covers any “person” signing as an “agent,” providing that he “shall [n]ever be deemed or held individually hable hereunder <em>for any reason or cause whatsoever.” </em>Master Lease at 12, ¶ 28(i), RR. 139a (emphasis added). Therefore, as Arbrogast forcefully maintains, since his status as a partner otherwise would be a “reason or cause” supporting liability, a literal interpretation of Subclause (i) would relieve him even from the liability he would bear by virtue of such status. <em>See </em>15 Pa.C.S. § 8327(2) (mandating, without exception, that all partners are hable jointly for all “debts and obligations of the partnership”).</p>

We do not foreclose the possibility that the general partners might, in some circumstances, create an arrangement permitting one partner to secure an advantage relative to the others by allowing, upon entry into a contract by which the entire partnership is bound, absolution from personal liability for the executing partner only.

Trizechahn argues, from February 2000 to June 2005, T &amp; M failed to fulfill any condition or obligation of the lease and that, accordingly, Trizechahn instituted legal action to enforce performance of the partnership’s obligations, thereby entitling Trizechahn to counsel fees under Paragraph 15(g). In this regard, Trizechahn proffers that the Superior Court committed legal error by entertaining an unreasonable construction of the clause’s language to find an ambiguity, whereas an ambiguity is only properly found where there are two different reasonable interpretations.

The question here is whether there was a clear agreement of the parties to award fees to the lessor in the present situation.

In doing so, the court reasoned that Trizechahn could not possibly offer probative parol evidence since it did not draft Paragraph 15(g); thus, the Superior Court concluded that it was required to resolve the ambiguity in favor of Appellees, as their intent was “clearly to not be held liable for attorneys’ fees.” <em>Trizechahn Gateway, </em><a href="/a2d/930/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="930 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="8349622" data-case-paths="/a2d/930/0524-01">930 A.2d at </a>524 <em>&amp; </em>n. 14.

Clearly, any person entering into a contract — assuming he has read it (as Trizechahn’s uncontested evidence showed) — has some idea of what he believes he is agreeing to.

As Trizechahn correctly points out, Paragraph 15(g) does not impose any separate condition, obligation, or requirement upon the tenant beyond the obligation to pay legal fees. Appellees’ argument that the only legal fees in view are those incurred by Trizechahn when it makes a payment or performs an act in place of T &amp; M is unconvincing because Trizechahn’s contractual right to take such action does not constitute “enforce[ment of] performance by Tenant of any condition, obligation or requirement[.]” There is a qualitative difference between Trizechahn making payments or performing other actions in place of T &amp; M, and Trizechahn “enforce[ing] performance by Tenant” through resort to the legal process. Therefore, Appellees’ indication that the word “hereunder” associated with the latter occurrence only applies to the former is illogical. Additionally, the same word, “hereunder,” is used later in Paragraph 15(g) when referring to the sums paid by the lessor becoming “additional rent hereunder.” In this case, “hereunder” could not possibly mean “under Paragraph 15(g),” as rent is not <a id="p654" href="#p654" data-label="654" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*654</a>discussed anywhere else in Paragraph 15(g), but is provided for in Paragraph 1. <em>See </em>Master Lease at 1, ¶ 1, RR. 128a.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Thus, the only reasonable way to understand the clause’s reference to Trizechahn’s “enforce[ing] performance by Tenant of any condition, obligation or requirement hereunder” is that “hereunder” refers to the lease as a whole, and not merely to Paragraph 15(g). Accordingly, there is no ambiguity but rather, as determined by the common pleas court, a clear agreement by the parties to award counsel fees.

That mandate is reinforced in other portions of the Uniform Partnership Act indicating that all partners have equal rights in the conduct and management of the partnership, <em>see </em>15 Pa.C.S. § 8331(5), and that each partner "must contribute towards the losses, whether of capital or otherwise, sustained by the partnership, according to his share in the profits,” <em><a href="/pa/578/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="849 A.2d 1159" data-case-ids="1329362,9244026" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0082-01,/a2d/849/1159-01">id.,</a> </em>§ 8331(1). Notably, Section 8327(2) contains only one exception to this general scheme, and that exception relates to a partner's decision to enter into a "separate obligation” to perform a partnership contract; this allows for a partner voluntarily to incur special obligations not shared by the others, rather than to place liabilities onto the others that he does not himself share.</p>

Trizechahn also points out that “hereunder" is used in other parts of the master lease where it is evident that the term refers to the entire lease. For example, under Paragraph 28(i), discussed above, persons signing in a representative capacity "shall [not] be deemed or held individually liable hereunder,” meaning under the lease.</p>
