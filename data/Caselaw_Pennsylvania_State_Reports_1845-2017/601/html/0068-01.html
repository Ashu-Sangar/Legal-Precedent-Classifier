The victim, S.E., testified that her assailant was riding a bicycle and wearing a black outfit. He took her into an alley by a dumpster where he threatened her at gunpoint and forced her to engage in oral and vaginal intercourse. After the attack, S.E. went to her friend’s house. The friend ultimately contacted police, who took the victim to the hospital. Medical personnel observed that the victim had suffered multiple abrasions to the genital area. A rape kit examination yielded DNA evidence that implicated Appellant.</p>

Appellant described each encounter and characterized all of them as consensual. He admitted that he wore a black outfit during some of the encounters, that he rode a bicycle, and that the telephone he was carrying could have been perceived as a gun. When asked about any other crimes he knew about in the neighborhood, Appellant told police that a friend of his had raped a woman in an alley. According to Appellant, the friend committed the attack at gunpoint and forced his victim to engage in oral and vaginal intercourse. Appellant explained that his friend told him <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>about the crimes because the two men “looked alike” and Appellant should be careful not to “get caught.”</p>

The 2007 amendments addressed these difficulties and made sweeping changes which included a longer period for filing, explicit provisions for extensions of time to file, and detailed direction on the information a Statement should include.

Furthermore, the Commonwealth points to the Superior Court’s alternative holding that the single substantive issue Appellant seeks to pursue to challenge his conviction is waived for the independent reason that he failed to ensure transmission of a complete record on appeal. In light of this holding, which Appellant did not challenge in his petition for allowance of appeal and is outside the scope of our review, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 73 n. 3, 970 A.2d at 1140 n. 3, the Commonwealth explains that no relief is available to Appellant in the present appeal in any event.</p>

For all of these reasons, I do not support the majority’s utilization of this appeal as a vehicle for imposing another bright-line rule. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 82, 970 A.2d at 1145 (“The failure to file ... an application within the 21-day time limit set forth in Rule 1925(b)(2) will result in waiver of all <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>issues not raised by that date.”). My concern arises, in particular, since the majority now appears to disavow the limited flexibility which we had just incorporated into the very recent rule amendments. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) (“In extraordinary circumstances, the [common pleas] judge may allow for the filing of a Statement ... <em>nunc pro tunc.”).</em>

    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[287,677,1153,743]]]'>Finally, I also differ with the majority’s perception that there is some ambiguity in new Rule 1925 in terms of whether an application should be written. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 80, 970 A.2d at 1144. As the Commonwealth also explains, under the explicit terms of the existing Rules of Appellate Procedure, “[u]nless another form is elsewhere prescribed by these rules, an application for an order or other relief shall be made by filing a written application for such order or relief with proof of service on all other parties.” Pa.R.A.P. 123(a). Since Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b)(2) does not specify any alternative form, I do not see that there is anything unclear about the requirement of a written application to obtain an extension of the time period for filing a statement of matters complained of on appeal.</p>

The Commonwealth makes the logical argument that an application is akin to a petition, which is defined as a "formal written request presented to a court." Appellee’s Brief at 21 (citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1165 (7th ed. 1999)). We agree. <em>See also </em>Pa.R.A.P. 123(a) (describing applications for relief as written requests). As we explain <em>infra, </em>all appellants seeking an extension under Rule 1925 from this date forward must make a written application to the trial court.</p>

At the time <em>Lord </em>was decided, a recently enacted rule of criminal procedure, now Pa.R.Crim.P. 720, eliminated post-verdict motions.

In a thoughtful dissenting opinion, Justice Saylor suggests that this Court should decline this appeal as improvidently granted. Justice Saylor observes that our holding has a narrow effect and, further, that <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>Appellant has an alternative basis for relief, i.e., he may seek reinstatement of his direct appeal rights by filing a petition for collateral relief. These observations are both correct and compelling. Like the dissent, we too favor the rulemaking process as the proper vehicle for changes to any rule of this Court. But our intention here is to <em>clarify; </em>it is the confusion and uncertainty surrounding Rule 1925 that prompts our decision in this case. The dissenting opinion further suggests that in reaching this decision, we have disavowed that part of the Amended Rule that authorizes the trial court, in "extraordinary circumstances,” to "allow for the filing of a Statement ... <em>nunc pro tunc." </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). We in no manner renounce any part of the Amended Rule, including that part that authorizes the trial court to permit a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>filing in light of extraordinary circumstances.</p>
