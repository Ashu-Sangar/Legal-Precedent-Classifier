While it is true that the text of Act 106 does not include the terms “medical necessity” or “utilization review,” we cannot agree with the Federation’s assertion that “Act 106 is simply silent as to who makes the ultimate and controlling ‘medical necessity’ determination with respect to the benefits actually delivered to the insured and paid for by the insurer.” Federation’s Brief at 28 (emphasis added).</p>

Nothing in Sections 908-4 and 908-5 implies or suggests that managed care plans may superimpose an additional, potentially overriding review process, such as utilization review for medical necessity and appropriateness, once a licensed professional has made the explicitly required certification and referral.

Any other interpretation of the plain text of the Act would render hollow the express statutory grant of authority to a licensed physician (or a psychologist in some cases) to certify and to refer the insured for “appropriate treatment.” 40 P.S. §§ 908-4 and 908-5. For example, if a physician certifies an insured as suffering from drug or alcohol abuse/dependency and refers the insured for residential treatment services, the statute does not permit the insurer to conclude that outpatient treatment services would be adequate and could be substituted, based on utilization review or other criteria. Likewise, in another illustrative example, if the <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>referring physician determines that the “appropriate treatment” for an insured requires seven days of services, then the insurer cannot conclude that one day of services is adequate based on utilization review.

However, Section 908-3’s benefits require inpatient care, which by definition requires admission to a hospital or similar facility and thus necessarily involves determinations by a licensed physician. <em>See </em>40 P.S. §§ 908-1 and 908-3. Most relevantly, detoxification is statutorily defined as a process whereby an alcohol- or drug-dependent or intoxicated person is assisted, in a licensed facility, through the period of time necessary to eliminate the alcohol and/or drugs from the body “as determined by a licensed physician, while keeping the physiological risk to the patient at a minimum.” 40 P.S. § 908-1.

We discern no indication in either Act 106 or Act 68 that the General Assembly intended such a result.

We cannot agree. Although Act 106 does not use the exact language of Section 764d(a), Act 106 does indeed specify with whom the authority lies for establishing the need for treatment for drug and alcohol abuse/dependency.

These very general policy considerations surrounding managed care need not constrict the choices of the General Assembly when it seeks to address concerns with regard to the availability or delivery of specific health care services. As we have discussed, the General Assembly has chosen to legislate on the delivery of several specific health care services, <em>e.g., </em>annual gynecological examinations, mammography, inpatient care for new mothers, childhood immunizations, and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. <em>See </em>text <em>supra. </em>In these cases, the General Assembly's judgment was properly informed by the individual characteristics and cost-benefit analyses of the specific medical examination, test, or treatment under consideration.</p>

It was for the General Assembly to balance the cost of requiring insurers to provide drug and alcohol abuse treatment against the potential benefits of doing so.

Initially, I agree with the Insurance Federation’s core position that Act 106, on its face, does not foreclose utilization review. In this regard, I do not believe that the Legislature’s decision to mandate coverage in the abstract, <em>see </em>40 P.S. § 908-2 (requiring that certain insurance policies “include within the coverage [certain] benefits for alcohol or other drug abuse and dependence”), equates to an express prohibition against implementing the required benefits -within the terms of the insurer’s pre-existing business model.

In this regard, I differ with the lead opinion’s position that because Act 106 imposes certification and referral prerequisites to obtaining care, it necessarily prohibits any other prerequisites — or, for that matter, any concurrent or retrospective review process. More centrally, I differ with the lead opinion’s position that Act 106’s terms imposing a requirement of certification and referral upon an <em>insured </em>(“Before an insured may qualify to receive benefits under this section, a licensed physician or licensed psychologist must certify the insured as a person suffering from alcohol or drug abuse dependency and refer the insured for appropriate treatment,” 40 P.S. §§ 908-4, 908-5), amounts to an express prohibition against utilization review of medical necessity and appropriateness on behalf of the <em>insurer. See </em>Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, at 35-37, 970 A.2d at 1117-18. Rather, facially, the statute indicates only that a patient cannot self-refer for such services. Furthermore, as the Insurance Federation stresses, the above-quoted provision does not contain terms in any way similar to the Depart-<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>merit’s 2003 notice declaring that “the only lawful prerequisite before an insured obtains nonhospital residential and outpatient coverage [and inpatient detoxification] for alcohol and drug dependency treatment is a certification and referral from a licensed physician or licensed psychologist,” and “[t]he certification and referral in all instances controls both the nature and duration of the treatment.” I also disagree with the suggestion that, merely because the definition of detoxification indicates that the process is to be administered by a licensed physician, the Legislature intended managed care organizations to abandon their business model and accept the unconstrained determination of any physician. <em>See </em>Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, at 36, 970 A.2d at 1118.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

Each of these, however, is materially distinct from Act 106. As to the requirements to provide benefits associated with annual gynecological examinations and mammograms, these preventative measures generally apply with respect to an entire class of individuals (women) and on a specific time table <em>(ie., </em>annually). 40 P.S. §§ 764c, 1574.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> Childhood immunizations are also <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>class-wide, preventative measures following a typical regimen, unlike drug and alcohol treatment, which is specific to individual patients and has aspects that are substantially remedial. The operation of the statute requiring coverage for inpatient care for new mothers is, again, a class-wide measure based upon an indisputable event, the delivery of a child. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 1583(a). Finally, the statute requiring the provision of insurance coverage for inpatient care related to mastectomies and breast cancer reconstruction specifically designates that length of stay is determined by the “treating physician,” 40 P.S. § 764d(a)(2, 3), thus expressly foreclosing utilization review. I agree with the Insurance Federation that the language contained in this statute demonstrates that the Legislature knows how to place the judgment as to medical necessity and duration of treatment expressly and exclusively within the hands of a treating physician. Therefore, I believe the General Assembly’s failure to do so across the provisions of Act 106 supports the Federation’s position that it did not manifest an intention to displace utilization review.</p>

The legislative history of Act 106 reflects the concern of legislators with the treatment of those suffering from alcohol- and drug-related addictions, as well as the alleviation of attendant social problems. However, it also reflects regard for cost control and the burden imposed on insurance companies. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa. Leg. Journal — House 1945-50 (November 29, 1989). Notably, there is no indication in the statute or in the legislative history that the Legislature designed for insurance companies to fund treatment that is not medically necessary or appropriate. Accordingly, to the degree that managed care organizations maintain appropriate criteria for medical <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>necessity and appropriateness, I do not regard the application of utilization review as fundamentally inconsistent with Act 106.

However, no such record has been presented to this Court. Moreover, if the mandatory benefits are truly being subverted, the Department has an available and appropriate remedy, in that it is authorized to promulgate substantive rules and regulations it deems necessary for the effective implementation of Act 106. <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 908-7. The formal process for the promulgation of such rules and regulations affords notice and an opportunity on the part of those affected to be heard, as well as the <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>assurance of regularity properly attaching to major policy milestones. <em>See </em>45 P.S. §§ 1201-1208; 71 P.S. §§ 745.1-745.14. In this regard, it seems to me that the Department’s repeated expression of concerns with inappropriate administration of insurance benefits at the whims of insurance companies are matched by the Insurance Federation’s concern with informal, wholesale alterations of policy on the impulse of state agencies. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief of Appellant at 47 (“So what are insurers to do, knowing that when the mood hits it a state agency can issue a ‘notice’ and dramatically change the law overnight?”).</p>

Here, however, I might accord more deference to the Department’s interpretation if it would provide greater context concerning its prior interpretation of Act 106 and/or support for its repeated implications that managed care organizations abuse utilization review with regard to Act 106 benefits when permitted to apply it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a> Moreover, the Department’s 2003 notice contains several mistakes and inconsistencies, which I believe further diminish the degree of deference due the notice and the associated reversal of policy. For example, the Department now recognizes that the notice’s specification for referral to detoxification by a licensed psychologist finds <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>no basis in the statutory text. <em>See </em>Brief for the Department at 12. Moreover, the statutory provisions mandating benefits for detoxification contain no requirement for certification or referral at all.
