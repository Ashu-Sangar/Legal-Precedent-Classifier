The court held that the PLCB’s interpretation of Section 102 was inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, which provided that the primary purpose of a retail dispenser is to engage in the sale of beer for on-premises consumption, and that providing beer for takeout sales was only secondary. It concluded that, by allowing a retail dispenser to sell either for on-site consumption or takeout, the PLCB erroneously inserted “either/or” language into the statute when none existed. Further, the court found that the PLCB’s interpretation lacked common sense and queried why the PLCB would license an entity “to engage in the retail sale of malt or brewed beverages for consumption on the premises” when that entity expressly prohibited the sale of beverages for that purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The dissent mirrored the position taken by the PLCB — that Section 102 merely permits the sale of beer for on-site consumption, but does not require it. It interpreted Section 102 as providing that one who has permission to sell beer for on-site consumption (by license) may (by privilege) sell beer in limited quantities to persons for off-site consumption. The dissent further opined that the majority erred by reading the definition in Section 102 in isolation, without examining it in context with other provisions of the Code, including Section 442(a), which addresses the means by which retail dispensers can receive and dispense beer, and states that retail dispensers may “break the bulk upon the licensed premises and sell or dispense the same for consumption on or off the premises so licensed.” 47 P.S. § 4-442(a)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> As a final point, the dissent reiterated the view that the majority’s reading of Section 102 mandated a licensee to use its license to the fullest extent, a proposition never adopted by any court or statute.</p>

In determining whether Ohio Springs is entitled to an eating place malt beverage license when it prohibits on-site consumption of beer, we examine the relevant language of the Code. As noted, under Section 432(a) of the Code, the PLCB is authorized to issue a retail dispenser’s license to, <em>inter alia, </em>an eating place that “meet[s] all the requirements of [the Code] and the regulations of the [PLCB].” 47 P.S. § 4-432(a). The disputed requirement at issue provides that retail dispenser means one “licensed to engage in the retail sale of [beer] for consumption on the premises of such licensee, with the privilege of selling [beer in limited quantities] ... to be carried from the premises ...” 47 P.S. § 1-102.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[318,1254,1153,735]]]'>The crux of the dispute focuses on whether the two types of beer sales contemplated in Section 102 — the sale of beer for on-site consumption and the sale of beer for carry-out purchases — are independent alternatives or whether the sale of beer for takeout is contingent upon the sale of beer for consumption on the premises of the facility. Initially, we recognize that there is no mandatory language in Section 102, expressly requiring the sale of beer for on-site consumption as a prerequisite to the sale of beer for takeout. Thus, as advocated by Ohio Springs and the PLCB, the language could be construed as holding that one who is “licensed” to sell beer for on-site consumption, but does not exercise such right, retains the “privilege” of selling beer solely for carry-out purposes.</p>

As advocated by MBDA, the Legislature did not employ “either/or” language indicating that the two types of beer sales were equal alternatives. Further, the sentence structure of Section 102 supports the view that the Legislature intended to make the sale of beer for takeout contingent upon the licensee engaging in the sale of beer for on-site consumption. Specifically, the placement of the phrase “with the privilege [of selling beer for carry-out]” after the Legislature defines a retail dispenser as “any person licensed to engage in the retail sale of [beer] for consumption on the premises,” tends to indicate that the primary purpose of a retail dispenser is to sell beer to be ingested at the facility, with the privilege of selling beer for takeout being secondary to such purpose.</p>

We are confident that if the Legislature had intended to permit retail dispensers, who do not serve alcohol at their facilities, to sell six-packs to the general public, it surely would have utilized clear language authorizing such sales in a distinct provision of the Code. To the contrary, as noted <em>supra, </em>the language and sentence structure employed in Section 102’s definition of retail dispenser leads one to conclude that the principal definition of a retail dispenser is an entity licensed to serve beer on the premises, with the secondary permissible function being the sale of a limited quantity of beer for takeout. While the General Assembly could have more carefully drafted the statutory provision at issue in order to close the current loophole utilized by the PLCB to justify the issuance of a license to Ohio Springs, we refuse to adopt the PLCB’s hyper-technical interpretation given the wide-ranging ramifications of doing so. As noted earlier, under such an interpretation, far more commercial facilities, which were never clearly contemplated by the Legislature to sell beer through any provision of the Code, could be licensed to sell six-packs.

    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.9",543,[192,1101,1155,992]]]'>This language is unambiguous and contains no restriction upon a retail dispenser’s ability to sell beer for take-out, beyond the requirement that it be licensed. In fact, the majority admits that nothing in the statute’s language mandates the sale of beer for on-site consumption as a prerequisite to the sale of beer for take-out, yet concludes the legislature meant to create such a requirement. Majority Op., at 462-64, 974 A.2d at 1152-53. It bases this conclusion in part on the placement of the phrase “with the privilege [of selling beer for take-out],” which is after and set apart from the phrase, “any person licensed to engage in the retail sale of [beer] for consumption on the premises.” <em>Id., </em>at 463, 974 A.2d at 1152 (quoting 47 P.S. § 1-102). However, the location and comma separation of the phrases do not linguistically or logically imply the grant under the latter phrase is contingent upon exercise of the rights given in first.

In fact, § 4-442 of the Code — specifically titled “Retail dispensers’ restrictions on purchases and <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>sales” — states “a retail dispenser may ... break the bulk [of its beer] upon the licensed premises and sell or dispense the same for consumption on or off the premises so licensed.” 47 P.S. § 4-442(a)(l). This provision, like § 1-102, contains no requirement a retail dispenser sell beer for on-site consumption in order to sell take-out; rather, it unequivocally states the retailer has the discretion to divide its sales as it sees fit. Logically, this division may include the decision to sell all beer as take-out, some beer as take-out, or no take-out at all.</p>
    <p id="b544-4" data-blocks='[["BL_544.5",544,[314,848,1152,956]]]'>Despite the majority’s specific observance that the statute’s plain language creates no sale contingency, it refuses to accept what it characterizes as a “hyper-technical interpretation given the wide-ranging ramifications” of accepting the “current loophole.” Majority Op., at 465, 974 A.2d at 1154. A loophole is “[a]n ambiguity, omission, or exception (as in a law or other legal document) that <em>provides a way to avoid a rule </em>without violating its literal requirements.” Black’s Law Dictionary 962 (8th ed.2004) (emphasis added). By definition, a loophole cannot exist where there is no behavioral rule, restriction, or requirement — there is no rule being avoided here, for there is no rule on this point at all. The statute’s plain language clearly does not require sales on-site, nor does it prohibit a retail dispenser from choosing to sell all its beer for take-out, and one requires no “hyper-technical,” linguistic gymnastics to reach such a plain conclusion. As there is no rule or restriction, there can be no loophole, and the majority’s characterization of the statute as such is misplaced.</p>

This is a misleading argument. There is no license category other than the one that allows both on-site and take-out; it provides that if you are licensed for the former, you may do the latter. If you want to sell take-out, get a retailer’s license. There is no need for a separate category.</p>

That is, the rule is that one may sell take-out with this license — if on-site sales are a requirement of exercising the privilege, that is an exception to the rule and <em>that </em>is what should appear in a “distinct provision.”</p>

The statute says the retail dispenser already has the ability to sell take-out beer, whether incident to consumption on the premises or not. This right exists, “unburdened,” without statutory requirement that beer be consumed on premises. If a retail dispenser eliminates the on-premises sales, does that dispenser acquire something other dispensers do not have? No. If one has the right to sell for on-site consumption as well as take-out, and one gives up the on-site sales, are the take-out sales somehow transformed into something that did not otherwise exist? Again, no. Simply put, the issue is subtraction, not addition.</p>

This ignores the fact that retail dispensers are already permitted to distribute without such “burden.” Its fear also ignores the fact that distributors distribute to retailers as well as the public.
