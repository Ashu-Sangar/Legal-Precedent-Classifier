William Wilt, a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, sought to enjoin the Secretary of Public Welfare and the State Treasurer from taking steps to operate an unused geriatric center as a mental health care facility. In his original complaint filed in the Commonwealth Court, Representative Wilt alleged only his standing to sue as a taxpayer of the Commonwealth. Preliminary objections were filed to the complaint challenging Wilt’s standing to sue. Following a hearing, Wilt was granted leave to file an amended complaint to assert his standing as a legislator, in addition to his status <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>as a taxpayer. The preliminary objections to the complaint were stayed pending the amendment of the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b413-4" data-blocks='[["BL_413.5",413,[191,454,1151,731]]]'>In considering the preliminary objections, the Commonwealth Court examined federal cases that had recognized the standing of a legislator to sue in limited circumstances. The Commonwealth Court observed that standing had been granted to legislators in cases asserting claims that their unique legislative powers had been infringed. Thus, the court noted, legislative standing had been recognized where an individual legislator alleged a deprivation of his right to vote to override a veto, and where state senators had challenged an illegal tie-breaking vote cast by a lieutenant governor. Legislative standing was not extended, however, where legislators’ votes had been duly counted but the legislators claimed the effectiveness of the legislation had been impaired by some subsequent event.</p>

Some other nexus must then be found to challenge the allegedly unlawful action. We find this distinction to be sound for it is clear that certain additional duties are placed upon members of the legislative branch which find no counterpart in the duties placed upon the citizens the legislators represent. These duties have their origin in the Constitution and in that sense create constitutional powers to enforce those duties. Such powers are in addition to what we normally speak of as the constitutional rights enjoyed by all citizens. To give but one familiar example, under the Pennsylvania Constitution, members of the Senate have the duty to approve or disapprove certain appointments made by the Governor.

The respondents argued that the senators were afforded the opportunity to exercise their power as legislators by voting on the nominee and that their special interest ceased to exist after they had voted.

The original members of the governing board that had previously been appointed by the Mayor were to continue to serve out their terms, but no new members could be appointed by the Mayor.

HSP argues that the appellants have failed to demonstrate that a political subdivision’s purported usurpation of the power to issue licenses to use riparian land would remain unchallenged unless an individual taxpayer was granted standing to challenge such action. HSP notes the obvious: <em>i.e., </em>that the Commonwealth executive would be uniquely suited to challenge any allegedly unlawful usurpation of its property by a political subdivision, and there has been no indication that the <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>Commonwealth executive power would not be inclined to challenge the City’s authority to license riparian lands, if the executive (via the Governor, Attorney General, or other executive power) believed such a usurpation had occurred.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[175,568,1153,693]]]'>As to the claim that the City lacked the authority to issue HSP the submerged lands license, we conclude that City Council and Councilman DiCicco have not satisfied the requirements necessary for taxpayer standing under <em>Biester. </em>The City’s exercise of the statutory authority to issue the riparian license pursuant to Act 321 is not governmental activity that, by its very nature, otherwise could not be subject to challenge in the courts. Indeed, the City’s authority has been challenged in court. The state legislators presently raise the issue in Claim I and the City joined the issue in these consolidated appeals when a new mayoral administration attempted to revoke the riparian license issued by the prior administration’s Department of Commerce. <em>See supra </em>n. 1.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.6",427,[170,1309,1158,1061]]]'>The same holds true for the alternative claim the state legislators make regarding the manner in which former Commerce Director Naidoff exercised her statutory authority under Act 321. In <em>HSP Gaming, </em>the City questioned her assessment of the authority she was given under Act 321 to license the construction of a casino complex. <em>Id. </em>Further, just as the Auditor General was better situated than taxpayer Stilp, the Commonwealth executive power is better positioned than individual state legislators, as taxpayers, to challenge the City’s executive action in licensing the use of Commonwealth lands. In addition, there has been no argument showing that those more directly and immediately affected are beneficially affected, and that the Commonwealth executive power would be disinclined to challenge the City’s exercise of its statutory authority in an appropriate case. Surely, the fact that more appropriate governmental parties have not elected to challenge a particular governmental decision cannot be enough on its own to generate taxpayer standing — particularly where those executive authorities are not “beneficially affected” by the decision.</p>

The new mayoral administration replaced Commerce Director Naidoff with Acting Commerce Director Duane H. Bumb. On January 24, 2008, Acting Commerce Director Bumb mailed a Notice of Revocation of License Issued in Error ("revocation notice”) to HSP. In the revocation notice, the City asserted that the Commerce Department's November 27, 2007 decision to issue HSP the submerged lands license was erroneous because, <em>inter alia: </em>the City's authority in such matters was moribund; the decision was contrary to the General Assembly’s intent to control riparian rights; and the decision violated the terms of Act 321, in allowing construction upon submerged lands and not mandating the production of evidence of deed or title to the premises on which the casino is to be developed. On February 22, 2008, HSP filed a Petition of Review, docketed at No. 28 EM 2008, challenging the validity of the revocation notice.</p>

As the City acknowledged, while it had initially defended its authority to issue the submerged lands license in these appeals, it argued to the contrary in HSP's appeal, taking the position that its licensing power under Act 321 had been eliminated by certain legislative enactments and that only the General Assembly had the authority to license use of the Commonwealth’s submerged lands in the Delaware River. Following oral argument in these appeals, we granted the City’s request to consolidate “in order to provide a comprehensive consideration of the different positions taken by the City during the pendency of various appeals, and in order to facilitate a speedy and global resolution of the question concerning the submerged lands license." <em>HSP Gaming, </em><a href="/pa/598/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="954 A.2d 1156" data-case-ids="3992133,8181118" data-case-paths="/pa/598/0118-01,/a2d/954/1156-01">954 A.2d at 1168</a>.</p>

However, there are no allegations in the Petition for Review that Councilman DiCicco’s “affected neighborhood” or its "residents” have sustained any concrete injuries or adverse impact as a result of the City's licensing decision. Indeed, there is not so much as an averment concerning where the Councilman lives in proximity to the project, much less how it would affect him as a resident. Notably, in this case, the one and only claim Councilman DiCicco asserts is that the City’s decision to grant the submerged lands license was unauthorized and the one and only interest he advances in pursuing his claim is that the law regarding the grant of riparian rights should be properly administered. Without the necessary factual predicate indicating his proximity to the project, much less how the specific decision he would challenge affects him as a resident, we cannot conclude that Councilman DiCicco <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>has the resident standing he declares he possesses.
