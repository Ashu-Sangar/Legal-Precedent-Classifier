At common law, an employer may terminate an at-will employee for any reason unless that reason violates a clear mandate of public policy emanating from either the Pennsylvania Constitution or statutory pronouncements.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In this case, we address the intersection of the PHRA and the public policy exception to at-will employment, namely, whether an employer with fewer than four employees, although not subject to the PHRA’s prohibition against sexual discrimination, nevertheless is prohibited from discriminating against an employee on the basis of sex. Because the PHRA reflects the unambiguous policy determination by the legislature that employers with fewer than four employees will not be liable for sex discrimination in Pennsylvania, we are constrained to conclude that a common law claim for wrongful discharge, resulting from sex discrimination, will not lie against those employers. We therefore reverse the Superior Court.</p>

First, regarding the PHRA, Employer argues that it is clearly inapplicable because it exempts small employers of less than four employees, thus demonstrating a public policy to protect small employers from defending against claims based on sex discrimination. To find in the PHRA a public policy that reaches small employers when the language of the PHRA itself is explicitly limited to employers of four or more employees would, according to Employer, require this Court to usurp the role of the legislature and extend protections to employees that the legislature chose not to protect in the PHRA.</p>

Similarly, Employer urges this Court to decline to find a public policy exception to at-will employment for employees who are sexually harassed by small employers premised upon a statute that exempts small employers. Second, regarding the Equal Rights Amendment as the source of public policy, Employer argues that by its terms, the Amendment affords “equality of rights <em>under the law </em>” (emphasis added by Employer). Affording equal rights under the law circumscribes the conduct of state and local governmental entities and officials in their formulation, interpretation, and enforcement of statutes and regulations. <em>See Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. v.

The legislature’s decision to lower the employee threshold from twelve to six to four, but not to one, indicates the lack of unanimous opinion that every employee should be protected from sex discrimination as Employee asserts. The legislature has had the opportunity to argue the merits of exempting small employers from compliance and to decide exactly where it should establish the threshold. It explicitly chose not to extend the protections against discrimination to employees of small employers. The wisdom of this decision is not before us.

We have not invoked the Equal Rights Amendment to provide a private cause of action for tort, nor have we invoked it to invalidate a statute that makes no distinctions based on gender. Employee has not identified any law under which she is being discriminated against. She is not being denied equal rights under the law due to her gender. Rather, the legislature has made the policy decision to exempt small employers from compliance with the PHRA. Therefore, Employee is being discriminated against because she works for a small employer. Such a distinction does not implicate the Equal Rights Amendment.</p>

The Superior Court, having concluded contrary to our holding that the PHRA and the Equal Rights Amendment provided a public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine, stated that it was difficult to believe that the legislature would first define certain acts as illegal via both the PHRA and the constitution, thus establishing a public policy unequivocally condemning such conduct, then remove all judicial recourse for the victims of that conduct. The legislature, however, did not characterize as unlawful all forms of discrimination; rather, it defined unlawful discrimination as that perpetrated by <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>“any employer,” which, as described above, includes employers of four or more employees. The PHRA, therefore, both defined the right and the remedy. <em>See Clay. </em>It did not, as the Superior Court found, extend the right to freedom from sex discrimination in the workplace to employees of smaller employers as defined by the act.</p>
    <p id="b591-5" data-blocks='[["BL_591.5",591,[201,678,1159,1231]]]'>We conclude, therefore, that Employee has not demonstrated that there exists a clear mandate of public policy prohibiting sex discrimination of all employees sufficient to overcome the employment at-will doctrine. The PHRA, which creates a narrow exception to employment at-will, prorides the remedy for the conduct it prohibits. It does not demonstrate a public policy sufficient to overcome its own limitation to employers of four or more employees. We cannot overlook the fact that the General Assembly decided not to make illegal the behavior of which Employee complains. While the PHRC announces a right to be free from sex discrimination in the workplace, 48 P.S. 955(a), it qualifies this right by granting it only where the employer meets the statutory definition. <em>Id.; </em>43 P.S. 954(b). It is not the role of this Court to create a private cause of action where the General Assembly has decided not to create a right or a remedy for victims of sex discrimination by small employers. Allowing a discharged at-will employee to commence an action in the courts premised on the right to be free from discrimination based on sex when the statute creating such a right does not extend it to her would be logically inconsistent with the legislature’s haring limited the PHRA’s reach to employers of four or more employees.

In footnote 10, the Majority asserts that the Human Relations Act is the "exclusive state law remedy for unlawful discrimination, <em>preempting </em>the advancement of common law claims for wrongful discharge based on claims of discrimination." Majority Opinion at 509 n. 10, 975 A.2d at 567-68 n. 10 (emphasis added). In reaching this conclusion, the Majority does not engage in any traditional preemption analysis, but, rather, references a 15-year-old federal district court case. While the terms of the Human Relations Act may "exempt” smaller employers from its coverage, there is no suggestion of preemption, and prior to today’s decision, our Court has never addressed this issue. Moreover, the Majority’s contention of statutory preemption avoids the thrust of what I believe to be the proper analysis: a limited common law claim for wrongful discharge based upon gender discrimination that is grounded upon public policy as plainly expressed in the Pennsylvania Constitution, not solely in the statute. Furthermore, in footnote 12, the Majority criticizes the dissenters for offering "without evidence” the proposition that "administrative compliance and litigation is more burdensome than litigation in courts.” Majority Opinion at 510 n. 12, 975 A.2d at 568 n. 12. There is no need for "evidence” to establish what the Majority already acknowledges in its opinion: there exists under the Human Relations Act <em>both </em>a mandatory administrative process <em>and </em>the specter of subsequent litigation in the courts. Majority Opinion at 506-07, 975 A.2d at 565-66; 43 P.S. § 962(c). Thus, it is self-evident that having to first exhaust an administrative process and then litigate in the judicial system would be more burdensome and expensive than only litigating in the courts.</p>
