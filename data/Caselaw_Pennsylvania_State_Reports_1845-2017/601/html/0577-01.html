Citing the long-standing common-law precept known as the deference rule, according to which civil courts decline to exercise jurisdiction over cases that would require them to decide ecclesiastical questions, the lower courts held that they lacked jurisdiction over the instant case. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the lower courts erred in finding that the deference rule applies here, and we therefore reverse and remand the matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

The dispute arose in May 1865, just after the end of the Civil War, when the governing body of the national denomination, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, adopted a resolution requiring members of every local church to renounce slavery. Thereafter, a local church in Louisville, Kentucky, rebelled against the resolution by electing pro-slavery officers to manage the church property. Anti-slavery members of the church then sued in state court to contest the validity of the election. Having failed to obtain relief there, anti-slavery members who were citizens of Indiana sued in federal court, raising the more general question of which of the two competing factions was entitled to use of the local church. Claiming that the pro-slavery officers of the local church had effectively seceded from the national denomination, the anti-slavery members initially prevailed. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the pro-slavery members argued that the national denomination had forfeited control of the local church’s property by passing the anti-slavery resolution because the resolution departed from basic principles of the faith pursuant to which the local church was founded.</p>

Accordingly, the Court framed its analysis by distinguishing among three distinct categories of church property disputes. The first category that the Court recognized was composed of cases in which the church property in dispute was held in express trust to sustain certain church doctrine or principles, and the dispute concerned whether the property was being used in violation of such doctrine or principles.

More specifically, the Gastons alleged that their children had been expelled in retaliation for the Gastons’ criticism of a course that their son, Joseph, was then taking that the course’s students were instructed not to discuss outside the classroom or even remove the course textbook therefrom.

For purposes of preliminary objections, appellees’ tactic is unavailing for two reasons. First, appellees’ reasons for making the Communications are irrelevant to the only element of appellants’ defamation claims that appellees have so far contested — namely, the defamatory nature of the Communications. Second, even if appellees contested the second element of the defamation claims — that they published the Communications — the inquiry concerning that element is not why appellees published the Communications but whether appellees published them. Thus, although appellees lift quotations from the School’s Student/Parent Handbook in an attempt to cast the Information Letter in a <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>more doctrinal light, the fact that, for instance, the School’s teachers are to lead “by example” — or that the letter itself contains religious language — is relevant neither to the defamatory nature of the Communications nor to the allegation that appellees made them. Appellants are challenging the truth of the statement that Eric brought a weapon to school, not the truth of the statements that Eric failed to “convey respect to God, self, teachers, adults and other students,” ignored “Christ’s teachings and moral values,” or failed to “love God and to respect [his] neighbor” (R.R. at 40a-41a, 34a-35a).

Indeed, whether the item that Eric was expelled for bringing to school constitutes a weapon is a secular factual matter well within the ken of a fact-finding civil court. Section 1317.2 of the School Code requires the expulsion of “any student who is determined to have brought onto or is in possession of a weapon on any school property.” 24 P.S. § 13-1317.2(a). The statute defines weapon as “includ[ing], but not be[ing] limited to, any knife, cutting instrument, cutting tool, nunchaku, firearm, <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>shotgun, rifle and any other tool, instrument or implement capable of inflicting serious bodily injury.” 24 P.S. § 13-1317.2(g). In at least one published decision, this definition has been interpreted and applied by a civil court. <em>See Picone v. Bangor Area Sch.

Although the School Code is not applicable to St. Eleanor’s, appellees do not cite any religious authority suggesting that there is a Roman Catholic definition of “weapon” that is distinct from that set forth at Section 1317.2(g). Certainly, neither this Court nor any other in Pennsylvania is any less learned than the Archdiocese as to such a secular question. <em>See Watson v.
