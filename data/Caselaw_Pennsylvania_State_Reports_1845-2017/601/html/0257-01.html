[Reed] and Gill then went to her mother’s house. There [Reed] changed clothes and smoked some “wet,” meaning PCP, along with Gill and her aunt.

At some point, Lyles ran out of the store. Gill thought Lyles told [Reed] what the decedent had said. Gill came out afterward and saw [Reed] standing in a nearby alley with his .9mm hand gun cocked. Gill stated that she thought [Reed] was acting irrationally and asked him to give her his handgun to hold and to come home with her. [Reed] refused and told her to lure the decedent outside so he could shoot him. Gill refused, and told [Reed] to forget about decedent’s comments.

The record reflects that [Reed] had pled guilty to murder generally. The hearing was for the purpose of establishing the appropriate degree of murder, which depends on a defendant’s intent or <em>mens rea. </em>The events leading to the killing were critical to [Reed’s] degree of guilt, particularly in light of [Reed’s] defense of diminished capacity and his expert’s testimony concerning the effects of PCP use. The evidence was, therefore, admissible under Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2), which permits evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts for the purpose of proving intent, preparation, or plan, all of which were at issue in this case. Also, in a general way, the evidence was admissible under the exception contained in <em>[Commonwealth v. </em>Billa, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">521 Pa. 168</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="521 Pa. 168" data-case-ids="1817463" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0168-01">555 A.2d 835</a>, 840 (1989)] (the bad acts were part of a chain or sequence of events that formed the history of the case and were part of its natural development.)

        <em>Id. </em>at 7. With respect to the Superior Court’s discussion in this regard, we make two clarifications. First, the Superior Court's characterization of the position of the PCRA court and the Commonwealth concerning the presumption of prejudice in the instant case is not entirely accurate. Indeed, in its opinion, the PCRA court stated "there is no question that [Reed] has proven his claim has arguable merit and that counsel had no reasonable and/or strategic basis for not providing the Superior court with the required documentation. <em>[Reed] has not, however, established that he was actually or constiTictively prejudiced by counsel's inaction." </em>PCRA Court Opinion, 5/29/07, at 3 (emphasis added). Likewise, the Commonwealth asserts in its brief that, because there was not a complete denial of counsel, it was error to presume prejudice. Commonwealth's Brief at 12. Thus, neither the PCRA court nor the Commonwealth agrees that prejudice must be presumed. Indeed, the issue of whether Reed is entitled to a presumption of prejudice clearly is in dispute. Second, the Superior Court's suggestion that a presumption of prejudice may be "overcome" is also erroneous. Indeed, the crux of a presumption of prejudice is that it cannot be rebutted. <em>See supra.</em>

    <p id="b350-9" data-blocks='[["BL_350.11",350,[289,1959,1156,405]]]'>I respectfully dissent, as I regard representation by counsel whose dereliction forecloses effective merits review of all claims raised on appeal to be the functional equivalent of having no counsel at all. I do not see a material difference between forfeiting the entire appeal based on untimely filing; failure to perfect the appeal; and failure to file a brief which can be considered on the merits. In each event, the client garners no effective appellate merits review of any issue.</p>

      <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>The majority expresses the concern that extending the presumption of prejudice to a defect in an appellate brief “essentially would transform the exception into a rule, as many appellate briefs contain at least one arguable defect.” Majority Opinion, at 275, 971 A.2d at 1227. However, as Appellee stresses throughout his present brief, the situation at hand is one in which counsel on direct appeal forfeited one-hundred percent of the claims raised on appeal. Since this simply is not the norm in appellate litigation, I do not believe the majority’s floodgates concern carries a great deal of force. Moreover, this is not an issue entailing relief from the judgment of sentence. Rather, it concerns only the provision of the one appeal as of right to which Appellee was and is constitutionally entitled.</p>
