For the reasons stated below, we conclude the Securities Exchange Act does not preempt such state law claims against a national securities exchange such as PSX. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[193,662,1151,515]]]'>The facts underlying this appeal are straightforward. Appellee PSX is a national securities exchange and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. In 2002, Appellant William J. Dooner worked as a stock trader on the floor of PSX and was a member of that exchange. Appellee Ralph DiDonato was registered as an equity options trader, was also a member of PSX, and like Dooner, conducted business on the floor of PSX. Both Dooner and DiDonato traded on the Semiconductor Index of PSX.</p>

DiDonato set up his computer, and left the immediate area. A few minutes later, Dooner arrived, moved DiDonato’s computer, and proceeded to situate himself in the place where DiDonato had been located. Dooner evidently took these actions based on the practice in the work culture of PSX that if a spot was unattended, it was considered to be open.</p>
    <p id="b289-6" data-blocks='[["BL_289.7",289,[188,1647,1153,724]]]'>Upon finding Dooner in his spot, DiDonato grabbed Dooner from behind, yanking him backwards and causing him to strike his head and his neck on the floor, which briefly rendered him unconscious. When Dooner regained consciousness, he complained of being disoriented, dizzy, and having a headache and pain in his back and neck. Robert Roth, Dooner’s immediate supervisor, approached the men, and assessed Dooner’s condition. Ultimately, Roth accompanied Dooner to the hospital where he was admitted and underwent a CAT scan and a MRI. Thereafter, Dooner left the hospital against medical advice when he received a telephone call from his distraught wife, Appellant Maureen Dooner, who had just learned that her father had been diagnosed with lung cancer and had six months to live.</p>

At the time of trial, Dooner was taking a muscle relaxant and prescription sleep medication. He also received epidural injections in his neck and a series of physical therapy sessions to relieve his pain. As a result of his injuries, Dooner was unable to return to his employment as a stock trader. He remained unemployed for a period of 10 months before he obtained a position as a roofing estimator for Home Depot at a significant reduction in income.</p>

The Dooners’ Second Amended Complaint (“Complaint”) contained various counts alleging both negligent and intentional torts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The trial court <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>granted Wallace’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed him from the case.

The jury awarded damages in the amount of $1,800,000 sustained by Dooner and $135,000 sustained by his wife. Thereafter, PSX filed a post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and/or for a new trial. Judge Nitza I. Quinones Alejandro denied the motion, rejecting PSX’s contention that all state tort claims against it, as a national securities exchange, were preempted. <em>Dooner v.

October 17, 2007). Contrary to the trial court, the Superior Court panel concluded that the Dooners’ claims were preempted by federal securities law. Specifically, the Superior Court determined that the Securities Exchange Act evinced a congressional intent to regulate thoroughly the area of governance of national exchanges regarding the conduct of floor traders. The Superior Court pointed to PSX having floor officials and a disciplinary committee responsible for preventing, investigating, and sanctioning the conduct of traders who become hostile on the trading floor. According to the intermediate appellate court, Congress’ delegation of authority to national exchanges such as PSX is so complete as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the states to supplement it. In making this determination, however, the Superior Court made clear that its holding was limited to floor traders and not members of the general public. The panel concluded that the Securities Exchange Act preempts “a <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>floor trader’s negligence causes of action against a national exchange where those causes of action implicate the exchange’s statutory authority to govern itself.” <em>Id. </em>at 14.

Simply stated, federal law is paramount. More specifically, Article VI, cl. 2, of the United States Constitution, the Supremacy Clause, provides that the laws of the United States “shall be the supreme Law of the Land; ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const, art.

The Dooners, emphasizing the reluctance of federal courts to find the preemption of state law claims, contend that their claims, which are based upon assertions of negligent supervision and premises liability, are not preempted by the Securities Exchange Act because they have nothing to do with the underlying purpose of that statute' — the regulation of investments and securities. The Dooners cite to United States Supreme Court precedent, reasoning that the Securities Exchange Act preempts only to the extent necessary to protect the aims of the Act. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., v.

Thus, contrary to the Superior Court’s conclusion, the Dooners contend their state law tort claims are not preempted by the Act, as these claims are in no way inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the federal statute. Moreover, the Dooners emphasize the Act does not expressly preempt state law claims and the savings clause broadly preserves state law rights and remedies. Finally, the Dooners offer a recent New York state intermediate court decision which found no preemption of a sexual harassment claim. <em>Lucarelli v.

According to PSX, to accomplish its purpose of regulating securities exchanges and markets, the Securities Exchange Act requires national exchanges such as PSX to self-regulate subject to the oversight, supervision, and control of the SEC. Consistent with this approach, national exchanges promulgate rules which are in turn approved or disapproved by the SEC through the exercise of its quasi-legislative grant of authority from Congress. PSX maintains this is a pervasive scheme of regulation that combines self-regulation by the securities exchanges with direct regulation by the SEC.</p>

The Dooners’ state tort claims, according to PSX, impact the organization and operation of the trading floor, and thus, are preempted by federal law. Furthermore, PSX embraces the rationale offered by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York in <em>Bantum v.

Likening the Dooners’ state law claims to the sexual harassment claim pursued in <em>Bantum, </em>PSX urges our adoption of the approach of the <em>Bantum </em>court finding preemption. Specifically, PSX asserts that permitting state law claims despite the Act’s regulation of the securities marketplace, which combines self-regulation by the securities exchanges with oversight and direct regulation by the SEC, would stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the purposes and objectives of Congress. As PSX is governed by a comprehensive set of rules promulgated by PSX and approved by the SEC, the essence of PSX’s self regulation would be eviscerated, contrary to the specific objectives and purposes of the Securities Exchange Act, if PSX could be held liable for damages because one member/trader assaults another member/trader over a particular post on the trading floor. In other words, PSX asserts it could not self-regulate itself if it was subject to the types of state law claims at issue <em>sub judice. </em>Thus, PSX urges us to find that the Dooners’ state tort claims are implicitly preempted by the Securities Exchange Act and to affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

PSX, conversely, argues that to permit state law tort claims will “eviscerate” its rules and the concept of self-regulation. Specifically, PSX points to Membership Rule 707 “Just and Equitable Principles of Trade,” which provides “[a] member, member organization, or person associated with or employed by a member or member organization shall not engage in conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.” PSX Exhibit 7 (R.R. 526a). Similarly, Membership Rule 708, “Acts Detrimental to the Interest or Welfare of the Exchange,” states “[a] member, member organization, or person associated with or employed by a member or member organization shall not engage in acts detrimental to the interest or welfare of the Exchange.” PSX Exhibit 8 (R.R. 527a). Related thereto, PSX notes that its by-laws provide for disciplinary rules governing the investigation and enforcement of violations of PSX’s rules and regulations. Consistent therewith, PSX Rule 60, “Options Floor Procedure Advices and Order &amp; Decorum Regulations — Sanctions for Breach of Regulations,” provides that a floor official on the trading floor may impose sanctions against a member for <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>breaching the “regulations that relate to administration of order, decorum, health, safety and welfare on the Exchange.” PSX Exhibit A to “Sur-Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Philadelphia Stock Exchange” (R.R. 133a). Furthermore, PSX offered testimony by James Holt, a professional security consultant, that it had various security measures in place, including criminal history checks, security cameras, guards and a uniformed police officer at the entrance of the building. N.T. Trial, 3/1/06, at 163-166 (R.R. 367a-371a). Additional testimony by Edward Deitzel established that a Market Surveillance Department responsible for “all member trading and compliance with trading rules,” and floor officials addressed problems on the floor. N.T. Trial, 2/27/06, at 185 (R.R. 229.1a). Thus, according to PSX, self-regulation, subject to extensive oversight, supervision, and control by the SEC, would be completely negated if the Dooners were permitted to pursue their tort claims regarding the supervision of traders and the security measures employed by PSX.</p>

Obviously, the assault of one trader by another is not the main focus of PSX’s disciplinary rules. Moreover, even though PSX’s rules may address trader safety, and violent trader conduct may result in disciplinary proceedings, state law tort claims based on assault and battery that allege negligent supervision and the negligent provision of a safe work environment would not in any way make such safety practices and disciplinary proceedings an impossibility or prevent PSX from disciplining its traders for misconduct. Indeed, in this matter, pursuant to these rules, floor officials barred DiDonato from the trading floor for the remainder of the day after the assault on Dooner, and, after disciplinary proceedings, DiDonato was suspended for a 10-day period and fined $15,000.</p>

Simply stated, we do not believe that our Commonwealth’s common law should be summarily dismissed by what we believe to be an overly broad assertion of obstruction of purpose.

While PSX argues, and the Superior Court found, that PSX's authority over floor trader conduct is so complete as to leave no room for the states to supplement this discrete aspect of regulation, this approach seemingly reveals a misunderstanding of the concept of field preemption. Field preemption, as the moniker suggests, deals with Congress' inferred intent to preempt an entire field of law — here the field of securities regulation. It traditionally does not consider the preemption of some narrow and limited aspect of that field. PSX's assertion fits more comfortably under the rubric of conflict preemption, discussed below. We note, however, in <em>Shulick v. PaineWebber, </em><a href="/pa/554/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="554 Pa. 524" data-case-ids="765954" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0524-01">554 Pa. 524</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="722 A.2d 148" data-case-ids="11766369,765954" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0148-01,/pa/554/0524-01">722 A.2d 148</a> (1998), our Court seemingly engaged in a circumscribed field preemption analysis in finding a state common law action based on inadequate disclosure of payments received in the course of executing a brokerage transaction was preempted. This approach is contrary to the traditional field preemption jurisprudence which focuses upon occupation of the entire legislative field; <em>see, e.g., Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em><a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">331 U.S. 218</a>, 229-30, <a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="103" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">67 S.Ct. 1146</a>, <a href="/us/331/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="331 U.S. 218" data-case-ids="6157471" data-case-paths="/us/331/0218-01">91 L.Ed. 1447</a> (1947), thus, we limit such an approach to the <em>Shulick </em>decision.</p>

This distinguishes this matter from other decisions in which preemption of state law tort claims have been found, as the state tort claims here are remote to the underlying purposes of the Securities Exchange Act and national securities rules. <em>See, e.g., Shulick, supra, </em>(holding state common law action based on disclosure of overflow payments received in course of executing brokerage transaction preempted).</p>

The court in <em>Lucarelli </em>simply concludes without discussion that because a claim of sexual harassment has ‘‘nothing to do with the purposes of” the Securities Exchange Act or the exchange's regulatory function, such claims are not preempted. <em>Lucarelli, </em><a href="/ad3d/24/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="24 A.D.3d 117" data-case-ids="979079" data-case-paths="/ad3d/24/0117-01">804 N.Y.S.2d at 741-42</a>.
