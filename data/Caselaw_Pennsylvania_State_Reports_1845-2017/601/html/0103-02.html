Williams’ home was located on the same street and within eyesight of Appellant’s residence. Two brothers, Cecil and Edward Jackson, who lived next door to Williams, were also present at her home. At some point during the evening, Appellant left Williams’ residence and returned to his own home. Shortly thereafter, he telephoned Williams and stated that he was going to do something and may not return. Williams then observed Edward Jackson carry an object wrapped in a jacket into Appellant’s home. Moments later, Williams noticed Appellant leaving his residence, dressed entirely in black.</p>

Mr. Johnson’s wife, Sonja, accompanied him on the delivery. When Mr. Johnson arrived at the given address, he parked his vehicle in the middle of the street, where his wife waited in the car. As Mr. Johnson approached the porch of the residence, <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>Appellant emerged from an adjacent alley. Appellant was wearing all black clothing and a black ski mask that had a large opening around the eyes. Appellant approached Mr. Johnson from behind and pushed him onto the porch. While holding a gun to his head, Appellant stated, “You know what this is.” When Mrs. Johnson opened the car door in an effort to help her husband, Appellant threatened to kill Mr. Johnson. Frightened, Mrs. Johnson remained in the car, which was parked seven to ten feet from where Appellant stood. Appellant demanded money and then pushed Mr. Johnson off the porch and into the alley. Mr. Johnson handed over the little cash he had and Appellant taunted him, repeatedly asking him whether he wanted to live. After Johnson pleaded for his life, Appellant fatally shot him in the back of his head and fled down the alley.</p>

Mr. Johnson was immediately taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Mrs. Johnson described the perpetrator to police as an African American male with a light complexion, hazel eyes, five feet eight inches in height, and weighing 150-160 pounds. She indicated that the robber wore a black ski mask, black Timberland boots, and black clothing. The police recovered a 9 mm. casing and a bullet that was consistent with either a .38 caliber or 9 mm. firearm.</p>

In the days that followed, Appellant warned Williams not to report the incident and threatened her by stating, “I took a life and don’t you think that I won’t kill again.” Fearing that Appellant might act on his words, Williams and her mother left the Philadelphia area to stay with Williams’ cousin, Keith Wright, in Salisbury, Maryland. Upon learning of Williams’ departure, Appellant telephoned Wright, whom he had previously known, in an attempt to speak with Williams. Appellant admitted to Wright that he had killed a man, and said that his motive was to obtain money to impress Williams. Appellant acknowledged that a woman <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>(Mrs. Johnson) witnessed the crime, but stated that he was not concerned because he had worn a mask during the incident.</p>

Williams additionally explained that a day or two before the murder, she overheard Edward Jackson mention that he had a gun and, on the night of the murder, saw Jackson carry an object "wrapped in a jacket into Appellant’s residence. Based upon this information, police obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant and search warrants for the residences of both Appellant and Edward Jackson. A search of Appellant’s residence revealed a pair of black boots and a matchbook with the telephone number of Stavros Pizza written on the cover. Menus from Stavros Pizza were also recovered from the Jackson residence.</p>

He explained that he and his girlfriend had an argument, and that he thought that his girlfriend would stay with him if he gave her money. Appellant further stated that he needed money to pay his grandmother’s medical bills. He asserted that, on the night of the murder, Cecil Jackson placed the pizza order and Edward Jackson supplied the gun. Appellant described the clothing that he wore during the commission of the crime, which was consistent with that reported by Mrs. Johnson. Appellant also claimed that he pointed his gun toward Mr. Johnson’s head because Mr. Johnson threatened him with a gun. He stated that the next thing he knew, his gun discharged.

On direct examination, Williams recanted portions of her previous statement relating to Appellant’s confession of the murder and the Commonwealth introduced her prior statement through the detective who interviewed her. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented expert testimony, establishing that Mr. Johnson died from a single gunshot wound, with the gun being fired from six to twelve inches from his head. The defense did not present any witnesses. Instead, the defense attacked the identification evidence linking Appellant to the crime, arguing that someone other than he committed the murder.

In support of these mitigating circumstances, as discussed in detail <em>infra, </em>Appellant first presented the testimony of Williams, his mother, and his grandmother. Williams testified that she had a child with Appellant; that Appellant was a good father; and that he had never been violent. Appellant’s mother testified about Appellant’s difficult childhood in a crime-ridden neighborhood; his car thefts, which led to his being adjudicated a delinquent; his later success when in a structured environment, and his difficulties arising from his mother’s intimate relationship with Cecil Jackson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appellant’s grandmother testified that Appellant’s mother never loved him and that Appellant was a nice person who never mistreated anyone.

Based upon the psychological testing and interviews, as well as Dr. Tepper’s examination of police records and several reports and evaluations examining Appellant’s background, Dr. Tepper testified that: Appellant had a difficult childhood in a rough neighborhood due to the absence of his father and the indifference of his mother; that his mother on occasion physically abused him; that he was in the low range of intelligence; that he excelled in the structured environment of the Glenn Mills School<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> after having been <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>adjudicated delinquent for auto theft; that he maintained a caring relationship with his girlfriend and grandmother; that at the time of the offense, he was hurt by his mother’s intimate relationship and cohabitation with his childhood friend, Cecil Jackson; and that he was concerned about his grandmother’s health and ability to pay her medical bills.</p>

Discounting the age mitigator, the prosecutor argued that, at age nineteen, Appellant was not so young and immature that age should be a mitigating factor. To rebut the lack of a significant criminal history mitigator, the prosecutor emphasized Appellant’s previous juvenile adjudications for auto theft. Further, the prosecutor attempted to rebut the catch-all mitigating factor by noting that Appellant did not suffer any organic brain damage, was of average intelligence, and knew that what he did was wrong.

Appellant’s claim, however, misses the mark. The mere fact that PCRA counsel did not ultimately succeed does not establish that his performance during the collateral proceeding was unreasonable or that he was ineffective. Appellant himself repeatedly referenced the extensive documentation PCRA counsel provided his expert, Dr. Heilbrun. <em>See ex. </em>Reply/Answer Brief of Appellant at 11 (“PCRA counsel produced volumes of records that had not been provided to Dr. Tepper.”). In fact, Dr. Heilbrun’s report indicated that PCRA counsel provided him with 29 documents. Appellant’s argument that such efforts were ineffective is not persuasive. Moreover, Appellant has not demonstrated that PCRA counsel lacked a reasonable basis for submitting to the PCRA court the above detailed extensive mitigating evidence, instead of the different, but not more extensive mitigation evidence offered in Appellant’s brief to this Court. We find that Appellant’s claim of PCRA counsel ineffectiveness utterly fails when considered in light of the extensive and laudatory efforts by that counsel.

(Appellant nevertheless appends a copy of this non-record, <em>pro se </em>motion to his brief on appeal.) The <em>pro se </em>request complained that appellant was innocent, that PCRA counsel had not visited him in prison, investigated his case, or spoken to him about his claims, and that he wanted to raise a new claim of racial discrimination in jury selection.

The PCRA court also mentioned the <em>pro se </em>motion, and then indicated that there was no reason to appoint new counsel where appellant already had “extremely competent counsel.” However, the court' offered appointed counsel the opportunity to raise the racial discrimination claim, counsel did so, and the court rejected it on the merits. N.T., 7/11/2005, at 5-7. The court did not appoint the Federal Defender at that hearing, or relieve initial counsel.

Of course, this jurisdictional statement did nothing to preserve any of these claims for appeal. Claims must be raised in the trial court; and, when an appeal is filed, preserved claims may be winnowed and renewed in a Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal, if the trial judge requests such a Statement. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 1925.

In my view, this Court lacks jurisdiction to grant such an indulgence, and even if we had jurisdiction, I would not approve a litigation strategy that operates to build-in delay in capital cases and to work an end-around the PCRA.</p>

Again, the PCRA does not provide such an exception. Moreover, the “avenue” deriving from the <em>Albrecht </em>dictum is arbitrary. Not all capital PCRA petitioners, and very few non-capital petitioners, want new counsel, secure new counsel or have new counsel volunteer so as to permit PCRA appeal “vindication” of their right to PCRA counsel.

The rule does nothing to vindicate the right to effective PCRA counsel for the overwhelming majority of defendants, in capital and non-capital cases alike, who do not have new counsel on PCRA appeal. If those defendants believe their PCRA counsel were ineffective, they are faced with the time and serial petition restrictions of the PCRA, as well as the <em>Lawson </em>standard.</p>

After all, how can the right to PCRA counsel be deemed vindicated if PCRA appeal counsel himself was incompetent, unless there is an easy avenue to attack PCRA appeal counsel?

Capital PCRA proceedings generally are presided over by careful, trained, experienced trial judges. Oftentimes it is the same judge who presided over the petitioner’s trial, with an intimate knowledge of the facts of the petitioner’s case, as well as the best view of the performance of the petitioner’s various lawyers. The Rules of Criminal Procedure now also require that PCRA counsel meet exacting-educational and experiential requirements. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 801 (Qualifications for Defense Counsel in Capital Cases); Pa.R.Crim.P. 904, cmt. An involved PCRA judge is well-positioned to assess whether PCRA counsel is performing competently; just as Judge Greenspan was called upon to do in this case. The PCRA judge can direct counsel to amend or further develop claims, can conduct colloquies with the defendant, and can easily assess whether counsel is adequately discharging his duty. Denials of relief in capital PCRA cases are then appealable as of right to this Court, which is also in a position, although from a different perspective, to assess the sort of effort counsel has made, and to take corrective action where it appears counsel has not competently discharged his duties. This role for the courts is not unusual: in the context <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>of counsel withdrawal, the courts are routinely called upon to assess counsel’s discharge of his duties to criminal defendants.

Respectfully, I have great difficulty with the majority’s perspective that a finding of brain damage and Axis I clinical disorders is “different, but not more extensive mitigation,” measured against an opinion that there is no brain damage or serious mental health issues. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 154, 971 A.2d at 1155.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

Nevertheless, as long as jurisdiction is secure I support the majority’s holding that we are empowered to <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>address challenges to the fundamental fairness in such proceedings, either via our own immediate review (if no material factual controversies exist) or a remand (if such controversies are present).

    <p id="b258-4" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[287,713,1155,842]]]'>Finally, in light of the substantially abbreviated hearing and in the absence of specific factual findings, the post-conviction proceedings seem to me to represent a well-meaning effort on the part of PCRA counsel and the PCRA court, in colloquial terms, to cut through the red tape. However, a study of this Court’s decisional law over the past ten years demonstrates that, at least in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, such truncated procedures will not generate a sustainable award of state post-conviction relief in contested cases. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gibson, </em><a href="/pa/597/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="331" data-cite="597 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="3924204" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0402-01">597 Pa. 402</a>, 421-22, <a href="/pa/597/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="332" data-cite="951 A.2d 1110" data-case-ids="3924204,8221590" data-case-paths="/pa/597/0402-01,/a2d/951/1110-01">951 A.2d 1110</a>, 1121-22 (2008) (discussing the present state of post-conviction jurisprudence in Pennsylvania and explaining, “particularly in close cases, a developed post-conviction record accompanied by specific factual findings and legal conclusions is an essential tool necessary to sharpen the issues so that differences at the appellate level can be mitigated”).</p>
    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.6",258,[288,1580,1154,466]]]'>In light of the above, I would vacate the present award of penalty relief and remand to the PCRA court for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion, including consideration of whether leave should be granted to amend the pleadings to state claims of deficient stewardship on the part of post-conviction counsel. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(A) (“The judge may grant leave to amend or withdraw a petition for post-conviction collateral relief at any time.

In terms of the effectiveness of PCRA counsel, Dr. Tepper was an obvious source of potentially helpful evidence at the post-conviction stage. Thus, if the above-described declaration is accurate, it bears on PCRA counsel’s stewardship, since they did not seek to introduce such helpful information into the record. For this and other reasons arising from a review of the transcript of the very brief PCRA hearing, and in the absence of a hearing on the effectiveness of PCRA counsel, I do not support the majority’s couching of their performance as laudatory at this juncture. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 154, 971 A.2d at 1155.</p>

Some reluctance to consider organic impairment to be substantially mitigating may arise from skepticism as to the truth of the allegation, as we are seeing such claims surface pervasively for the first time on post-conviction review. Since, however, the condition is well recognized in the medical and scientific communities and may in fact be considered by reasonable jurors to be substantially mitigating, I do not believe the appropriate response is to dilute the potential impact of this category of evidence by equating it with the sort of emotional factors described by Dr. Tepper at the penalty hearing. Rather, the evidence should be reviewed by a factfinder to assess its believability and force before it properly can be credited or discounted in terms of its material significance in capital sentencing.</p>
