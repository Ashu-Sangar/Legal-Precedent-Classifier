The majority, however, focused its attention on another public disclosure law, the Sunshine Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> which provides for broad public access to agency meetings. The majority took particular note that, under the Sunshine Act, an agency may conduct some of its business in closed executive sessions, where it may “consult with its attorney or other professional advisor regarding information or strategy in connection with litigation or issues on which identifiable complaints are expected to be filed.” <em>Schenck, </em><a href="/a2d/893/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="893 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="8985782" data-case-paths="/a2d/893/0849-01">893 A.2d at 853-54</a> (quoting 65 Pa.C.S. § 708(a)(4)).

In this regard, the dissenting opinion developed that the Sunshine Act “applies to official action and deliberations by a quorum of agency members and requires that the same take place at a public meeting,” whereas the Right to Know Act applies only to “public records,” which the statute defines to mean certain documents like “any account, voucher or contract dealing with the receipt or disbursement of funds ... and any minute, order or decision by an agency[.]” <em>Schenck, </em><a href="/a2d/893/0849-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="893 A.2d 849" data-case-ids="8985782" data-case-paths="/a2d/893/0849-01">893 A.2d at 856</a> (Friedman, J., dissenting) (quoting 65 P.S. § 66.1) (emphasis deleted).

With reference to the approach taken by various federal courts, the dissent favored the application of an <em>in camera </em>review procedure to test a government agency’s assertion of privilege. <em>See id. </em>at 858, <a href="/a2d/769/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="769 A.2d 449" data-case-ids="11110867,1276771" data-case-paths="/a2d/769/0449-01,/pa/564/0482-01">769 A.2d 449</a> (developing that “federal courts have repeatedly reviewed documents <em>in camera </em>when deciding claims that documents are protected from discovery under the attorney-client and/or work product privilege”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> Finally, Judge Friedman observed that, in the context of a probate <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>proceeding, <em>In re Estate of Wood, </em><a href="/a2d/818/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="818 A.2d 568" data-case-ids="9353465" data-case-paths="/a2d/818/0568-01">818 A.2d 568</a> (Pa.Super.2003), the Superior Court had instructed a trial court to review material <em>in camera </em>to determine if the work product privilege applied.

Further, she argues that the interpretation of the Commonwealth Court majority contravenes the purpose of the Right to Know Act and leads to an unreasonable result, namely, that all information from a solicitor, whether or not it flows from executive session or otherwise relates to litigation, is inaccessible simply because the subject of litigation is a permitted executive-session topic. Appellant also observes that the motivating force behind the preparation of attorney invoices is to secure payment, and therefore, attorney billing records are not likely to contain disclosures of confidential information or mental impressions, conclusions, or opinions in the nature of work product. <em>See Slusaw v. Hoffman, </em><a href="/a2d/861/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="861 A.2d 269" data-case-ids="9187131" data-case-paths="/a2d/861/0269-01">861 A.2d 269</a>, 273 (Pa.Super.2004) (holding that attorney invoices were not privileged documents to the extent that they did not disclose confidential communications between client and lawyers). Further, she develops that the description-of-services entries are integral to the expenditure of public funds, thus supporting her presumptive right of access as a citizen. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 18 (expressing difficulty believing that the solicitor “cannot submit a bill without divulging privileged information in the tiny space allotted for services rendered on his invoices[;] [s]urely, the solicitor was aware of the public’s (the people who pay the bills) right to see generally what the solicitor did to earn his money”). The Pennsylvania Newspaper Association, as <em>amicus, </em>disfavors wholesale redaction of entries as inconsistent with the public’s right to disclosure concerning expenditures and advocates shifting the burden to the government to substantiate claims of privilege. Additionally, it emphasizes that <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>the Sunshine Act’s litigation-related exception is not absolute, as officials must nevertheless disclose general information regarding the reason for the executive session to demonstrate to the public that the closed session is legitimate. <em>See Reading Eagle Co. v.

Further, it offers its support for the Commonwealth Court’s <em>in pari materia </em>construction of the Act, as do its <em>amici, </em>the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors and the Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities Association. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Appellee at 9 (“The analogy between legal advice given at an executive session within the scope of the Sunshine Act and legal advice described in a lawyer’s invoice is a solid one.”). The Township also contends that the burden to demonstrate that information is within the scope of the Right to Know Act consistently rests with the requester and should not shift to a government body upon its assertion of privilege. In this regard, it urges that it should be accorded a presumption of good faith. <em>See Albert v.

In any event, the municipality argues that courts simply are not authorized to undertake <em>in camera </em>review in the right-to-know setting as distinguished from the discovery context in adversarial litigation. The Association of Township Supervisors also stresses the important public purpose of shielding communications between an attorney and a public client under the Sunshine Act, with reference to the Commonwealth Court’s explanation <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>that, “if ... litigation strategy, ... the amount of settlement offers or ... potential claims became public, it would damage the municipality’s ability to settle or defend those matters and all the citizens would bear the cost of that disclosure.” <em>Reading Eagle, </em>156 Pa.Cmwlth. at 415, <a href="/pa-commw/156/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="627 A.2d 305" data-case-ids="1447109" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/156/0412-01">627 A.2d at 307</a>.</p>
