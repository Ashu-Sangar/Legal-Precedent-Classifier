In addition to the <em>Phillips </em>concurrence, Appellant discusses the thoughts of other judges, scholars, and commentators who, over the past thirty years, have addressed the conceptual difficulties which have surfaced as a result of the way Section 402A has been interpreted and applied. Such discourse, Appellant notes, motivated the recommendations advanced in the Third Restatement. Appellant contends that the changes advocated in the Third Restatement do not mark a radical departure from Section 402A, but rather, “fine tune” existing strict liability law to achieve greater fairness in these distinct types of claims. According to Appellant, whereas the Second Restatement is silent regarding when a product is defective, the Third Restatement provides appropriate guidance. Appellant suggests that the Third Restatement reflects the trend in product liability litigation nationwide, would clarify and streamline the law in Pennsylvania, and would result in a more just and cost-effective resolution of product liability lawsuits.</p>

According to Appellee, a return to a fault-based system would undermine such purposes by increasing the plaintiffs’ burden of proof, perhaps to an insurmountable level.

As the treatment of these broader categories evolved, most courts came to realize that application of strict liability in design and warning cases was far more problematic than in the manufacturing-defect paradigm. Particularly in light of the tort system’s largely open-ended damages scheme, and the impossibility of designing products incapable of contributing to human injury, doctrinal limiting principles were necessary to contain the liability of product manufacturers and suppliers. <em>See, e.g., Prentis v.

The Restatement would serve as a far more rational platform from which to make modest future adjustments, if necessary, than <em>Azzarello. </em>As stated very recently by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in conjunction with a prediction that this Court would adopt Sections 1 and 2 of the Third Restatement: “The Third Restatement ... eliminates much of the confusion that has resulted from attempting to quarantine negligence concepts and insulate them from strict liability claims.” <em>Berrier v.

However, to state this relationship as being inescapable is to ignore the scenario in which a designer might be excusably unaware of the circumstances that make a product dangerous, but nonetheless allowed the dangers to exist in the product. Furthermore, the passage of time attendant to many products liability cases means that evidence cannot be obtained through normal discovery procedures, and therefore evidentiary standards preclude even an inexcusably unaware designer from being found liable for defects. The rule embodied in 402A therefore imposes a standard that allows a product to be considered defective in a situation where a product would have been altered or-withdrawn from the market if only the designer had know of its dangerous propensities.</blockquote>
