For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that the burden was not on the Department to prove the validity of its administrative directive, but rather on Brittain, as the inmate, to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the alleged invalidity of the pornography ban. As Brittain did not satisfy his burden in this regard, summary relief should have been granted in favor of the Department. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the Commonwealth Court’s order that denied the Department summary relief.</p>

He maintained that DC-ADM 803-1 improperly prohibited inmates from possessing materials depicting mere nudity, including artwork, drawings, photographs, and <em>Playboy Magazine, </em>without any legitimate penological purpose. Brittain sought an order enjoining the Department from confiscating and destroying materials in his <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>possession pursuant to the policy. Brittain attached what he characterizes as affidavits, signed by him and six other inmates, which assert that mere nudity does not adversely affect their personal rehabilitation or treatment, does not cause them to sexually harass others, and does not cause them to create a hostile work environment for prison employees.</p>

The Department attached to its new matter the “verifications” of a licensed psychologist and a unit manager of a state prison, which state that those individuals have reviewed the factual averments set forth in the Department’s answer and new matter, and concluded, under the penalty of perjury, that they are true and correct.</p>

The Department emphasized that it was not required, in response to Brittain’s lawsuit, to present “peer-review scientific-evidence” to demonstrate that its policy is reasonable.

He reiterated that it was the Department’s burden, in response to his lawsuit, to prove, <em>via </em>testimony, that its administrative directive is reasonable. Brittain’s prayer for relief, therefore, sought an order denying the Department’s motion for summary relief, and directing the Department to provide discovery materials relating to why it adopted the anti-pornography policy. Brittain additionally sought a preliminary injunction, precluding the Department from utilizing DC-ADM 803-1 pending the outcome of his case.</p>

It found that the deposition of the deputy superintendent established a rational connection between the policy of banning newspapers, magazines, and photos and the legitimate penological objective of increasing incentives for better prison behavior among the most recalcitrant prisoners. Thus, the Court concluded that <em>Turner’s </em>first factor supports the policy’s reasonableness. It found that the second, third, and fourth <em>Turner </em>factors were logically related to the policy itself, and added little to the first factor’s basic logical rationale. <em><a href="/us/548/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="548 U.S. 521" data-case-ids="3500498" data-case-paths="/us/548/0521-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/548/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="548 U.S. 521" data-case-ids="3500498" data-case-paths="/us/548/0521-01">at 532</a>, <a href="/us/548/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="548 U.S. 521" data-case-ids="3500498" data-case-paths="/us/548/0521-01">126 S.Ct. 2572</a>.

In <em>Ramirez, </em>an inmate challenged a prison regulation implementing a statutory ban on the use of federal funds to distribute sexually explicit material to prisoners. The district court granted the government’s pretrial motion to dismiss, holding that the regulation was valid because, intuitively, it was rationally connected to the government’s asserted interest in prisoner rehabilitation. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding the record inadequate as a matter of law to demonstrate the validity of the restriction. The <em>Ramirez </em>court concluded that the connection between the restriction at issue and the government’s rehabilitative interest was not so obvious as to eliminate the need for the development of a factual record. <em>Id. </em>at 129.
