Essentially, Baker claims, the exclusion acts as a “disguised waiver” of stacking that does not comply with the explicit waiver requirements of Section 1738(d). Baker contends that Erie is improperly abrogating a statutory requirement by inserting an exclusion into its policy. Moreover, since Baker affirmatively chose not to waive inter-policy stacking and therefore paid a higher premium for that choice, Baker claims that Erie’s application of the exclusion in this case has the effect of denying him coverage he paid for in accordance with the MVFRL. Baker further argues that the exclusion is “buried” in the Erie policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

There is no dispute that the exclusion’s unambiguous language precludes coverage in this case, where the insured was injured while riding his non-Erie-insured motorcycle. If its exclusion is invalidated, Erie will be paying on a risk it did not knowingly insure, or collect a premium to underwrite: in this case, the substantially higher risk associated with motorcycles. Furthermore, Erie argues, Section 1738’s stacking provisions do not apply here. Those provisions refer to stacking UIM benefits in policies that provide UIM coverage. There is no UIM coverage under the circumstances of this case because the household exclusion applies to preclude it in the first instance. Ultimately, this case is not about stacking. It is about an applicable, unambiguous exclusion designed to preclude unpaid coverage of unknown risks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Ultimately, however, Baker’s argument fails. After careful review, we conclude that application of the household exclusion in this case does not involve “stacking” at all. We hold instead that the Erie policy exclusion is a valid and unambiguous preclusion of coverage of unknown risks, and it was properly applied to the circumstances of this case.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[312,983,1151,934]]]'>We begin our analysis by noting that “the interpretation of a contract of insurance is a matter of law for the courts to decide. In interpreting an insurance contract, we must ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written agreement. When the policy language is clear and unambiguous, we will give effect to the language of the contract.” <em>Paylor, </em><a href="/pa/536/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="640 A.2d 1234" data-case-ids="1843209,7871724" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0583-01,/a2d/640/1234-01">640 A.2d at 1235</a>. We further note that an insured’s failure to read carefully the clear and unambiguous terms of his insurance policy has never furnished grounds to invalidate those terms or otherwise nullify them. <em>See, e.g., Standard Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/503/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="503 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1785950" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0300-01">503 Pa. 300</a>, <a href="/pa/503/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="503 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1785950" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0300-01">469 A.2d 563</a>, 566 (1983) (holding failure to read an insurance contract is an unavailing excuse and cannot justify avoidance of its terms).

Baker’s claim that the exclusion was somehow “buried” in his insurance policy is not persuasive.</p>

      <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>Next, we consider the relevant statutes. Section 1738(a) of the MVFRL mandates stacking of uninsured and underinsured benefits limits when multiple vehicles are insured under policies on which the insured is covered for a given accident. Section 1738(b) allows an insured to waive the stacking in return for a lower insurance premium. The rest of Section 1738 describes the waiver procedure. Baker did not waive stacking of UM and UIM coverages on his Erie policy. Thus, if he had been in an accident driving one of the Erie-insured vehicles and the tortfeasor had insufficient coverage, Baker would have been permitted to stack the UIM limits on all three vehicles ($100,000 each) and have access to benefits of $300,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The third-party tortfeasor’s insurance was insufficient to cover his damages. Baker therefore sought UIM benefits from the Universal policy on his motorcycle, and received the policy limits of $15,000, which still did not adequately compensate him.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Next in priority was the other <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>policy on which Baker was an insured, the Erie policy covering his three other vehicles. <em>See 75 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1733(a). But the Erie policy has an exclusion precluding UIM coverage in this very situation, that is, where Baker was injured while driving a vehicle he owned, but did not insure with Erie-his motorcycle. As a result, Baker was not entitled to stack the coverages of his three Erie-insured vehicles because <em>there was no UIM coverage to stack.</em>

In this <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>case, Baker insured his motorcycle with $15,000 of UIM coverage, which was inadequate to compensate him for his injuries.

Because the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law mandate that an individual may not purchase underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the amount of her bodily injury liability limits [75 Pa.C.S. § 1734], the underinsured motorist coverage on a motorcycle policy is often inadequate.

Assuming ABATE's description of the situation is accurate, it clearly reflects the higher risks and dangers of motorcycles. The practical problem of insuring motorcycles may be compared to the problems of insuring drivers with bad driving records, or pedestrians who do not own and insure a vehicle, or who do not otherwise have access to motor vehicle insurance. Our legislature has demonstrated in the past that it can structure alternative insurance programs to provide coverage in special risk situations. See, e.g., 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1741-1744 (Assigned Risk Plan); 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1751-1757 (Assigned Claims Plan). The argument regarding inadequate insurance options for motorcyclists is better addressed to the legislature and does not, by itself, support the invalidation of an unambiguous policy provision which does not violate current law.</p>

Instead, as we have stated, Baker does have the right to stack the UIM coverage applicable to his Erie-insured vehicles, which is what he requested by refusing to sign a stacking waiver and choosing to pay higher premiums for his Erie policy.

The concurrence determines that, to the extent that the General Assembly actually considered the matter, the Legislature likely regarded exclusions and stacking as separate issues. It therefore concludes that the exclusions frame the scope of UIM coverage, and thus do not effect the application of the stacking provisions because stacking does not apply when an accident does not come within the scope of the UIM coverage of the policy in question. The proverbial bottom line deriving from this analysis is the employment of the household exclusion to deny an insured the benefits of stacking, for which he paid, without complying with the statutorily mandated waiver provisions, in violation of the clear language of the legislature. Rather than requiring an overt act of waiver by the named insured pursuant to the specific form as specified in § 1738(d), the household exclusion does not even require the insurer to demonstrate that the insured was aware of the exclusion.</p>
