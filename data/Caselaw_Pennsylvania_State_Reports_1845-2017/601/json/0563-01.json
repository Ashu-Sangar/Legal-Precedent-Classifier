See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726. Our Prothonotary is directed to set a briefing schedule and list this matter for oral argument. The issues to be briefed are:\nA. Whether 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-103 dictates that Petitioner lacks standing to seek disqualification of Bailey Perrin Bailey, LLP on the basis of alleged violations of constitutional law.\nB. Whether the Attorneys Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-101 et seq., authorizes the Office of General Counsel\u2019s contingent fee arrangement with Bailey Perrin Bailey, LLP.\nC. Whether Bailey Perrin Bailey, LLP, should be disqualified because the General Assembly did not authorize the contingent fee arrangement between the Office of General Counsel and the law firm, such that the agreement violates Article III, \u00a7 24 and the separation of powers mandate of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nD. Whether Bailey Perrin Bailey, LLP should be disqualified because the due process guarantees of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions prohibit the Commonwealth from delegating the exercise of its sovereign powers to private counsel with a direct contingent financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.\nJustice BAER and Justice GREENSPAN dissent.",
