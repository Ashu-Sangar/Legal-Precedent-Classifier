        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nA jury awarded appellant Lawrence J. Willinger, Jr., $455,199.75 in a wrongful death and survival action against appellee Mercy Catholic Medical Center. Appellant had brought the action to recover for the death of his son, Leonard. The Superior Court, in a unanimous opinion, affirmed the lower court\u2019s order as to appellee\u2019s liability, but remanded for a new trial on the issue of damages. The Superior Court held the trial court\u2019s charge erroneous. Lawrence Willinger and Mercy Catholic Medical Center each appealed from the Superior Court decision..\nThe facts giving rise to this controversy are not disputed. On June 2, 1969, appellant\u2019s five year old son, Leonard, entered Mercy Catholic Medical Center for a tonsillectomy. The medical records indicate that on the day of the operation he was in excellent health. In preparation for the surgery, Leonard was placed under anesthesia. A nurse anesthetist negligently administered the anesthesia. As a result, Leonard\u2019s heart stopped beating for a period of between four and twenty minutes. When the doctor who was to perform the operation arrived in the operating room, he quickly revived Leonard\u2019s heartbeat. The prolonged cardiac arrest, however, caused Leonard to suffer serious brain damage, which, on July 23, 1969, caused his death.\nAppellant Willinger urges this Court to reinstate the trial court\u2019s award of damages. The trial court\u2019s charge to the jury with regard to damages under the Survival Act, was:\n\u201cHere are three items to consider [under the survival action]. First, pain and suffering .\nThe second item is compensation for loss of future earnings for the working life expectancy of the deceased, less the probable cost of his maintenance reduced to present worth.\nThe third item, any loss that may have been sustained as a result of the loss of amenities or pleasures of life.\n* * * * * *\nLeonard had a legal interest in a continuation of his life . the plaintiff, that is, Mr. Willinger, as the administrator of the estate, for the loss of those years of life which you determine the decedent might otherwise have spent on this earth. We are not talking about loss of life as such because loss of life is not compensable. What we are talking about is the loss of life\u2019s pleasures.\nI am not going to go into any great explanation on it. An individual has a right to enjoy life, to marry, if you will, to work, to enjoy hunting, enjoy fishing, enjoy watching ball games, even box lacrosse, if you want, all these sorts of things. And if that was cut off because of the negligent act of either or both of these defendants, which was the proximate cause thereof, you can make an award to Leonard Willinger\u2019s estate for that loss.\u201d\nAppellant would have us hold that it is not error for a trial court to instruct the jury that, under the Survival Act, it may separately consider an award compensating for the decedent\u2019s \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d.\nThe rule is well established in Pennsylvania, however, that compensation for the loss of life\u2019s amenities is recoverable only if the victim survives the accident giving rise to the cause of action. Any other rule would be contrary to the compensatory objective of awarding damages to tort victims. We, therefore, affirm the Superior Court\u2019s determination that the trial court committed reversible error when it instructed the jury that it could separately consider and award damages for loss of life\u2019s pleasures.\nIn Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 299, 282 A.2d 206 (1971), we held that a decedent\u2019s estate could recover damages for pain and suffering and loss of gross earning power from the date of injury until death. Damages from the time of death through decedent\u2019s estimated working lifespan were limited to loss of earning power less personal maintenance expenses. In reaching this holding we stated:\n\u201cQuite properly, the injured plaintiff should receive as damages his total estimated future earnings undiminished. But if such a plaintiff dies, his action, whether commenced or continued by his personal representative, is for the benefit of the estate. We cannot be blind to the reality that neither the deceased person nor his estate is burdened with the personal maintenance costs of the decedent . If we were seeking to compensate for the loss of life itself, it may be true that the best approximation of the value of that life could be cast in terms of an individual\u2019s personal maintenance costs. It has never been the law in Pennsylvania, however, nor do we here choose to hold that the loss of life itself is compensable.\u201d\nId., 444 Pa. at 308, 282 A.2d at 229. We discern little or no distinction between seeking to calculate the value of \u201clife itself\u201d and the value of experiencing life\u2019s pleasures. Were we to permit compensation for loss of \u201clife itself\u201d, undoubtedly this intangible item would have to be measured in terms of the loss of those very opportunities to enjoy family, work, and recreation the trial court directed the jury to consider in measuring the loss of life\u2019s pleasures. Thus, to permit a jury to award damages to the estate for the decedent\u2019s loss of life\u2019s pleasures in effect authorizes a type of recovery expressly repudiated in Incollingo.\nEven where the victim survives a compensable injury, this Court has never held that loss of life\u2019s pleasures could be compensated other than as a component of pain and suffering. Indeed, the two types of loss are interrelated. As this Court stated in Corcoran v. McNeal, 400 Pa. 14, 23, 161 A.2d 367, 372-73 (1960):\n\u201cThe loss of well-being is as much a loss as an amputation. The inability to enjoy what one has heretofore keenly appreciated is a pain which can be equated with the infliction of a positive hurt. The conscious loss of a benefit to which one is entitled hurts as much as a festering wound.\u201d\nThus, to a large extent it has been the plaintiff\u2019s consciousness of his or her inability to enjoy life that we have compensated under the rubric of \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d. Unlike one who is permanently injured, one who dies as a result of injuries is not condemned to watch life\u2019s amenities pass by. Unless we are to equate loss of life\u2019s pleasures with loss of life itself, we must view it as something that is compensable only for a living plaintiff who has suffered from that loss. It follows that, under Incollingo, damages for the pain and suffering that may flow from the loss of life\u2019s pleasures should only be recovered for the period of time between the accident and the decedent\u2019s death.\nJudge Hoffman, writing for the Superior Court, persuasively rejected the conclusion appellant urges us to reach.\n\u201cThus, case law upholds the distinction between loss of life, in which loss of life\u2019s amenities is not compensable, and impairment of a living person\u2019s faculties, in which instance such loss is recoverable. Therefore, the lower court\u2019s statement of the law was erroneous. We resist the lower court\u2019s attempt to expand the right of recovery in wrongful death and survival actions to include loss of life\u2019s amenities. The problem of translating the loss resulting from an accident into money damages is always a complex and often imprecise calculation. However, our courts and legislature have established some guidelines to assist the jury in compensating loss \u2014 loss of life\u2019s pleasures or amenities is simply not one of the elements of recovery in wrongful death and survival actions.\u201d\nWillinger v. Mercy Catholic Medical Center, etc., 241 Pa.Super. 456, 469, 362 A.2d 280, 286-87 (1976) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\n. Willinger v. Mercy Catholic Medical Ctr., 241 Pa.Super. 456, 362 A.2d 280 (1976).\n. We take jurisdiction pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a). This case was reassigned to the writer on September 29, 1978, for the purpose of preparing an opinion expressing the views of a majority of this Court.\nMercy Catholic Medical Center appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of the hospital\u2019s request to amend its complaint against additional defendant Go. The hospital made its request after plaintiff\u2019s case had been presented at trial and more than three years after the statute of limitations had run. The hospital\u2019s original complaint against Dr. Go alleged individual negligence in the administration of anesthesia to Leonard Willinger. The attempted amendment would have alleged that Dr.. Go was vicariously liable for the negligence of a nurse anesthetist. Such an amendment would have raised a new cause of action against Dr. Go. See Saracina v. Cotoia, 417 Pa. 80, 208 A.2d 764 (1965) (new cause of action raised when judgment on one would not bar any further action on the other, a different measure of damages is applicable, different defendants are available, and different proof is required). Since the statute of limitations expired more than three years earlier, the trial court properly denied the amendment. See Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., 457 Pa. 321, 325, 319 A.2d 914, 918 (1974) (leave to amend liberally \u201csubject to the qualification that any amendment may not introduce a new cause of action after the statute of limitations has run its course\u201d).\n. Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, \u00a7 2, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3373 (1975).\n. Appellant further contends that appellee waived its right to a new trial on damages by objecting to appellant\u2019s motion that special interrogatories be submitted to the jury. Appellant argues that had the jury been required to specifically state the amount they awarded for loss of life\u2019s pleasures, a new trial would not be necessary. This contention must be rejected. Appellant\u2019s argument presumes that had appellees not objected to the submission of special interrogatories, appellant\u2019s request would have been granted. The record indicates, however, that the trial court independently concluded that special interrogatories should not be submitted to the jury. Generally, a trial judge may grant or refuse a request for specific findings on the basis of whether such would add to a logical and reasonable understanding of the issue. \u201cTo permit the jury to return special findings, where they are unnecessary, can create misleading issues and defeat justice.\u201d Greet v. Arned Corporation, 412 Pa. 292, 297, 194 A.2d 343, 345 (1963). Here we are unable to declare that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that special interrogatories were inappropriate.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThis case was originally assigned to me. I submitted the following opinion as a majority opinion, for which there were insufficient votes. This is now submitted as a dissent.\nOn June 2, 1969, decedent, a patient at defendant Mercy Catholic Medical Center (herein referred to as \u201cdefendant hospital\u201d), suffered a cardiac respiratory arrest during preoperative preparation for a tonsillectomy. Decedent suffered brain damage from said arrest and this brain damage eventually caused his death on July 23, 1969.\nPlaintiff, decedent\u2019s father, filed suit against defendant hospital in the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that defendant hospital was negligent in its treatment of decedent. Defendant hospital joined Dr. Martin T. Brennan (decedent\u2019s surgeon) and Dr. Josephine L. Go (decedent\u2019s anesthesiologist) as additional defendants. A jury trial commenced and at the completion of all testimony, the trial court granted additional defendant Brennan\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The case against defendant hospital and additional defendant Go was submitted to the jury which rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff against defendant hospital in the amount of $450,000 under the Survival Act. Additional defendant Go was absolved of all liability\nDefendant hospital\u2019s post-trial motions were denied by the trial court and defendant hospital appealed to the Superior Court, alleging 1) that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could award damages to the plaintiff under the Survival Act for decedent\u2019s \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d and 2) that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant hospital to amend its complaint against additional defendant Go. The Superior Court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant hospital to amend its complaint against additional defendant Go, but that the trial court did err in instructing the jury that it could award damages to the plaintiff under the Survival Act for decedent\u2019s \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d. Accordingly, the Superior Court granted a new trial, limited only to damages. Willinger v. Mercy Catholic Medical Center, 241 Pa.Super. 456, 362 A.2d 280 (1976). Both plaintiff and defendant hospital filed petitions for allowance of appeal to this Court; said petitions were granted.\nIn this appeal, plaintiff contends that the Superior Court erred in holding that the trial court acted erroneously in instructing the jury that it could award damages to the plaintiff under the Survival Act for decedent\u2019s \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d. The trial court\u2019s charge read, in pertinent part:\n\u201cHere are three items to consider [under the survival action]. First, pain and suffering .\nThe second item is compensation for loss of future earnings for the working life expectancy of the deceased, less the probable cost of his maintenance reduced to present worth.\nThe third item, any loss that may have been sustained as a result of the loss of amenities or pleasures of life. Leonard [decedent] had a legal interest in a continuation of his life ... [If you find either defendant liable,] you can compensate the plaintiff, that is, Mr. Willinger, as the administrator of the estate, for the loss of those years of life which you determine the decedent might otherwise have spent on this earth. We are not talking about loss of life as such because loss of life is not compensable. What we are talking about is the loss of life\u2019s pleasures.\nI am not going to go into any great explanation on it. An individual has a right to enjoy life, to marry, if you will, to work, to enjoy hunting, enjoy fishing, enjoy watching ball games, even box lacrosse, if you want, all these sorts of things. And if that was cut off because of the negligent act of either or both of these defendants, which was the proximate cause thereof, you can make an award to Leonard Willinger\u2019s estate for that loss.\u201d (emphasis added).\nThe Survival Act provides that \u201cany right or liability which survives a decedent may be brought by . his personal representative ... as though the decedent were alive\u201d. Act of April 18, 1949, P.L. 512, art. VI, \u00a7 603, as re-enacted, 20 P.S. \u00a7 3373. Although the Act does not define the types of damages which are available to the decedent\u2019s representative in a survival action, this Court has held that the Survival Act is \u201cintended to compensate the decedent\u2019s estate . . . (for the) decedent's total disability.\u201d Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 263, 306, 282 A.2d 206, 228 (1971) (emphasis added).\nWe held in Corcoran v. McNeal, 400 Pa. 14, 161 A.2d 367 (1960) that a plaintiff\u2019s loss of his ability to \u201cenjoy\u201d life can be considered by the jury in calculating plaintiff\u2019s damages for pain and suffering. This method of calculating i. e. lumping \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d with pain and suffering has created confusion. It is an attempt to mix together two separate items \u2014 how do you mix oranges and cats? The effect has been to blur each item\u2019s uniqueness and significance. It has also resulted in a jury not being able to consider \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d where an injured plaintiff is in a comatose state and hence has no pain or suffering. And finally, individuals who are victims of a tortious act which results in immediate death have not been able to be compensated for \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d because they, too, have had no pain or suffering.\nTherefore, I would hold that \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d is a separate item of damage to be considered by the fact finder in arriving at a just and proper award to compensate all tort victims for their tort caused death or injury. \u201cLife\u2019s pleasures\u201d include a consideration of, but are not limited to, the loss of the pleasure of obtaining a spouse, of raising children, of pursuing a vocation, of learning, of participating in social and sports activities and all those factors (physical, spiritual, mental and emotional) which the culture realistically provides for the particular injured or deceased victim. The trial court, the late Judge Donald Orlowsky presiding, properly charged the jury.\nDefendant hospital, in its appeal to this Court, asserts that the trial court erred in ruling that the defendant hospital could not amend its complaint against additional defendant Go. Three days after the trial commenced and more than three years after the statute of limitations had expired, defendant hospital moved to amend its complaint against additional defendant Go. Defendant hospital\u2019s original complaint against additional defendant Go alleged a cause of action based solely on Go\u2019s individual negligence. In its attempted amended complaint, defendant hospital alleged that a nurse negligently treated decedent in defendant hospital while acting in her capacity as an employee of Go and therefore, Go was vicariously liable for said nurse\u2019s negligence. Defendant hospital\u2019s allegation of vicarious liability raised a new cause of action against Go and since the statute of limitations had already expired, the lower court properly prohibited said amended complaint. Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., 457 Pa. 321, 325, 319 A.2d 914, 918 (1974).\nThe Superior Court\u2019s order, remanding this case for a new trial on damages, should be reversed and the judgment of the trial court should be reinstated.\nMANDERINO, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. Plaintiff was awarded $5,199.75 in stipulated damages under the Wrongful Death Act.\n. Defendant hospital objected to the charge on \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d. Plaintiff then requested the court to submit special interrogatories to the jury so that the jury would segregate any damages awarded for \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d from all other damages. Counsel for defendant hospital objected to the special interrogatories and the court refused to submit the interrogatories. Plaintiff contends this should act as a waiver of defendant\u2019s right to appeal the court\u2019s charge because the special interrogatories would have allowed an easy cure to any possible error as opposed to the necessity of a new trial on the issue of damages if Superior Court is correct. Plaintiff is wrong. The record indicates that the judge would have refused the request for special interrogatories no matter what the defendant did. Finally, the waiver argument is very tenuous, at best.\n. Usually after a trial court charges the jury in detail on pain and suffering, the judge then adds in passing a sentence about \u201closs of life\u2019s pleasures\u201d.\n. This holding is in'accord with Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 382 F.Supp. 1271, 1299 (D.Conn.1974), aff\u2019d in part, 524 F.2d 384 (2d Cir. 1975) (non-jury award of $100,000 for \u201cthe destruction of the decedent\u2019s capacity to enjoy life\u2019s activities\u201d affirmed; remand for recalculation of lost net earnings) and Downie v. United States Lines Co., 359 F.2d 344, 347 (3rd Cir. 1966) cert. denied, 385 U.S. 897, 87 S.Ct. 201, 17 L.Ed.2d 130 (1966) (since plaintiff\u2019s injuries reduced his life expectancy, he can be compensated for the \u201cenjoyment of life\u201d which he would have had during the lost years of life.)\n. Defendant hospital contends, however, that additional defendant Go waived her right to object to defendant hospital\u2019s untimely filing of the amended complaint because four years earlier, Go failed to move for a judgment of non pros against defendant hospital when the latter failed to timely file its original complaint. Defendant hospital\u2019s contention is without merit.",
