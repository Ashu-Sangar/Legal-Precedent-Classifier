        "text": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of his common-law wife, Mamie Martin. He was sentenced to a term of 2*/2 to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. He subsequently moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial judge vacated sentence pending disposal of the motion and, upon denial of the motion, reinstated the above sentence. Appellant appeals the denial of withdrawal of his guilty plea. We affirm the court below.\nThe withdrawal of a guilty plea is within the discretion of the trial court. Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 469 Pa. 407, 366 A.2d 238 (1976); Commonwealth v. Morales, 452 Pa. 53, 305 A.2d 11 (1973); Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 299 A.2d 268 (1973). Where the motion is a post-sentence motion, relief will be granted only when necessary to correct manifest injustice. Commonwealth v. Rosmon, 477 Pa. 540, 384 A.2d 1221 (1978); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 507, 378 A.2d 1229 (1977); Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 301 A.2d 592 (1973). A more liberal policy toward post-sentence withdrawals would create a \u201csentence testing device\u201d for defendants. Starr, supra, 450 Pa. at 489, 301 A.2d 592. All defendants would plead guilty, view their sentence and then seek withdrawal of the guilty plea if the \u201codds\u201d favored a jury trial.\nTaking cognizance of the underlying theory, we find that the trial judge erroneously (although in good faith) treated this case as a pre-sentence situation. Appellant\u2019s time for appeal could have expired before the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to withdraw the plea. In order to avoid jeopardizing appellant\u2019s possible appeal to this Court, the trial judge vacated the judgment of sentence, with the intention of reinstating the judgment if appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw failed. Thus, while the motion was filed post-sentence, once the judge \u201cturned back the clock\u201d, he felt compelled to use the pre-sentence standard. This was error. A procedural concession made only for the purpose of preserving an opportunity to appeal should not affect the substantive test to be used on the underlying motion.\nThus, the trial court should have used the post-sentence, \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d test. Appellant alleges that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because he did not understand the import of such a plea and because he was in a state of shock from the time of the death of the victim, his common-law wife, to the time of trial. At a hearing on April 19, 1977, the trial judge found these allegations to be unsubstantiated. The record supports the court\u2019s finding that the guilty plea was, in fact, knowingly and voluntarily made.\nAppellant also makes a bare, unsubstantiated allegation of \u201cjudicial coercion\u201d at a March 9, 1977 hearing during which he reaffirmed his guilty plea. Neither the record nor his brief indicate any basis for finding coercion.\nAppellant\u2019s reasons for withdrawal of his guilty plea fail to satisfy the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d test. Thus, had the trial judge applied this standard, he would have reached the same decision \u2014 denial of withdrawal \u2014 as he reached under the more lenient (for the defendant) pre-sentencing test then prevailing. See Forbes, supra.\nWe affirm the judgment of sentence.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, POMEROY, NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., join.\nOpinion Expressing the Views of a Majority of the Court\nROBERTS, Justice.\nI agree that the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. This case should be analyzed under the standard for adjudicating pre-sentencing motions to withdraw pleas of guilty established in Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 299 A.2d 268 (1973). Accord Commonwealth v. Morales, 452 Pa. 53, 305 A.2d 11 (1973); Commonwealth v. Santos, 450 Pa. 492, 301 A.2d 829 (1973); Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 301 A.2d 592 (1973). Neither party argues that the post-sentencing standard the opinion of Mr. Justice Larsen employs should have been applied. Thus, the only issue before us is whether the trial court\u2019s disposition of the motion under the pre-sentencing standard was erroneous. Under the pre-sentencing standard, the trial court properly denied relief. Mr. Justice Larsen\u2019s disposition of the issue under the more stringent \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d standard used for post-sentencing motions is inappropriate.\nFurther, I disagree with the opinion\u2019s purported creation of a \u201cnew\u201d test for adjudicating pre-sentencing motions to withdraw pleas of guilty. See Commonwealth v. Whelan, 481 Pa. 418, 392 A.2d 1362 (1978) (Roberts, J., dissenting opinion (Part II)).\nO\u2019BRIEN, POMEROY, NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., join in this opinion.\n. This problem has since been resolved by Pa.R.Crim.P. 321 and Pa.R.A.P. 343, adopted June 29, 1977 with an effective date of September 1, 1977. These rules, read together, require a post-sentence motion for withdrawal of a guilty plea to be filed within ten days of sentencing. The 30-day appeal period does not begin until the motion is disposed of.\n. The pre-sentence test for withdrawal of a guilty plea, once the Commonwealth has commenced its case, is now \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d. See Commonwealth v. Whelan, 481 Pa. 418, 392 A.2d 1362 (1978).",
