        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOver twenty-eight hours elapsed between appellant Joseph Bowen\u2019s arrest and his preliminary arraignment. In that period of delay, police conducted fifteen interviews with appellant and obtained four inculpatory statements. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted these inculpatory statements into evidence. Appellant argues that police obtained these inculpatory statements in violation of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 118, Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972), and its progeny. We agree and reverse.\nWithout a warrant, Philadelphia police arrested appellant at about 10:30 p. m., February 21, 1971, and took him to the Police Administration Building. Police suspected that, earlier that day, appellant killed a Philadelphia police officer. Police placed appellant in an interrogation room, where questioning began at 11:30 p. m. Police subjected appellant to repeated interrogation, throughout which appellant repeatedly denied all involvement in the killing.\nUntil 3:15 p. m., February 22, sixteen and three-quarters hours after his arrest, appellant did not inculpate himself and police still had not provided for his preliminary arraignment. At 3:15 p. m., however, after police confronted appellant with the fact that the gun found near the scene of the killing had been traced to his brother, appellant acknowledged that he had obtained the gun from his brother a few days earlier. About two hours later, police briefly confronted appellant with his brother. Between 5:40 p. m. and 6:25 p. m., over nineteen hours after his arrest, appellant further inculpated himself. Further police questioning conducted until 7:25 p. m. produced a third statement in which appellant inculpated himself in a previous shooting.\nAt 8:45 p. m., over twenty-two hours after appellant\u2019s arrest the previous day, police began to take a formal, written statement from appellant. Appellant signed this writing two hours later. It was not until 3:15 a. m. the next day, four and one-half hours after appellant signed the statement and twenty-eight and three-quarters hours after appellant\u2019s arrest, that a preliminary arraignment was held.\nThe pre-arraignment delay in this case constitutes an undisputable violation of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 118. Rule 118, then applicable, provides:\n\u201cWhen a defendant has been arrested without a warrant, he shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the proper issuing authority where a complaint shall be filed against him.\n(a) If the complaint charges a court case, the defendant shall be given an immediate preliminary arraignment.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972), this Court held that a violation of Rule 118 requires the suppression of \u201call evidence obtained during \u2018unnecessary delay\u2019 except that which . . . has no reasonable relationship to the delay whatsoever.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Williams, 455 Pa. 569, 572, 319 A.2d 419, 420 (1974), we again set forth the criteria by which violations of the Rule are to be determined: \u201cthe delay must be unnecessary; evidence that is prejudicial must be obtained; and the incriminating evidence must be reasonably related to the delay.\u201d Accord, e. g., Commonwealth v. Dixon, 454 Pa. 444, 311 A.2d 613 (1973). Compare Commonwealth v. Davenport, 471 Pa. 278, 286, 370 A.2d 301, 306 (1977) (effective May 16, 1977, \u201c[i]f the accused is not arraigned within six hours of arrest, any statement obtained after arrest but before arraignment shall not be admissible at trial\u201d).\nThe lengthy delay in this case was clearly established by the evidence at the suppression hearing. The repeated, lengthy interrogation of appellant, both before and after he was confronted with the fact that the gun found at the scene of the crime was traced to his brother, was deliberately designed to elicit appellant\u2019s full confession to the crime. Police persisted in their questioning to create an atmosphere conducive to appellant\u2019s self-incrimination. They did so despite appellant\u2019s repeated denials over a period of sixteen hours. Sixteen and three-quarters hours elapsed from the time of arrest until appellant\u2019s admission of possession of his brother\u2019s gun; nineteen hours elapsed before appellant gave a full oral statement; appellant\u2019s formal statement was not completed until twenty-three hours after arrest, and preliminary arraignment did not take place until twenty-eight and three-quarters hours after arrest. There is no room for doubt that appellant\u2019s statements were directly related to the unnecessary, unjustified, and prejudicial delay.\nWe have stated repeatedly that Rule 118, Futch, and its progeny are specifically designed to put a stop to the practice of delaying arraignment of a defendant while the investigation against him continues. E. g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 472 Pa. 414, 372 A.2d 761 (1977). We reaffirm this principle today.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and new trial granted.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J., joins.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1978). This case was reassigned to the writer on September 29, 1978, for the purpose of preparing an opinion expressing the views of a majority of this Court.\n. Appellant also asserts that: (1) his written inculpatory statement was involuntary; (2) oral testimony of another offense was erroneously admitted into evidence; and (3) the trial court\u2019s charge invaded the province of the jury.\n. On September 18, 1973, Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 118 was renumbered as Rule 130 and amended, effective January 1, 1974. Rule 118 therefore applies to the present case.",

        "text": "POMEROY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the delay between arrest and arraignment in this case was inordinate and in manifest violation of our rule which requires prompt arraignment, Pa.R.Crim.P. 130. As I have pointed out before, however, the exclusionary rule of Futch was designed as a preventive measure to put an end to continual disregard of the rule by the police. Like other constitutionally related exclusionary rules, it says to police and prosecutors that if they obtain evidence illegally, it may not be used at trial. Conceding the validity of this approach, exclusion obviously can have no deterrent effect whatever on police action which took place in the past, prior to the announcement of the rule. Such was the case here. Bowen\u2019s arrest occurred on February 21, 1971; the exclusionary rule of Futch was not announced until over a year later, on April 20, 1972. To exclude now the confessions obtained before the new rule existed can hardly be justified as a deterrent to police misconduct; it is rather the needless imposition of a penalty against society itself.\nEAGEN, C. J., joins in this dissenting opinion.\n. See Commonwealth v. Dutton, 453 Pa. 547, 551, 307 A.2d 238, 240 (1973) (dissenting opinion of POMEROY, J., joined by JONES, C. J., and EAGEN, J.).
