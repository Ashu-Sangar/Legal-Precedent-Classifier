After a review of the briefs and record, we find that the lower court erred in determining the value of appellee\u2019s interest in the partnership at date of dissolution. See 59 P.S. \u00a7 104 (1964) (repealed 1975). The lower court found, and the parties do not dispute that the partnership was dissolved on April 6, 1966. However, in determining the value of appellee\u2019s partnership interest, the lower court used gross profit figures for the entire year of 1966 (through December 31, 1966). This procedure is inconsistent with the court\u2019s finding that the dissolution date was April 6 and has resulted in an overstatement of the value of appellee\u2019s interest. Accordingly, the cause is remanded to the lower court for a recalculation of appellee\u2019s award.\nIt is so ordered.\nEach party to pay own costs.\nWe hear this appeal based upon section 204(a) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp. 1978-79).",
