The testator died on October 23, 1965, leaving a will under the terms of which he bequeathed One Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($160,000) among 11 pecuniary legatees in varying amounts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In addition, the testator specifically bequeathed his stock to his son, Leonard H.

Leonard Tose contributed Fifty Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty-four Dollars and Sixty-five Cents ($50,834.65) toward the payment of the Federal Estate taxes and the stock had been distributed to Leonard leaving nothing available for distribution to the pecuniary legatees. Andrea Tose, one of the pecuniary legatees, filed objections and supplemental objections to the account alleging that the State and Federal death taxes attributed to Leonard’s specific legacy, the stock, should have been apportioned to it and paid by Leonard. She also contended that certain administrative expenses should have been similarly apportioned. The Auditing Judge in his adjudication of March 22, 1972, sustained the position of Ms. Tose with reference to the apportionment of the death taxes attributed to Leonard’s specific bequest and thereby made available a fund of Thirty-eight Thousand One Hundred Sixty Dollars and Twenty-six Cents ($38,-160.26) for the partial satisfaction of the 11 pecuniary legacies. Exceptions were filed by the executors to the direction <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>to apportion and by Andrea Tose to the allowance of the executors’ commission and the failure to direct the apportionment of certain administrative expenses.

An Opinion Sur Objections to a Schedule of Distribution was filed on April 23, 1974, and thereafter exceptions were filed by Andrea Tose.

First, it is contended that interest should be paid at a rate of three per cent (3%) per annum on the pecuniary legacies commencing one year from the date of the decedent’s death. It is argued that this result is required by the Probate, Estates and Fiduciary Code. Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, § 2, 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3543(a) (1975).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Secondly, appellant contends that the interest paid on the delinquent estate and inheritance taxes should not have been apportioned to the pecuniary legacies. Specifically, it is argued that the account of the executors shows that they paid interest on the tax liability in the amount of Nine Thousand Eight Hundred <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>Eighty-one Dollars and Thirty-one Cents ($9,881.31) which was taken into account in charging the pecuniary legatees. It is asserted that the delay in payment of these tax obligations arose because of a dispute as to the value of the stock, which was the subject of the specific bequest, and therefore the pecuniary legatees should not have been held responsible for the interest that accrued. Thirdly, appellant charges that her counsel should have been paid out of the fund “created” for the benefit of all of the pecuniary legatees.</p>

Thus, in the objections to the account appellant had available to her the claim that the interest paid on the death taxes should not have been apportioned, as well as her objection, which she did raise, to the portion of the principal of these <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>taxes for which the specific bequest should have been held accountable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although appellant filed objections and supplemental objections and exceptions to the adjudication, this claim was raised for the first time in the objections to the unconfirmed schedule of distribution.

Each of these claims were dependent upon a final adjudication providing for a fund available for payment of the pecuniary bequests. It would have been ludicrous to claim interest on the legacies until there was a resolution of the question as to whether the legacies abated because of the absence of a fund to pay them. It would be equally absurd to claim contribution for counsel fees on a theory that new funds had been generated as a result of the litigation until the proceedings establishing the alleged new fund had become final. Both of these claims could not have ripened until the exceptions to the confirmation of the account had been resolved. Appellant properly initiated these claims by raising them at the first available opportunity by way of objections to the schedule of proposed distributions filed by the executors.</p>

In her brief appellant concentrates upon the fact that Section 3543(a) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20Pa.%20Super.%203543" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="20 Pa.

She also cites <em>Smith Estate, </em>13 Fiduc.Rep. 244, 30 D. &amp; C.2d 1 (1962) where the court directed that the interest on pecuniary legacies shall be paid out of income. What appellant ignores is that the question is not her entitlement to interest but the existence of a fund out of which such payment could be made. As the learned court below properly noted, appellant’s arguments are of no avail where all of the income is included in the balance for distribution, as was the case here, and still the legacies could not be paid in full. To achieve the result appellant seeks to obtain, it would be necessary either to surcharge the executors or to charge the specific legacy to <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>generate a fund out of which payment might be made.

The rule stated in Sowers suggests that where the fund before the court is “in jeopardy” and an interested party’s litigation protects the fund from this jeopardy, counsel fees may be allowed to the litigant out of the fund. The <em>Hemp-stead </em>decision merely provides concrete examples of when a fund is “in jeopardy,” <em>viz., </em>when the fund is threatened by fraud or illegal claims. When <em>Sowers </em>and <em>Hempstead </em>are read in this light, it is clear that there is no legal basis upon which appellant in the instant case could be awarded counsel fees.
