    <p id="b577-5" data-blocks='[["BL_577.5",577,[234,466,1160,1664]]]'>We turn then to appellant’s contention that an in-court identification made of him by Anthony Ragland was tainted by an illegal pre-trial identification procedure. Through his counsel, appellant presented a pre-trial motion to suppress the proposed in-court identification testimony of Anthony Ragland. That motion was denied and Ragland was permitted to testify to the jury that appellant was the person he saw shoot Marvin Wyatt. Appellant points out that Ragland initially picked appellant’s photograph from an array of ten displayed to him by police early in the morning of June 19, 1974, at which time it is argued, appellant “was the primary focus of the police investigation and [at which time] the police had formed the intention to arrest [him].” Appellant contends, therefore, that adversary proceedings had been initiated against him and that he was entitled to counsel at the time of the photographic identification made by the witness Ragland. <em>See Commonwealth v. Richman, </em><a href="/pa/458/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="458 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="479711" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0167-01">458 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=320%20A.2d%20351" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="320 A.2d 351">320 A.2d 351</a> (1974), <em>Commonwealth v.

This out-of-court identification allegedly resulting from an invalid uncounselled photographic identification procedure was not introduced into evidence at trial, however, and we therefore need not decide whether appellant was entitled to the representation of counsel at the time of that pre-trial photographic array. The only issue with which we must now be concerned is whether the in-court identification made by the witness Ragland was impermissibly tainted by the pre-trial procedure (assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the pre-trial procedure was invalid), and was therefore improperly admitted into evidence at trial.</p>

First, the pre-trial procedure consisted of showing the witness ten photographs, one of which was appellant. Appellant does not now argue that the photographs themselves were overly suggestive in any way. Indeed, at the pre-trial suppression hearing the prosecution presented evidence indicating that the nine photographs of persons other than appellant were of persons of similar age, complexion, and hair style. The record also indicates that the witness was not told that the group of ten photographs contained one of a suspect in this case; he was simply given the ten photographs and asked if he recognized any of them. After viewing the photographs for two or three minutes, Ragland picked out appellant’s picture and said that he was the person who had shot Wyatt.</p>

For most of this time, the witness was within eight to twelve feet of the shooter. Based on this view, Ragland had, prior to identifying appellant’s photograph, described Wyatt’s assailant to the police. That description was consistent with appellant’s appearance. Moreover, that was the only identification of the killer made by Ragland prior to the pre-trial suppression hearing (Rag-land was never requested to pick Wyatt’s assailant from a line-up, nor were any other photographs shown to him). Lastly, although approximately nine months had elapsed between the time of the shooting and the pre-trial suppression hearing, Ragland’s testimony at that hearing was positive and consistent, and unshaken on cross-examination. Allowing him to testify at trial that appellant was the person he saw shoot Wyatt was therefore not error.</p>

      <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>Next we consider appellant’s contention that the trial court erroneously limited defense counsel’s cross-examination of the prosecution’s key witness, Anthony Ragland, regarding his knowledge of an identification of the perpetrator allegedly given to the police by Crawford, the details of which allegedly contradicted Ragland’s identification. This attempt was objected to by the prosecution, and the court sustained the objection, having concluded that the proposed cross-examination would elicit inadmissable hearsay testimony from Ragland. Whether or not the proposed question was objectionable on hearsay grounds need not now concern us for it is clear that even if the prosecution’s objection was erroneously sustained, appellant was not prejudiced thereby. The only thing that appellant was prevented from doing was to ask Ragland if he knew that Crawford had described Wyatt’s killer as having worn a hat at the time of the shooting, whereas Ragland, in his original description to police, said that the killer was bareheaded. Both witnesses, according to the prosecution’s evidence, had identified appellant as the killer. Thus, defense counsel’s attempt to impeach Ragland’s credibility by questioning him regarding Crawford’s identification, went not to the substance of the identification, but rather to some minor peripheral matter. Furthermore, in rejecting defense counsel’s reasons for wanting to question Ragland regarding Crawford’s identification of appellant, the trial court stated,</p>

Moreover, defense counsel was allowed, as has been discussed previously in this opinion, to question two police officers who were on duty on the night of the homicide as to these allegedly conflicting identifica<a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>tions by Ragland and Crawford. Any error the trial court may have committed in limiting cross-examination of Rag-land was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p id="b581-5" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[236,503,1151,475]]]'>Lastly, we come to the question of whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine the prosecution witness, Ragland, regarding Rag-land’s alleged record as a juvenile offender. Appellant argues that he was denied his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him because the trial court’s ruling effectively prevented him from pursuing one avenue of attack against this prosecution witness’s credibility.</p>
    <p id="b581-6" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[237,1003,1152,368]]]'>The facts surrounding this issue are as follows. As previously mentioned, Anthony Ragland was the prosecution’s key identification witness.

The basis of that refusal, of course, was the court’s belief that <em>any </em>questioning of Ragland by defense counsel regarding Ragland’s juvenile record would have been improper. The prosecution now argues that the trial court’s action was correct because the results of juvenile adjudications are always inadmissible for impeachment purposes. In support of this proposition, the prosecution cites <em>Commonwealth v. Katchmer, </em><a href="/pa/453/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="453 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="577577" data-case-paths="/pa/453/0461-01">453 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=309%20A.2d%20591" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="309 A.2d 591">309 A.2d 591</a> <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>(1973), and the Juvenile Records Act of 1972, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, 11 P.S. §§ 50-102 et seq.</p>

The prosecution does not contend that <em>Davis </em>is inapplicable in Pennsylvania, but rather, it argues that <em>Davis </em>requires only that a defendant be allowed to cross-examine regarding the witness’s juvenile record when such cross-examination is designed to show the witness’s bias. In the instant case, according to the prosecution, defense counsel’s request was a general one, seeking permission to explore the witness’s juvenile record on cross-examination, without any mention being made of a possible theory of bias on the part of the witness which could have brought the situation within the ambit of <em>Davis. </em>Without such an assertion of bias, contends the prosecution, the trial court properly followed <em>Katchmer, supra, </em>in denying defense counsel’s request. Specifically, the prosecution argues:</p>
    <blockquote id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.6",582,[265,1718,1117,585]]]'>“it is claimed [by appellant] that possibly some bias on the part of Ragland might have been revealed had the questioning been permitted.

The Commonwealth submits that if the protection of anonymity for juvenile offenders provided by the Juvenile Act of 1972 is ever to be violated, this should only be on the basis of a concrete demonstration of necessity to prove particular bias or prejudice, which is totally lacking in this case.”</blockquote>
