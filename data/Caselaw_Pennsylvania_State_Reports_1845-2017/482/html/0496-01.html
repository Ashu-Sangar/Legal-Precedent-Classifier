    <p id="b533-9" data-blocks='[["BL_533.9",533,[206,907,1153,800]]]'>Appellant, Rodney Simmons, was tried by a judge sitting with a jury for the homicide of Samuel McCrae. Appellant was found guilty of murder of the third degree and possession of instruments of crime. He filed original post-verdict motions and supplemental post-verdict motions, all of which were denied. On March 25, 1976, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten to twenty years on his conviction of murder of the third degree, and a concurrent sentence of two and one-half to five years on the possession of instruments of crime conviction. He appealed the judgment of sentence imposed on the murder conviction to this court and the judgment of sentence imposed on the conviction of possession of an instrument of crime was appealed to the Superior Court, which certified that appeal to this court for disposition.</p>

On April 14, 1975, appellant, Rodney Simmons, also known as “Hot Lips,” was sitting in the front passenger seat of an automobile driven by Kenny Biggs, also known as “Lemon”. In the rear seat was another individual, known as “Nut,” who was intoxicated. At approximately 9:30 p. m. the automobile driven by “Lemon” was in the vicinity of 29th and Clementine Streets, Philadelphia. The automobile was pulled to the side of the street where Clarence Williams, Gregory LaMarr and Michael Jackson were standing. Appellant inquired of the group where they were from. This question was explained as meaning in street language, did they belong to a street <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>gang. Williams responded “Go ahead. We don’t do that stuff around here.” This response caused a verbal exchange between appellant and Williams. Jackson then told the occupants of the car to turn off the engine and get out of the car. Appellant responded that they would be right back. As the car pulled away Williams, carrying a stick, followed the car up to a red light at 29th and Allegheny Avenue. When the car stopped at the light, Williams took cover behind a tree. Samuel McCrae then walked around the corner from Allegheny Avenue onto 29th Street. As McCrae crossed the street and approached the driver’s side of Lemon’s automobile, appellant leaned across from the passenger seat and fired a shot, striking McCrae in the chest. McCrae was later pronounced dead. The cause of death was determined to be the gunshot wound.</p>

Appellant was arrested at approximately 11:48 p. m. on April 14, 1975, at his home in Philadelphia, and transported to the Police Administration Building. He arrived at police headquarters at 12:25 a. m., on April 15, and was placed in an interrogation room. From 12:25 a. m. until 2:50 a. m., appellant was left alone. The police officer in charge of the investigation, Detective Doyle, was at the scene of the shooting supervising the crime laboratory’s collection of evidence and interviewing potential witnesses. Detective Doyle arrived at the police station at 2:50 a. m., when he immediately proceeded to the interrogation room where appellant was being held. Appellant was then permitted to use the bathroom facilities. The record continues by showing that between 2:54 a. m. until 3:01 a. m. Doyle elicited general biographical data from appellant. The chronology shows that from 3:01 a. m. until 3:35 a. m., appellant was warned of his constitutional rights and that he gave a statement. The substance of the statement was that appel<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>lant admitted that he, “Lemon,” and “Nut” were in the car passing 29th and Clementine Streets. He then stated that the group of boys standing on the corner began to shout and the victim was two car lengths away from their automobile when he was shot. Appellant also stated that “Nut” was in the back seat and was drunk. The statement did not indicate who fired the shot that killed McCrae. From 3:85 until 3:50 a. m. appellant was left alone. At 3:50 a. m. until 4:08 appellant was fed and taken to the mens’ room. From 4:08 until 5:10 appellant was again left alone. From 5:10 a. m. until approximately 5:30 a. m., Detective Doyle performed a neutron activation test to determine if appellant had recently fired a gun. Beginning at 5:30 a. m. and continuing until 6:10 a. m., appellant gave an inculpatory statement that was signed at 6:30 a. m. He was subsequently arraigned.</p>

We have concluded that “administrative delay,” — i. e., that period of time required to accomplish the mechanics of the booking process — is not an “unnecessary delay” under the rule. Administrative delay, however, has never been held to include a waiting period so that the detective in charge of the investigation, who happens to be at the crime scene at the time of an arrest, may return to the police station. The investigating detective’s presence is not necessary for booking purposes. The only purpose for the investigating detective’s return is to interrogate the arrestee. Time spent awaiting the investigating detective’s arrival cannot be considered necessary so as to remove the requirements for prompt arraignment.</p>
