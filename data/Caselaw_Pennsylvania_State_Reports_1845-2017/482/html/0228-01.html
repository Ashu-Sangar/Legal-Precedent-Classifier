Following an extended hearing, the chancellor ordered an accounting and partition of all the entireties property held by Helen and Joseph Ashley. The Chancellor concluded, however, that appellant was not a shareholder of either WIPCO, Inc., or Ashley Machine and Tool Co.

She bases her argument upon the following facts about which there is no dispute. On January 6, 1964, appellant and her husband, appellee Joseph Ashley, entered into a subscription agreement with the newly formed WIP-CO, Inc. The agreement, which was approved by the Board of Directors of WIPCO, Inc., stated that appellant and appellee were each to purchase 50 shares of WIPCO stock at a purchase price of $5,000.00 for each block of 50 shares. On March 5, 1964, individual stock certificates in the amount of 50 shares each to appellant and appellee, Joseph Ashley, were prepared by an attorney who handled appellee’s legal <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>matters. The stock certificates were signed by the Secretary of WIPCO, Inc., Helen Ashley. Stock certificate “Number 1” purported to show that Joseph Ashley was the owner of 50 shares of WIPCO stock; certificate “Number 2” indicated that Helen Ashley owned 50 shares of WIPCO stock. The certificates were receipted for in WIPCO’s stock certificate registry book, but they were not signed by the president of WIPCO as required by WIPCO’s by-laws and by the Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1933, P.L. 364 art. VI, § 607, as amended 15 P.S. § 1607(B). Appellant placed the certificates in a filing cabinet in the office of Ashley Machine and Tool Co., a corporation wholly owned by appellee, Joseph Ashley, and for whom appellant worked as office manager. Consideration for the subscription offer was provided by Ashley Machine and Tool Co., which transferred assets totalling $10,000.00 to WIPCO in March, 1964.</p>

The receipt stubs were also crossed out with an “X.” No notice was given to appellant that the shares certificate receipt stub indicating her ownership in 50 shares of WIPCO stock was being voided. At the same time that he “voided” the stock certificate receipt stubs above, appellee’s accountant filled in WIP-CO stock certificate “Number 3” to indicate that 100 shares of WIPCO stock were owned by Ashley Machine and Tool Co. Stock certificate “Number 3” was back-dated to March 11, 1964, pursuant to appellee’s directions. In May, 1972, at the time of the above transactions, appellant was a judicially declared incompetent, having been declared so by the court on April 28, 1971, because of alcoholism. Her competency was judicially restored on June 5, 1972.</p>

The evidence presented at trial clearly shows that at the time WIPCO was incorporated, appellee possessed the required “donative intent” to give 50 shares of the WIPCO stock to his wife, appellant here, and the equity court’s conclusion that appellant had failed to establish that element of a valid, inter vivos gift was erroneous. At trial, appellee testified that, as early as January 6, 1964, he intended to give appellant 50 shares of WIPCO stock. He also testified that at the time WIPCO was incorporated in March, 1964, he intended to give appellant half of the WIPCO stock, and that his attorney prepared stock certificates Numbers One and Two, and put the federal tax stamps on them, in order to effectuate the intended gift. Appellee stated that at that time — March, 1964 — he assumed that the stock had been issued. Subsequently, according to appellee, it appeared that the issuance had not been completed because the attorney was “having problems.” For reasons not revealed at trial, certificates Numbers One and Two were never signed by the president of WIPCO. Additionally, the trial court found as a fact that from 1964 until 1968, at least, appellee made both oral and written representations that appellant owned WIPCO stock.</p>

Article VI, Section 607 (15 P.S. § 1607) outlines, among other things, the information required to be contained on the stock certificate. That section states that “[t]he shares of a corporation shall be <em>represented </em>by share certificates.” (emphasis added). These certificates are required by the Act to state that the corporation is organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, and to state the name of the holder of the shares, the number of shares represented by the certificate, and the par value, if <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>any, of each share represented. If the corporation is authorized to issue shares of more than one class, the certificate is required to alert the shareholder of that fact and provision must be made to assure that the shareholder knows the relative rights of the shares of each class. The Act also provides that every certificate is to be signed by the president and secretary (or other authorized officers) and sealed with the corporate seal. Clearly, the purpose of § 607’s requirements is to protect the purchaser of corporate stock, and to fully inform that purchaser of certain information deemed pertinent by the legislature. A corporation’s failure to comply with Section 607’s requirements was not intended to protect it in an action brought by a shareholder. In fact, Section 610 of Article VI (15 P.S. § 1610), states</p>

As provided in the original subscription offer, which was accepted by the WIPCO Board of Directors, appellee and appellant were each to purchase 50 shares of WIPCO stock. Each block of 50 shares was to cost $5,000.00. Within one week of WIPCO’s acceptance of this subscription offer, appellee caused Ashley Machine and Tool Co. to transfer various machinery and equipment to WIPCO. The record does not reveal the exact monetary worth of this machinery and equipment, however, the record shows that it was in excess of $10,000.00. In addition to authorizing this transfer of Ashley Machine assets to WIPCO, appellee, in conjunction with his accountant, set up the corporate records of both Ashley Machine and WIPCO to reflect that exactly $10,000 worth of these assets consisted of an outright transfer from Ashley Machine to WIPCO, while the remainder in excess of $10,000 value was carried as a loan from Ashley Machine to <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>WIPCO.

Not only did he personally authorize the transfer of $10,000 in Ashley assets to WIPCO in March, 1964, for the purpose of providing consideration for WIPCO stock, $5,000 of which was to be issued to him personally, but, as he testified at trial, he and Ashley Machine Tool Co. are “one and the same” ; that “[he] was the business,” and that the house in which appellee presently resides was purchased with Ashley Machine and Tool Co. funds. Significantly, when asked, how long he had lived in the house owned by Ashley Machine and Tool Co., appellee responded, <em>“I bought that home, </em>

Appellant and appellee, Joseph Ashley, had each offered to purchase 50 shares of WIPCO stock for a purchase price of $5,000.00 each. Those offers were accepted by WIPCO’s Board of Directors, and consideration for the issuance of shares was provided by appellee who caused Ashley Machine and Tool Co. to transfer $10,-000.00 worth of assets to WIPCO. At that point, the gift to appellant of 50 shares of WIPCO stock was complete, and WIPCO’s subsequent failure to fully comply with the statutory formalities regarding the issuance of the certificates which represent those 50 shares, cannot invalidate the prior gift.</p>
