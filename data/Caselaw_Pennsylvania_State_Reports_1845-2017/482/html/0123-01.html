The family has been known to the Bureau of Children’s Service of Lancaster County (herein “Bureau” or “Agency”), appellee herein, since 1956, the agency having been involved with the placement of older children. Over a four-year period subsequent to W’s birth numerous visits were made to the home by caseworkers on the staff of the Bureau. Reports of these visits contained in the Bureau’s files indicate that the M’s house was generally dark, filthy and without heat in cold weather except for an inadequate oil burner. A “terrible” odor permeated the living quarters and the children were unkempt and frequently in need of a change of diapers or clothing. Upon a number of occasions the parents were warned by the caseworkers of the need to upgrade conditions in the home. These warnings went unheeded, however, and the situation in the house remained unchanged. As a result, W. was placed in a foster home in August of 1967, and custody was formally awarded to the Bureau following a court hearing on October 31, 1967.</p>

The parents made no effort to see W., made no inquiry as to his health or well-being, and sent him no gifts or cards. At the Bureau’s initiative a meeting was held with the parents in October of 1971. The condition of the parents’ home was discussed, but neither parent expressed any interest in seeing the child. There was no further contact until June of 1973, when the Bureau made two visits to appellants’ home concerning one of the other children. Again the home was found to be dirty, dark and foul smelling. On neither of these occasions did the parents mention or inquire as to W. In March of 1975, after the lapse of another sixteen months, a caseworker informed the parents that involuntary termination proceedings were <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>to be pursued by the Agency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> There have been no subsequent encounters between the appellants and the Bureau.</p>

    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.6",161,[237,800,1153,760]]]'>In examining the circumstances of the case before us, appellant P.M., the child’s mother, has an I.Q. of 47; appellant W.M., the child’s father, has an I.Q. of 65. The Bureau of Children’s Service was aware of this at the time the child was first removed from appellants’ home. It is true that as the majority states appellants did not maintain communication with their son. However, a month or two after the child’s initial removal, the mother called the Bureau and requested a visit with her child. She was refused and was told that such a visitation would “upset” the child. Appellants <em>then </em>made no further efforts because they believed that to do so would “upset” their son. Appellants were not contacted by the Bureau until four years later and were never advised by the Bureau how to maintain contact with their son.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.7",161,[240,1588,1150,292]]]'>Furthermore, appellants were lulled into a state of inactivity by the Bureau. When W.M, III, was removed in 1967, the Bureau also removed his sisters from appellants’ home. However, in 1974, the Bureau returned to the parents the custody of their mentally retarded daughter even though communications were not maintained with that child.</p>

While the majority may be reluctant to find a legal duty on behalf of the Bureau, the majority has no such qualms in ignoring these same facts and finding a waiver by appellants of their rights as parents.</p>

      <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>The Court does not discuss the appellants’ “incapacity” under Section 311(2) but says that such “incapacity” is probably a “permissible inference.” At p. 412, n. 4. Given the intellectual capacity of appellants and the fact that the Bureau has not shown that the causes of an “incapacity” cannot or will not be remedied, the parental rights of appellants cannot be terminated under § 311(2). <em>In re Geiger, </em><a href="/pa/459/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="459 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="481005" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0636-01">459 Pa. 636</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="459 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="481005" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0636-01">331 A.2d 172</a> (1975). Additionally, the state cannot constitutionally terminate parental rights if the parent is “incapacitated” without fault. <em>In re William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a>, 1252 (Concurring and dissenting opinion of Nix, J.; and dissenting opinion of Manderino, J.)</p>

Surely if the parents are “incapacitated” for one child they would be for the other.</p>
