      <em>Graves </em>addresses only specific intent. While evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication in a murder case may be used to negate intent <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>and thereby reduce the crime to a lesser degree of murder, in no event can it change the <em>character </em>of the crime from murder to manslaughter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b618-6" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[229,864,1162,411]]]'>The final question is whether appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel. We stated in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em>“counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests”. <a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, 604, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a>, 352 (1967).

    <p id="b618-7" data-blocks='[["BL_618.7",618,[230,1315,1158,518]]]'>Appellant’s first two claims hereunder allege that his attorneys (two public defenders) were ineffective because they failed to appeal the jury charge on intoxication (discussed prior), and failed to object to the photographic exhibits. Since the state of the law at the time of trial clearly supported the jury charge on the use of intoxication evidence, it would have been frivolous for counsel to appeal this matter. The record clearly shows that counsel <em>did </em>object to introduction of the photos. Hence, these ineffective assistance claims are without merit.</p>
    <p id="b618-8" data-blocks='[["BL_618.8",618,[229,1874,1159,366]],["BL_619.1",619,[244,317,1150,362]]]'>The third claim of ineffective assistance concerns counsel’s failure to appeal the lower court’s denial of a motion to suppress evidentiary use of oral statements made to the police by appellant at the time of his arrest. At the post-conviction hearing, appellant’s former counsel testified that he had considered the issue waived because appellant, in taking the witness stand, had testified as to the state<a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>ments in question. Counsel also told the court that he had forewarned appellant that such testimony would operate as a waiver. Since appellant’s testimony constituted a voluntary and knowing waiver, counsel, quite properly, recognized he was barred from raising the suppression issue on appeal. Thus, we find no ineffective assistance of counsel on this issue.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[246,716,1155,905]]]'>The final aspect of the ineffectiveness issue involves the failure of counsel to inform appellant of his alleged right to have a court-appointed counsel other than a member of the public defender’s staff. There is no such right. While an indigent is entitled to court-appointed counsel at no cost, he cannot insist upon a counsel other than the public defender. <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/428/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="428 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1912423" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0210-01">428 Pa. 210</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=236%20A.2d%20805" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="236 A.2d 805">236 A.2d 805</a> (1968). Furthermore, the court will not grant a motion for change of counsel except for substantial reasons. Pa.R.Crim.P. 316(c)(ii); <em>Commonwealth v.

At the PCHA hearing, where he first raised this question, appellant expressed a vague notion that he might have been able to obtain an attorney with more experience in handling homicide cases. He failed to present any substantial reasons which would have justified reassignment of counsel even if he had made such a request. Nor did he ever express dissatisfaction with his public defender.</p>

However, a waiver is not avoided simply because a party <em>argues </em>that the issue has not been waived, rather it must be established that the claim of no waiver is in fact sustainable. In this case it clearly was not. The claim that the argument rests upon a new principle of law, not recognized at the time of the direct appeal in this case, assumes that our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.
