The precise issue raised is whether the failure of a defendant to object to a delay caused by a co-defendant or the co-defendant’s counsel permits that period to be excluded under section (d) of Rule 1100 in the computation of the period in which the defendant must be tried. In view of the limited issue presented and the absence of a factual dispute we may here dispense with a detailed recitation of the circumstances of the arrests and the procedural histories that followed in each case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It is sufficient for our purposes that the period of delay in question was not occasioned by instant appellees or their counsel and that the failure to exclude this period from the computation would result in a finding that trial commenced beyond the period required under Rule 1100. In each instance the trial courts accepted the view that the appellees’ acquiescence in the delays justified exclusion under section (d). The Superior Court reversed, holding that absent affirmative evidence of an agreement or approval of the delay, section (d) does not provide for the exclusion where the delay was caused by the <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>unavailability of a co-defendant or his counsel.

We are urged to find that his acquiescence should be construed as a participation in the delay on his part for which he should be held accountable and that the Commonwealth should be viewed as being without fault. Addressing first the latter part of this premise, it must be observed that Rule 1100 expressly provides an opportunity for the Commonwealth to file a timely request for an extension of the time for the commencement of trial, where good cause for such a request is present.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In <em>Commonwealth v. Shelton, </em><a href="/pa/469/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="469 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1722059" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0008-01">469 Pa. 8</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="469 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1722059" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0008-01">364 A.2d 694</a> (1976), we stressed that section (c) provided the Commonwealth with an adequate procedural method to protect its right to effectuate a timely prosecution and that <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>there was no need to distort the clear language of section (d) to provide additional exclusions. <em>See </em>also <em>Commonwealth v.

It cannot be legitimately argued that the Commonwealth is free from fault where it had available an adequate remedy which it failed to utilize. When it became apparent that the continuances and delays of co-defendants and their counsel might jeopardize the prosecution against the appellees, it was then the responsibility of the Commonwealth to proceed under the provisions of section (c) to secure sufficient time to assure a timely prosecution. At that juncture the defense would properly have been put to an election between the acceptance of an extension order or the agreement to a severance.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[284,1083,1162,1281]],["BL_609.1",609,[228,329,1154,253]]]'>The first leg of appellant’s argument would have us decide that it was the appellees’ responsibility in the first instance to move for a severance. The obvious weakness of this position is that there is nothing in the language of section (d) which would support such an obligation. In the clearest possible terms section (d) provides for only two situations which will justify exclusions from the computation of the mandatory period — neither is here applicable. <em>Commonwealth v. Shelton, <a href="/pa/469/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="469 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1722059" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0008-01">supra;</a> Commonwealth v.

Further, we are not impressed by the reasoning offered in support of such a construction of the section. The Commonwealth would have us assume that these appellees necessarily benefited from the delaying tactics of their co-defendants and proceed to argue that it would be unfair not to hold them accountable for the period of time that expired. Even if we were inclined to indulge in that sort of speculation, which we are not, it does not follow that the possibility of a fortuitous benefit must give rise to an obligation on the part of appellees to affirmatively disassociate themselves. While it is true that dilatory practices of <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>parties or their counsel are not to be countenanced, <em>Commonwealth v.
