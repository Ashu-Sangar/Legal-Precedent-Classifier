However, he went on to state Batty’s condition requires he be kept in a hospital or “residential treatment center,” and indicated Batty might be dangerous to society if immediately set free. He could not specify how long such a treatment program should continue, but stated some of his patients have been under care for over seven years. He testified that counselling on the drinking problem should be available. While stating juvenile treatment was preferable, the psychiatrist went on to testify Batty could, if properly treated, get adequate care in an adult setting.</blockquote>

The photographs were probative of the degree of appellant’s culpability. They were introduced to help rebut appellant’s assertion that culpability did not reach murder of the first degree. The pictures clearly demonstrate that appellant, after inflicting a severe beating, took steps to conceal his crime. Thus, the evidentiary value of the photographs outweighed their inflammatory impact on the trier of fact and they were properly introduced into evidence.</p>
