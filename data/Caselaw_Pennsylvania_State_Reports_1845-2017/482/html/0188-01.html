In a separate provision, the testatrix appointed appellant and the Reading Trust Company, now the National Central Bank, appellee herein, as trustees of two trusts created by the will. The first of these, denominated a “Trust for Valerie Lynne Rudolph” (daughter of appellant and granddaughter of testatrix), provides for monthly payments of income and distributions of portions of the principal to Valerie upon her attaining ages 80, 45 and 60, respectively, at which latter time the trust shall terminate. The second trust consists of the residue of the estate. The will provides for monthly payments of $100 out of income to each of the two sisters of testatrix for their respective lives; the balance of income is to be paid to appellant in monthly installments during her lifetime. She is also given a right to invade principal to the extent that the trustees find necessary from time to time for the “support, maintenance, medical care and nursing care of my said daughter” (appellant).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The will further directs that so long as Virginia Croessant Rudolph lives, the corporate co-trustee shall be guided solely by her written advice as to investment or reinvestment of the trust principal, and shall not be liable for any loss occasioned by such reliance.</p>

Little action was taken to administer the estate, however, and on January 5, 1975 appellant was removed, without objection, as executrix on petition of National Central Bank. The bank and appellant’s daughter Valerie were appointed “succeeding executors” by the Register of Wills, having been named as such in the will. Premised upon her actions, or lack thereof, with respect to the administration of the estate, the bank, on September 5, 1975, petitioned the court for removal of appellant as co-trustee under the will. Following an evidentiary hearing, <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>the orphans’ court ordered appellant removed as trustee. It also decreed that appellee-bank be relieved of the testamentary directive that it comply with appellant’s written instructions concerning the investment of the trust property.

Bobb, Esq., a lawyer who had represented her as executrix.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> His testimony revealed a pattern of inattention and neglect on the part of Mrs. Rudolph pertaining to the administration of her mother’s estate. Her repeated failure to respond to counsel’s inquiries and admonitions concerning estate matters culminated in the resignation of Mr. Bobb as counsel. This neglect was evidenced by the fact that corporations in which the decedent owned stock were not notified of the death nor were dividends and interest on the securities collected; state and federal income and death tax returns went unfiled; and taxes due on the estate were never paid. As further evidence of the appellant’s inability to participate effectively as a trustee under the provisions of the will, the witness noted that on two occasions Mrs. Rudolph inquired into the possibility of removing the bank as a co-trustee. Appellant did not dispute the charges of her neglect in administration of the estate. Rather, her excuse was that she was incapacitated by numerous illnesses during the period in question.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellant testified that she had now recovered her health and desired to act as trustee, and in so doing would cooperate with the bank as co-trustee. As <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>indicative of her ability to function responsibly she cited her successful management of her own considerable holdings. This testimony was corroborated by that of Mrs. Rudolph’s accountant, James E. Berta, Jr., and her daughter, Valerie. Moreover, Valerie, the primary beneficiary under the trusts, twenty-seven years of age at the time of the hearing, testified that she desired that the appellant be allowed to continue as trustee. It is in light of this record that the action of the lower court must be viewed.</p>

In dismissing appellant’s exceptions the court en banc concluded: “Our reluctance to remove a fiduciary appointed by a decedent is referred to in our Order and we would point out that since the decedent, the mother of Mrs. Rudolph, appointed her as a co-trustee of her estate and directed her to advise the National Central Bank, her co-trustee, with reference to investments placed an even greater obligation upon Mrs. Rudolph to communicate and cooperate with her co-trustee, an obligation which she failed to carry out because of her continued neglect of her duties. We regretfully arrived at the conclusion that the exceptant’s attitude demonstrated a hostility toward her co-trustee, which conduct was not justified.</p>

Such a final decree is not, however, binding on this Court as “law of the case” and does not prevent us from reviewing the evidence anew to resolve the wholly distinct issue of appellant’s ability to serve as trustee.

We note, however, that appellant assisted in the handling of her mother’s property following the death of appellant’s father and that the testatrix was thus familiar with the investment policies and financial transactions of appellant. In light of this knowledge of the testatrix, a court should be loath to interfere with the desires she expressed in her will. <em>Beichner Estate, supra; </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts, § 107, Comment <em>f </em>(1959). The record indicates, furthermore, that appellant has successfully managed her own holdings (greater than those presently in the trust) for a number of years.</p>

Although the record before us does not indicate whether the trusts in question have commenced or been funded, it does appear that at the direction of appellant, the two sisters of testatrix began receiving their monthly income payments of $100 (under the terms of the residue trust) shortly after the death of the testatrix. The granddaughter has expressly waived any right to present income under the separate trust for her benefit.</p>
