Newell, an occupant of the bar, testified on behalf of the Commonwealth that appellant, who was present and had been watching the altercation removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed the deceased one time. Further testimony for the Commonwealth was introduced to show that death was caused by a single stab wound.</p>

Although this witness did not actually see a stabbing, his testimony certainly corroborates the more detailed description of the event given by Newell. The other witness, Mr. Greene, testified that he did not see the appellant have any contact with the deceased.
