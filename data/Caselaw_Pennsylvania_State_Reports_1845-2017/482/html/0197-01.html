In <em>Haideman </em>the Commonwealth in its case-in-chief introduced the testimony of the arresting officer that after warning the defendant of his constitutional rights “[h]e didn’t say nothing; he calmed down and he shut up.” The Court, citing the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Kroslack, </em><a href="/f2d/426/1129-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="426 F.2d 1129" data-case-ids="2247089" data-case-paths="/f2d/426/1129-01">426 F.2d 1129</a> (7th Cir. 1970), reasoned: “The testimony elicited here could well have led the jury to infer guilt from defendant’s refusal to make the statement.

Up to the point when White refused to “say any more” his statement regarding the shooting of Sumpter inside the Inn had not been clearly inculpatory. Rather, it was a confusing statement purporting to describe a shooting incident, but from which it is difficult to discern exactly what White was describing. At some points it appears that White is referring to the incident inside of the Inn, but at other times, to the shooting outside the tavern. The defendant’s statement that “he had already done enough to hurt himself” could therefore quite easily have enabled the jury to draw an inference of guilt from that which White left unsaid in talking to the detective.</p>

Then he reached back like this (Indicated with right hand reaching back towards right rear pocket), I don’t know if he was going for a roscoe [a gun] or not. I pulled mine and I fired two or three times. Karen told me to run. I went to Karen’s aunt’s house at 1952 Rowan Street. Then Karen called her aunt on the phone and told her that the guy in the bar had been shot, her aunt told me and I left. Right after I had left the house the cops grabbed me. Question: What is the name of the guy that you shot? Answer: I only know him by Anthony, he lives on Rowan between Wayne and Germantown I think. I used to go with a girl on the same block. Question: Where is the gun that you had? Answer: I don’t know, I threw it when I ran out the bar. Question: How long were you in the bar before the shooting? Answer: I’ll say about fifteen minutes. Question: Was the guy that you shot the same guy that threatened you Tuesday night? Answer: No man — I just talked to Anthony Thursday and everything was all right. Question: What caused the argument between you and the guy tonight? Answer: I don’t know he said something about something that I said offending him. Question: Were you talking to Karen Young outside of the bar before the shooting? Answer: Yeah, I had gone in the bar, then I went outside and talked to Karen and to some other people and then I want back into the bar. That was the end of the statement.”</blockquote>
