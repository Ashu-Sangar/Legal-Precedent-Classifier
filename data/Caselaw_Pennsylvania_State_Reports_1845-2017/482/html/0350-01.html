It’s not an argument. It’s more of those things, . . . This is a pre-meditated, willful, deliberate killing.’ (N.T. 159-160).</blockquote>

That person would have been dead just like Gregory Davis is dead today, because Michael Wilson didn’t care who he shot that night. He was going to get somebody from Seybert Street. Michael Wilson killed Gregory Davis. He killed him premeditately, willfully, deliberately.’ (N.T. 162-163).</blockquote>

There is only one version of this case, the true version, it’s the Commonwealth’s version and that’s the only evidence in this case.” (N.T. 139).</blockquote>

Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I am sure you realize the irony of that.
