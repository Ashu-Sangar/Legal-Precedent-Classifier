      <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>The facts are as follows: On August 5, 1974 at about 8:00 p. m., appellant, then fifteen years of age, was arrested by Philadelphia police in connection with the July 20th stabbing death of another juvenile, Thomas Anthony. Following his arrest, appellant was transported to the 17th District Police Station where he remained until 9:30 p. m. at which time he was transported to the Police Administration Building (PAB). Upon arriving at the PAB, appellant was asked whether he wanted his father present; appellant stated that he did not. Sometime between 9:45 p. m. and 10:00 p. m. appellant was questioned by a Detective Paris, without first being given Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> warnings. In response, appellant indicated his name, age, residence, school grade, the fact that he could read and write, and that his parents were separated and he resided with his father; these responses were reduced to a written memorandum, which appellant read and signed. Shortly thereafter, at about 10:00 p. m., Detective Paris informed appellant of the offense in question and gave him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Appellant indicated, both orally and in writing, his desire to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At about the same time, appellant was again asked whether he wanted his father to be present; again he stated that he did not. Sometime between 10:00 p. m. and 11:00 p. m., appellant admitted his participation in the killing of Thomas Anthony. This statement was transcribed and appellant read and signed it.</p>

Although the record does not conclusively establish the exact time of appellant’s arraignment, it is safe to infer that appellant was arraigned sometime shortly after 4:00 a. m. Just before being arraigned, appellant telephoned his father, but appellant was informed by his sister that the father was already enroute to the PAB, in response to a telephone call from the Juvenile Division. Appellant’s father did arrive in time to talk to appellant at the time of arraignment.</p>

Shortly after appellant’s arrival at the PAB, the police knew where appellant resided, and that he lived with his father. In spite of this knowledge, the record shows no effort by police to contact appellant’s father before interrogating appellant about the homicide. In fact the only evidence leads to the conclusion that appellant’s father was only notified of his son’s status shortly before the arraignment, some five or six hours <em>after </em>appellant made his inculpatory statement. The only adults “consulted” by appellant prior to arraignment were police officers. The Commonwealth argues that appellant voluntarily waived his right to consult with an interested and informed adult. To accept this argument would render meaningless the protection afforded to juveniles by <em>McCutchen. </em>The essence of our doctrine relating to juvenile waiver is that the benefit of consultation with counsel or an interested, concerned and knowledgeable adult prior to a decision to waive Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights counterbalances the immaturity of the youthful accused. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, <a href="/pa/472/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="472 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1727763" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0492-01">supra.</a> </em>It is only after a meaningful consultation has taken place that it can be found that the disadvantage occasioned by the juvenile’s immaturity has <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>been offset to some degree. Since the ultimate decision, even after the consultation, must be made by the juvenile, his immaturity can not be completely removed from the equation. At best we can hope by this process to impress upon him the seriousness of the decision and to apprise him of his options and the consequences that might follow the path he elects. The Commonwealth lays great stress on the fact that appellant expressed a desire not to speak with his father. This is the type of decision that reflects the immaturity that the doctrine is designed to guard against. Obviously the appellant was more concerned with parental disapproval and failed to perceive the more important need at that moment for consulting with one who was concerned with his welfare. It is only after a meaningful consultation that we can be satisfied that the juvenile possesses an informed judgment capable of making such a grave decision. We therefore decline to adopt the argument urged by the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
