    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[232,1053,1159,926]]]'>The lengthy delay in this case was clearly established by the evidence at the suppression hearing. The repeated, lengthy interrogation of appellant, both before and after he was confronted with the fact that the gun found at the scene of the crime was traced to his brother, was deliberately designed to elicit appellant’s full confession to the crime. Police persisted in their questioning to create an atmosphere conducive to appellant’s self-incrimination. They did so despite appellant’s repeated denials over a period of sixteen hours. Sixteen and three-quarters hours elapsed from the time of arrest until appellant’s admission of possession of his brother’s gun; nineteen hours elapsed before appellant gave a full oral statement; appellant’s formal statement was not completed until twenty-three hours after arrest, and preliminary arraignment did not take place until twenty-eight and three-quarters hours after arrest. There is no room for doubt that appellant’s statements were directly related to the unnecessary, unjustified, and prejudicial delay.</p>

Conceding the validity of this approach,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> exclusion obviously can have no deterrent effect whatever on police action which took place in the past, prior to the announcement of the rule.
