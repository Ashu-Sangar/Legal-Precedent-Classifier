By this appeal we are asked to determine whether the DER has the legal authority to compel the City of Lebanon to continue with the fluoride treatment of its water supply and, if such authority exists, whether in this case the DER exercised that authority without abusing its discretion. We conclude that sufficient authority is vested in the DER by statute to prescribe continued fluoridation and that the agency’s deci<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>sion with regard to Lebanon’s proposed permit modification was a reasonable and justifiable exercise of the department’s statutory authority.</p>

In the hearings before the Environmental Hearing Board the City sought to establish that fluoride in water might have a deleterious effect on the potability of the water or the health of the consumer. The DER and the advocates of fluoridation, on the other hand, produced evidence that fluoride treatment has been successfully practiced in this country for decades, significantly reducing the incidence of dental caries among the populace, and without producing any ill effects. From our examination of the record we are satisfied that the evidence amply supports the conclusion of the DER and the Environmental Hearing Board that the fluoridation of domestic water supplies is an important means of preventing tooth decay, especially in children, and thereby of protecting the public health. Clearly, the DER had power, “for the protection of the public health,” to promulgate its regulation prohibiting the alteration of the chemical composition of water without its approval. The evidence warranted the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Board’s conclusion that actions concerning the elimination of fluoridation fall within the scope of this regulation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The Commonwealth Court suggested that in order to require continuation of fluoridation by any water supply permit holders, such as Lebanon, the DER must require that all permit holders fluoridate their water supplies, including municipalities which have never initiated such treatment. Assuming that the DER could, in the proper exercise of its authority, require all permit applicants to undertake fluoridation as a condition of obtaining a water supply permit (a question not presented by this record and <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>which we need not now consider),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> the fact that it has not enforced such a requirement does not render defective the agency’s refusal to sanction abandonment of this beneficial health measure by a permit holder whose water supply system is already capable of fluoridation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Since elimination of the fluoride component in water already containing it would arguably be prejudicial to public health, the refusal to approve such an action seems clearly to be within the DER’s statutorily vested discretion, relative to protection of public health, and neither arbitrary nor capricious, as appellee contends. In sum, we conclude that the DER’s fluoridation policy is a reasonable exercise of its statutory authority over water supply permits, and that the agency acted properly in refusing to allow the City of Lebanon to alter the formula of its water so as to cease fluoridating the municipal water supply.</p>

The generative forces of this hostility are not easily identified but have found expression in a variety of arguments. It is contended, variously, that there is a lack of statutory authority for the municipal action; that even if adequate statutory authority can be inferred, fluoridation is an abusive exercise of police power and as such is constitutionally offensive; that it prohibits the free exercise of religion by imposing medication upon those who would resist it; and that it otherwise constitutes a deprivation of personal liberties. The courts throughout the nation have been virtually unanimous in resisting these as well as other arguments, and in upholding fluoridation of drinking water as a valid public health measure whenever a challenge has been presented. . .

In the second instance, where the existing permit requires fluoridation, the applicant is seeking to change the permit and, therefore, has the burden of convincing DER that it is not prejudicial to the public health to remove the requirement.</blockquote>

The Department of Environmental Resources (DER) has never decided that drinking water is unsafe when it has been fluoridated nor has it ever decided that drinking water is unsafe when it <em>has not been </em>fluoridated. If it had ever decided the issue — either way — all drinking water in the state would have to be treated or not according to the DER’s decision. How then can it be said that the DER did not abuse its discretion? I would affirm the Commonwealth Court.</p>
