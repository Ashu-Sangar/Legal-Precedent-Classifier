On February 13, 1956, the parties executed a similar lease for two additional parcels along the Turnpike’s Northeast Extension. The monthly rental payments for the parcels were based upon a percentage of gross sales for different types of products sold at ARCO’s service stations located on the leased parcels. Payments were made monthly, with the Commission periodically auditing ARCO’s books.</p>

But it is said that the order of the lower court precludes determination of a large part of the cause of action asserted by the <em>Commission </em>— i. <em>e., </em>that portion of the claim relating to the period more than six years prior to the date of commencement of the action.

That rent is based in part upon a percentage of certain of the lessee’s gross receipts. ARCO’s answer makes it clear that the dispute is over what exact percentage of the receipts is due as rent under the leases. The complaint avers that the asserted deficiency in rental payments has been continuous since the beginning of the terms of the leases over twenty years ago. But we have no idea at this stage whether the Commission can prevail on the merits of the suit, f. e., what percentage of gross receipts is owed as rent under the leases. Our resolution of the statute of limitations question at this point is thus essentially a premature determination of the measure of damages. See <em>Safety Tire Corp. v. Hoffman Tire Co., </em><a href="/pa/458/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="458 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="479708" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0102-01">458 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20834" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="329 A.2d 834">329 A.2d 834</a> (1974). Such a determination, of course, could not be dispositive of the merits even if we were to decide the statute of limitations issue in the Commission’s favor. Since the Commission has not been precluded from proving the merits of its claim, it is not — at least not yet — out of court, and the lower court order before us is therefore interlocutory.
