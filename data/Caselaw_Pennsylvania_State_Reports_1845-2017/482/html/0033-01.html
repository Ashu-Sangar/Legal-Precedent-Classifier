Hinges on the door to the basement had been broken and eleven bicycles had been moved approximately sixty feet from an opposite wall to a point nearer the door. No burglary tools were found and no vehicle was seen in the vicinity. Following a jury trial, appellant was convicted of burglary and sentenced to eight to twenty years imprisonment. The conviction was affirmed by the Superior Court, without an opinion, and this Court granted review.</p>

The application was denied and as a result, appellant did not testify in his own behalf at trial.</p>

In <em>Bighum </em>after rejecting a request that we abrogate the practice of using prior convictions for impeachment of defendant-witnesses we endeavored to strike a balance between the competing interests by charging the trial court to weigh certain enumerated factors. These factors were designed to limit the admission of this type of evidence to situations where its introduction was of essential evidentiary value to the prosecution and not unreasonably unfair to the defense. We here reiterate, and to some extent, refine the factors that should be considered in the balancing equation. It is to be stressed that the list is not to be considered exhaustive or exclusive, but rather illustrative of the type of considerations that should influence the decision. Most importantly we stress that there must be a meaningful exercise of discretion in these cases and that the former per se rule of admissibility has been expressly repudiated. In making the determination as to the admissibility of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the trial court should consider: 1) the degree to which the commission of the prior offense reflects upon the veracity of the defendant-witness; <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> 2) the likelihood, in view of the nature and extent of the prior record, that it would have a greater tendency to smear the character of the <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>defendant and suggest a propensity to commit the crime for which he stands charged, rather than provide a legitimate reason for discrediting him as an untruthful person; 3) the age and circumstances of the defendant; 4) the strength of the prosecution’s case and the prosecution’s need to resort to this evidence as compared with the availability to the defense of other witnesses through which its version of the events surrounding the incident can be presented; and 5) the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant’s credibility.</p>

Federal Rule of Evidence, 609, distinguishes between those crimes that involve dishonesty or false statement and crimes punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. As to crimes falling within the former category, a per se rule of admissibility applies. The latter category of offenses are subjected to a balancing test to determine their admissibility.</p>

In Pennsylvania, we have traditionally accepted prior robbery convictions for impeachment purposes. We recognize, however, that this precedent was established at a time when we accepted the view that all felony convictions should be admitted for impeachment purposes. A determination of whether a <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>crime involved <em>crimen falsi </em>was formerly required only where the prior offense was a misdemeanor.
