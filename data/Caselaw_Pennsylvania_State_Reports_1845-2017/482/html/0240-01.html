On September 30,1974, Badger appeared before the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County and expressed an intention to plead guilty. The Commonwealth was then asked to detail the facts of the case. Following an oral recitation of the alleged facts by the district attorney, defense counsel challenged the accuracy of a portion of the district attorney’s summary, which implied Badger was the ringleader in the criminal transaction. Thereupon, the court asked Badger if she were admitting the facts as recited by the district attorney, and when she replied in the negative defense counsel requested permission to withdraw the guilty plea and the motion was granted.</p>

      <em>way, </em>however, like <em>Chapman </em>itself, presents quite a different situation from the one at bar. There the Court found error in the trial court’s failure to appoint a separate lawyer for each of three trial co-defendants. The error lay in the fact that the defendant’s single appointed counsel was confronted with the risk of representing conflicting interests due to receipt of confidential information from each of his three clients. The Court held that ineffectiveness of counsel in the form of representing conflicting interests could not be judged by the harmless error standard, because the evil lay “in what the advocate finds himself compelled to <em>refrain </em>from doing,” and it would therefore “be difficult to judge intelligently the impact of a conflict on the attorney’s representation of a client.” <em><a href="/us/435/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="435 U.S. 475" data-case-ids="2258" data-case-paths="/us/435/0475-01">Id.</a> </em>at <a href="/us/435/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="435 U.S. 475" data-case-ids="2258" data-case-paths="/us/435/0475-01">98 S.Ct. at 1182</a>.

The majority suggests that counsel should have requested a judge “who was not aware of the plea” to try this case, but this was not a feasible alternative. Pennsylvania’s twenty-ninth judicial district, comprised of Lycoming County, has but two judges. From the record before us it appears that Judge Raup tried Badger’s case and presided also at the jury trial of another participant in the crime. A third co-conspirator pleaded guilty and was sentenced by the only other judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County, Judge Greevy. Under the circumstances, the tentative tender of Badger’s guilty plea and the withdrawal of the plea would likely be known to Judge Greevy, who (on appellant’s theory) would also be susceptible to a charge of bias because of receiving the guilty plea of a co-conspirator. It is worthy of note in this connection that of the 59 judicial districts in Pennsylvania, 25, or fully 42%, are one-judge districts while 13 more, or 22%, are two-judge districts. Thus, 63% of our judicial districts have only one or two judges.
