The circumstances surrounding the contempt citation occurred during the dispositional phase of a juvenile delinquency proceeding. A thirteen-year-old boy named “B” was adjudicated a delinquent after he escaped from a juvenile facility and participated in a theft of four automobiles. As part of the court’s efforts to determine proper placement for the juvenile, both “B” and his mother were interviewed by various juvenile court personnel. In the course of these interviews it was learned that “B’s” mother had received inpatient psychiatric treatment at the University of Pittsburgh, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic (WPIC), on four occasions between 1964 and 1974. Based upon this information, the juvenile court’s psychiatrist, who had examined both “B” and his mother, recommended “. getting the hospital records regarding “B’s” mother and her treatment.” In response to this recommendation, the juvenile court judge wrote to WPIC requesting release of “B’s” mother’s psychiatric records. When informed by WPIC that the records would not be released without the patient’s consent, the court issued a subpoena to the Administrator of WPIC ordering him to attend a hearing on April 26, 1976, and to bring “B’s” mother’s records with him. On April 26, 1976, Dr. Roth attended the hearing on behalf of the director of WPIC, and although he had brought the appropriate documents with him, refused to release them to the Court without the patient’s consent. Dr. Roth was then adjudged in contempt of court and fined $100.00. Execution of the court’s order was stayed pending appeal.</p>

    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[192,801,1155,893]]]'>Appellant’s argument is two-fold. He first argues that a patient’s psychiatric records are privileged from judicial disclosure in a juvenile delinquency proceeding by the so-called doctor-patient privilege statute. He also contends that the patient’s constitutional right of privacy prevents disclosure of information obtained by the doctor within the confines of the doctor-patient relationship. Ordinarily, when faced with an issue raising both constitutional and non-constitutional questions, we will make a determination on non-constitutional grounds, and avoid the constitutional question if possible. <em>Commonwealth v. Staley, </em><a href="/pa/476/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="476 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1736898" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0171-01">476 Pa. 171</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="476 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="1736898" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0171-01">381 A.2d 1280</a> (1978). We conclude that the doctor-privilege statute does not prohibit disclosure of the records in this case, but that their disclosure is barred by the patient’s constitutionally protected right of privacy. We will therefore discuss both the constitutional and the non-constitutional questions raised.</p>

This distinction between “communications” and “examinations” established by <em>Phillips’ Estate, </em>is said to be based upon the purpose of the privilege statute, namely, to create a confidential atmosphere in which the patient will be encouraged to disclose all possible information bearing on his or her illness so that the physician may render effective treatment. The statutory privilege need not apply to information learned by the doctor through observation and examination because confidentiality presumably is not required for the doctor to observe and examine but confidentiality is essential if the doctor’s information is to be obtained from the patient’s communications.</p>

Accepting, arguendo, this characterization of the “blackening” requirement, I cannot conclude, as does Mr. Justice Manderino, that “psychiatric treatment does not evidence the existence of such a condition,” p. 423, or that it does not tend to be evidence that such a condition exists.</p>

It is indeed the exception to find a physical condition which is, or is viewed to be, caused by morally opprobrious conduct or thought.
