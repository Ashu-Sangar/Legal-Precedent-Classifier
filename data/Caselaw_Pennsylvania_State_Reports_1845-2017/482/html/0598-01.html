On March 8,1975, appellant was tending bar at Ed and Mickey’s Chaise Lounge Bar in North Philadelphia. At various times during the day, the victim, <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>Ernest Harville, had been in the bar arguing with appellant about Selena Harris, who evidently had been seeing both men. During these arguments, the victim told appellant, “Either you’re going to kill me or I’m sure as hell going to kill you.”</p>
    <p id="b633-5" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[191,573,1151,253]]]'>At approximately 11:00 p. m., appellant received a phone call from Ms. Harris telling him that Harville had been to her apartment with a gun stating that he was going to kill appellant. After receiving this call, appellant took a gun from behind the bar and placed it in his back pocket.</p>
    <p id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.6",633,[191,845,1152,244]]]'>Shortly thereafter, the victim arrived at the bar, but various patrons prevented him from entering. At that time, Ms. Harris called the bar and asked to speak with the victim. Harville was allowed to enter the bar and went into a phone booth.</p>

As he approached the booth, he heard the victim state, “Here comes [Jarvis] now. I’m going to blow his . brains out.” Because appellant thought that the victim was reaching for a gun, he pulled his own weapon and shot the victim three times. The victim died as a result of these wounds.</p>

In <em>Moore, </em>however, the defendant, in addition to requesting consolidation, specifically requested that the court charge the jury that involuntary manslaughter was a permissible verdict. In the instant case, no such request accompanied appellant’s motion to consolidate.
