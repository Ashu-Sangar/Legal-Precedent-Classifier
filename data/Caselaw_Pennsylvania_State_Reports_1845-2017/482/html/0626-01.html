After a degree of guilt hearing, appellant was convicted of murder of the second degree and on November 2, 1976, was sentenced to life imprisonment. New counsel was appointed to assist appellant in taking an appeal. On August 15, 1977, we remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence County for an evidentiary hearing on effectiveness of trial counsel and to allow appellant to file a petition to withdraw his guilty plea as if timely filed. After a consolidated hearing pursuant to both orders, the trial court denied appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and held that trial counsel was not ineffective.

Employing the same language quoted above, the indictment clearly stated that the specific conduct which appellant later in the colloquy admitted to was the cause of Mrs. Merriman’s death on the night in question.

We find no merit in this claim. The discussion centered around whether the death sentence could be imposed upon a defendant who was convicted of murder of the first degree after pleading guilty. There was clearly cause for confusion since a change in the Rules of Criminal Procedure was to become effective between the time appellant entered his plea and the time sentencing would take place. The trial court apparently reached the conclusion that the new rule, allowing capital punishment after a guilty plea, would be inapplicable to appellant’s case and clearly informed appellant that the maximum sentence that could be imposed would be life imprisonment even if he was found guilty of murder of the first degree at the evidentiary hearing. Appellant indicated on the record that he understood. Thus the colloquy adequately demonstrated that appellant understood the range of sentences to which he was subject. Compare <em>Commonwealth v.

All of these claims address areas of inquiry not expressly required by the comment to Rule 319(a) which sets forth the minimum requirements for a guilty plea colloquy.

On this record we reject appellant’s claim. Neither the comment to Rule 319(a) nor our case law requires that specific inquiry be made into this area. Moreover, the colloquy clearly instructed appellant that, as well as giving up his right to trial by jury, he was waiving the rights otherwise associated with trial. Appellant was properly informed that he was waiving his right to go to trial, his right to the presumption of innocence, his privilege against self-incrimination, the right to call and confront witnesses and to compel them to testify if necessary, and the right to enter a plea of not guilty.</p>

Appellant’s contention that this portion of the colloquy was misleading as to his rights at the degree of guilt hearing must also fail.

A guilty plea is a waiver of those rights associated with trial. Knowledge of the extent of appellate rights is not necessary to validate such a waiver. The absence of this information in the colloquy, therefore, did not render appellant’s plea unknowing or involuntary. Appellant was properly instructed as to his appellate rights and the procedure for pursuing them at his sentencing. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 1405(c).</p>

Finally, appellant was instructed that should the trial court fail to accept the terms of the plea bargain agreement and find that he was guilty of murder of the first degree he would be entitled to withdraw his plea as of right pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319(b)(3) (“If thereafter the judge decides not to concur in the plea agreement, he shall permit the defendant to withdraw his plea.”).</p>

In the absence of any allegation that the validity of appellant’s plea was actually affected by either of these factors, these claims are without merit. Also without merit is appellant’s contention that the court failed to inquire into appellant’s background to ascertain whether his education was adequate for him to understand the proceedings. In response to specific questions put to him early in the colloquy appellant stated that he was nineteen and had left school two years earlier while in the eleventh grade. Finally, appellant alleges that the colloquy was defective in failing to demonstrate that he voluntarily, intelligently, and understandingly waived his constitutional rights. The foregoing discussion and the twenty-two page transcript of the colloquy clearly reveal that appellant’s plea was entered voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly.

Appellant claims that the statement that the markings were “believed” identical is insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.

Trial counsel testified that upon learning that appellant had been drinking and using drugs prior to the burglary and homicide they researched the law relating to voluntary intoxication. In the course of their research they discovered that under 18 Pa.C.S.A § 308 voluntary intoxication or drugged condition is not a defense to a criminal charge but may be offered into evidence to reduce murder from a higher to lower degree. Appellant admits that the statute was explained to him prior to the entry of his guilty plea. He alleges, however, that trial counsel never discussed with him the use of intoxication as a mitigating factor at the degree of guilt hearing and that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to introduce evidence of his intoxication at that time. At the degree of guilt hearing counsel attempted to cross-examine Gene Reno on the question of whether appellant was intoxicated. Reno, however, was extremely uncooperative and the line of questioning proved to be fruitless. At the evidentiary hearing on ineffectiveness, trial counsel testified that they believed they could go no further in proving intoxication or drugged condition since appellant refused to testify at the degree of guilt hearing.

They further indicated, however, that capital punishment was unlikely since appellant’s age constituted a mitigating circumstance under the statute. Appellant was also told that it was possible the death penalty was unconstitutional.</p>

He claims that the threat of an unconstitutional death penalty made his decision one that was not knowing and intelligent. He urges that an intelligent decision was impossible in the absence of pre-trial determination of the constitutionality of <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>the death sentence. Thus, appellant argues that trial counsels’ failure to attack the constitutionality of the death penalty by pre-trial motion rendered his guilty plea invalid. It is true that counsel did not challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty by pre-trial motion. But appellant has failed to demonstrate that his plea was induced by counsels’ inaction. Rather, the record supports the conclusion that the plea was the product of a number of considerations. Appellant’s plea was motivated by his belief that he would obtain parole at an earlier date by pleading guilty and counsels’ advice that conviction of murder of the first degree was probable, as well as by his desire to avoid the threat of the death penalty. Thus, we cannot say that appellant’s plea of guilty was induced by counsels’ failure to attack the constitutionality of the death sentence pre-trial. Compare <em>Commonwealth v.
