He arrived at the Police Administration Building at 5:55 a. m. and at 6:00 a. m., the police warned appellant of his constitutional rights and of the charges against him. The police questioned appellant between 6:00 a. m. and 9:10 a. m. and during this interrogation, appellant made statements indicating that he did not shoot Earl Blake. To verify this and with appellant’s consent, a polygraph examination was conducted from 9:10 a. m. to 1:30 p. m. At 1:30 p. m., appellant was informed that he failed the polygraph examination. Appellant was rewarned of his constitutional rights and at 1:55 p. m., appellant admitted shooting Earl Blake. Between 2:10 p. m. and 2:40 p. m., appellant gave a written statement. He was subsequently arraigned.</p>

At 5:45 p. m., appellant’s questioning was resumed, with an oral admission coming at 6:10 p. m. Under these facts, we conclude that appellant’s delay in arraignment was caused by a necessary step in the police process, the checking of his story, a reason sanctioned by this court in our <em>Futch </em>decision.”</blockquote>

At that time he gave a statement and took a polygraph test. On August 13, appellant contended that he did not remember shooting Earl Blake. Appellant was released later that day. This statement on August 13 was similar to appellant’s initial statement of August 20, that he did not remember shooting Earl Blake.</p>
