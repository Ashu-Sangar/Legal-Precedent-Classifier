The two proceeded to a washroom in the rear of the bar where they remained for a few minutes. When the two came out of the washroom, they proceeded toward the front of the bar. As James Holmes passed a patron, Jessie Wallace, he pointed a gun at Wallace’s head and said: “This is a stickup.” James Holmes then seized Wallace. When several female patrons began to scream, Petty ran toward the front door. James Holmes began to pull Wallace toward the front door. He then fired a shot at Petty and turned toward Wallace, who was falling to the floor, and fired a shot at him. The first shot struck Petty; the second struck Holmes’ hand and then Wallace. Both Petty and James Holmes then fled the bar.</p>

But in determining the sufficiency of the evidence, we must, as previously mentioned, view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth v.

And I says no I ain’t go’ne in nowhere, take me home . . . . Petty [then] say, I’ll go with you.” Appellant knew his brother had a gun. When the car arrived at a restaurant on West Oak Lane, James Holmes and Petty left the car and entered the restaurant to “make some money.” They returned to the car without doing so because the restaurant was too crowded. The four then proceeded to a friend’s residence to borrow money, but the friend was not home. They then proceeded “around the corner to where the [two] bars” were located. James Holmes entered one of the bars by himself “to see if [he could] get some money . . . .” He came back out and Petty then entered with him. They remained in the bar for five minutes and then returned to the car. Either Petty or James Holmes then remarked: “We gonna take this other bar across the street.” They entered that bar and the attempted robbery and shooting, previously related, took place.</p>

The remaining three went to a hospital where Petty and appellant entered. Rob departed in the car. Later, appellant was informed by someone at the hospital that Petty was dead.</p>
