By exercising the statutory option of imposing a period of probation in lieu of sentencing, the court defers sentencing a defendant to a fixed term of imprisonment until such time as the defendant has violated the conditions of his probation. In other words, the setting of the term of probation is not a term of sentence, and may not act as a limitation on the court to impose a sentence for a term of years greater than the probationary period, not in excess of the maximum fixed by law for the particular offense. The sentence imposed by the court in the instant case — a period of imprisonment of not less than three years nor more than ten years — was within the court’s power as authorized by law.

The issue then is whether a previously vacated sentence which is replaced by probation puts any limitation upon a trial court should the probation later be revoked due <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>to violation of its terms and the defendant subjected to resentencing. In answering this question we find the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">supra,</a> </em>instructive. The Supreme Court there held that where a conviction is reversed and vacated upon appeal, neither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposes an absolute bar to a more severe penalty upon reconviction. The Court went on to conclude, however, that where a more severe sentence is imposed following reconviction, the reasons for the enhancement, based upon “ . . . identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding,” <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">395 U.S. at 726</a>, <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">89 S.Ct. at 2081</a>, <a href="/us/395/0711-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="395 U.S. 711" data-case-ids="1772134" data-case-paths="/us/395/0711-01">23 L.Ed.2d at 670</a>, must affirmatively appear in the record.

This conclusion flows logically from the initial premise that a “vacated” sentence is of no legal effect. Moreover, any fear that a possibility of enhanced punishment will chill a defendant’s option to seek modification of a sentence pursuant to 12 P.S. § 1032, <em>supra, </em>n.10, is offset by a requirement that any such enhancement be justified by the defendant’s conduct subsequent to the original sentencing.</p>
