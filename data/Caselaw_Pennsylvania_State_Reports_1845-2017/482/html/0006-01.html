The Commonwealth attempted to rearrest the defendant by filing a petition before another judge of the Court of Common Pleas. The second judge denied the petition without a hearing, believing <em>res judicata </em>precluded him from reversing another judge of the same court. This court affirmed, but only because the “motion to quash” was actually a <em>habeas corpus </em>action, which decision was appealable.
