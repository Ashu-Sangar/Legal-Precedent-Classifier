As a means of enforcing the public meetings requirement, the Open Meeting Law also provides — in language again made applicable to the judiciary under 42 Pa.C.S. § 1703— that “[n]o formal action shall be valid unless such formal action is taken during a public meeting,” 65 P.S. § 262, and declares that “[a]ny member of any agency who participates in a meeting or hearing knowing that it is being held or conducted in such a way to intentionally prevent an interest<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>ed party from attending or with the intent and purpose of violating this act is guilty of a summary offense and upon conviction thereof shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding $100 plus costs of prosecution.” 65 P.S. § 268.</p>

While judicial rule-making power may well have been inherent in the constitutional scheme,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the explicit grant of rule-making authority to the judiciary came from the General Assembly.

As distinguished from the situation in other jurisdictions in which statutory provisions articulated schemes explicitly envisioning joint legislative and judicial activity in rule promulgation, see, e. g., <a href="/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 U.S.C. § 2072">28 U.S.C. § 2072</a>, the Pennsylvania provision delegated the entire procedural rule-making authority with respect to civil actions to the Supreme Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The breadth of this delegation is suggested by the closing paragraph of the statute, providing that “[f]rom and after the effective date of any rule promulgated under this Section . . . the operation of any act of Assembly relating to practice or procedure . . and inconsistent with such rule, shall be suspended insofar as such act may be inconsistent with such rule.” 17 P.S. § 61. Thus, under the statutory provision, procedural rules promulgated by the Supreme Court, without the participation of the legislature, had the full force of law.

And in 1968 this already somewhat dormant issue became moot. It was in that year that the Judiciary Article of the Pennsylvania Constitution was altered to grant the Supreme Court in Article V, § 10(c) “the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts.” See note 3, <em><a href="/citations/?q=245%20A.2d%20238" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="245 A.2d 238">supra.</a> </em>Section 10(c) further provides, very much like 17 P.S. § 61, that “[a]ll laws shall be suspended to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under [this] provision.” While the new Judiciary Article, given the breadth of the grant in 17 P.S. § 61, may have had only a limited impact on the <em>extent </em>of the Supreme Court’s rule-making authority, it established the <em>source </em>of that authority — that source, after 1968, is unquestionably the Constitution.</p>

For once it becomes clear — as it surely is now— that the rule-making power is vested by the Constitution in the judiciary, any legislative intrusion into that power must be viewed with the greatest of skepticism. And an intrusion which threatens members of the Supreme Court with summary offense sanctions simply for conducting their rule-making deliberations in the ways that they have for years in the past conducted them, is serious enough to constitute a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.</p>

    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[197,653,1156,1279]]]'>The major response to this argument is that there is simply no substantial support for the proposition that the grant of authority in Article V, § 10(c) is anything other than exclusive. Particularly when the constitutional provision is viewed against the background of its predecessor statute, i. e., 17 P.S. § 61, which itself delegated such a broad scope of authority to the Supreme Court, it would be anomalous to conclude that Section 10(c) is nothing more than a grant of concurrent power. Moreover, the constitutional provision’s explicit statement, see page 4, <em><a href="/citations/?q=245%20A.2d%20238" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="245 A.2d 238">supra,</a> </em>that court-made rules will prevail against any statutes that might be inconsistent with them would be incongruous with a scheme in which the legislature exercised concurrent rule-making power.

In a somewhat related argument, it could be urged that insofar as it protects the judiciary, the separation of powers doctrine only protects that branch against incursions into its control and conduct of actual pieces of adversary litigation and that the doctrine is inapplicable in situations in which the Supreme Court is exercising “non-judicial” (i. e., rule-making) powers. Adopting this argument would allow one readily to accept the long line of cases holding <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>that the General Assembly may not impair final judgments, or otherwise interfere with the course of ongoing or completed litigation, see, e. g., <em>Leahey v.

First, there is convincing support for the proposition that the rule-making power is “judicial” in nature. Dean Roscoe Pound, for instance, observed that “procedure of courts is something that belongs to the courts rather than to the legislature, whether we look at the subject analytically or historically” and concluded that “if anything was received from England as a part of our institutions, it was that the making of . general rules of practice was a <em>judicial </em>function.” R.

Most prominently, it has been recognized for many years that regulating bar admissions and disciplining members of the bar are as much judicial functions and as protected against legislative incursion as are, for instance, adjudications issued in traditional adversary litigation. As this Court has noted, “The admission of an attorney to practice before a court is a judicial act . . . [and] [a] statute which would constitute an encroachment on that function ‘must be regarded as a vain attempt by the Legislature to exercise a power which it does not possess.’ ” <em>In re Shigon, </em><a href="/pa/462/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="462 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="485221" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0001-01">462 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="462 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="485221" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0001-01">329 A.2d 235</a>, 240 n.14 (1974), and cases cited therein. It is clear, therefore, that the separation of powers doctrine protects more in <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>the judiciary than the conduct of litigation; given the explicit mention of rule-making in the Constitution, it would be unreasonable to conclude that that power does not enjoy the doctrine’s protection.</p>

Even if one accepts (a) the exclusivity of the judiciary’s rule-making power as provided in Article V, § 10(c) of the Constitution, and (b) the applicability of the separation of powers doctrine to the rule-making area, it could be argued that Section 1703 represents no incursion into the judiciary’s rule-making authority. Section 1703, it could be urged, does not mandate the promulgation or defeat of any particular rule. Rather, according to this argument, it simply provides a procedure which the Supreme Court must follow in its consideration of proposed rules and, as such, does not intrude on the powers granted the judiciary by Article V, § 10(c).</p>

In the absence of any language indicating otherwise, there is no reason to think that the power “to prescribe” rules does not carry with it the power to decide <em>how </em>rules are prescribed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> If the Constitution’s draftsmen had intended to allow the General Assembly to prescribe the method by which the Supreme Court would promulgate rules, one would have expected that they would have explicitly so provided.

For such power injects the General Assembly in a pervasive and insistent fashion into the carrying out of what the Constitution has explicitly established as a judicial function. Even if one were to ignore the potentially significant relationship between methods of promulgating rules and the rules that finally emerge, the General Assembly’s insertion of itself into the structure of the rule-making process is inconsistent with the mandate of the separation of powers doctrine that the judiciary be kept “a separate, distinct and independent entity in government.” <em>Commonwealth v.

This legislative grant of power to the Supreme Court was originally made in the Act of June 21, 1937, P.L.1982, No. 392, and was amended by the Act of March 30, 1939, P.L. 14, and the Act of August 25, 1959, P.L. 751. The grant, codified as 17 P.S. § 61, was repealed by Section 2 of the Judiciary Act Repealer Act, No. 1978-53. For purposes of convenience, we will refer to the provision, even though repealed, as 17 P.S. § 61.</p>

Of course, if one concludes that what is a “judicial power” is to be defined by the Constitution and not by an abstract analysis of what functions are peculiarly “judicial” in nature, then, in light of Article V, § 10(c), the rule-making power would clearly be classified as . “judicial.”</p>

This proposition could be tested by imagining that the Supreme Court promulgated a set of rules explicitly setting forth the procedure by which it would carry out its rule-making responsibilities. It would be difficult to conclude that this set of rules did not appropriately come within the Supreme Court’s power under Article V, § 10(c).</p>

It is of particular interest that Florida, the state which moved earliest and which is generally regarded as the most progressive in the area of expansive Open Meeting Laws, see Wickham, <em>Let the Sun Shine In, </em>68 N.W.L.Rev. 480, 491 (1973), has itself excluded the judiciary from the scope of its act’s coverage. See Fla.Stat.Ann. 286.011, Fla.Op.Att.Gen. 071-32. And the Supreme Court of Florida has suggested that this exclusion is mandated by the separation of powers doctrine. <em>Canney v.
