(Benson), an engineering and construction firm, designed and built two cooling towers at the Philadelphia Electric Corporation’s Limerick power plant near Pottstown, Pennsylvania.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Benson was assessed a use tax by appellee, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on certain items and material used in the construction of the cooling towers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In August and September of 1972, the Commonwealth completed an audit of Benson’s business activities in connection with the construction of the Limerick cooling towers. As a result of this audit, Benson was assessed $3,206.03. This amount represented the Commonwealth’s determination of Benson’s deficiency in the use tax payable to the Commonwealth. Benson filed a petition for reassessment with the Commonwealth Sales Tax Board of Review, contesting $582.80 out of the $3,206.03 deficiency sought by the Commonwealth. The Sales Tax Board of Review denied Benson’s petition. Benson then sought relief by filing a petition for review with the Board of Finance and Revenue. The Board of Finance and Revenue deter<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>mined that of the $582.80 contested by Benson, $161.78 was mistakenly assessed as due and owing delinquent use tax. Benson then appealed to the Commonwealth Court. On November 24, 1976, Commonwealth Court granted Benson additional tax relief in the amount of $13.91, thereby reducing the amount in controversy before this court to $407.11. On December 22, 1976, Benson filed exceptions to the Commonwealth Court’s order, and on December 23, 1977, the Commonwealth filed exceptions contesting the continued validity of <em>Commonwealth v.

The last paragraph of Section 201 (o )(4)(B) does list exceptions to the granting of the exemption, however these exceptions must be read in conjunction with the previous language granting the exemption. The interpretation of the exceptions employed by the majority requiring all materials or supplies to be “affixed” strips the general exemption of any rational meaning.</p>
