This instrument is listed under that title in the Index to Record at p.i thereof. At the end of this paper appears the printed name of “Ammon K. Graybill, Jr., President, Ammon K. Graybill, Jr., Inc.

There follows a statement, purportedly signed by E. E.

No such “Consent Order and Decree” is to be found in the original record submitted to us in this case. So far as appears, this paper was not before the Commonwealth Court, and it clearly was not the “Exhibit A” which was attached to the petition for enforcement.

Most <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>recently, this Court unanimously concluded that a party aggrieved by the action of an arbitrator under The Public Employee Relations Act cannot postpone until enforcement proceedings a challenge to the arbitrator’s award. <em>Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/478/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="478 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1740575" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0582-01">478 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/pa/478/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="478 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1740575" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0582-01">387 A.2d 475</a> (1978) (permitting the aggrieved party to “refuse to abide by [the terms of the award] . . . forces the party in whose favor the arbitrator originally ruled to seek enforcement of the award [under an Act 195] enforcement action”). Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v. Derry Township, </em><a href="/pa/466/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="466 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1714996" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0031-01">466 Pa. 31</a>, 39, <a href="/pa/466/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="466 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="1714996" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0031-01">351 A.2d 606</a>, 610 (1976), we held that “[t]he failure to appeal [an order of the Department of Environmental Resources] made that order final and foreclosed any attack on its content or validity in the [subsequent] enforcement proceedings.” In light of these decisions interpreting legislative schemes comparable to the Human Relations Act, Graybill’s attack on the validity of the PHRC’s Consent Order and Decree in enforcement proceedings should be foreclosed.</p>
