Fairhill and the involvement of his brothers in the fire at 2927 N. Fairhill. Subsequently, when police learned of appellant’s possible involvement in both fires, he was again given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and was told that he was being questioned about possible involvement in both fires.

However, members of the jury, with respect to the closing argument of the District Attorney, I want to say this to you: During the course of his argument, the District Attorney made a reference to the defendant’s lack of remorse. It was highly improper for him to do this. And if you recall, I stopped him at that point and directed him to confine his argument to the facts of the case. It was highly improper for the District Attorney to have made a statement of this kind because it assumes that the defendant is already guilty whereas the defendant is presumed to be innocent unless and until such time as the jury decides otherwise. It is solely your function to make this decision and not the District Attorney’s and it was improper for him to attempt to usurp your function in this regard. You must not be influenced by this improper argument of the District Attorney.

When the trial judge is confronted with gruesome or potentially inflammatory photographs, the test for determining their admissibility which he must apply is ‘whether or not the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.’ <em>Commonwealth v.

Rather, they simply showed burned floors, walls, steps, and ceilings. One of appellant’s theories was that the fire was not of an incendiary origin. Captain Charles Lewis, Assistant Fire Marshall, testified, however, that the fire had been set. He used the photos to show burn patterns which buttressed his conclusion. As the photographs were not inflammatory and yet were highly relevant, we find no error in their admission.</p>
