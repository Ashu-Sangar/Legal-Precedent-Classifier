The point in common in the two cases is that in Pennsylvania both admission to the bar examination and admission to the bar “on motion” under the comity rule are premised upon the applicant possessing a law degree from an approved law school. Murphy graduated from Western State University College of Law of Orange County, Fullerton, California<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>; Acker graduated in 1955 from Youngstown State University <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>School of Law, Youngstown, Ohio.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Neither institution is accredited under our rules because neither has received ABA accreditation and it was for this reason that the Board took the action it did in each case.

We could have decided to determine the adequacy of the legal education of an applicant through our own investigative machinery.

The exception noted above is the State of Indiana. The Supreme Court of that state now recognizes a law degree earned from a law school which is approved by the state in which the school is located, whether or not the school was ABA approved. With all respect to the action of our sister state, this seems to us to be carrying the concept of full faith and credit to an unjustified extreme, for the net effect is to permit a jurisdiction having the lowest educational criteria determine who may sit for the bar examination in Indiana.

Without written criteria to be met by the schools involved and without an established system of inspection and evaluation, plus periodic reevaluation, the approval would be on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, without any of the standards which all agree are essential. With such an established system for Pennsylvania, it would seem that we would merely be duplicating the <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>ABA program, unless, of course, we wished to make the standards either more stringent or less stringent than the ABA standards.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a> No one has advanced to us any argument that either variant is presently necessary or desirable.

Mr. Justice MANDERINO, in his dissenting opinion, speaks also of the “glaringly apparent” inequity of the Rule requiring accreditation. The nature of the inequity is not spelled out, presumably because it is “apparent.” It is unclear to us, however, wherein this inequity lies. It surely cannot be found in the fact that, as appellant alleges, the California Committee of Bar Examiners has seen fit to accredit Murphy’s school within California, and that this has been accepted as sufficient by several other California state groups, other proprietary law schools and certain federal departments.</p>
