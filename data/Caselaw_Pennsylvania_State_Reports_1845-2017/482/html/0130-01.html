      <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>On the date of Price’s death, appellant, Moody and Griff in. were all inmates of D Block, a maximum security area of Holmesburg Prison. The inmates of D Block were not permitted to leave it, nor were other inmates permitted to enter it without an institutional escort. Price was seen alive at 8 a. m. on the date of his death. At 3:15 p. m. that day, Philip Harris, a guard, found Price’s dead body in a vacant cell while making a routine check. The body was hanging by a sheet from the grating of a ventilator. Dr. Halbert Fillinger, Assistant Philadelphia Medical Examiner, examined the body and found that death resulted from strangulation by a ligature consisting of three shoelaces braided together. The ligature was wrapped tightly around Price’s neck when the body was discovered. Fillinger also noted that the victim had been tortured with a sharp instrument prior to death. After the body was discovered, all of the inmates on D Block were locked in their cells. One of the inmates, Calvin Hunter, called Harris over to his cell and said, “They killed that guy back there, didn’t they?” Hunter gave information about the killing to the authorities and testified at a preliminary hearing. At that hearing, Hunter testified that while locked in his cell on the day of the incident, he saw appellant, Moody, Griffin and Price walk by in the direction of the vacant cell. He then heard someone yell several times, “Help, they’re killing me.” Appellant, Moody and Griffin then walked by Hunter’s cell without the decedent. Hunter died before appellant’s trial and the court, therefore, admitted his preliminary hearing testimony into evidence. The foregoing evidence supports the verdict of murder of the first degree.</p>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.5",166,[226,1934,1157,257]]]'>Appellant next alleges errors at trial. One of his allegations was that it was error to admit evidence showing that he was convicted, along with three other inmates, of murdering Samuel Molten in Holmesburg Prison on August 15, 1973. We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[226,2215,1158,148]],["BL_167.1",167,[246,310,1153,899]]]'>The evidence at appellant’s trial for Molten’s murder indicated that appellant and his co-defendants at that trial were members of the Nation of Islam, a religious sect <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>commonly known as the Black Muslims. Appellant had the title of Lieutenant within the sect. This position gave him responsibility for the enforcement of its tenets. Molten was murdered because he made derogatory remarks about Elijah Muhammed, the founder of the Nation of Islam. The evidence in the instant case also establishes appellant’s position as a Lieutenant in the Black Muslims. The evidence further shows that Price was co-operating with federal authorities in the District of Columbia who were prosecuting a case involving the killing of seven members of Hanafi Muslims, a rival group to the Black Muslims. Price implicated seven Black Muslims in that case, including Moody and Griffin. There is evidence that the decedent was killed because of his co-operation in the Hanafi Muslim case. The court below admitted the evidence of the prior conviction on the basis that it was relevant to show a motive for the killing of Price. The court’s action was correct.</p>

The sixteen months that elapsed between them is not excessive in this case because appellant remained in prison and the circumstances did not significantly differ. There was a similarity in motive in that both crimes were in retaliation for the victims’ actions that displeased the Black Muslims. The evidence was admissible.</p>

We do not agree. If a witness at a preliminary hearing testifies under oath and is subject to cross-examination, the notes of testimony may constitution<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>ally be admitted at a subsequent trial if the witness is unavailable. <em>California v.

Hunter was under oath at the preliminary hearing and appellant and his co-defendants were present and each had his own attorney. All three defense attorneys cross-examined Hunter. The death of a witness is sufficient to allow the introduction of testimony from a preliminary hearing. <em>Commonwealth v.
