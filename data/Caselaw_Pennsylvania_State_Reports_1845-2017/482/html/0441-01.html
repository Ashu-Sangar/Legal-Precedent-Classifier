On June 2, 1969, appellant’s five year old son, Leonard, entered Mercy Catholic Medical Center for a tonsillectomy. The medical records indicate that on the day of the operation he was in excellent health. In preparation for the surgery, Leonard was placed under anesthesia. A nurse anesthetist negligently administered the anesthesia. As a result, Leonard’s heart stopped beating for a period of between four and twenty minutes. When the doctor who was to perform the operation arrived in the operating room, <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>he quickly revived Leonard’s heartbeat.

If we were seeking to compensate for the loss of life itself, it may be true that the best approximation of the value of that life could be cast in terms of an individual’s personal <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>maintenance costs.

We discern little or no distinction between seeking to calculate the value of “life itself” and the value of experiencing life’s pleasures. Were we to permit compensation for loss of “life itself”, undoubtedly this intangible item would have to be measured in terms of the loss of those very opportunities to enjoy family, work, and recreation the trial court directed the jury to consider in measuring the loss of life’s pleasures. Thus, to permit a jury to award damages to the estate for the decedent’s loss of life’s pleasures in effect authorizes a type of recovery expressly repudiated in <em>Incollingo.</em>

Indeed, the two types of loss are interrelated. As this Court stated in <em>Corcoran v.

    <p id="b479-7" data-blocks='[["BL_479.8",479,[214,1744,1154,626]]]'>Thus, to a large extent it has been the plaintiff’s consciousness of his or her inability to enjoy life that we have compensated under the rubric of “loss of life’s pleasures”. Unlike one who is permanently injured, one who dies as a result of injuries is not condemned to watch life’s amenities pass by. Unless we are to equate loss of life’s pleasures with loss of life itself, we must view it as something that is compensable only for a living plaintiff who has suffered from that loss. It follows that, under <em>Incollingo, </em>damages for the pain and suffering that may flow from the loss of life’s pleasures should only be recovered for the period of time between the accident and the decedent’s death.</p>

Therefore, the lower court’s statement of the law was erroneous. We resist the lower court’s attempt to expand the right of recovery in wrongful death and survival actions to include loss of life’s amenities. The problem of translating the loss resulting from an accident into money damages is always a complex and often imprecise calculation. However, our courts and legislature have established some guidelines to assist the jury in compensating loss — loss of life’s pleasures or amenities is simply not one of the elements of recovery in wrongful death and survival actions.”</blockquote>

Defendant hospital’s original complaint against additional defendant Go alleged a cause of action based <em>solely </em>on Go’s individual negligence. In its attempted amended complaint, defendant hospital alleged that a nurse negligently treated decedent in defendant hospital while acting in her capacity as an employee of Go and therefore, Go was vicariously liable for said nurse’s negligence.

Plaintiff then requested the court to submit special interrogatories to the jury so that the jury would segregate any damages awarded for “loss of life’s pleasures” from all other damages. Counsel for defendant hospital objected to the special interrogatories and the court refused to submit the interrogatories. Plaintiff contends this should act as a waiver of defendant’s right to appeal the court’s charge because the special interrogatories would have allowed an easy cure to any possible error as opposed to the necessity of a new trial on the issue of damages if Superior Court is correct. Plaintiff is wrong. The record indicates that the judge would have refused the request for special interrogatories no matter what the defendant did. Finally, the waiver argument is very tenuous, at best.</p>
