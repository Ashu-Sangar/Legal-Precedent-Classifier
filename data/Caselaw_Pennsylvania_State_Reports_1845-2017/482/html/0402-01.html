On May 28, 1974, as was his custom, appellee left the store for lunch and on return to resume his duties, parked his car in a lot provided by his employer. The employee was required to park his vehicle in this parking lot by order of his employer. A contiguous parking lot was reserved for customers of the store and the employees were directed not to use it. To reach the store from the lot it was necessary to traverse the public highway. As Mr. Hreha was crossing the highway upon his return from lunch, he was struck by an automobile and sustained injuries for which he claimed compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, art. 1, § 101 et seq., as amended, 77 P.S. § 1 et seq. (Supp.1978-79).</p>
