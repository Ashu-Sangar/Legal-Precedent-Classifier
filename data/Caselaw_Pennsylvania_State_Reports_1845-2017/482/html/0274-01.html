This is because my disagreement with the <em>Garcia </em>rationale was based on that opinion’s view that evidence in a murder prosecution could <em>always </em>be taken by a rational trier of fact to prove nothing more than involuntary manslaughter, an argument that I find quite unpersuasive. See 482 Pa. at 323-325,393 A.2d at 1127-1128. Two propositions seem to me to be established by the <em>Polimeni </em>and <em>Garcia </em>opinions: (1) that the same evidence may be interpreted by the fact-finder to establish two somewhat different mental states, and (2) that the difference in these mental states is not thought to be controlling for purposes of determining whether involuntary manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder. If this be so, then the differing mental states accompanying entry of a building in burglary and criminal trespass (viz., volitional entry as opposed to knowledge of the lack of license or privilege in that entry) should not be controlling, either.</p>

It should be noted that the legislature’s modifications of the criminal trespass provisions of the Model Code, <em>see </em>note 17, <em>supra, </em>lend no aid to the majority’s théory. If it were otherwise, then the Model Code’s guidelines for the determination of lesser included offenses would have no place in the area of criminal homicide, where the legislature did not adopt other significant parts of the Model Code’s formulation. <em>See generally </em>Toll, <em>supra </em>note 17, at 308-17; Model Penal Code §§ 210.2-210.5 (Proposed Official Draft, 1962).</p>

Since I believe that criminal trespass is a lesser included offense of burglary, I necessarily reject the majority’s argument that the convictions here deprived appellants of due process because they were not informed of this charge in the indictments. It might be mentioned in passing, moreover, that each of the indictments in these cases charged that the defendant “feloniously did enter” a certain building. It thus may be arguable that although they did not spell but scienter, these indictments nonetheless provided appellants with fair notice that they were being charged with something more than mere entry.
