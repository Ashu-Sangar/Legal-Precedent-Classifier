Epler, was employed by North American Rockwell Corporation as a laborer and machine operator in its foundry. On the afternoon of May 19, 1972, decedent parked his car in a lot provided by his employer for employees who drove to work. The municipality in which employer’s plant was located had banned on-street parking in the vicinity of the plant, and thereby, required the employer to provide off-street parking facilities for its employees. The employer then established a pecking order in the allocation of off-street parking facilities, allowing managerial and supervisory personnel to park at a site contiguous to the plant while relegating other classes of employees, such as Mr. Epler, to an unpaved lot located across a public street, Park Road, adjoining the employer’s plant. The pecking order for the most desirable contiguous parking places was established by the issuance of parking lot permits to limit access to contiguous places to designated employees. Violation of employer’s directives as to where to park would result in warnings to the employee and disciplinary action for repeated violations.</p>

May 20, 1972, Mr. Epler after saying goodnight to the guard at the gate of the plant, proceeded across Park Road heading toward his car where he had parked in the designated lot on the other side of the public thoroughfare. As he was crossing the road, Mr. Epler was struck and killed by one or two automobiles somewhere near the middle of the road at about 12:38 a. m. It was customary for foundry workers to wash up, take a shower, and change clothes after completion of the shift, and the decedent had apparently done this on the day of the accident since his soiled work clothes were found in a bundle in the roadway.</p>

The Commonwealth Court has properly held that the fact that a parking lot is separated from the employer’s actual business operations or plant by a public thoroughfare is of no significance in determining whether the lot can be considered the employer’s “premises” within the intendment of the Act. <em>IngersollRand Company v.

    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[229,1442,1163,889]]]'>Here there can be no question that the parking lot, on which claimant’s vehicle was parked, was an integral part of the employer’s business. In <em>Shaffer v. Somerset Community Hospital, supra, </em>the court observed that: “In determining the instant appeal, we may not close our eyes to the needs of present day society. The automobile has become the universal means of transportation. A hospital must of necessity have a parking lot.” Although the instant case involves a manufacturing plant and not a hospital, the necessity for the establishment of the parking lot was created not for the mere convenience of the plant’s employees, but so that the employer could meet the obligation imposed on it by arrangement with the municipality in which it was located to furnish off-street parking by requiring a special sticker designating the places where employees were to park. Failure to comply with that directive was subject to disciplinary action.</p>

Under established law of this jurisdiction any injury occurring to an employee up until the time he leaves the premises of the employer, provided that it is reasonably proximate to work hours, is compensable. <em>Pineda v.

Those cases are distinguishable from the case at bar because of the temporal proximity between the time of instant claimant’s injury and the time when he left the plant gate. Once it has been established, as in this case, that a parking lot is part of the employer’s business premises, injuries occurring to an employee upon the lot are compensable when the employee’s presence on the lot is temporally proximate to the hours of work. <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v.

Thus the final question left for resolution is whether the fact that the accident occurred upon the public road, which he was required to traverse to reach the parking lot, changes the result.</p>

I agree that in this situation the decedent’s death should be compensable.</p>
    <p id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.9",432,[246,934,1160,731]]]'>I concur separately because I believe that the majority states its holding in terms more expansive than warranted by the salutary theory the opinion expounds. The majority is correct that the award of compensation for injuries upon the employer’s premises, the so-called “premises rule”,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> is based on the employment relationship, not on the employer’s ownership and control over the area where the injury occurred. For an injury to be compensable, however, it is neither legally nor logically “sufficient” merely that “the employee is required to be in the area because of the employment,” as stated by the Court, <em>supra </em>at 1167. Rather, the instant case falls within a narrow exception to the “premises rule”, <em>viz. </em>travel between two parts of the premises.</p>

This position represents the majority rule of other jurisdictions, as the cases collected in the margin show.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The best explanation for <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>today’s short extension of the “premises rule” is that the employer is responsible for creating the necessity of his employees’ encountering the particular hazards of the trip between a non-contiguous parking lot and the working plant <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>itself. The extension is not intended to broaden the coverage of compensable injuries beyond those which occur while an employee is traveling between two parts of the employer’s premises. See 1 A.
