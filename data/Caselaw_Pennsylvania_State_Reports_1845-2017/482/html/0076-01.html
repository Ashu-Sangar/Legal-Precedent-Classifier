In that case Larry Little was defending himself on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon. In his summation to the jury, Little “. . . made statements that the court was biased and had prejudged the case and that petitioner was a political prisoner.” <em><a href="/us/404/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="404 U.S. 553" data-case-ids="6175982" data-case-paths="/us/404/0553-01">Id.</a> </em>404 U.S. at 554, 92 S.Ct. at 660, 30 L.Ed.2d at 710. A North Carolina state trial court held Little in contempt, concluding that his remarks “. . . were very disrespectful and tended to subvert and prevent justice.” <em>Id. </em>at 554, 92 S.Ct. at 660, 30 L.Ed.2d at 710. The North Carolina state court also concluded that Little’s statement “. . . directly tended to interrupt its proceedings and to impair the respect due the [courts] authority,” and further “. . . that they reflected on the integrity of the court and tended to subvert and prevent justice,” and that Little’s remarks “were wilfull and intentionally used and that the words tended to interrupt and to impair the respect due its authority.” <em>Id. </em>at 554, 92 S.Ct. at 660, 30 L.Ed.2d at 710. The United States Supreme Court reversed Little’s conviction holding that the above quoted remarks did not constitute criminal contempt. The Supreme Court pointed out that there was no evidence that the defendant “actually disrupted the court proceeding,” and said that to constitute contempt, the conduct “must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely, threat to the administration of justice.” <em>Id. </em>at 555, 92 S.Ct. at 660, 30 L.Ed.2d at 710.</p>

    <blockquote id="b128-10" data-blocks='[["BL_128.7",128,[325,1956,1118,405]]]'>“. . . [T]he law of contempt is not made for the protection of judges who may be sensitive to the winds of public opinion. Judges are supposed to be [persons] of fortitude, able to thrive in a hearty climate. Trial courts . must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice.” <em>Id. </em>at 555, 92 S.Ct. at 660, 30 L.Ed.2d at 711 (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>

State courts are not free to conclude that conduct such as that for which appellant was held in contempt constitutes contempt of court unless it actually disrupts the court proceeding. <em>See also Holt v.
