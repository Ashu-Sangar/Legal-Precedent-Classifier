After hearing the Commonwealth’s case, Judge Olszewski determined that the murder may be of the first degree and pursuant to Rule 1115(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, elected to secure two additional judges who, after a second hearing, determined appellant’s degree of guilt.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The three-judge panel found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and sentenced him to life <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>imprisonment.

Appellant watched television, smoked cigarettes, drank coffee and was even taken out to dinner by Trooper Donald Taylor. Appellant was always free to leave and was never questioned until 9:43 p. m. During this period, the police conducted an investigation (independent of appellant) of appellant’s whereabouts the night of the murder and as a result thereof, appellant became a prime suspect by 9:00 p. m. At 9:43 p. m., upon entering the interrogation room at the barracks, appellant was informed by Trooper Taylor that he was a prime suspect in the Patricia Emlaw murder. Appellant was given his constitutional rights and waived them. He also signed a voluntary waiver form giving the police permission to search his car. During the next hour and a half, which included rest periods, appellant was questioned and consistently denied his involvement in the murder. At 11:50 p. m., appellant was taken to the police garage and shown his car which contained blood stains on the front seat and inside the trunk. Appellant was placed under arrest and again read his rights. He waived these rights and stated he would continue with the questioning. He was returned to the interrogation room and once again read his rights. He was also informed that his parents were present in the barracks. Appellant requested to see his mother and they met inside the room for approximately five minutes. She advised appellant to “tell the truth” and upon her departure, at approximately 1:00 a. m., appellant confessed to murdering Patricia Emlaw.</p>

When a degree of guilt hearing begins, the prosecution presents witnesses who are then subject to cross-examination by the defense. After the prosecution has presented its case (or so much of its case permitting the trial judge to make a decision that murder of the first degree may be involved) the trial judge calls in two other judges if he concludes that the verdict may be murder of the first degree.
