Both Section 2004 of the Third Class City Code and the arbitration award place restrictions upon the number of hours of compensable overtime.

Section 1408 of the First Class Township Code limits township policemen to “a fixed or stipulated salary.” Compare e. g., The Borough Code, Act of February 1, 1966, P.L.

The Borough Code also repeals the Act of 1897 insofar as it relates to boroughs. See The Borough Code, § 3501, 53 P.S. § 48501 (1966) (“[n]othing contained in this act shall be construed to revive any act or part of any act heretofore repealed”), and Act of May 14, 1915, P.L. 312, § 1 (repealing the Act of 1897 as applied to boroughs).</p>
