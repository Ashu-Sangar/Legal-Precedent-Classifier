Prior to placing the appellant in police custody defense counsel had reached an agreement with the Chief of the Homicide Division of the prosecutor’s office that Lark was not to be interrogated. Counsel also advised his client of his constitutional rights. At that point it is clear that appellant concurred in the decision that he was to remain silent. When the detective, in whose custody appellant had been placed, began to read the warnings, counsel interrupted and stated, “He doesn’t need to know that. I have talked to him. He is not going to make any statements and I have instructed him not to talk to you.” The foregoing facts are substantially agreed to by both the prosecution and defense.</p>

This consisted of an arrest report, a hearing sheet for the issuing authority, and a “229 report” (a police informational sheet, wherein the arrestee’s name, age, background and occupation are noted). The prosecution’s evidence would indicate that the officers did not interrogate appellant concerning the facts of the incident and that the statement was not given in response to any questions.

The testimony given by the police officers provided a basis for the suppression court’s acceptance of the prosecution’s version, thus this would ordinarily end review of this complaint. However, it is this very point that raises a most important question that I believe is deserving of further consideration. The decision as to which version of the facts was to be accepted pitted the credibility of the appellant against the officers who gave a contradictory account of what occurred. In such a situation the accused, who was in the hostile surroundings of a police station, is at a distinct disadvantage. All of the potential witnesses are likely to be his inquisitors. Candor requires us to acknowledge that the testimony of a defendant, because of his obvious interest in the proceedings, is often viewed with jaundice eye and the absence of corroboration by a disinterested witness frequently proves fatal to the defendant’s cause.</p>
