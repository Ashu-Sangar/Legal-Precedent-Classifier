    <p id="b289-9" data-blocks='[["BL_289.9",289,[220,1184,1153,566]]]'>Applicant, Richard Sienkiewicz, Jr., has filed an application for reargument relative to the Court’s decision of September 28, 2005, which required that Respondent PennDOT’s preliminary objections to Applicant’s petition for a board of viewers be sustained, as Applicant had failed to establish a <em>de facto </em>condemnation. <em>See Sienkiewicz v. PennDOT, </em><a href="/pa/584/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="584 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="988544" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0270-01">584 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="883 A.2d 494" data-case-ids="8908177,988544" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0494-01,/pa/584/0270-01">883 A.2d 494</a> (Pa.2005). The case concerns Applicant’s claim, as a business owner, that his commercial fuel station and convenience store operations were impaired by a public road reconfiguration project. The background is set forth in our opinion. <em>See <a href="/a2d/883/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="883 A.2d 494" data-case-ids="8908177,988544" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0494-01,/pa/584/0270-01">id.</a></em>

As PennDOT notes, however, we did address this claim, indicating that extraordinary circumstances are required to support it, which were not present on the record before the Court. <em>See Sienkiewicz, </em><a href="/pa/584/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="584 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="988544" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0270-01">584 Pa. at 283</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="883 A.2d 494" data-case-ids="8908177,988544" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0494-01,/pa/584/0270-01">883 A.2d at </a>501 n. 11 (citing <em>Truck Terminal Realty Co. v. </em>

There is no evidence in the affidavit, or in the depositions and submissions that preceded it, of unreasonable or arbitrary action on PennDOT’s part such as might establish extraordinary circumstance under <em>Truck Terminal, </em>and such as was established as a matter of record in the cases that Applicant presently cites. <em>See, e.g., Newman v. PennDOT, </em><a href="/a2d/791/1287-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="791 A.2d 1287" data-case-ids="9477981" data-case-paths="/a2d/791/1287-01">791 A.2d 1287</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) (“During DOT’s 27-month <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>construction, there was no reasonable ingress and egress from Newman’s property, which resulted in the closure of Newman’s business.”). For example, Applicant did not adduce evidence of any construction-period restriction on ingress and egress, or requirement of circuitous travel, above and beyond that which was addressed in our opinion. Rather, in terms of PennDOT’s conduct, Applicant’s case relative to the construction-interference claim rested on precisely the same evidence as did the restriction-on-access and circuity-of-travel claims that were the primary subject of our opinion.</p>
