It found that this case was governed by <em>Elliott-Reese, </em>and held that the Guaranty Association was only obligated to pay out the policy limits of the defendant’s policy, in this case $200,000, and not any delay damages or interest sought by Appellant notwithstanding the availability of an additional $100,000 under the statutory cap. On appeal to this Court, Appellant argues that, because delay damages and post-judgment interest become part of the verdict against an insurer, the Guaranty Association should likewise be required to pay them, over and above the policy limits but subject to the statutory cap of $300,000. The Guaranty Association argues that it has paid policy limits, which is all it is statutorily obligated to pay. Our Court now seems to accept this argument through its <em>per curiam </em>affirmance.</p>

I do not believe, however, that this case is the appropriate vehicle for addressing this issue. Rather, I believe that before this Court can review the statutory language governing the Guaranty Association in this regard, we must engage in a predicate analysis of the Superior Court’s decision in <em>Hall v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa-super/363/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="363 Pa.

This Court has never reviewed the propriety of <em>Hall, </em>and the parties in this action, like those in <em>Elliott-Reese, </em>have not raised the validity or effect of <em>Hall, </em>or asserted that the Guaranty Association acted in bad faith as the Superior Court required in <em>Hall </em>before an obligation to pay delay damages arises.</p>
