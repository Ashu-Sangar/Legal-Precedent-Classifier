Fletcher, </em><a href="/pa/561/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="561 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="93271" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0266-01">561 Pa. 266</a>, <a href="/a2d/750/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="750 A.2d 261" data-case-ids="11524791,93271" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0261-01,/pa/561/0266-01">750 A.2d 261</a> (2000). Briefly, the killing occurred in March 1992, when Appellee approached the victim, Vaughn Christopher, and shot him twice, first in the thigh, and second, and fatally, in the right flank. The Commonwealth presented evidence that the killing was motivated by Mr. Christopher’s retention of illegal drugs (and/or proceeds thereof) that had been consigned to him by Appellee for sale. Mr. Christopher was taken to the hospital, where he died during the course of emergency treatment. Apparently, his clothing was discarded or lost at the hospital facility.</p>
    <p id="b738-4" data-blocks='[["BL_738.4",738,[253,1049,1162,754]]]'>Police secured statements from several eyewitnesses, including Ronald Brooks and Natalie Grant, describing the above events and indicating that Appellee approached the victim, produced a handgun, and shot Mr. Christopher in the absence of any physical confrontation or struggle. Upon his apprehension and arrest, Appellee gave a statement to police admitting to his role in the killing, but he contended that he acted in his own defense. According to Appellee’s statement, he was angry because Mr. Christopher had stolen money from him in the course of a gambling activity; he approached Mr. Christopher and punched him in the head; Mr. Christopher pulled a pistol; a struggle ensued; and, during the course of this struggle, Appellee placed his hand on the gun and fired twice toward Mr. Christopher’s legs.</p>
    <p id="b738-5" data-blocks='[["BL_738.5",738,[250,1845,1163,368]]]'>At the preliminary hearing, the parties stipulated to the overall results of an autopsy performed by Dr. Hydow Park, then of Philadelphia’s Office of the Medical Examiner, concluding with the agreement that Dr. Park would be made available at trial. <em>See </em>N.T., March 26, 1992, at 4. The Commonwealth also presented Natalie Grant’s testimony, which was largely consistent with her statement.</p>

The Commonwealth also called Ronald Brooks, who denied that he had furnished an incriminatory statement to police and insisted that he was not present at the scene of the killing; therefore, the Commonwealth presented Brooks’ prior inconsistent statement into evidence. Additionally, Appellee’s own statement given during the police interrogation was read to the jurors, and the Commonwealth also offered into evidence substantial testimony from investigating officers describing the overall police investigation.</p>

The evidence was not introduced through Dr. Park himself, however, upon the district attorney’s representation to the trial court that Dr. Park was unavailable as he was in Africa on a medical mission. Over a defense objection, the Commonwealth introduced opinion testimony from a different pathologist, Dr. Ian Hood, based upon the factual findings in Dr. Park’s autopsy report, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth v.

The report also indicated that the bullet was recovered “from the muscles of the left anterior chest wall beneath the rib cage.” <em>Id. </em>at 15. Further, the report stated that there was no evidence of close range firing on the skin. <em>See id. </em>at 13; <em>see also id. </em>at 15 (“The skin around the entrance wound shows no gunpowder stippling or deposits of soot.”). With regard to the wound to the victim’s right thigh, the report reflected that the bullet entered six inches above the knee, coursed backwards and downwards, and exited four inches above the knee and three inches away from the entrance wound. <em>See id. </em>The report also indicated that there was no scalp hemorrhage, but disclosed a three-by-one-inch contusion on the left lower chest. The jurors were also informed that no clothing was submitted to the Office of the Medical Examiner for examination. <em>See id. </em>at 18-19.</p>
    <p id="b740-5" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[259,1350,1157,204]]]'>During the direct examination, Dr. Hood clarified that the fatal bullet entered around the location where the victim’s right elbow would ordinarily hang on a line dropping from the back of the armpit.

Finally, Dr. Hood testified that the unavailability of the victim’s clothing precluded him from rendering an opinion as to the distance from which the victim was shot, as follows:</p>

The petition alleged that trial counsel never interviewed Dr. Park and, had he done so, he would have learned that, in Dr. Park’s view: the Commonwealth’s version of the shooting was highly unlikely, while in contrast, Appellee’s account was likely and consistent with Mr. Christopher’s wounds as well as other evidence; the wound to Mr. Christopher’s thigh evidenced a bullet trajectory that was sharply downward, making it unlikely that the shooter was several yards away as Ms. Grant had <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>testified; the bruise on the left side of Mr. Christopher’s body was not caused by the bullet traveling internally through his body, but instead was produced by a blunt external impact to the chest; the bruise was consistent with a struggle, and specifically, could have been caused by either a fist or elbow; because the skin on the sides of the head and at the scalp is very dense and tough and bruises less easily than skin on many other parts of the body, no forensic pathologist could draw a reliable conclusion from the absence of bruising as to whether the victim had been stricken on the side of the head; and the lack of markings on Mr. Christopher’s hands did not in any way contradict Appellee’s account that shots were delivered while he and the decedent were fighting over the gun, because contact with or proximity to a discharging handgun would not ordinarily leave any detectable markings, and Mr. Christopher underwent a substantial course of emergency medical treatment, during which his hands could have been cleaned. Appellee attached to the petition a declaration from Dr. Park supporting the above-described averments.</p>

As to trial counsel, the Commonwealth notes that, prior to Dr. Hood’s testimony, counsel reviewed the autopsy report and slides with him. The Commonwealth also points to evidence that it is not unusual for an assistant medical examiner other than the pathologist who performed an autopsy to furnish trial testimony, <em>see id. </em>at 28-29, and reiterates that the practice has been met with approval by the courts.

To the extent that there is uncertainty in this regard in light of the post-conviction testimony of Drs. Park and Hood, the Commonwealth views such uncertainty as of little significance, since mere ambiguity as to source does not prove that the bruise resulted from an actual struggle as Appellee claims; rather, the bruise could have been caused by a number of other known circumstances, including the victim’s collapse against a vehicle and ultimately to the ground after having been shot, as well as the emergency medical treatment that was administered in an effort to save his life. <em>See generally </em>N.T., September 5, 2003, at 120-21 (reflecting Dr. Hood’s post-conviction testimony that the bruise could have been caused by “[j]ust about any blunt impact”). The Commonwealth thus asserts that the opinion testimony concerning the bruise was not meaningful in terms of the jurors’ central assessment of the credibility of the eyewitness accounts that Appellee, without provocation, shot the victim in a dispute over drug proceeds. Along these lines, the Commonwealth argues that the post-conviction judge, who was not the trial judge, vastly overstated the significance of evidence concerning the bruise via indications that Dr. Hood’s testimony on the issue was “essential to the verdict,” “rul[ed] out the possibility of self-defense,” and “completely rule[d] out the defendant’s version of events,” <em>Fletcher, </em>Nos. 6001-6004 March Term 1992, <em>slip op., </em>at 5, 7, 11.

Park and Hood concerning the source of the bruise on Mr. Christopher’s chest. As the Commonwealth develops, even if it is accepted that the fatal bullet did not cause the bruise to the victim’s chest, there were several other likely causes (for example, the victim’s multiple falls or the emergency medical treatment), other than a struggle between Appellee and the victim. Furthermore, the core evidence that there was in fact a struggle derived from Appellee’s statement to police upon his arrest, a context in which exculpatory statements shifting and spreading blame are often viewed with skepticism, as self-serving and unreliable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> The evidence thus <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>touched on the critical matter of the credibility of the eyewitnesses only in a substantially indirect fashion. As such, we do not agree with the PCRA court that there is a reasonable probability that a mere indication by a pathologist at trial that the bruise to the victim’s chest was not accounted for by the fatal bullet would have been likely to have affected the verdict.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> While we do recognize Appellee’s point that the trial prosecutor overstated the significance of Dr. Hood’s testimony in terms of excluding the possibility of a struggle, we note that the trial court instructed the jurors that the attorneys’ comments were not evidence, <em>see </em>N.T., January 29, 1993, at 27-28, and moreover, the record reflects that the actual evidence (Dr. Hood’s trial testimony) was fairly measured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

Certainly, other dynamics of Dr. Park's post-conviction testimony, such as the inconsistency of the angle of the bullet wound to Mr. Christopher's thigh with the Commonwealth's theory of the case, were potentially more powerful, at least in the abstract. The Commonwealth, however, made several inroads into these lines of testimony on cross-examination and offered contradictory evidence from experts of its own. Additionally, the PCRA court did not render relevant factual findings, make credibility determinations, or expressly decide the case on such points. We therefore decline, at this juncture, to make a further assessment from the appellate perspective concerning prejudice associated with these other facets of Appellee's claim.</p>
