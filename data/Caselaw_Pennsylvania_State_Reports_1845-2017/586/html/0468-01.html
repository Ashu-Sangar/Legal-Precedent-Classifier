In this regard, Appellant argues that due diligence should not include placing a burden on a criminal defendant to investigate the criminal record of his or her trial counsel for possible conflicts of interest, particularly when the trial court and the prosecution allegedly had this information in their possession.</p>
    <p id="b680-8" data-blocks='[["BL_680.7",680,[252,1809,1158,311]]]'>The Commonwealth takes the position, as did the PCRA court, that the exercise of due diligence would have resulted in Appellant discovering trial counsel’s arrest.

The fact that the Commonwealth does not dispute Appellant’s assertion that he did not “discover” trial counsel’s arrest for DUI until January 29, 2001 does not equate to the Commonwealth stipulating that, for purposes of the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(ii), trial counsel’s arrest was “unknown” to Appellant. This Court has held that, for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h), information is not “unknown” to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In order to meet the statutory requirements of the “governmental interference” exception to the PCRA’s one year jurisdictional time-bar, Appellant was required to plead and prove that his “failure to raise the claim [or claims] <em>previously </em>was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim [or claims] in violation of the Constitution or laws of this <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States....” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i) (emphasis added).</p>

Appellant reasons that “these particular government officials interfered with [Appellant’s] ability to raise this claim any sooner than he did.” Appellant’s brief at 31. Furthermore, Appellant challenges the PCRA court’s determination that, because the evidence at issue is not exculpatory, the Commonwealth was not required by <em>Brady </em>to disclose the evidence to him. Appellant characterizes this determination as a non-sequitur. In his view, the issue under this exception is merely whether, “under the PCRA, [Appellant] was prevented from discovery by the acts or omissions of government officials.” Appellant’s brief at 32. In closing, Appellant submits that this Court should rule that a prosecutor must disclose to a defendant evidence within his or her possession which creates a conflict of interest on the part of the defendant’s attorney and that when a prosecutor (or a trial court) fails to disclose such information, that withholding of information constitutes governmental interference.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Commonwealth’s argument in response to this claim essentially mirrors the rationale employed by the PCRA court in rejecting Appellant’s “governmental interference” claim.</p>

Appellant does not contend, for instance, that the Commonwealth had exclusive control over information regarding trial counsel’s arrest and that the Commonwealth denied him access to this information until recently. As stated above, trial counsel’s arrest was a matter of public record and was just as available to Appellant and his previous counsel as it was to Appellant and his current counsel. It, therefore, cannot be said that Appellant could not have brought his claims <em>previously </em>as the result of any alleged interference by governmental officials.

We note that there is a significant measure of bootstrapping in Appellant's arguments regarding the PCRA’s exceptions to the one year jurisdictional time-bar. In order to conclude that the Commonwealth interfered with Appellant’s ability to bring his conflict of interest claim by failing to inform him of the alleged conflict of interest, this Court first would have to determine that a conflict of interest indeed existed. To determine as much would require the Court to reach the merits of Appellant's underlying substantive claims before resolving whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain those very claims.</p>

Whereas the majority would find that counsel’s DUI arrest was public record, and therefore, generally discoverable through an exercise of due diligence on the part of Appellant, I would find that the particular circumstances of this case lead to the conclusion that PCRA counsel, through the exercise of diligence, should have uncovered counsel’s DUI arrest. Specifically, the allegations made by PCRA counsel in Appellant’s first PCRA peti<a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>tion indicate that by exercising due diligence, PCRA counsel would have further uncovered trial counsel’s criminal history. Thus, I would not go so far as the majority does to hold that criminal defendants are generally responsible for the arduous task of uncovering the criminal record of their attorney, where no basis for such discovery exists. For the following reasons, I concur.</p>
    <p id="b684-5" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[251,695,1161,993]]]'>The majority opinion posits that trial counsel’s DUI arrest could not be characterized as “unknown” to Appellant because the information was a matter of public record. I believe, however, that there is danger in placing such an onerous burden on a criminal defendant to search public records to determine whether there are pending charges against his attorney during that defendant’s trial. Rather, in affirming, I would rely solely upon the record <em>sub judice, </em>and conclude that if where, as here, PCRA counsel, who represented Appellant at his first PCRA hearing, had exercised due diligence, he would have uncovered trial counsel’s DUI arrest. Because PCRA counsel for Appellant alleged during the first PCRA proceeding that trial counsel had a substance abuse problem and had been suspended from practicing law, there was some basis upon which to suspect that further investigation of trial counsel may have uncovered relevant information. Thus, based on this knowledge, PCRA counsel, through the exercise of due diligence, could reasonably have discovered the DUI arrest which was of record at the time.</p>

In addition, following the first PCRA hearing, [Appellant] filed a Motion to Re-open the Record wherein [Appellant’s] counsel asserted that he was aware that [Appellant’s trial attorney] had been suspended from the practice of law prior to the first PCRA hearing. Certainly these facts placed [Appellant] or his counsel on notice that some infraction of the law oc<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>curred. Given that notice the defendant had every opportunity to raise that substance abuse problem in the context of a criminal record. [Appellant] has not demonstrated that information concerning [trial counsel’s] criminal record was not known or knowable to him at the time of trial or shortly thereafter, let alone at the time of his first PCRA when he specifically raised substance abuse problems.</blockquote>
