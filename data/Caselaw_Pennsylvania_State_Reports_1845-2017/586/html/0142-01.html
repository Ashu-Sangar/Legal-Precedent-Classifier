    <p id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.7",351,[239,760,1150,194]]]'>We allowed appeal to consider whether a trial court’s failure to issue a cautionary instruction upon the admission of evidence of a co-conspirator’s guilty plea during a jury trial constitutes reversible error.</p>
    <p id="b351-9" data-blocks='[["BL_351.8",351,[236,998,1154,412]]]'>In the early morning hours of August 31, 2001, Appellant and two other men forcefully entered the residence of an elderly couple. The three perpetrators, one of whom was armed with a pellet gun, threatened to shoot the victims, bound them with duct tape, and absconded with a large sum of money. Appellant was subsequently arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police, and later, made a statement admitting his involvement in the crimes.</p>
    <p id="b351-10" data-blocks='[["BL_351.9",351,[232,1454,1158,907]]]'>Thereafter, George MacDougall confessed to having participated in the home invasion, named Appellant and Tony Yohe as the other perpetrators, and entered a plea of guilt on the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery. At the jury trial of Appellant and Yohe, the Commonwealth called MacDougall to testify. MacDougall refused, however, because he had sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and he did not wish to incriminate himself or hinder his potential appeal. Nevertheless, at the request of the Commonwealth, and without objection by Appellant’s counsel, the court admitted MacDougall’s guilty plea into evidence; further, the district attorney related to the jurors the circumstances surrounding the plea, including MacDougall’s explicit identification of Appellant and Yohe as his co-conspirators. At no point did Appellant’s counsel request a cautionary instruction concerning the appropriate perspective from which to view MacDougall’s guilty plea in determining Appellant’s guilt, and the court offered no such instruction.</p>

      <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>Appellant was convicted of robbery and associated conspiracy, burglary, terroristic threats, unlawful restraint, and simple assault. He received the maximum sentence on each charge, to be served consecutively, resulting in an aggregate term of imprisonment of 26 to 100 years. Appellant lodged an appeal from the judgment of sentence in the Superior Court, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence of MacDougall’s guilty plea should not have been introduced in the absence of a cautionary instruction, and that his trial counsel rendered deficient stewardship in this regard.</p>

Thomas, </em><a href="/pa/443/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="443 Pa. 234" data-case-ids="1936954" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0234-01">443 Pa. 234</a>, 244-45, <a href="/citations/?q=279%20A.2d%2020" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="279 A.2d 20">279 A.2d 20</a>, 26 (1971), the court noted that the evidence of MacDougall’s guilty plea fostered a suggestion of guilt by association, which was inherently prejudicial. The court concluded, however, that the asserted error was harmless in light of the other evidence of this case, particularly Appellant’s confession. It also explained, <em>inter alia, </em>that the impact of MacDougall’s plea was mitigated by the fact that he had renounced it and was pursuing an appeal challenging his sentence, as well as by the absence of any reference to the plea in the district attorney’s closing argument.</p>

Although he filed a reply brief, Appellant offers little to answer the waiver contention, indicating only that trial courts should have the obligation to offer limiting instructions <em>sua sponte.
