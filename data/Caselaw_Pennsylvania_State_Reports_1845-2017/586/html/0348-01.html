Initially, no charges were filed in connection with the fire, but in May 2002, Kluge confessed that he had doused the interior of the building with a flammable substance and left the rear door of the building open so that a white male, known to him only as “Steve,” could enter and set the structure ablaze. Kluge explained that his former partner, Shope, had directed him to destroy the building so that they could receive the proceeds of their insurance policy.

[ojther jurisdictions have allowed more latitude as to the elusive quantum of information sufficient to satisfy the Fourth Amendment’s specificity requirement, recognizing the fluid nature of criminal investigations.”). Furthermore, the Superior Court referenced <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em><a href="/f2d/827/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="827 F.2d 604" data-case-ids="1753913" data-case-paths="/f2d/827/0604-01">827 F.2d 604</a>, 607 (9th Cir.1987), indicating that the decision demonstrated that other jurisdictions permit the use of “John Doe” warrants, so long as they include all of the information available to the government at the time. <em>See Laventure, </em><a href="/a2d/858/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="858 A.2d 112" data-case-ids="9157106" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/0112-01">858 A.2d at 115</a>. Based on the above, the majority, in essence, adopted the standard proposed by the Commonwealth, albeit that it added a requirement of prompt amendment. Specifically, the majority held that a “John Doe” complaint or warrant may be deemed sufficient, even in the absence of particular identifying information relevant to the defendant, if the following questions can be answered affirmatively:</p>
    <blockquote id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[196,1567,1114,302]]]'>(1) did the Commonwealth set forth all information it knew or should have known in the initial “John Doe” complaint or warrant; and (2) was specific, identifying information obtained later as the result of diligent investigation added to the complaint or warrant within a reasonable amount of time.</blockquote>

It is well-settled that the purpose underlying a <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>statute of limitations is to limit the amount of time an individual is exposed to criminal liability because of the inherent difficulties in defending against a criminal charge where a great deal of time has passed between the commission of the crime and the prosecution thereof, e.g. the death or lack of memory of -witnesses. <em>Cardonick, </em><a href="/pa/448/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="448 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1944680" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0322-01">448 Pa. at 332-333</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20402" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="292 A.2d 402">292 A.2d at 407-408</a>. The use of the above proposed standard on a case-by-case basis would not contravene this rationale, as the criminal case will have actually commenced with the filing of the initial “John Doe” complaint and issuance of the warrant. Essentially, the “ball will be rolling” as a result of the initial “John Doe” complaint or warrant, and if a swiftly-developing investigation does not result in the rapid amendment of the initial document to include the subject’s actual identity, then the applicable statute of limitations will function ultimately to bar prosecution.</blockquote>

In this regard, the Commonwealth asserts that the constitutional matters that the Superior Court discussed are irrelevant to the controversy, since there can have been no violation of any constitutional right of Appellant arising out of the pre-amendment complaint and warrant, as they were never acted upon in their original forms. According to the Commonwealth, the exclusive focus of the review therefore must be upon the requirement of Criminal Rule 504(2) that a complaint describe an unknown defendant “as nearly as may be.” At various points in its brief, the Commonwealth acknowledges that this language is the same as is used in Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, but, again, the Commonwealth generally seeks to isolate the issue presented in this case from the Pennsylvania and federal constitutional decisions pertaining to the particularity of a warrant’s description.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a>

The Commonwealth argues that this understanding is supported by the standard Pennsylvania criminal complaint form, claiming that the form obviates any requirement to identify a “John Doe” defendant with particularity, since one of its provisions sets out the option for charging a person whose name is unknown, as follows: “We accuse the defendant whose name and popular designation or nickname is unknown to me and whom I have therefore designated as__” Alternatively, the Commonwealth endorses the relation-back approach that was adopted by the Superior Court, under which timely amendments to a criminal complaint and/or arrest warrant should be treated as relating back to the date on which the original documents were filed and/or secured. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that there is some flexibility relative to the enforcement of deadlines in other areas of the law, particularly where the defendant is not prejudiced.

Next, the Commonwealth references this Court’s implementation of a relation-back doctrine in the arena of post-conviction claims, where a timely petition has been filed implicating the jurisdiction of the courts. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 13-14 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Again, the matter is remote from the present one and, additionally, concerns the modification of claims, as opposed to the haling into court of a party in the first instance. Finally, the Commonwealth contends that our civil jurisprudence would appear to permit a post-statute amendment to a complaint when all that is being amended is the name of the defendant. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee at 14-15 (citing <em>Powell v.

These decisions are not supportive of the Commonwealth's position. Indeed, the present state of Pennsylvania jurisprudence in the civil context is that the substitution of a named party for a fictitious party, such as "John Doe,” is an addition of a new party, and is generally not permitted after the statute of limitations has run. <em>See Anderson Equipment Co. v.

Additionally, contrary to the Commonwealth’s position, the language of the standard Pennsylvania criminal complaint form requiring specification of a fictitious name for an unknown defendant also does not diminish the clear requirement of Rule 504(2) that the complaint ’'shall” contain a description of an unknown defendant as nearly as may be.
