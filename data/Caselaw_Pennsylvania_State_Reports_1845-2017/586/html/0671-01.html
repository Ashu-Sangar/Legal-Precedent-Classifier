With each technological advancement, the practice of law becomes more sophisticated and, commensurate with this progress, the legal system must adapt. Courts are facing the need to shed any technophobia and become more willing to embrace the advances that have the ability to enhance the efficacy of the legal system. However, before we are too quick to differentiate CGA’s or create a special test for their admission, it must be noted that the rules for analyzing the admission of such evidence have been previously established. In particular, a CGA should be treated equivalently to any other demonstrative exhibit or graphic representation and, thus, a CGA should be admissible if it satisfies the requirements of Pa.R.E. 401, 402, 403, and 901.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellant emphasizes the fact that one image within the CGA shows the victim on her knees before Appellant fires the third bullet. Contradicting Appellant’s contention, Matzkanin testified that the poses, although not guaranteed to be 100% accurate, were within the confines of the findings and suggestions of the expert opinions of both Dr. Ross and Trooper Beach. Specifically, Dr. Ross testified that, concerning the distance between Appellant and the victim, based upon the lack of soot or gunpowder, the bullet path or trajectory for the various wounds, and that, as a result of the first shot, the victim would have collapsed to the floor in a kneeling position. N.T. 2/4/02 p. 177-215.

Clearly, reconstruction will not reveal the exact pose of each finger, hair, distances precise to the micrometer, or other minor aspects of the individuals involved.

In addition, Matzkanin was questioned about a knife that appeared in the last scene of the animation, but never appeared in the victim’s hands. Despite attempting to emphasize an apparent facial illogicality to this sequence, the CGA was merely representing the theory of the Commonwealth. In particular, it was the contention of the Commonwealth that Appellant placed the knife there after firing the shots in an attempt to stage the crime scene and create a claim of self-defense. The Commonwealth also theorized that Appellant had moved the victim’s right arm because the blood evidence indicated to Dr. Ross that Appellant had moved the arm of the victim after death in an attempt to create a self-defense claim. N.T. 2/4/04 at 217-19. Appellant, through cross-examination, highlighted the information that actually was either unfounded or that represented an arbitrary choice where the data was unknown, such as the exact positions of each body part.

The CGA is, ultimately, a representation of the expert opinions and demonstrative evidence.

However, the jury ultimately found the testimony of the Commonwealth experts, and the CGA, to be credible.

In particular, the CGA did not include: (1) sounds; (2) facial expressions; (3) evocative or even life-like movements; (4) transition between the scenes to suggest a story line or add a subconscious prejudicial effect; or (5) evidence of injury such as blood or other wounds. Instead, much like a two-dimensional hand drawing of bullet trajectories, the CGA merely highlighted the trajectory of the three bullets fired, concluding from ballistics and blood splatter that the body had been moved after the victim died as part of Appellant’s attempt to stage his self-defense.

Such a question and determination are within the province of the trial court and should not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. In particular, the trial court sitting with all facts before it, including the monetary disparity of the parties, must determine if the potentially powerful effect of the CGA and the inability of a defendant to counter with his or her own CGA should lead to its preclusion.

A CGA is a drawing, or drawings, created by a computer that, when assembled frame-by frame, produce the image of motion. The image is merely a graphic representation depicting the previously formed opinion of a witness or witnesses, in this case the Commonwealth experts. F. Galves, <em>Where the Not So Wild Things Are: Computers in the Courtroom, the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Need for Institutional Reform and More Judicial Acceptance, </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20Harv.%20J.L.%20%26%20Tech.%20161" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="13 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 161">13 Harv. J.L. &amp; Tech. 161</a>, 227-30 (2000). Presently, the CGA is akin to the traditionally permitted drawings used by crime scene reconstructionists to show bullet path trajectory. Accordingly, a CGA is only as credible as the underlying testimony that it represents and the computer plays no part in calculating an outcome or presenting its own conclusions. Conversely, computer-generated simulations do not depict witness opinion; rather, the computer program, based upon the data entered, draws a conclusion. As such, a computer simulation presents not only the testimony of an expert regarding the programming and data input but also a conclusion of the computer based upon the formulas programmed to use the raw data entered. For example, scientists use computer simulations to predict the effects of earthquakes on a building's structure by inputting factors such as: (1) wind; (2) magnitude of earthquake; (3) proximity of earthquake; (4) building materials; (5) building height; (6) amplitude of the earthquakes waves; and so forth. However, the simulation creates a result that nobody can testify to with personal knowledge nor is it the representation of an individual's opinion. Rather it is the <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>outcome of the program’s mathematical formulas based on the various inputted data and the laws of physics as entered by the programmers. As noted by Justice Castille in his concurring Opinion, the program used for either a CGA or a simulation is a human product and may be subjected to scrutiny regarding its programming bias and soundness in principles of both math and physics. At that point, a proper determination of the appropriate weight to be assigned to its output can occur. Further, as discussed <em>infra, </em>jury instructions may help in reducing or eliminating the potential for a jury to assign undue weight to a CGA by clarifying that it is, in actuality, a graphic representation of biased testimony of one party and not a product of neutral infallible artificial intelligence. Today, we address only the admissibility of CGA evidence as defined above and not that of computer simulations.</p>

Chief Justice Cappy urges this Court to adopt a standard in which the Commonwealth would be required to file a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>whenever CGA evidence is involved. Although this is a recommended procedure to reduce potential prejudice, we hold that the moving party, be it the Commonwealth or a defendant, should file a motion <em>in limine </em>and seek permission of the trial court to admit the evidence as soon as possible, even if after the start of trial. It is conceivable that a party may find, after the start of trial, that a CGA would be helpful to rebut evidence or new testimony set forth by the opposing party. Should a party discover that a CGA would be helpful at that point in time that party should not be precluded from asking the trial court to admit a CGA into evidence. The timing of the request must be weighed along with the various other factors involved in determining if the prejudicial effect of the CGA outweighs its probative value. As one example, an eyewitness may testify for the defendant that they were able to see the crime scene from a certain location. Such testimony may come as a surprise to the Commonwealth, which would wish, at that time, to introduce a CGA showing the viewpoint from that location at various heights and angles in order to rebut the testimony that the witness could see what they claimed. Such a CGA would be relatively benign, with no depiction of the defendant or victim and would be used merely to impeach the credibility of the eyewitness. Most likely, in this circumstance, no prejudice would result from its admission even after the start of trial. Moreover, the Commonwealth should not be penalized for being unable to foresee the testimony of all parties by being prevented, as a <em>per se </em>rule, from admitting a CGA into evidence after the start of trial. The rules of evidence must still be applied to each situation and, thus, Pa.R.E. 403 should still be employed in determining the admissibility of a CGA at a later point in trial; however, the further along the trial is, the more likely it is that the prejudicial effect will outweigh the probative value of a CGA because the opposing party has less time to examine the CGA or prepare its own CGA. This concern would be heightened in criminal cases where the defendant may have scarce resources to properly examine a CGA and prepare his or her <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>own. Certainly, in a case such as this, where the CGA is not benign but rather represents the actual crime, a cold-hearted killing, a failure to file a pre-trial motion <em>in limine </em>could create a prejudicial effect to such an extent that it could foreclose the possibility of midtrial admittance of the CGA into evidence.</p>

We must respectfully disagree with Justice Castille's suggestion that the "wisest course” is excluding such evidence where the defendant cannot secure an equivalent production. Concurring Opinion (Castille, J.), at 703, 896 A.2d at 1190. As in the fields of toxicology, neurology, statistics, jury selection, hand writing analysis, and sociology/criminology a defendant is not entitled under any existing precedent to matching funds. However, should the trial court determine that undue prejudice would result from the defendant's inability to examine the methodology used in creating what is merely a depiction of the Commonwealth’s expert testimony, the court may either exclude the evidence pursuant to Pa.R.E. 403 or provide the necessary funds to the defendant. Such a concern is certainly more relevant when discussing a computer-generated simulation where the underlying programming is relevant to the results received and does not merely graphically depict expert testimony as in a CGA. Moreover, the economic efficacy demonstrated by the Commonwealth is irrelevant as it is not the role of the trial court or this Court to advise the Commonwealth on how best to spend its money for trial. Thus, whether or not "the cost was worth the expenditure of scarce public financial resources,” <em>Id. </em>at 702, 896 A.2d at 1189, is not a question for this Court. Further, reviews of fiscal sagacity are not conducted concerning other Commonwealth expert testimony using psychologists, DNA forensic experts, and the like. A discussion of a court’s subjective opinion regarding the relative bargain received by the Commonwealth in procuring a CGA factor into a Pa.R.E. 403 test weighing its probative versus prejudicial value should also not be a <a id="p696" href="#p696" data-label="696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*696</a>question for the trial court or this Court. Ultimately, the amount of money spent may be a concern because of an increase in the prejudicial effect of the CGA due to the inability of a defendant to expend the same amount of money; however, the value received by the Commonwealth for its expenditure is irrelevant to the prejudicial effect or probative value of the CGA.</p>

Chief Justice Cappy opines that limiting instructions are necessary in all cases involving the admission of a CGA into evidence. Although we agree that such instructions are a powerful tool in limiting prejudice, and a trial court would be wise to issue them, Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 105 states that a non-admitting party may request jury instructions regarding the admission of evidence. Pa.R.E. 105. Of course, a trial court may issue instructions on its own initiative. <a id="p699" href="#p699" data-label="699" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*699</a>"Though the trial court may, on its own initiative, give a limiting instruction to the jury, the onus is on a party who is entitled to such an instruction to ask for one. Otherwise, the party may waive an objection to the jury's use of evidence for an improper purpose.” David F. Binder, <em>Binder on Pennsylvania Evidence </em>§ 1.05, p. 22 (4th Ed. 2005). Today, we hesitate to create a new rule of evidence applying only to CGA evidence in criminal or civil cases; instead, we hold that such instructions are recommended on the part of the trial court to reduce prejudice. However, in accord with long-standing Pennsylvania law, a failure to ask for such instructions could result in waiver of any objection. <em>Keefer v.

I agree with the majority that the admission of the CGA will be guided by the considerations that normally govern demonstrative evidence, including authentication, relevancy, and weighing the probative value versus the prejudicial impact of that evidence.

I also am in general agreement with the approach and analysis in Madame Justice Newman’s learned Majority Opinion.

The testimony of the person who created the CGA in this case, Randy Matzkanin, testimony which the Majority summarizes at some length, Majority op. at 685-87, 896 A.2d at 1179-80, made clear that the computer product at issue was intended to reflect not the conclusions of the computer, but the conclusions and opinions of the Commonwealth’s flesh and blood forensic witnesses, as related to and interpreted by Mr. Matzkanin.

In a case where both parties are well-funded, each will have the resources available to hire the computer professionals necessary to challenge the accuracy of a proffered CGA or to generate a competing animation. In contrast, in a criminal case involving an indigent defendant, the cost of assuring that the defense is able to adequately assess the accuracy of a Commonwealth CGA, or to produce a competing CGA of its own either contesting the accuracy of the Commonwealth’s depiction or depicting a defense theory, would have to be borne by the <a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>state. If such funding is denied, the burden will fall upon appointed counsel to attempt to school himself in a field in which he most likely is not expert. As this case reveals, the cost of this evidence, in terms of both time and money, is substantial — the fifteen second CGA here apparently cost $10,000-$20,000 and a substantial portion of the trial was consumed in examining how Mr. Matzkanin produced it. Having reviewed the essentially benign end-product, I am not convinced that the cost was worth the expenditure of scarce public financial resources. I recognize that ours is an increasingly image-driven culture. However, such trends need not be indulged at every turn in the courtroom. I fully trust that a jury can “get the picture” — it certainly could have gotten an equivalent picture here — through more balanced, economical and old-fashioned means, such as testimony and diagrams.</p>

Majority op. at 691-95, 896 A.2d at 1183-84. Nevertheless, the Majority goes on in <em>dicta </em>to address the issue, ultimately suggesting that an indigent defendant has no right to public funds to arrange for his own CGA, and that the question of whether the Commonwealth should be permitted to introduce a CGA in a case where the defense cannot afford a counter-CGA should be left to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Id. </em>at 695-96, 896 A.2d at 1185. I cannot join in the Majority’s extended <em>dicta </em>on the point both because it is not properly before this Court and because I, like the Chief Justice, would leave open the prospect that the interests of justice may require providing an indigent defendant with the funds necessary to respond to a CGA produced by the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Concurring Opinion (Cappy, C.J.), at 700, 896 A.2d at 1188.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Furthermore, I should note that the fact that <a id="p704" href="#p704" data-label="704" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*704</a>this Court holds that CGAs may be admissible in the discretion of the trial judge does not mean that any party has an enforceable right to introduce the evidence. Thus, given the limited value of this sort of evidence, the wisest course for the trial judge <em>might </em>be to exclude such evidence entirely in those situations where the defense cannot secure an equivalent production.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

    <p id="b912-6" data-blocks='[["BL_912.8",912,[256,1059,1165,791]]]'>Admissibility of evidence is not a function of finances of the parties. If one side chooses to develop evidence, of this or any type, its admissibility cannot rest on a determination of the relative resources of the other party. Relevance, not money, is what makes something admissible. Pa.R.E. 402 (“All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by law. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible.”). If a defendant feels the need for unaffordable evidence, such as these animations, an expert, or testing of any kind, he has but to ask the court, which will determine the entitlement under existing principles. The remedy is not to ignore the rules of evidence or to preclude the other side from introducing relevant evidence. Suggesting that disparate resources can comprise a reason to exclude evidence presages the triumph of social sensitivity over legal reason.</p>

Again, the matter has not been raised and we <a id="p705" href="#p705" data-label="705" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*705</a>have received no advocacy on it, nor has our Rules Committee considered the ramifications of this area. More to the point, relevance, not timing, remains the key to admissibility. If prejudice or unfair surprise is found, evidence may be excluded, <em>see </em>Pa.R.E. 403; if not, it should not be kept out simply because it was not moved at a certain time. Trials are fluid and ever-changing landscapes; what is planned one moment is of no use the next, and matters never considered gain salience at the most unexpected time. There appears no reason to treat these animations any differently than any other demonstrative tools used to aid understanding.</p>
    <p id="b913-5" data-blocks='[["BL_913.4",913,[164,919,1156,691]]]'>There are general principles of evidence and its admission that cover these animations as well as any other evidence. Technology advances, and the law must accommodate it, but we need not write a new rule every time a new manifestation of evidence arises. Our existing rules of admissibility, discovery, and motions cover this situation quite adequately. While clearly fancier, in legal concept this animation appears little different from any other drawing or chart — it is a visual aid and nothing more. Time-tested principles will determine its admissibility without a new rule specific only to computer-generated animations or variations, existent or to come. Adding <em>dicta </em>suggesting a special rule because of the form of the visual aid is not warranted or necessary.</p>
