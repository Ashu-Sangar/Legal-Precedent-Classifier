None of these cases hold that a petition alleging the forfeiture of the right to compensa<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>tion is the same as a petition seeking suspension of benefits. A claimant forfeits his right to benefits when he refuses reasonable medical services for his work-related injuries. <em>See 77 </em>P.S. § 531(8). An employer may seek a suspension of benefits for other reasons, however, such as an improvement in earning power altering a claimant’s need for benefits. <em>See Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Div., </em><a href="/pa/526/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="526 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1825940" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0025-01">526 Pa. 25</a>, <a href="/pa/526/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="526 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1825940" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0025-01">584 A.2d 301</a>, 304-05 (1990) (“A ‘suspension of benefits’ is supported by a finding that the earning power of the claimant is no longer affected by his disability, whether it arises from his employer offering suitable replacement employment, or from the ability of the claimant to secure other suitable employment that provides equal or greater compensation.”). Forfeiture is based on the claimant’s own unwillingness to receive treatment rather than a change in status. With forfeiture, there is no requirement of a change which alters a claimant’s right to benefits, as exists with a suspension of benefits. Because appellant’s petition was under the forfeiture section, it was not a suspension petition, and cannot fall under § 413; thus, appellant is not entitled to reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund.</p>

I disagree with this characterization and conclude that this result is clearly erroneous. Therefore, I must dissent.</p>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[221,814,1154,680]]]'>On June 7, 1993, Employer issued a Notice of Compensation Payable to Donald Buehler (Claimant) for a May 19, 1993 work-related injury to his right shoulder. On August 11, 1997, pursuant to Section 306(f.l)(8), 77 P.S. § 531(8), alleging that Claimant refused reasonable medical treatment, Employer filed a Petition entitled Petition for Forfeiture of Benefits, subsequently filing its request for supersedeas on September 8, 1997. According to the Majority, “Section 306(f.l)(8) itself does not allow for reimbursement.” (Majority Op. 586 Pa. at 88, 92, 890 A.2d at 1048, 1050.) However, I believe this misstates the effect of Section 306(f.l)(8), which does not preclude reimbursement; rather it is merely silent as to reimbursement.</p>

    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.4",302,[266,730,1161,648]]]'>77 P.S. § 999(b) (emphasis added). The General Assembly created the Supersedeas Fund to balance the rights of employers against the requirement that injured employees receive compensatory benefits immediately, even where an employer disputes his or her entitlement. Section 443 is explicit in stating that supersedeas reimbursement is limited to those instances where the request was made pursuant to Section 413 or Section 430 and was denied. The elements require that: (1) supersedeas be requested pursuant to Section 413; (2) the request for supersedeas be denied; (3) payments were continued because of the supersedeas denial (4) the proceedings became final; and (5) the compensation was not payable.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[265,1415,1162,483]]]'>Section 413 of the Act sets forth the authority of a Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ) to “at any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate ... an award of the department or its workers’ compensation judge upon petition filed by either party ...” 77 P.S. § 772. Section 413 is the only place in the Act where the broad grant of authority to change the compensation due to a claimant appears. Elsewhere, the Act contains only specific grants of authority for actions that may be taken by a WCJ.</p>
    <p id="b302-7" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[263,1940,1162,426]],["BL_303.1",303,[234,318,1149,95]]]'>Section 413 is also important for establishing requirements for both an automatic supersedeas and one like that at issue, one that is discretionary. Section 413 also indicates that, when a petition is filed pursuant to Section 413, it will serve to “suspend payment of compensation in whole or to such extent as the facts alleged in the petition would, if proved, require.” 77 P.S. § 774(2). Thus, Section 413 extends its reach to all those petitions that seek to alter the workers’ compensation <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>award. A forfeiture of benefits is such a petition and, thus, comes within the purview of Section 413.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[231,456,1154,742]]]'>Section 413 further indicates that a WCJ may approve a request for supersedeas upon “proof of any other fact which would serve to modify or terminate payment of compensation .... ” 77 P.S. § 774(2). There is nothing in this language that limits approval of a supersedeas request to only certain types of petitions. The limiting language, where there is any, is contained in the detailed statutory sections relative to each specific action. That is why Section 314, 77 P.S. § 651, for example, specifies that any monies paid by an employer to a claimant while the claimant is refusing to undergo a physical examination are to be recouped from future compensation payments and Section 306(f.l)(8) is silent in terms of a remedy. Section 306(f.l)(8) is silent on the subject because, in my view, it comes within the ambit of Section 413.</p>

The unstated intent of this section is to penalize any action by an employer pursuing self help by withholding compensation rather than availing itself of its remedies and securing a supersedeas. This is also analogous to Section 430, upon which the Board grounded its decision. The Majority determines that the Board was mistaken and that a forfeiture petition cannot fall under Section 430. Yet, an employer, who is obligated to pay a claimant benefits, may cease paying benefits only if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) submits a supplemental agreement to a WCJ pursuant to Section 408 (77 P.S. § 732); (2) submits a final receipt to a WCJ signed by the claimant pursuant to Section 434 (77 P.S. § 1001); (3) secures an order from a WCJ granting a discretionary supersedeas initiated by petition (77 P.S. § 774); (4) files a Notice of Suspension upon the claimant’s return to work pursuant to Section 413(c) (77 P.S. § 774.2); or (5) secures a final order from a WCJ terminating benefits. In the instant matter, Employer submitted a Petition pursuant to Section 413 specifically request<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>ing a discretionary supersedeas and, upon its denial, continued compensation payments.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[264,451,1162,1281]]]'>Therefore, the General Assembly has carefully constructed a comprehensive scheme for suspending, modifying, reinstating, or terminating benefits, with accompanying provisions for a supersedeas. Included within this scheme is the forfeiture of benefits where a claimant has refused reasonable medical treatment. Contrary to the Majority’s belief that there are no cases holding that a petition alleging a forfeiture is the same as a petition seeking suspension of benefits, the courts of this Commonwealth have treated a forfeiture of benefits as a suspension<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> in part because, when a claimant recants and chooses to undergo the reasonable medical treatment, the forfeiture is lifted. <em>Stuart Painting Co. v.

However, a review of the cases and the Section 413 “Petition to:” (Form LIBC-378)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> reveals that this petition is used when a claimant has refused employment, refused reasonable medical treatment, refused a physical examination, requests a change to the notice of compensation payable, or a correction in the average weekly wage, none of which require a change in physical condition and the first three of which can result in a suspension of benefits.</p>

There is a Claim Petition, a “Petition to” (review, modify, terminate, suspend, or reinstate) (Form LIBC-378), Petition for Physical Examination or Expert Interview, Utilization Review Request, Application for Supersedeas Fund Reimbursement, and Request for Designation of a Physician. There is no specific petition designated as a forfeiture petition. This is because, to obtain a forfeiture of benefits, the employer must file a “Petition to:”.</p>

Form LIBC-378 is a Section 413 Petition and the document utilized when an action implicating the workers’ compensation award is initiated, in check-the-box format. The form itself states that the employer/employee is asking the WCJ to take one or more specific actions to alter the award, which are listed at the top of the form — none of those listed actions is the forfeiture of benefits. To make use of the form, the employer selects the action it requires (such <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>as “Suspend Compensation Benefits”) in the top portion of the form. In the lower third of the form are various boxes to check to indicate the basis on which the request is made. Box number six is entitled “Reasonable Treatment Refused,” which is based on Section 306(f.l)(8). Thus, Form LIBC-378 is a Section 413 Petition. Clearly, then, the request is made pursuant to Section 413, which governs modification, suspension, termination, or reinstatement of benefits by a WCJ. Finally, the second page of Form LIBC-378 has a place to check whether a supersedeas is requested pursuant to Section 413, 77 P.S. § 772, when a supersedeas is not automatic pursuant to 77 P.S. § 771.
