Skepton (“Skepton”), Joseph Bozzelli, trading as J.B. Plumbing Company (“J.B. Plumbing”), and Dual Temp Company, Inc. (“Dual Temp”) (collectively “Contractors”). The Com<a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>monwealth Court answered this question in the negative, and we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b724-4" data-blocks='[["BL_724.4",724,[262,431,1157,636]]]'>The facts underlying this matter are not in dispute and are as follows. In 1992, the School District invited public bids for the construction of a new high school. The District included in its invitation for bids information to public bidders in the following sections Notice to Contractors, Instructions to Bidders, and General Conditions of the Contract (“General Conditions”). The General Conditions required that the Contractors furnish labor, materials, equipment, facilities, and supplies for the construction of the school. The General Conditions also mandated that the Contractors secure and pay for all permits, governmental fees, and licenses necessary for the proper execution and completion of the construction.</p>
    <p id="b724-5" data-blocks='[["BL_724.5",724,[262,1093,1158,467]]]'>The Contractors were the lowest responsible bidders. The District, therefore, awarded a general construction contract to Skepton, a plumbing contract to J.B. Plumbing, and a heating, cooling, and ventilation contract to Dual Temp. The parties expressly incorporated into the contracts the bid specifications set forth in, <em>inter alia, </em>the General Conditions. In return for the Contractors completing their duties under the contracts, the School District agreed to pay the Contractors lump sum contract fees.</p>
    <p id="b724-6" data-blocks='[["BL_724.6",724,[259,1595,1160,629]]]'>Consistent with their duties under the contracts, the Contractors applied to the Borough for the issuance of permits to construct the school. The Borough notified Skepton that the cost of a construction permit under the applicable local ordinances and resolution totaled $88,838. The Borough informed Dual Temp that its permit would cost $22,021, and the Borough assessed J.B. Plumbing a permit fee of $9,120. These fees constituted approximately 10% of the estimated construction costs. The Contractors paid the permit fees under protest and then filed separate actions against the Borough in which they challenged the validity of the ordinances and resolution. The suits were consolidated for trial.</p>
    <p id="b724-7" data-blocks='[["BL_724.7",724,[259,2260,1159,95]],["BL_725.1",725,[165,305,1151,352]]]'>The trial court determined that the imposed permit fees were grossly disproportionate to the actual costs incurred by <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>the Borough, which only totaled $1,234 or 1% of the assessed fees, and were primarily for the purpose of raising revenue. Based on this determination, the court concluded that the ordinances and resolution violated the Borough Code, 53 P.S. § 46202. The court, thus, declared the ordinances and resolution invalid and ordered the Borough to refund the permit fees to the Contractors.</p>
    <p id="b725-4" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[161,690,1156,728]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the trial court’s conclusion that the ordinances and resolution were invalid. The Commonwealth Court, however, decided that the Contractors were not entitled to a refund of the improperly collected fees. Initially, the court determined that the Contractors were not entitled to a refund because they failed to file a written complaint and verified claim as called for by the Local Tax Collection Law, 72 P.S. §§ 5566b-5566c. The court further reasoned that because the Contractors had included the expense of the permit fees in their bids and the School District had reimbursed the Contractors for these fees, the Contractors had suffered no injury. Thus, in the Commonwealth Court’s view, to refund the permit fees to the Contractors would result in a windfall for the Contractors.</p>

The Court unanimously decided that, because the Borough never raised an argument regarding the validity of the vehicle by which the Contractors sought a refund, the Commonwealth Court inappropriately * <em>sponte </em>injected such an issue into the matter. <em><a href="/a2d/755/1267-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="755 A.2d 1267" data-case-ids="11219333,11219449,11219507,225957,225981,225990" data-case-paths="/a2d/755/1267-01,/a2d/755/1267-02,/a2d/755/1267-03,/pa/562/0343-01,/pa/562/0344-01,/pa/562/0343-02">Id.</a> </em>at 1270 and 1272.

In a footnote, the Majority submitted that whether the Contractors, in fact, would receive a windfall was not a foregone conclusion. In this regard, the Majority suggested in passing that “[u]pon the Contractors receipt of a refund, the School District might very well initiate an action against the Contractors asserting, perhaps, a restitution interest in the funds. Thus, any purported windfall might very well be short lived.” <em><a href="/a2d/755/1267-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="755 A.2d 1267" data-case-ids="11219333,11219449,11219507,225957,225981,225990" data-case-paths="/a2d/755/1267-01,/a2d/755/1267-02,/a2d/755/1267-03,/pa/562/0343-01,/pa/562/0344-01,/pa/562/0343-02">Id.</a> </em>at 1272 n. 4.

After making such demand, the District commenced the instant action against the Contractors and the Borough. The complaint raised several claims, all of which sought to have the court order that the permit fees be refunded directly to the School District. The Borough then filed a petition for interpleader to pay the permit fee refund to the court. Upon the agreement of the parties, the Borough deposited the refunded permit fees, which by then totaled more than $180,000, into an escrow account pending the resolution of this litigation. Consequently, the Borough was dismissed from the case. The parties filed a Stipulation of Facts, and the trial court held a hearing in which the District offered the stipulation and rested, and the Contractors offered the testimony of Skepton, Joseph Bozzelli, and the vice-president of Dual Temp.</p>

The trial court denied the District’s motion for post-trial relief and converted the decree nisi into a final decree. The District then filed a Notice of Appeal in the <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>Commonwealth Court, raising three distinct issues. Specifically, the School District asked whether it is entitled to the refunded permit fees since it ultimately paid the cost of the project including the permit fees; whether it has a greater interest in the permit fees than the Contractors because the Contractors were the School District’s agents; and whether the District is entitled to restitution of the illegal permit fees under theories of unjust enrichment and mistake of law.</p>
    <p id="b727-4" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[171,752,1157,896]]]'>In a published opinion, the Commonwealth Court affirmed. <em>Wilson Area School District v.

As to whether the School District is entitled to restitution of the illegal permit fees under the doctrine of unjust enrichment, the court observed, <em>inter alia, </em>that in order for a defendant to be “unjustly” enriched, he or she must receive a benefit wrongfully or passively. <em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">at 631</a>. The court concluded that, because the Contractors obtained the permit fee refund pursuant to this Court’s order following a lengthy litigation process, the Contractors did not obtain the refund either wrongfully or passively. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Court asserted that the Contractors “were not unjustly ‘enriched’ because they did not have the contractual obligation to return any cost savings to the School District.” <em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">Id.</a> </em>For these reasons, the court concluded that the District failed to establish entitlement to relief under the doctrine of unjust enrichment. <em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">Id.</a></em>

In this regard, the court stated that, in Pennsylvania, a party generally is not entitled to equitable relief based upon ignorance or mistake of law when the party had full knowledge of all the material facts when the party entered into the contract. <em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">Id.</a> </em>Here, according to the Commonwealth Court, the School District did not present any evidence at trial to support the alleged mistake of law, nor did the Stipulation of Facts reveal any support for relief under the theory of mistake of law. <em><a href="/a2d/860/0625-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="860 A.2d 625" data-case-ids="9147559" data-case-paths="/a2d/860/0625-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court determined that the School District’s claims for restitution afforded the District no relief.</p>

As this Court has recognized, the doctrine of unjust enrichment contemplates that “[a] person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another must make restitution to the other.” <em>See, e.g., Binns v.

Nor does the District address this Court’s long-held precedent regarding the inapplicability of the doctrine of unjust enrichment when the relationship between parties is founded upon a contract. In feet, the School District does little to bolster its position that it is entitled to restitution based upon the doctrine of unjust enrichment. Instead, the District, in essence, makes a general plea for equitable relief. The School District bases this plea on its belief that returning the illegal fees to the Contractors will allow the Contractors to obtain a windfall at the expense of the District, which ultimately would mean that the local taxpayers would absorb the brunt of the alleged windfall.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

It is the terms of these contracts which control the parties’ rights, duties, and expectations. As noted above, the District does not argue that it is entitled to the refunded permit fees under the terms of the contracts. Rather, the School District would have this Court employ the doctrine of unjust enrichment to find that, based upon its perception of equity and fairness, the District should receive the refunded permit fees. We will not engage in such a task. Instead, consistent with this Court’s prior easelaw, we hold that the doctrine of unjust enrichment is inapplicable here since the relationships between the District and the Contractors were founded upon written contracts. <em>See Third National &amp; Trust Company of Scranton, supra.</em>

    <p id="b730-5" data-blocks='[["BL_730.5",730,[252,1488,1166,858]]]'>Next, we must determine whether the School District is entitled to restitution based upon the doctrine of mistake of law. This Court has defined “mistake of law” as meaning “ ‘a mistake as to the legal consequences of an assumed state of facts.’ ” <em>Betta v. Smith et al., </em><a href="/pa/368/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="368 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="1230345" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0033-01">368 Pa. 33</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20538" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="81 A.2d 538">81 A.2d 538</a>, 539 (1951) (quoting <em>Restatement (First) of Restitution </em>§ 7 (1937)). A general rule in this Commonwealth is that ignorance or mistake of law with full knowledge of the facts is not grounds for equitable relief. <em>First National Bank of Sunbury v. Rockefeller et al., </em><a href="/pa/333/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="333 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1187916" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0553-01">333 Pa. 553</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="5 A.2d 205">5 A.2d 205</a>, 206 (1939). This Court, however, has recognized exceptions to this general rule. For instance, the Court has allowed equitable relief pursuant to the doctrine of mistake of law based upon the “the fundamental principle that no one shall be allowed to enrich himself unjustly at the expense of another by reason of an innocent mistake of law.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 A.2d 205">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="5 A.2d 205">at 207</a>.</p>

      <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>The crux of the School District’s argument regarding mistake of law is that it relied upon the ordinances and resolution, which were later deemed invalid, in determining how much money it was required to pay for the construction of the school. According to the School District, by relying on the ordinances and resolution, the District either overpaid for the permit fees or awarded larger than necessary contracts to the Contractors. The School District asserts that there is clear evidence that a mistake of law occurred in this matter and that such a mistake is a basis for it obtaining restitution of the refunded permit fees. For their part, the Contractors contend, <em>inter alia, </em>that, to the extent that the District made a mistake in entering into the contracts, the mistake was one of law, which, according to the Contractors, is not a ground for equitable relief under the facts of this case.</p>

First, the record clearly demonstrates that the Contractors were responsible for securing and paying for permits and that the Contractors, and not the District, in fact secured and paid for all necessary permits. Moreover, the record does not reflect that the School District relied upon the ordinances and resolution in awarding the contracts to the Contractors or in making any payment to the Contractors. Instead, the District invited public bids for the school project. Along with the invitation to bid, the District informed all bidders in the General Conditions that the successful bidders would be responsible for securing and paying for all permits. The District, therefore, shifted any burden regarding permits and permit fees onto the successful bidders. The District ultimately awarded the contracts to the Contractors simply due to the fact that the Contractors were the lowest responsible bidders, not, as the District insinuates, due to any mistake regarding the legal consequences of the assumed state of facts. In the same vein, there is no evidence that the District paid the Contractors any amount of money based upon a mistake regarding the legal consequences of the assumed state of facts. Rather, the District paid the Contractors the lump sum fees called for by the contracts. Consequently, we <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>find that the School District has not established that a mistake of law occurred here.</p>

I note, however, that I would apply the bright-line rule that a written contract precludes recovery based on unjust enrichment as a general, but not an inviolable, one. In this regard, I would not foreclose the possibility that an action for unjust enrichment might lie in some set of circumstances in which services or benefits are conferred in connection with a contractual relationship that are clearly beyond the contemplation of the parties to the agreement. Such an exception would seem to me to be particularly appropriate in the arena of public contracts. Indeed, it was based on this understanding that I joined the majority opinion in the initial <em>Skepton </em>appeal, with its dictum suggesting that the District might possess a restitutionary interest in some portion of the proceeds from the permit-fees refunds. <em>See Skepton v.
