For the reasons that follow, we hold that within the circumstances of this case the trial court was vested with the discretionary power to appoint counsel from the Public Defender’s Office to serve as standby counsel for a <em>pro se </em>criminal defendant, who was previously determined to be financially ineligible for representation by that office.</p>

On May 18, 2004, the trial court held a pre-trial conference and scheduled trial for August of 2004. On August 20, 2004, prior to the commencement of trial, Attorney Hadley petitioned to withdraw from the case because of Bettelli’s failure to pay his retainer. The trial court granted Attorney Hadley’s motion. On September 24, 2004, during another pre-trial conference, Bettelli decided to proceed <em>pro se </em>after an on the record colloquy. The trial judge found that Bettelli was competent to waive his right to counsel and understood that he was required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not retain new private representation. Acting on his own behalf, Bettelli moved for a continuance, which was granted.</p>

Thereafter, Bettelli again waived his right to counsel, on the record, and chose to proceed <em>pro se.</em>

On November 30, 2004, the Commonwealth filed a motion for a continuance, and requested that the court set a specific date for trial, arguing that it was calling expert witnesses and needed advance notice to secure their attendance. The trial court granted the motion, and set March 7, 2005 for jury selection and March 17, 2005 for trial. Bettelli filed a third <em>pro se </em>motion for a continuance on February 6, 2005, stating that he was attempting to finance a retainer to <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>secure private counsel.

The court conducted a colloquy with Bettelli, at which time he again requested a continuance to obtain private representation. The court determined that Bettelli had ample opportunity to obtain private counsel and directed him to proceed with trial <em>pro se. </em>The court further ordered an attorney from the Public Defender’s Office, in his official capacity, to act as standby counsel,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> even though that office had previously found Bettelli financially ineligible for representation. The trial court determined that the Public Defender’s Office was best suited to represent Bettelli because its lawyers were available and qualified to provide Bettelli with effective assistance. Additionally, given the small size of the Venango County bar, no other lawyer with sufficient experience to represent Bettelli effectively was available. Finally, the court considered the fact that the Commonwealth was prepared to proceed and the case had already experienced multiple delays.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Specifically, the AOPC suggests that if this scenario were to occur again, the Public Defender could simply challenge the appointment by either seeking interlocutory appeal of such order or by seeking the court to certify the issue for appeal. Thus, the AOPC posits, the issue could be reviewed in a future case through <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>these alternative mechanisms, which, therefore, militates against our consideration of the matter now.</p>

Likewise, the Rule requires an incarcerated defendant be tried within 180 days. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 600(E). Under either of the scenarios suggested by the AOPC, a defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial would be implicated and, thus, whether a certified appeal and/or interlocutory appeal were sought by the public defender, as distinct from any defendant, regarding the appointment as standby counsel at the request of the Commonwealth, the adjudication of the appeal could presumably result in the loss of the prosecution. Thus, it does not appear that trial could be delayed while an appeal of the issue was being pursued without the potential of a hampered prosecution and, if, conversely, the trial was conducted, we would face the same mootness argument made herein.

In this unique situation, it was entirely appropriate for the trial court to appoint the Public Defender, even though the Public Defender previously had denied Bettelli representation based on his financial status. The trial judge stated a multitude of reasons for his appointment of the Public Defender and determined that, in this instance, justice required the appointment. The court reasoned that Venango County, a small rural jurisdiction, had only approximately fourteen attorneys who had tried criminal cases in the two years previous to this case. Of those attorneys, the court determined that approximately ten were qualified to defend against a felony-level charge. Included in that list of ten was Attorney Hadley, who had represented Bettelli previously, and who had withdrawn due to Bettelli’s failure to pay him for his legal services. The court determined that he was not an appropriate candidate for appointment. At the time, there were three qualified attorneys in the Public Defender’s Office with caseloads which permitted this representation. The trial court stated that it was concerned with the amount of time that transpired as a result of the granted continuances. The court was cognizant that the District Attorney requested a specific scheduling date to arrange for the appearance of Commonwealth witnesses. As Bettelli attempted to stall proceedings by requesting continuances to obtain counsel, the trial court determined it had reached a point where it needed to force Bettelli to trial.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[253,1987,1160,369]]]'>Thus, we find no flaw in the trial court’s reasoning. Indeed, the court appears to have weighed with care the competing interests in this case and reached an eminently reasonable compromise. Considering the unique facts in this situation, we hold it was proper for the trial court to appoint the Public Defender pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(D) and 122(C)(1) in the interests of justice.</p>

      <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>As noted, the Public Defender’s Office additionally asserts that the Court of Common Pleas’ ability to appoint counsel conflicts with our Court’s decision in <em>Dauphin County </em>where the trial court entered an administrative order specifying income levels based on the Federal Poverty Income Guidelines, which if exceeded would disqualify the applicant for public defender representation. The Dauphin County Public Defender’s Office filed a writ of prohibition arguing that the Dauphin County Court of Common Pleas did not have authority to set eligibility criteria for public defender services. Our Court agreed, and vacated the trial court’s administrative order. We found that the Act specifically provided that if the public defender was “satisfied” with a person’s inability to procure sufficient funds to hire private counsel, it was to provide that person with representation. <em>Dauphin County, </em><a href="/pa/578/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="849 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="1329465,9243904" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0059-01,/a2d/849/1145-01">849 A.2d at 1149</a> (relying on 16 P.S. §§ 9960.1-.13).

On the merits of the question, the Majority approves of the appointment order below by deeming it an “entirely appropriate” exercise of the trial court’s authority and “an eminently reasonable compromise” on the “unique” facts presented. I respectfully disagree with both the Majority’s decision to entertain this Petition and its analysis of the propriety of the lower court’s appointing free counsel to an ineligible defendant. Moreover, I believe that we should refer this matter to the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee to analyze Pa.R.Crim.P. 121 and 122 and consider revisions that would make clear that it is inappropriate to automatically appoint taxpayer-subsidized counsel to ineligible, non-indigent defendants whenever they waive their right to counsel.</p>

The Majority’s ineffectual mandate, thus, is but the epilogue to a purely advisory opinion. The Majority recognizes that the instant litigation is moot, but it nevertheless holds that the standby counsel appointment order falls within the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to mootness. In so holding, the Majority rejects out of hand the cogent argument forwarded by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (“AOPC”) that, if a similar instance of forced representation were to recur, the Public Defender could seek redress through non-extraordinary <em>means </em>— i. <em>e., </em>either by seeking review as of right under the collateral order doctrine, <em>see </em>Pa. R.A.P. 313, or by seeking a permissive interlocutory appeal. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 312 &amp; Chapter 13. The Majority believes that these normal avenues of appellate review are unavailable as a result of Pa.R.Crim.P. 600. The Majority states that:</p>
    <blockquote id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[197,1347,1114,1012]]]'>Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 600, a trial must commence 365 days from the date on which the complaint is filed, if the defendant has been released on bail. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 600(A)(3). Likewise, the Rule requires an incarcerated defendant be tried within 180 days. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 600(E). Under either of the scenarios suggested by the AOPC, a defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial would be implicated and, thus, whether a certified appeal and/or interlocutory appeal were sought by the public defender, as distinct from any defendant, regarding the appointment as standby counsel at the request of the Commonwealth, the adjudication of the appeal could presumably result in the loss of the prosecution. Thus, it does not appear that trial could be delayed while an appeal of the issue was being pursued without the potential of a hampered prosecution and, if, conversely, the trial was conducted, we would face the same mootness argument made herein. Thus, we conclude that the issue is one that is capable of repetition, yet likely to evade review.</blockquote>

Indeed, resort to the Writ is inappropriate under both prongs of the <em>Carpenter-town Coal </em>test: (1) as I have noted in discussing mootness, other appellate remedies exist in the ordinary course; and (2) the abuse of lower court jurisdiction which creates the “extreme necessity” to issue the Writ is not remotely implicated. Indeed, as to the second prong, the Public Defender does not argue that the trial court in this case lacked jurisdiction, or “usurped” its established authority, in issuing its appointment order. To the contrary, the Defender candidly admits that its appointment in this case was fully authorized by this Court’s Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rather than challenging jurisdiction, the gravamen of the Public Defender’s complaint is merely that the trial court’s Rules-based discretionary appointment authority “clash[es] with the discretion granted the Public Defender” under the Public Defender Act. The Public Defender then notes that there is a dearth of appellate case law interpreting the Public Defender’s authority and that is why it has sought extraordinary review here.</p>

However, this is not an extraordinary circumstance calling for a Writ of Prohibition. The Public Defender’s own pleadings make clear that it believes that the court acted in accordance with the Criminal Rules; its dispute is with the Rules themselves, which it believes are in conflict with the discretionary prerogatives reserved under the Public Defender Act. The Writ does not exist so that anytime a party wants to “prohibit” a trial judge from doing something, this Court will step in and remonstrate that judge. Rather, it exists for genuine instances of abuse affecting so fundamental a matter as the lower court’s jurisdiction or power. Here, the Public Defender never acknowledges the controlling, high standard, much less does it try to satisfy the standard. The AOPC is absolutely correct that this is not an instance implicating the Writ of Prohibition.</p>

As the AOPC again correctly notes, the Rules themselves resolve the purported conflict. Criminal Rule 1101, which governs “Suspension of Acts of Assembly,” specifically and unambiguously provides that the Public Defender Act is suspended “insofar as the Act is inconsistent with Rule 122.” It is Rule 122, of course, which authorizes the trial courts to appoint counsel, irrespective of indigency or other concerns, when “the interests of justice so require.”</p>

I have several concerns with the Majority’s approval of the trial court’s drafting of the Public Defender as taxpayer-financed standby counsel for a financially ineligible criminal defendant. First, the Majority does not make clear the governing standard of review. Second, the Majority’s ultimate approval of the appointment order is based upon a finding that it was an “entirely appropriate” decision reflecting “an eminently reasonable compromise” given the “unique” and “narrow” facts here. Majority op. 586 Pa. at 327-29, 898 A.2d at 1281-82. In my view, there was no “compromise” attempted or achieved here; instead, the trial court candidly admitted that it <em>always </em>appoints standby counsel in cases where the defendant is proceeding <em>pro se </em>and it saw no reason to distinguish between the Public Defender and private counsel in following its fixed approach. Third, because the Majority fails to enunciate the proper review standard and the actual basis for the trial court’s decision, it fails to address a more difficult and important issue concerning the proper interpretation of this Court’s Rules, which- appear to authorize — but certainly do not require — the appointment of taxpayer-financed standby counsel to <em>non-indigent </em>criminal defendants in certain cases.</p>

That hope did not pan out, however, and as the trial approached, the court elected not to grant further continuances to the defense.

The Rule is silent on the question of indigency; thus, it draws no distinction between those <em>pro se </em>defendants who are indigent and those who can afford to retain counsel, nor does it suggest a manner of recouping public moneys in a case where standby counsel is appointed for the benefit of a defendant who is financially able to retain his own lawyer.

Moreover, the Comment to Rule 122 makes clear that the broadness of this appointment power is intentional, as it states that this provision “retains in the issuing authority or judge the power to assign counsel regardless of indigency or other factors when, in the issuing authority or judge’s opinion, the interests of justice require it.” Pa.

Although the Rule is written in mandatory terms, the mandate is triggered only when the “interests of justice” so dictate.

Even in the case of an indigent defendant, who is entitled to taxpayer-provided counsel, once that defendant has validly waived the right to counsel, there is no constitutional entitlement to standby assistance. As a constitutional matter, the defendant may choose counsel, or he may choose to represent himself. He is not entitled to both choices, and <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>when he chooses self-representation, he should be prepared for the solitary consequences.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[153,428,1159,1362]]]'>On the other hand, there may be circumstances attending a particular case where the appointment of standby counsel is advisable to vindicate concerns <em>other than </em>the defendant’s right to counsel. The cases involving potentially disruptive defendants provide the best example; obviously, a defendant should not be permitted to employ his right of self-representation in a fashion which makes a mockery of the trial, or ensures the waste and expense of a mistrial. <em>See Mayberry v.

Appointment of counsel in that instance may help to forestall a greater, planned injustice. The unique stakes involved in capital cases may also counsel in favor of a blanket rule requiring standby counsel, whether the defendant is indigent or not. <em>See Commonwealth v. Szuchon, </em><a href="/pa/506/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="506 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1790932" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0228-01">506 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="506 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1790932" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0228-01">484 A.2d 1365</a>, 1376-77 (1984). Moreover, at least where it is an indigent defendant, appointment of taxpayer-financed standby counsel in complex cases, cases where the trial is expected to be lengthy, or cases where there is some indication that the defendant, though competent, is mentally unstable, may further the interests of justice, and with no harm to countervailing interests of the defendant or society, which could be expected to bear the expense of a change in circumstances affecting an indigent defendant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_8" id="ref_footnote_2_8">8</a>

In that instance, the taxpayers should not so cavalierly be expected to foot the bill for the lawyer the defendant has elected not to hire. In my view, in the case of a defendant who can afford counsel, but has elected not to retain counsel, taxpayer-financed standby assistance should be available only where the defendant has refused to hire standby counsel himself, and there is some specific reason to believe that the failure to appoint standby counsel may cause a greater public financial calamity (such as a mistrial or other significant waste of time -and/or resources). In short, the appointment in that instance should exist only to further the public interest, and not the whim or caprice of the defendant. At a minimum, if counsel is to be appointed for a non-indigent defendant at public expense, some mechanism should be put in place to recoup the costs of the appointment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_9" id="ref_footnote_2_9">9</a>

It is not a sufficient answer in the face of that argument to say: “we always appoint standby counsel, even to non-indigent defendants who waive counsel.” In my view, that answer was clearly an abuse of discretion. Moreover, there was nothing in the circumstances of this case to suggest that an appointment of standby counsel was necessary to protect the public <em>interest </em>— e.g., there was no suggestion that Bettelli would seek to disrupt the proceedings or try to force a mistrial. The taxpayers should not be expected to bear the expense of an <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>appointment of standby counsel for this defendant, who was financially able to secure his own counsel, but who elected not to (whether out of parsimony, ill judgment, a fervent desire to represent himself, or obstreperousness), and who affirmatively waived his right to counsel and elected to proceed <em>pro se.</em>
