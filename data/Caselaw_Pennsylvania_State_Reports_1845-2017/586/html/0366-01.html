      <em> </em>to compel such a ruling where an alibi instruction is not included in a jury charge. Rather than contest this interpretation of <em>Roxberry II, </em>the Commonwealth argues that our own cases on ineffectiveness and the alibi instruction are inconsistent and that we should conclude that a finding of prejudice <em>per se </em>is not necessary where an alibi instruction has not been given. We find that the courts below generally have misconstrued the intended breadth of <em>Roxberry II. </em>In this case, where trial counsel articulated a reasonable and sound basis for deliberately declining to seek an alibi instruction, we conclude that trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.

Notably, he did not suggest that such testimony itself serves no purpose, nor did he suggest that counsel should not highlight alibi evidence for the jury in closing. He simply expressed his discomfort, under the circumstances at bar, with the expectations a specific alibi instruction might raise in the minds of the venire, and explained that it was his practice to avoid disappointing such expectations where possible.

(“The lower court, however, found that <em>Roxberry II </em>in effect short circuits the <em>Pierce </em>test because <em>Roxberry II </em>‘does not permit either a finding that Appellee was not prejudiced or a finding that counsel had a reasonable strategy.’ ”). I disagree. I view the Superior Court’s analysis as merely rejecting this particular trial counsel’s basis for failing to seek the alibi instruction in this particular case. <em>See Hawkins, </em><a href="/a2d/848/0954-01" class="citation" data-index="193" data-cite="848 A.2d 954" data-case-ids="9249288" data-case-paths="/a2d/848/0954-01">848 A.2d at 958-60</a>.
