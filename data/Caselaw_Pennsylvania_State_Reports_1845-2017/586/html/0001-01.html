Kuss &amp; Associates, Inc., to manage and administer pension plans for the Township’s employees. As a fiduciary of the Township, Kuss had the authority to open accounts for the Township, to sign and endorse checks payable to the Township’s pension plans, and to transfer funds for the Township. Kuss misappropriated eight checks payable to the Township’s Pension Plan by depositing the checks in an escrow account established under the name “Robert J. Kuss <em>&amp; </em>Associates, Inc.,” which Kuss maintained through appellant, Mellon PSFS Bank. The checks were issued between June 7, 1989 and March 23, 1990, and were payable to “The Board of Commissioners TTEE Springfield Township PEN PLS.” Kuss endorsed seven of the eight checks: “For Deposit Only <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>2-196-061.” He endorsed the eighth check: “For Deposit Only 2-196-061 On Account Springfield Twp Pen Plan.”</p>

In September, 1995, the Township filed a complaint, in which it sought to recover the amount of the eight checks Mellon credited to Kuss’s account. In its complaint, the Township included claims for statutory conversion, negligence, and “money had and received.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Township withdrew its negligence claim prior to trial.</p>

The jury also determined, with respect to the seven checks endorsed with “For Deposit Only 2-196-061,” the Township established claims for conversion and for “money had and received.” Therefore, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Township in the amount of the seven checks.</p>

Based on this reading of <em>Jones, </em>Mellon asserts its knowledge of Kuss’s status as a fiduciary of the Township is wholly immaterial and, because the Township had authorized Kuss to endorse all checks payable to the Township’s pension plan, including the eight in question, the UFA shields Mellon from liability in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Mellon asserts this Court has already properly decided <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>this issue in <em>Jones, Backer, </em>and <em>Strong. </em>Accordingly, Mellon advocates overruling <em>Levy </em>and reversing the Superior Court’s decision below.</p>

The plain language of the statute states that if a fiduciary has the power to do that which the bank allows him to do, <em>ie., </em>endorse and deposit checks “in a bank to his personal credit” — or in this case to his business account — the bank is not liable regardless of whether it knew of his fiduciary status.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The statute does not list knowledge of a fiduciary’s status as a requisite to the bank’s insulation from liability; that element, that prerequisite to protection, simply does not exist in the statute. “Only if a statute is unclear may a court embark on the task of ascertaining the intent of the legislature by reviewing the necessity of the act, the object to be attained, circumstances under which it was enacted and the mischief to be remedied.” <em>Coretsky v.

Simply stated, a bank could not act in bad faith or have actual knowledge that the fiduciary was breaching his or her obligations to a principal if the bank never knew the fiduciary was, in fact, a fiduciary. Thus, a bank’s knowledge that it is dealing with a fiduciary is necessary in order for the statute to have meaning.

While a Prefatory Note does not control the disposition of the issue before the Court, it certainly demonstrates the drafter’s intent, which is particularly relevant here since our Legislature adopted Section 9 of the UFA in the exact same substantive form as the uniform law drafted by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the emphasized language above clearly indicates that the drafters of the UFA intended for the Act to protect banks in situations where banks know that they are dealing with fiduciaries.</p>
