While driving her own car insured by Appellee State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm), Jayneann M. Craley was killed in an accident attributed to the negligence of an uninsured drunk driver on July 12, 1993. tier infant son, Keith Craley, and her mother-in-law, Gloria Craley, who resided with Keith and Jayneann, were passengers in the car and were injured in the accident. Following the accident, Jayneann’s husband, Randall Craley, as administrator of Jayneann’s estate and on Keith’s behalf, and Gloria Craley on her own behalf sought and collected uninsured motorist benefits from State Farm pursuant to a policy for which Jayneann was the named insured and which provided coverage of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per occurrence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

It is Randall’s policy and its exclusions that are relevant to the legal issues presented in this case.

Evidently by ignoring subsection (b)’s provision of waiver of the stacking required by subsection (a) without distinguishing inter- and intra-policy stacking, the court focused upon subsections (c)’s and (d)’s restricted application. The court concluded that it could not hold that the-notice set forth in subsection (d) must be provided in both inter- and intra-policy stacking situations, as to do so would conflict with subsection (c)’s application to multiple-vehicle policies only. Without contemplating whether notice could otherwise be provided, the court instead resolved the ambiguity by construing subsections (b) and (c) together to provide that “only named insureds who purchase coverage for more than one vehicle under a single policy will be entitled to notice and the opportunity to waive stacking,” finding that, “[h]ad the legislature intended [to permit] all named insureds to waive stacking, it would have utilized different language in subsection (d).” <em>Id. </em>at 708.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a>

While acknowledging that subsections (c) and (d) address intra-policy stacking waiver to the exclusion of inter-policy stacking, State Farm asserts that nothing in the section prohibits the waiver of inter-policy stacking. Indeed, State Farm argues that to deny insureds the ability to obtain a reduced premium in exchange for the waiver of stacking on a policy covering a single-vehicle would be contrary to the cost-containment purpose of the MVFRL and would unfairly penalize those who only own one vehicle, who would be unable to avail themselves of the cost-saving measure. State Farm notes that the Craleys chose to insure their cars with limited uninsured motorist coverage, which included the stacking waiver, and consequently, received a reduced premium.

If a named insured insures some cars under one policy ("the policy”) and others under a separate policy (“the second policy”) and signs the form provided in subsection (d) which refers to the waiver of stacking "for each motor vehicle insured under <em>the policy," </em>that named insured reasonably could assume that he received a reduced premium for waiver of the stacking of the limits regarding the vehicles insured by "the policy” with no knowledge that he was waiving stacking of the applicable limits of "the policy” to "the second policy,” despite paying premiums on both policies.

I write separately in order to express my views regarding the inconsistency between the written rejection form found at 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)(1) and the remainder of Section 1738 of the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738.</p>

Similarly, unlike the Majority, I believe the plain language of Subsection (b) of 1738 generally provides named insureds with the option to waive stacking of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, which would include both inter- and intra-policy stacking. Subsection (c) specifically requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that each <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>named insured purchasing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for more than one vehicle under a policy must be provided with the opportunity to waive the stacking of such coverage. Subsection (d)(1) of 1738 moves back to the general and instructs that “[t]he named insured shall be informed that he may exercise the waiver of the stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage by signing” the legislatively prescribed written rejection form. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)(1).</p>
    <p id="b714-4" data-blocks='[["BL_714.4",714,[258,765,1163,366]]]'>All of this leads me to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to allow for inter- and intra-policy stacking of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage and for the waiver of the same. With that said, when measured against the remainder of Section 1738, there is an inconsistency in the aforementioned written rejection form regarding the waiver of inter-policy stacking.</p>
    <p id="b714-5" data-blocks='[["BL_714.5",714,[301,1160,805,40]]]'>The written rejection form reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b714-6" data-blocks='[["BL_714.6",714,[297,1223,1125,472]]]'>By signing this waiver, I am rejecting stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage under the policy for myself and members of my household under <em>which the limits of coverage available would be the sum of limits for each motor vehicle insured under the policy. </em>Instead, the limits of coverage that I am purchasing shall be reduced to the limits stated in the policy. I knowingly and voluntarily reject the stacked limits of coverage. I understand that my premiums will be reduced if I reject this coverage.</blockquote>
    <p id="b714-7" data-blocks='[["BL_714.7",714,[255,1722,1166,636]],["BL_715.1",715,[174,314,1154,93]]]'>75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d)(1) (emphasis added). The emphasized language above seems to indicate that if a named insured would decide not to waive stacking, then the amount of coverage available would be the sum of the limits for each vehicle insured under the named insured’s policy. This rejection form, therefore, appears to speak only to the effects of intra-policy stacking and not to the effects of inter-policy stacking, which would permit the limits of coverage available to be the sum of the limits for each motor vehicle insured under the policy and/or any other relevant policies. I respectfully submit that the General Assembly could cure the inconsistency between the written rejection form and the remainder <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>of Section 1738 if the General Assembly would amend the written rejection form as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.4",715,[217,424,1115,471]]]'>By signing this waiver, I am rejecting stacked limits of uninsured motorist coverage under the policy for myself and members of my household under which the limits of coverage available would be the sum of limits for each motor vehicle insured under the policy <em>or the policies. </em>Instead, the limits of coverage that I am purchasing shall be reduced to the limits stated in the policy. I knowingly and voluntarily reject the stacked limits of coverage. I understand that my premiums will be reduced if I reject this coverage.</blockquote>
    <p id="A5I" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[172,918,1157,631]]]'>I do not believe that the inconsistency between the written rejection form and the remainder of Section 1738 renders Randall Craley’s particular rejection of the stacking of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage invalid or unenforceable as it applies to inter-policy stacking. The reality is that because Mr. Craley only insured one vehicle under his policy, when he signed the rejection form, he “could not have thought he was receiving a reduced premium for waiving intra-policy stacking [since] there could be no intra-policy stacking with only one vehicle on ‘the policy.’ ” Majority Opinion 586 Pa. at 504, 895 A.2d at 542. I, therefore, am able to join the result reached by the Majority Opinion.</p>
