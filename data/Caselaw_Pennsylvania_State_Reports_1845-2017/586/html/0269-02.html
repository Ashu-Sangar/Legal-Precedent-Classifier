Mawson argued that Ruhl’s filing of the POC resulted in a statutory release of Mawson up to the $1,000,000 limit of its Reliance insurance policy. Mawson asserted that contract law principles of offer and acceptance did not apply in liquidation because the POC process is a statutory mechanism. Mawson also maintained that, in establishing Pennsylvania’s statutory scheme, the General Assembly adopted a form of burden shifting among the interested parties in an insolvency, where standing is conferred upon third party claimants to assert claims directly against the insolvent insurer’s estate, while the insolvent insurer’s insureds, in turn, receive some benefit of the insurance coverage they had purchased. Furthermore, Mawson denied Ruhl’s allegations that there were discovery violations in the tort action which had caused Ruhl to file its POC. Mawson also requested a scheduling order to allow depositions if President Judge Colins was concerned that there was insufficient factual information to decide the matter.

Ruhl further maintained that the Liquidator actually treated his POC as withdrawn as evidenced by the Liquidator’s December 13, 2002 letter informing Ruhl that the POC was designated “inactive.” Additionally, Ruhl maintained that Mawson’s non-disclosure of its excess insurance coverage affected his decision to file the POC, and that once Ruhl became aware that Mawson was going to rely on the POC and its attendant release, he withdrew it. <em>Id. </em>at 19-21, 47-48.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

The Liquidator explained that Article V of the Pennsylvania Act is based upon the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) model act entitled “Insurer’s Supervision Rehabilitation and Liquidation Model Act,” (“Model Act”), which derives from Wisconsin’s Insurer’s Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act of 1967 (“Wisconsin Act”). <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="Wis. Stat. § 645.01">Wis. Stat. § 645.01</a> <em>et seq. </em>In the Liquidator’s view, the filing of a POC is a statutory event which releases the policy holder up to the applicable insurance policy limits. The Liquidator rejected the notion that contract law was applicable because the statutory language, outlining the automatic effect of the POC, is clear. Citing the Comments to the Wisconsin Act as support, the Liquidator argued that important public policy is furthered via a proper application of the statute because, under Section 221.40(a), the General Assembly sought to allocate the unavoidable losses and burdens occasioned by the disruptive event of the insolvency of an insurance company. In this endeavor, the General Assembly made a decision to provide certain protections for policy <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>holders, including some economic benefit for the premiums they had paid. The Liquidator also noted that the decision in this case would affect not only the parties here, but other insolvent estates, some of which rely more heavily upon POC releases. <em><a href="/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="Wis.

    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[154,592,1156,1279]]]'>The Liquidator explained that, during an insurance company insolvency, a third party claimant makes a voluntary decision respecting whom to seek recovery from. In the Liquidator’s view, if the third party claimant elects to file a knowing and voluntary POC and thus to seek recovery from the insolvent insurer’s estate, that filing is an irrevocable elective event which forecloses that party from pursuing other remedies, and particularly bars him from pursuing policy holders.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The Liquidator noted that Ruhl had the opportunity to pursue a tort action against Mawson without filing a POC, and thus to see what he could recover directly from Mawson. The Liquidator asserted that Ruhl’s POC release was not conditional and that no other action except its very filing was required in order to effectuate the statutory release. In the Liquidator’s view, Ruhl was attempting to “hedge his bets” because it turned out that Mawson may be solvent enough to satisfy the remainder of the judgment. The Liquidator maintained that this was the very sort of situation the statute sought to prevent. The Liquidator also advised the court that it never treats POCs as withdrawn, and that filed POCs are administratively transferred to an inactive status where they remain until reactivated by the filer or until the ultimate resolution of the liquidation of the estate. <em><a href="/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20645.01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="Wis.

Mawson argues that the plain language of Section 221.40(a) requires a finding that the act of filing a third party POC in an insurance company liquidation operates as a release of the insured’s liability in the amount of the applicable policy limits of the insolvent insurer. Mawson further contends that once the POC is filed, the statute permits no express or implicit opportunity for withdrawal, and thus the POC cannot be construed as an “offer” to the Liquidator that can be unilaterally withdrawn prior to acceptance.</p>

McCafferty, </em><a href="/pa/563/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="563 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="1366957" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0146-01">563 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/a2d/758/1155-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="758 A.2d 1155" data-case-ids="11196913,11196965,1366942,1366957" data-case-paths="/a2d/758/1155-01,/a2d/758/1155-02,/pa/563/0145-01,/pa/563/0146-01">758 A.2d 1155</a>, 1165 n. 13 (2000).

In this regard, Mawson first challenges the lower court’s predicate finding that a POC is akin to a petition under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, noting that the court cited no support for that conclusion. Mawson argues that there is no basis in the statute or in petition practice for the lower court’s conclusion that a POC should be deemed no different than any other petition filed against an adversary in civil practice.</p>

The purpose of the statute, as squarely set forth in Section 221.1(c), is to balance and protect the interests of the insured, creditors and the public by minimizing legal uncertainty and litigation, and thereby, Mawson argues, the statute seeks to ensure an “equitable apportionment of any unavoidable loss.” <em>See </em>40 P.S. § 221.1(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> Mawson submits that the lower court’s essentially <em>ad hoc </em>approach compromises the certainty that is supposed to result from the statutory POC release provision. Mawson asserts that, once Ruhl filed the POC, both Mawson and Ruhl were intended to benefit from this statutory scheme — Ruhl by being afforded third party standing to ensure some sort of recovery in the liquidation matter, with Mawson receiving the functional equivalent of the protection of the original insurance policy. The lower court’s approach, in Mawson’s view, directly negates the purpose of the statute.</p>

Mawson notes that there is no statutory, procedural or decisional authority in Pennsylvania to support such a standard in the POC withdrawal paradigm. Moreover, Mawson notes that both parties here were “disadvantaged” as a result of Reliance’s insolvency, and Mawson clearly was further disadvantaged by Ruhl’s being permitted to withdraw his POC. Absent the release, Mawson notes that it is now individually obligated to Ruhl for the portion of the jury verdict above the PPCIGA statutory limit of $300,000. In this regard, Mawson explains that although Federated agreed to assume Mawson’s defense in the underlying tort action, Federated was not obligated to (and in fact did not) agree to indemnify Mawson for any liability below the trigger for its excess coverage. Mawson posits that withdrawal, if <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>appropriate at all, should be permitted only where there is proof of fraud, collusion or other extraordinary circumstances.</p>

Mawson maintains that the 1998 interrogatories were answered truthfully because Ruhl sought disclosure of Mawson’s automobile insurance carrier information, and Mawson supplied Ruhl with that very information, <em>i.e., </em>the $1,000,000 insurance policy with Reliance. Mawson asserts that it did not deny or conceal the existence of the $10,000,000 Federated excess insurance coverage because Ruhl did not ask about “excess” insurance coverage.</p>

Ruhl opposes a plain language reading of the statute, reasoning, as President Judge Cohns did, that such an interpretation would produce a harsh and draconian result that the statute does not intend. Ruhl also notes that nothing in the statute expressly and affirmatively prohibits the withdrawing of a POC; surely, he submits, if the General Assembly intended such a prohibition, it could have included language that would explicitly bar withdrawal. In the absence of such an express prohibition against withdrawal, Ruhl argues, the lower court properly analogized the filing of a POC to petition practice, and properly adopted a petition practice standard of permitting a POC withdrawal upon cause shown.</p>

In light of that fact, he argues, President Judge Colins did not abuse his discretion in finding that Ruhl may withdraw the POC. Ruhl suggests that, for any POC and attendant release to be valid, it must have been knowingly and voluntarily executed and filed. Ruhl argues that the fact that he had no knowledge of Mawson’s excess insurance coverage at the time he filed the POC calls into question whether it was knowing and voluntary.

And, viewing the subsection as a whole, the term plainly bears its usual, mandatory meaning. Certainly, there is no textual ambiguity: “the filing of the claim shall operate as a release.” Moreover, the fact that the provision goes on to list a single circumstance where the release may be rendered null and void — “if the insurance coverage is avoided by the liquidator” — merely reinforces that, in other instances, the imperative, absolute effect controls. Therefore, under the statute’s plain meaning, when a third party POC is filed in an insurance liquidation, that very filing acts as a release of the insured’s liability to the third party on that action in the amount of the applicable policy limit.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[154,1338,1155,1021]]]'>Ruhl is correct, of course, that the statute does not specifically state that the party who tenders a POC cannot later withdraw it. But this circumstance neither creates an ambiguity nor warrants interpreting the statute in a fashion that would negate what its affirmative language commands. The statute commands that the filing operates as the release. Given the mandatory language employed, it was not necessary for the General Assembly to tediously list, and then disavow, all litigation measures that might seek to undo the imperative language. Where mandatory language is employed, there is no need to engage in the redundancy of disapproving individual exceptions. What is more significant is that the plain language of the statute explicitly recognizes one and only one manner of nullifying the release — where the liquidator avoids coverage. That fact strongly suggests that the General Assembly knew how to recognize an exception, and intended no other exceptions than the single one it listed. A right to withdraw a filed POC is simply not expressed nor is it implied in the plain language of Section 221.40(a).</p>

Our General Assembly noted that two significant goals of Article V are to “minimize legal uncertainty and litigation,” and to provide “equitable apportionment of any unavoidable loss.” The Act poses a difficult decision for a third party plaintiff, a difficulty made necessary by the unfortunate and uncontrollable fact of the insolvency, a fact which affects the plaintiff and the insured alike. The Act also fixes the point of that decision at the time <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>when the plaintiff files the POC, thus indicating his election to seek relief via the liquidation proceeding. That filing creates an expectation of some measure of security for the plaintiff as well as the insured policy holder. There is nothing harsh or draconian in the General Assembly’s determining that, once such an election is made to participate in the liquidation proceeding, the election controls. Such a fixed point obviously minimizes uncertainty and reduces litigation. Moreover, the plaintiff has ample opportunity before making his election to determine whether the insured is individually financially responsible such that it may be to his advantage not to seek relief via liquidation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> For these reasons, in this Court’s view, enforcement of the statute according to its plain and unambiguous terms is fully consistent with the articulated legislative purpose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>

The statutory scheme as enacted by the Liquidator thus provided ample opportunity for Rulil to investigate his options.</p>

In addition to the fact that we fail to see how holding a third party plaintiff to his election pursuant to the plain language of the statute is contrary to the legislative purpose as a matter of construction, it is difficult to follow the claim, implicitly accepted by the lower court here, that the plain language result is harsh and draconian in this case. Ruhl elected both to file a POC, thereby limiting his recovery under Maw-son’s primary insurance policy, and to proceed with his tort action against Mawson — a course which made sense only if Ruhl hoped or expected that there was some source (excess insurance or Mawson’s resources) to satisfy a monetary judgment rendered in an amount beyond the $1,000,000 limit of the Reliance Policy. Discovery of the excess policy with Federated — the fact which the lower court cited as warranting withdrawal of the POC — at best might have confirmed the litigation decision to continue with the tort action which Ruhl already had made. It is not self-evident how the alleged non-disclosure can be said to have prejudiced Ruhl by causing him to file the POC.</p>

In light of the broad nature of the Commonwealth Court’s resolution, and the uncertain and incomplete state of the record, it is not <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>apparent whether our review disposes of all questions properly presented in the litigation below. It will be for the Commonwealth Court to determine, in the first instance, the independence and viability of any other presented challenges Ruhl raised to Mawson’s petition to enforce the POC.</p>
