The Department found that Drivers were free from such control and direction when providing their driving services for Appellees.

Viktor does not reimburse Drivers for expenses. Drivers pay for their own business cards, cell phones, advertising, clothing, home phones, and home offices, in the event that they operate an office from their home. If a Driver accepts an assignment from Victor that he or she cannot perform, Driver may chose a substitute to fulfill the assignment, and Driver is then obligated to pay that substitute on his or her own.
