While Braun ultimately replaced the funds, the ODC instituted disciplinary <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>proceedings and recommended disbarment. Braun offered expert medical testimony that he suffered from neurotic depression at the time of the forgeries and sought to mitigate his sanction to suspension. This Court determined that Braun established a sufficient causal connection between his psychiatric disorder and the underlying professional misconduct, and the “[psychiatric disorder [was] an appropriate consideration as a mitigating factor in a disciplinary proceeding....” <em>Braun, </em>at 895-96. This Court followed the Board’s recommendation that the established mental disorder and requisite causal connection to the misconduct, coupled with the underlying facts of Braun’s case, justified suspension rather than disbarment. <em>Id., </em>at 896.</p>

      <em>Grigsby, </em>at 733 (citation omitted). Respondent has admitted that for 18 years (from 1982-2000), he was incapable of telling the truth in official documents or at official proceedings when it was in his perceived personal interest not to do so. Although the Hearing Committee found this pattern of deceit disturbing, it held <em>Braun </em>obligated only a sanction of suspension. We find respondent’s level of fraud, which transcended professions and jurisdictions, requires disbarment. <em>See Renfroe, </em>at 403-04 (“The power of a court to disbar an attorney should be exercised with great caution, but there should be no hesitation in exercising it when it clearly appears that it is demanded for the protection of the public.”) (quoting <em>Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

      <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>In light of the falsehoods and material omissions that riddled Respondent’s application to sit for the bar examination, it is patently obvious that the Board of Law Examiners did not have a full and fair opportunity to determine whether he should have been admitted as an attorney in the first instance. Simply to disbar Respondent without revoking his license rewards him for having lied successfully because a petition for reinstatement will not require him to submit a new application for admission to the Board of Law Examiners and take another bar examination. Only by requiring Respondent to begin the admissions process <em>ab initio </em>can we be assured that he has the requisite fitness and character to be a member of the bar.</p>
