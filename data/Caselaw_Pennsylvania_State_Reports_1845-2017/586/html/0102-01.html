Both the trial court and the Superior Court held that appellees, the putative grandparents in this case, were entitled to pursue visitation under the Act as a result of their <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship to the mother of the child. For the reasons that follow, this Court agrees that appellees had standing, and therefore, we affirm.</p>

In 1979, shortly after Francesca was born, appellee Maryann Costello began babysitting her. When Francesca was eleven months old, her biological mother died and her biological father, Francis Szypula, left her in the custody of appellees.

    <p id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[263,656,1162,673]]]'>On November 8,1997, while still residing with appellees and unmarried, Francesca gave birth to Felicity. Appellant Teddy Peters, who was twenty-three years of age at the time of Felicity’s birth, is the child’s biological father. Francesca and Felicity lived with appellees for the first four years of Felicity’s life, while appellant lived elsewhere. In March of 1999, appellant petitioned for shared custody of Felicity, which the trial court granted. Then, in November of 2001, appellant petitioned for and was awarded primary physical custody, while Francesca had partial custody which was limited to weekly supervised visits. Appellant allowed appellees to see Felicity at Christmas in 2001, but denied them access to the child thereafter.</p>

That action was consolidated with the existing custody dispute. The trial court held a consolidated hearing on October 30, 2002, at which Francesca, Daniel Costello, Felicity’s teachers, appellant, a clinical psychologist hired by appellant, and appellant’s neighbor testified. Mr. Costello testified that, although Francesca is not his biological daughter, he and his wife raised her as their own since she was eleven months old, and he has had a lifelong father-daughter relationship with her. He further testified that Felicity lived with appellees for a period of four years from the time of her birth until November 2, 2001, when appellant was granted primary physical custody. Mr. Costello testified that Felicity called him “Poppy” and called Mrs. Costello “Mamona;” that appellees had always regarded Felicity as their own grandchild; and that they had had a continuous and close relationship with Felicity and spent much time with her, including birthdays and holidays. Further, during the years <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>when Felicity lived with appellees, appellant neither questioned nor objected to their <em>de facto </em>grandparental relationship with the child. After primary physical custody was awarded to appellant, Mr. Costello attempted to see Felicity by calling appellant or stopping him on the street to ask for access, but appellant was unaccommodating.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[230,659,1155,528]]]'>Francesca testified that, since November of 2001, she had been allowed only supervised visitation with Felicity on Sundays at the Family Court facility in Philadelphia. She stated that Felicity was very attached to appellees, whom Francesca referred to as her parents. When Francesca had custody of Felicity, she resided with appellees, and Mrs. Costello cared for the child while Francesca was at work. Francesca stated that Mrs. Costello and Felicity enjoyed a loving relationship, with Mrs. Costello willing to do whatever she could for Felicity.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[230,1217,1153,417]]]'>Dr. Najma Davis, a clinical social worker hired by appellant to perform a custody evaluation, also testified. Dr. Davis noted that she had visited appellees’ home; she described appellees’ relationship to Felicity as that of grandparents; stated that she considered appellees to be Felicity’s grandparents; and testified that, in her professional opinion, appellees should continue to maintain a grandparental relationship with Felicity.</p>
    <p id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[227,1663,1153,420]]]'>Appellant testified that appellees are not Felicity’s biological grandparents, but acknowledged that he had treated them as Felicity’s grandparents since she was born. Appellant also stated his view that a grandparent should not have a right to be involved with a grandchild if it would be detrimental to the child and, in his view, the care issues existing in the Costello home, issues which in part led to his successful custody petition, were such a detriment.</p>
    <p id="b315-8" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[224,2112,1154,258]]]'>On November 13, 2002, the trial court heard Felicity’s testimony <em>in camera. </em>Though understandably not very forthcoming given her age, Felicity did tell the court that she would like to live with her father, but also would like to spend time with appellees, whom she called “Poppy” and “Grandmom.”</p>

      <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>The trial court issued an order on November 15, 2002, awarding shared legal custody of Felicity to Francesca and appellant, with appellant having primary physical custody and Francesca having partial physical custody limited to the first and third weekend of every month, from Friday evening to Sunday evening. The court also granted appellees partial custody/visitation on the fourth weekend of every month from Friday evening to Sunday evening. In addition, the court apportioned a designated list of holidays among appellant, Francesca and appellees, and awarded appellees seven days of vacation-related physical custody, occurring at the conclusion of school each June. Finally, the court ordered that appellees should have liberal, unmonitored telephone access to Felicity.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[269,1031,1158,1113]]]'>Appellant appealed to the Superior Court, but only as to the partial custody/visitation award to appellees. Appellant argued that the trial court erred in finding that appellees had standing under the Grandparent Visitation Act, where appellees were neither the biological nor the adoptive grandparents of Felicity. The trial court filed an opinion in which it noted that it had found that appellees stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to Francesca because they assumed parental status when they entered into the custody agreement with Francesca’s biological father and actually discharged parental duties for nearly all of Francesca’s life. The court further noted that the rights and duties springing from a relationship <em>in loco parentis </em>are the same as in a biological parent-child relationship. With respect to appellant’s argument that appellees cannot be considered Felicity’s grandparents because they are not her biological grandparents, the trial court noted that nothing in the Act, or in the common meaning of the term “grandparent,” restricted grandparental status to those with a biological relationship to the child. Therefore, the court determined that, as a result of their <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship with Francesca, appellees were Felicity’s maternal grandparents.</p>

Subsection (a) provides that grandparents may petition for partial custody and visitation, and authorizes the court to grant such relief, in the following circumstances:</p>

    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[222,1378,1156,528]]]'>With respect to the merits of the petition, the court noted that it had found that allowing appellees partial custody and visitation was in the child’s best interest. The best interest finding was based upon the evidence revealing that Felicity had a close relationship with appellees; that the child herself expressed a desire to see appellees; and that appellant’s own expert opined than this grandparental relationship should be maintained. Finally, the court noted that there was no evidence that the custody schedule it had ordered would interfere with either parent’s relationship with the child.</p>
    <p id="b317-8" data-blocks='[["BL_317.8",317,[221,1935,1153,423]],["BL_318.1",318,[265,315,1162,351]]]'>The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished opinion. The panel noted, as the trial court had, that <em>in loco parentis </em>status embodies an assumption of parental status as well as an actual discharge of parental duties, and gives rise to a relation which is “ 'exactly the same as between parent and child.’ ” Slip op. at 3 (citation omitted). The panel found that appellant had proffered no reason why, when someone assumes parental status with respect to a child, “that status and the standing it <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>confers <em>vis a vis </em>a grandchild must be disregarded” especially where, as here, those seeking access to the child “are regarded by all those concerned as operative grandparents.” <em>Id. </em>at 4. Finally, the panel rejected appellant’s argument that the Act applies only to biological grandparents, agreeing with the trial court that the statute contains no such restriction. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>
    <p id="b318-6" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[264,697,1163,1211]]]'>For purposes of this appeal, appellant does not dispute the trial court’s findings that appellees stand <em>in loco parentis </em>to Francesca; that they served as <em>de facto </em>grandparents to Felicity; and that maintaining that relationship would be in the child’s best interest. Instead, appellant confines himself to the preliminary and strictly legal question of appellees’ standing to seek visitation and/or partial custody under the Grandparent Visitation Act. Appellant contends here, as he did below, that the Act does not confer standing upon putative grandparents who are neither the adoptive nor the biological grandparents of the child in question. The narrow issue presented is primarily a question of statutory interpretation, and as such, this Court’s review is plenary. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Because appellees are not Felicity’s biological or adoptive grandparents, appellant argues that they are third parties who lacked standing to petition for visitation under the Act. Moreover, appellant argues that recognizing standing in the situation of appellees here will turn the narrow grandparent exception into a broad one whereby any person who stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to a parent during that parent’s childhood could later seek visitation with that parent’s children, which <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>possibly could lead to disputes between “[a]ctual legitimate grandparents” and previous parental caretakers claiming to be “better” grandparents.

Instead, it simply speaks of grandparents (and great-grandparents). In construing the term, this Court must look to the “common and approved usage” of the term “grandparent.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “grandparent” as “a parent’s parent.” <em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary </em>(2002), 988. The same dictionary defines “parent” as follows: “la: one that begets or brings forth offspring: Father, Mother; b[law] (1): a lawful parent (2): a person standing in loco parentis although not a natural parent....” <em>Id. </em>at 1641 (emphasis supplied). <em>See also The Merriam Webster Dictionary </em>(1997), 535 (defining “parent” as “1: one that begets or brings forth offspring: FATHER, MOTHER[;] 2: one who brings up and cares for another”) (emphasis supplied).

As appellant concedes in equating adoptive grandparental status with biological grandparental status, there are instances <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>in the law where non-biological family status has the same legal effect as biological status. But, <em>in loco parentis </em>relationships, like adoptive relationships, have a settled place in the law as well, and generate equivalent parental rights and responsibilities. Consistently with the view of the Court Majority in <em>T.B., </em>we will not read the General Assembly’s failure to address the various permutations of parentage in Section 5313(a) as reflecting an intention to eliminate grandpa-rental relationships that have their roots in the common law doctrine. 786 A.2d at 918 (General Assembly’s failure to address common law <em>in loco parentis </em>doctrine in provisions respecting custody cannot “act to repeal by implication what has been entrenched in our common law.”).</p>

As we have noted above, it is settled that “[t]he rights and liabilities arising out of an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship are, as the words imply, exactly the same as between parent and child.” <em>Id. </em>at 917 (emphasis supplied). One of the natural incidents of parenthood is that parents become the grandparents of their children’s children. And, indeed, it is notable that appellees here in fact assumed the status of <em>de facto </em>grandparents when Francesca gave birth to Felicity while still living at home, and filled that role for a substantial portion of the child’s life, since they housed Francesca and Felicity for four years and cared for the child when Francesca worked. In light of the settled legal effect of <em>in loco parentis </em>status, it seems unlikely in the extreme that the General Assembly intended that persons with a legal relationship “exactly the same” as that of a parent to a child would be deemed to have no legally cognizable relationship with the offspring of that child.</p>

Section 5313(a) standing is specifically limited to those grandparents seeking visitation with a grandchild who “has resided with his grandparents or great-grandparents for a period of 12 months or more and is subsequently removed from the home by his parents.” Thus, it does not encompass every grandparent, much less every person who may seek to forward a claim for <em>“in loco” </em>grandparent status. Therefore, appellant’s concern that affirmance of the decision below would permit any non-biological caretakers of a child’s parent to file a petition for partial custody or visitation is baseless.

Appellees are not officious intermeddlers or mere “prior caretakers,” as appellant would have it. As a result of their willingness to step in and actually perform the roles of parents and grandparents, they have distinguished themselves from all other persons lacking a biological or adoptive relationship with this child. In this regard, appellant’s argument that the fact <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>that Felicity has a living, biological maternal grandparent justifies denying appellees’ standing to seek visitation misses the point. Francesca had and has a living, biological parent, too; but it was appellees who took on the responsibilities for raising Francesca, and thereby acquiring the attendant rights of parenthood. The universe of potential petitioners under the Act, while larger than the biological pool, nevertheless is rationally restricted only to those who have played an actual rearing role in the child’s life. Accordingly, we hold that, for purposes of the Act, appellees are the equivalent of the child’s maternal grandparents, and as such, appellees had standing to file a petition seeking visitation with their grandchild.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>

Initially, I believe this ruling is fact specific and will not be of general application. With the exception of eight months around her thirteenth year, Francesca has lived her entire life with the <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>Costellos. Francesca’s mother is dead, and at the conclusion of the eight-month period during which Francesca lived with her father, her father signed a formal agreement entrusting the Costellos with responsibility for Francesca’s health, education, welfare, and physical and emotional needs. The only thing missing in the agreement between Francesca’s lather and the Costellos that would have mooted this suit is formalized adoption. Moreover, Francesca’s child Felicity, who is at the center of this dispute, lived her entire life with the Costellos until Appellant obtained primary custody of Felicity through a court action. This is simply not a case of the devoted nanny or next door neighbor from a parent’s childhood seeking custody of the parent’s child, but rather this holding applies only to those individuals who stand <em>in loco parentis </em>to the parent and have lived with the child for twelve months or more. Accordingly, while I join the majority opinion, I emphasize the compelling nature of the facts of this case which would have to be present in any case before this would be applicable as precedent.</p>

The term “grandparent” is clear and unambiguous, and it has been for the entirety of Pennsylvania jurisprudence. The traditional, common, clear, and time-honored definition of “grandparent” is the parent of one’s parent. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 988 (3d ed. 1993). That is achieved one of two ways: biologically, or through adoption. A grandparent does not include someone who acts as' a grandparent. Behaving like a grandparent, filling the role of a grandparent, and having others think of you as a grandparent may give rise to familial inclusion and affectionate wishes at holidays and birthdays, but it simply does not make it so for purposes of standing in child custody disputes. Serving as surrogate grandparent does not give one the statutory status of the real thing.</p>

The adoption of this expansive definition is more troubling for its potential consequences concerning parent-child relationships than grandparent-child relationships.
