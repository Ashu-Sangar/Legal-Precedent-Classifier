Indeed, in Claimant’s view, the Board’s regulations do not address or resolve the substantive issue of penalties at all; rather, they merely govern the procedural question of the time period to file an appeal and a request for supersedeas following the award of benefits. In contrast, Claimant argues, the substantive provisions of the Act address the issue of penalties. Claimant argues that, the General Assembly having addressed the question of penalties, only that body has the authority to change or amend the law regarding the effect of a timely supersedeas request on an employer’s obligation to pay an award.</p>

Claimant also suggests that a penalty was appropriate because supersedeas requests should not be filed in every case, but instead should be reserved for those cases where strong authority exists for the request. Claimant argues that Employer can cite no such authority here. In addition, Claimant notes that the twelve-day delay here deprived a widow and her four children of benefits they had already waited over four years to receive. Claimant concludes that, because Employer violated the Act, alleged no valid substantive authority in favor of supersedeas, and did not act diligently enough to ensure a decision within a thirty-day time frame, the WCJ’s penalty award was not an abuse of discretion.</p>

Employer notes that Section 428 speaks in terms of “default in compensation payments,” without purporting to define when the obligation to make an awarded compensation payment can be said to begin. Employer then argues that it cannot be deemed to have been in such “default” because it had exer<a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>cised its right, a right specifically granted it by administrative regulation, to seek a supersedeas. Thus, in Employer’s view, its obligation to pay Claimant arose, at the earliest, only when supersedeas was denied. Employer further argues that, under its reading of Section 428, there is no tension between the Act and the Board’s validly-adopted supersedeas regulations because the Act (which is silent on when the obligation arises) and the regulations merely establish that an employer’s obligation to pay does not arise, in a case where supersedeas is timely sought, until the request is denied by the Board or is deemed denied. Because Employer here paid the award before the Board even ruled on its supersedeas request, Employer argues that it cannot be deemed to have been in default, and thus, no penalty can issue. Employer concludes that, “[a]n employer who fully complies with the Board’s Regulations should not be penalized for having done so.” Brief for Appellee Rox Coal, 13.</p>

The Board reiterates that Section 428 of the Act does not define when the obligation to pay begins and that, in addressing this point of when a default occurs, the Act should be read <em>in pari materia </em>with the Board’s supersedeas regulations, which fill that gap. Thus, Section 428 can be fully harmonized with the regulations by recognizing that the Employer’s obligation to pay runs from the Board’s denial or deemed denial in the case of a timely supersedeas request. Because Employer here acted in reliance upon those regulations, the Board argues that there is no predicate violation of the Act and regulations which could warrant an assessment of penalties.</p>

It notes that the notion of a hard and fast rule fixing the employer’s obligation to pay, and the beginning of the default period, as beginning on the thirtieth day after the WCJ or Board first announces its benefit award is a product of Commonwealth Court decisional law involving awards rendered before the Board promulgated its supersedeas regulations. <em>See Cunningham v.

      <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>properly incorporated the Board’s regulations into the equation, and wisely abandoned what had proven to be uneven and <em>ad hoc </em>judicial attempts to align <em>Cunningham’s </em>strict 30-day rule with the 50-day (appeal from the WCJ to the Board) or 60-day (appeal from the Board to Commonwealth Court) decisional time-frame contemplated by the Board’s supersede-as regulations. The Board describes the previous problem, and the solution accepted below, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[288,746,1112,526]]]'>[T]he Commonwealth Court had previously fashioned a somewhat uneven rule, whereby an employer who does not pay compensation within 30 days of the award, but who has a supersedeas application pending with the Board, may be retrospectively absolved of liability for penalties if a supersedeas is ultimately <em>granted. Candito[, supra.] </em>On the other hand, the Commonwealth Court tolerated the assessment of penalties if a supersedeas was later <em>denied. Hoover[, supra.] </em>In other words, the employer’s liability for penalties was controlled by a condition subsequent.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[284,1287,1114,686]]]'>The irrationality of this uneven rule was best borne out by the respective facts of <em>Candito </em>and <em>Hoover. </em>In <em>Candito, </em>an employer delaying payment 52 days before receiving a supersedeas from the Commonwealth Court, incurred no penalty; whereas the employer in <em>Hoover </em>was assessed a ten percent penalty on indemnity benefits for a delay of six days in mailing the claimant’s check. Both cases paradoxically encouraged employers to engage in what <em>Cunningham </em>deemed a violation of the Act. The <em>en banc </em>panel below sensibly eliminated this paradox by overruling <em>Hoover, </em>and giving greater weight to the Board’s regulations in defining the employer’s obligation to pay an award of compensation pending an application for supersedeas.</blockquote>

The Board notes that its regulations balance the need for a prompt decision with an opportunity for the employer to make a meaningful decision whether to appeal and seek supersedeas, an opportunity for the claimant’s meaningful response, and an opportunity for the Board (which consists of fifteen members) to deliberate and reach an informed majority decision. In the Board’s view, public policy should disfavor forcing parties and the tribunal to rush matters in order to take advantage of the Board’s reasonable supersedeas regulations. In addition, with respect to Claimant’s argument that supersedeas should only be sought by employers in rare cases where the employer has specific authority in support of its position, the Board notes that Claimant fails to realize that its supersedeas regulations already incorporate the familiar and exacting stay standard devised by this Court in <em>Pennsylvania Pub.

    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[154,1210,1154,959]]]'>We are persuaded by the Board’s argument on the proper interplay of its regulations and the provisions of the Act. Under the statute, the power to assess a penalty is dependent upon the party violating the Act or pertinent rules and regulations. 77 P.S. § 991(d). One way an employer may violate the Act, and become “subject to a penalty,” is to “terminate! ], decrease! ] or refuse! ] to make” a payment provided for in a compensation “decision,” in the absence of a supersedeas being sought and actually granted. <em><a href="/a2d/702/1038-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="702 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="11896680,18207" data-case-paths="/a2d/702/1038-01,/pa/549/0658-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 971(b). Section 428, which is entitled, “Final judgment on default in payments; entry in common pleas; lien of judgment and execution thereon,” does not separately address or authorize penalties. Instead, that Section grants a claimant the right to secure a judgment by default if the employer is in “default of compensation payments for thirty days or more.” <em><a href="/a2d/702/1038-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="702 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="11896680,18207" data-case-paths="/a2d/702/1038-01,/pa/549/0658-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 921.

Thus, in Claimant’s view, the Act contemplates a thirty-day period in which an employer (or insurer) may pursue a supersedeas without fear of penalty. But, that is not how either Section 428, or the Act’s penalty provisions, actually read. Section 428 does not address the point where a default occurs, much less fix that default at thirty days from judgment; instead, that Section assumes a default and then addresses the separate question of the potential summary remedy afforded to claimants once that default has persisted for thirty days. By the same token, the penalty provisions in the Act are not made contingent upon the expiration of thirty-day grace periods following a violation. To the contrary, Section 430(b) makes an insurer or employer “subject to a penalty” upon termination, increase, or refusal to pay an award, with no time-qualification or grace period. Similarly, Section 435 authorizes tribunals to impose penalties for “violations,” without addressing grace periods. Under the statutory construct, then, a penalty is at least theoretically available the very day a default occurs; thus, a “refusal to make a payment” could warrant a penalty if it persisted for a single day: In short, it is apparent that Section 428 of the Act does not set forth the thirty-day, penalty-free supersedeas construct advanced by Claimant (and accepted by the Commonwealth Court).</p>

In the absence of the Act setting forth a procedure or time-frame for considering a request for supersedeas, we perceive no tension between the Board’s regulations and the statute.

The Majority reasons that, because Section 428 does not define when “default” occurs, the regulations of the Board rather than the provisions of the Act should be utilized to define the point in time at which the employer has an obligation to pay benefits. This reasoning is critically flawed and does not comport with the plain language provisions of the Act. Moreover, even if “default” were an ambiguous term, resort to a definition is preferable to the wholesale adoption of the Board regulations, which themselves do not define “default.” Further, there is no argument that the term “default” is ambiguous to require the Majority to depart from the clear language and meaning of the statute.</p>

Within the workers’ compensation scheme, there are many legal duties that can be imposed upon an employer and from which the employer may default. Several examples immediately come to mind — issuance of a notice of compensation payable or notice of compensation denial, payment of the claimant’s average weekly wage, payment of medical expenses, payment of fatal claim benefits, and payment of specific loss benefits. Determining when the obligation arises in each of these major areas is not difficult. The obligation arises when the order creating the legal duty is filed. In the instant matter, the obligation to pay fatal claim benefits arose on June 18, 2000, when the Board entered its Order denying reconsideration and awarding benefits to Claimant in a stated amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

That request must be granted. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 991. The General Assembly, thus, anticipated the precise situation before us and has indicated that “a petition to <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>terminate, suspend or modify a compensation agreement ... or award as provided in this section shall not automatically operate as a supersedeas.... ” Section 413, 77 P.S. § 774(2). Further, the Act mandates that “[a]ny insurer who suspends, terminates or decreases payments of compensation without ... having requested and been granted a supersedeas ... shall be subject to penalty as provided in Section 435 [77 P.S. § 991].” Section 413(b), 77 P.S. § 774.1 (emphasis added). In other words, the employer is not entitled to self-help. An employer who is adjudicated responsible for workers’ compensation payments must commence those payments within thirty days. The employer that fails to commence payment within thirty days, has, smt <em>sponte, </em>suspended those benefits and is in default.

Section 430 of the Act provides that discretionary penalties may be imposed on an employer that fails to pay benefits within the thirty-day time period. 77 P.S. § 971(b). Nothing in the regulations states that a request for supersede-as tolls the time constraints of Section 428.

It is axiomatic that a supersedeas provides prospective, not retroactive, relief. Therefore, once the obligation to pay benefits arises, an employer must continue to pay those benefits until the supersedeas is granted.

Thus, despite the clear and unambiguous language of the Act, the Majority has implemented a temporary supersedeas pending the outcome of the application for supersedeas. The logical extension of this principle would mean that any time an employer files a request for supersedeas, it is entitled to an automatic supersedeas pending the review of its request. This procedure was invalidated in <em>Baksalary v. Smith, </em><a href="/f-supp/579/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="579 F.

Before <em>Baksalary, </em>any appeal acted as an automatic supersedeas in workers’ compensation cases pending a decision on the appeal. The federal court reasoned that the claimant acquired a property right in benefits on the date that the order granting benefits was filed. It then held that a Section 413 automatic supersedeas deprived the claimant of his or her property without due process of law. The General Assembly subsequently revised Section 413 to remove the automatic supersedeas on the filing of an appeal. 77 P.S. § 774, <em>amended </em>by the Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, No. 57, § 16, effective August 22, 1996.</p>
