Although her physician prescribed a daily whirlpool bath as a treatment for her bedsores, Chester Care did not have a whirlpool bath; as a result, Mrs. Barnes was given a regular bath on a daily basis. This represented a departure from Chester Care’s ordinary policy of bathing residents twice weekly. In January 1996, Tommy Twyman, a certified nursing assistant employed by Chester Care, drew a bath for Mrs. Barnes, but apparently did not check the water temperature before placing her in it. The bath water was 138 degrees and caused Mrs. Barnes severe burns from which she died three days later.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The CAT Fund filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, in which it asked the court to: dismiss the bad faith claim; limit the CAT Fund’s potential liability on the breach of statutory duty claim to $1 million; dismiss Chester Care’s requests for reimbursement for defense costs such as attorney’s fees; and strike three allegedly impertinent paragraphs from Chester Care’s complaint.

This raised the issue of whether the CAT Fund was required to defend the wife. The court determined that not every injury or claim that arises as a consequence of providing medical services falls under the heading of “professional liability” for purposes of the act. Rather, the CAT Fund only need cover those claims that arise directly from the provision of medical services, and the underlying claim against the wife did not fit this description. <em>See id. </em>at 5-6, <a href="/a2d/739/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="739 A.2d 104" data-case-ids="11561918,837140" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0104-01,/pa/559/0001-01">739 A.2d at 106</a>.

Critically for present purposes, <em>Connolly </em>did not purport to draw the boundaries <em>of </em>what constitutes the furnishing (or failing to furnish) of medical services in the first instance, that is, in circumstances where the cause of action is premised directly upon the alleged faulty provision of health care.</p>

It also cannot be overlooked that the CAT Fund is intended to operate as an excess insurer as regards the portion of a malpractice claim exceeding the health care provider’s basic coverage for professional liability, <em>see, e.g., </em>40 P.S. §§ 1301.701(b)(2); 1301.701(d) (stating that the CAT Fund’s purpose is to pay all claims “against a health care provider ... to the extent such health care provider’s share <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>exceeds its basic coverage”); <em>Connolly, <a href="/pa/559/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="559 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="837140" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0001-01">559 </a></em><a href="/pa/559/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="559 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="837140" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0001-01">Pa. at 5-6</a>, <a href="/a2d/739/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="739 A.2d 104" data-case-ids="11561918,837140" data-case-paths="/a2d/739/0104-01,/pa/559/0001-01">739 A.2d at 106</a> (emphasizing that the statutory purpose of the CAT Fund is to supply “coverage in excess of [health care providers’] professional liability insurance”); <em>see also </em>40 P.S. § 1301.701(a) (requiring that Pennsylvania health care providers obtain insurance at a basic level against professional liability, through either a licensed insurance carrier or an approved self-insurance plan), and utilizing different definitions of professional health care services depending upon whether the term appears in a private insurance contract or in the statute would be at odds with this facet of the Fund’s underlying purpose.</p>

Clearly, Section 103’s use of the term “medical services” cannot be restricted by the specific insurance policy at issue in that or any other litigation, but must instead be understood by reference to the Malpractice Act’s own broadly defined class of health care providers. <em>See supra </em>note 4. For purposes of the act, then, “medical services” signifies the professional health care services of a covered health care provider. Accordingly, in determining whether the bath given to Mrs. Barnes triggered coverage by the Fund, we must focus on whether this service involved a medical skill (broadly understood as per the above) associated with specialized training.</p>

In <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>support of this position, the Fund highlights the following testimony of Mr. Twyman:</p>

Brief for Appellants at 29. It also avers that Mrs. Barnes’ injuries could not have resulted from professional malpractice because her doctor’s prescription relating to the alleviation of bedsores specified that she needed a whirlpool bath and, moreover, had expired at the time the bath was given; the Fund argues that the ordinary bath given outside of the prescription’s timeframe therefore only served purposes relating to routine hygienic care rather than any medical objective. The Fund finally contends that, in any event, the real cause of the harm had nothing to do with Mr. Twyman’s actions, but resulted instead from a faulty hot-water valve, thereby removing the entire matter from the professional malpractice arena.</p>

Finally, Appellees highlight various regulations promulgated by the Department of Public Welfare (“DPW”) which pertain to long-term care nursing facilities which provide skilled or intermediate nursing care, and to nursing-home financial aid under Pennsylvania’s Medical Assistance Program. <em>See generally Harston Hall Nursing &amp; Convalescent Home, Inc. v.

The present matter does provide an opportunity to elaborate upon these issues, as it is undisputed that Mrs. Barnes was totally debilitated by her condition, both mentally and physically, which necessarily altered the nature of the tasks performed on her behalf, and more specifically, the nature of the skill and the types of judgments necessary to perform them. The Fund’s argument that Mr. Twyman simply used his physical strength to place Mrs. Barnes in the tub and take her out therefore leaves open the question of whether his failure to do any more than that amounted to professional negligence in the furnishing of medical services (here, nursing care).</p>

It is uncontested that Mrs. Barnes was under the care of a nursing home licensed to provide health care or professional medical services at the time of the incident. In that setting she required specialized care for her skin condition as initially ordered by a doctor and as provided by a trained nurse’s aide pursuant to a regimen that exceeded routine custodial care. Although the bath that Mrs. Barnes received departed from the doctor’s orders in that it lacked a whirlpool component, the salient point for present purposes is that, while providing the bath, Chester Care’s employees were delivering medical services in light of the overall circumstances concerning Mrs. Barnes’ physical and mental infirmities. Bathing a completely incapacitated individual requires a certain degree of specialized training that might be unnecessary for the bathing of an ordinary elderly patient. For example, it requires the exercise of professional judgment as to considerations such as when and how frequently to check the water temperature, whether a person in Mrs. Barnes’ condition would be able to remove herself from the tub if the water became too hot, and whether there was any likelihood of any other mishap such as drowning. Administering a bath under these circumstances therefore falls outside the scope of general custodial care which can be performed adequately by <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>an untrained employee.

Regardless of whether Ms. Barnes’ physician prescribed the bath or whether, as a certified nursing assistant, Mr. Twyman received training in bathing persons in Ms. Barnes’ condition, Mr. Twyman’s deposition testimony clearly demonstrates that <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>the type of skill that was required to bathe Ms. Barnes on a daily basis was not a “medical skill,” let alone a medical skill “associated with specialized training.”</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.4",620,[258,473,1156,95]]]'>Mr. Twyman offered the following testimony regarding his duty to bathe Ms. Barnes:</p>
    <blockquote id="b620-6" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[298,581,1114,95]]]'>[T]hey needed me to pick her up, put her in the bath, pick her up, take her out of the bath.</blockquote>
    <p id="b620-8" data-blocks='[["BL_620.6",620,[253,693,1162,676]]]'>Plaintiffs’ Reply Brief in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, Exhibit A. While the successful completion of these tasks certainly required the exercise of judgment as to considerations such as water temperature and water levels, I, unlike the Majority, cannot go as far as to classify the type of judgment necessary to bathe Ms. Barnes properly as “professional judgment.” <em>See </em>Maj. Op. 586 Pa. at 409-10, 894 A.2d at 742. It is beyond dispute that the proper exercise of judgment was important to Ms. Barnes’ safety. The importance of the proper exercise of judgment in bathing Ms. Barnes properly does not, however, transform this judgment into “professional judgment,” the improper exercise of which would trigger coverage under the Fund.</p>
    <p id="b620-9" data-blocks='[["BL_620.7",620,[255,1387,1159,624]]]'>As the Majority notes, the Legislature created the Fund to serve as “a contingency fund for the purpose of paying all awards, judgments and settlements for loss or damages against a health care provider ... as a consequence of any claim for <em>professional liability....” </em>40 P.S. § 1301.701(d) (emphasis added) (superseded). In my view, finding, as the Majority does, that the negligent giving of a bath, under the circumstances presented in this case, constitutes the improper provision of a medical service giving rise to Fund coverage stretches the scope of “professional liability” claims covered by the limited resources of the Fund beyond that which the Legislature intended.</p>
    <p id="b620-10" data-blocks='[["BL_620.8",620,[255,2032,1157,140]]]'>For these reasons, I would reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees.</p>
