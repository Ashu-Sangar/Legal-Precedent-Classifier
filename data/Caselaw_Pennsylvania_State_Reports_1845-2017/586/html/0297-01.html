Although not stated by the Superior Court, one can infer that it believed that where Mother could have sought recovery regardless of whether Child had enjoyed a “typical life,” so too could Daughter as an intervenor acting in Mother’s stead.

Consequently, Father contends that Daughter <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>should have been denied intervention, because she was not an intended beneficiary of the payments. Father notes that the support guidelines, Pa.R.C.P.1910.16-1 — 1910.16-7, established by this Court pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 4322, do not provide for direct payment of funds between a parent and child, but rather provide for payment from the obligor to the custodial parent or guardian. Father asserts that if this Court upholds Daughter’s intervention based on the Agreement’s provision for increased payments to be made to Mother, we would open the door to a child suing one or both of her parents by equating the right to be supported with the right to support payments. Because he concludes that neither parent intended Daughter to receive the payments dollar for dollar, we read his argument to assert that Daughter is an incidental rather than intended beneficiary under the test set forth in Section 302.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Instead, agreements and orders direct the non-custodial parent to pay support monies to the custodial parent. The rationale behind this is obvious: parents are better equipped to utilize support payments and to decide what is best for their children than are children themselves.

The Superior Court noted that some of our sister states have allowed children to enforce their parents' separation agreements. In the first of three cited cases, the court relied upon <em>Smith v.

We note, however, that the Ohio court utilized the cited language only to support its conclusion that the trial court had continuing jurisdiction to modify the terms of a separation agreement and increase the support amount based in part on the third party beneficiary status and in part on the public policies related to a parent’s obligation to support a child. The Superior Court then cited without discussion <em>Worthington v.

As Daughter was named in the contract, we find it indisputable that Daughter was a third party beneficiary; the question is whether she is an intended or incidental beneficiary.

Therefore, I am not as certain as the majority that it is appropriate to rely exclusively upon ordinary contract principles to resolve the specific question of whether Daughter had standing to sue Father to enforce the contract’s terms. It seems to me that that essential question amounts to one of public policy resolvable even in the absence of the overlay provided by Section 302 of the Restatement of Contracts. Because I agree that, as a policy matter, minor children should not be accorded standing to initiate such legal actions absent express statutory authority, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at <a href="/citations/?q=586%20Pa.%20308" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="586 Pa. 308">586 Pa. 308</a>-13, 893 A.2d at 94-96, I join the majority opinion subject only to the above thoughts.</p>
