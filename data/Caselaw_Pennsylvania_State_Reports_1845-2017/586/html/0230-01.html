Trooper Bryan did not speak directly to Appellant or Seeley due to the emergent nature of their injuries, but he did interview the emergency medical services (E.M.S.) personnel at the scene. One E.M.S. person informed him that Appellant appeared to have been drunk, while another related that Appellant smelled of alcohol. Trooper Bryan inspected Appellant’s Pathfinder, in which he found two bottles of wine, one of them empty and the other partially full, and near which he discovered a half-empty bottle of vodka.</p>

Trooper Allen further stated that Trooper Bryan told him that he had found three alcohol bottles, one near and two inside Appellant’s Pathfinder.

The Fourth Amendment requires that the government establish a nexus among the four factors of time, crime, objects, and place. <em>See generally </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 3.7(d) (4th ed.2004). In the present case, the Commonwealth acknowledges as a “glaring flaw” in the first affidavit of probable cause the affiant officer’s failure to attest that Appellant was ever transported to, or treated at, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Brief for Appellee at 4 n. 1, thus, facially omitting the essential connection to place.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> I therefore believe that it is necessary to address the arguments on the terms presented by the parties.</p>

Additionally, as the Commonwealth emphasizes, the evidence at issue (hospital records) is not evanescent, as was also the case in the decisions in which the “time” nexus factor has assumed particular importance. Moreover, the “independent investigative team” requirement that has arisen as a specific restriction on recourse to the independent source doctrine in Pennsylvania, focuses on foreclosing any advantage to the government arising from police misconduct and/or tainted evidence. <em>See Melendez, </em><a href="/pa/544/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="115" data-cite="544 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="463598" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0323-01">544 Pa. at 334</a>, <a href="/pa/544/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="676 A.2d 226" data-case-ids="463598,7859918" data-case-paths="/pa/544/0323-01,/a2d/676/0226-01">676 A.2d at 231</a> (“[Application of the ‘independent source doctrine’ is proper only in the very limited circumstances where the ‘independent source’ is <em>tmly independent from both the tainted evidence and the police or investigative team which engaged in the misconduct by which the tainted evidence was </em>discovered.” (quoting <em>Mason, </em><a href="/pa/535/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="535 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1841557" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0560-01">535 Pa. at 573</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="637 A.2d 251" data-case-ids="1841557,7353048" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0560-01,/a2d/637/0251-01">637 A.2d at 257-58</a> (emphasis in original))).

What is lacking, however, is an assessment concerning whether specific facts or circumstances were communicated to the district justice from which she reasonably could infer that evidence of a crime could be found at UPMC. In this regard, the record does not reflect that any facts were presented to the district justice to establish such connection, since there is no evidence that the affiant officer communicated that Appellant had been taken to UPMC after the fatal accident.</p>

Appellant’s position appears to be that, by virtue of the deficiencies in the initial warrant, all of the legitimate evidence supporting probable cause (for example, the evidence of Appellant having crossed the center line into an opposing lane of traffic; the arresting officer's observation of liquor and wine bottles in and around Appellant's vehicle; and the officer's interviews with emergency medical personnel who conveyed their observations concerning Appellant's unusual conduct, his inebriated appearance, and the smell of alcohol arising from his presence) must be viewed as tainted.

Rather, the Lead Opinion affirms the order of the Superior Court on the basis that the original warrant was constitutionally sound. I am baffled by this reasoning. As noted by the Lead Opinion, the Commonwealth expressly conceded that the first warrant, which was .obtained pursuant to Trooper Bryan’s affidavit, was faulty. <em>See </em>Lead Opinion at 10.
