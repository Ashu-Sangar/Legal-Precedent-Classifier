Carroll testified that he gives the Club his entire salary of $600. The average balance in the Club’s account is approximately $3,000.00. This money is used to finance projects that cannot be funded with taxpayer money. For example, the Club assisted the local Boy Scout troop, donated $300 to a scholarship fund, and gave $200 to a group that was assisting victims of Hurricane Katrina. Projects undertaken by the Club are discussed with borough council and reflected in the minutes of borough council meetings. Carroll receives no salary, income, or any benefit in kind from the Club.

In <em>Anastasio, </em>the candidate (there, for local office) had entered “None” in block 10 of the Financial Statement — a block which directs disclosure of “direct or indirect sources of income.” The candidate in fact had employment income. An objector filed a petition to strike, alleging a fatal defect; the trial court agreed and struck the nomination petition; a three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order in a brief published opinion; and this Court affirmed <em>per curiam, </em>by a vote of 4-3. Judge Kelley reasoned that, like the candidate in <em>Anastasio, </em>Carroll had “failed to designate anything on his financial statement from which a reviewer could ascertain that he served as the President of the Club and on the Board of DAMA.”</p>

Benninghoff did, however, advert to his salaried position as a state representative (a salary which was of public record) in multiple other blocks on the form, and he disclosed supplemental income. This Court held that Benninghoff had “substantially complied” with the requirements of the Ethics Act, and thus he should be permitted to amend the form.

Carroll notes that the Act speaks to financial interests, is designed to expose potential financial conflicts, and thereby acts to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people in their government by assuring the impartiality and honesty of public officials. Brief for Appellant, 7 <em>(citing </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 1101.1(a)). Carroll argues that the fatal defect rule is designed to ensure that financial disclosures are fully and timely made, so that they may inform the public about a candidate’s financial interests, thus facilitating the ability of the public to assess whether those financial interests are likely to influence, or conflict with, the candidate’s execution of his public responsibilities. Consistently with this purpose, Carroll notes, the rule to date has been applied to terminate candidacies only where the candidate failed to file a timely financial statement,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> filed a timely financial statement but failed to disclose the sources of income or debts,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> or filed the financial statement in the wrong location.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Brief for Appellant, 7-8.</p>

Thus, he did not deprive the voting public of information about his financial interests that would allow voters to assess whether those interests potentially conflict with the public trust. Instead, he has been denied the opportunity to appear on the ballot because his full disclosure of his financial interests did not include an exhaustive summary of his non-financial public associations. Carroll maintains that the Commonwealth Court’s extension of the fatal defect rule to failures to report non-financial interests is an “unprecedented expansion” which cannot be squared with the terms or purpose of the Ethics Act and the financial statement requirement.</p>

With respect to his role in the Mayors Club, which Garvey claimed had to be disclosed as a “business entity” affiliation under Section 1105(b)(8), Carroll notes that the term “business entity” is not defined in the Ethics Act. But, Carroll argues, the elemental term “business” is defined in the Act, and in a way that makes plain that it encompasses only for-profit entities: “[a]ny corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, organization, self-employed individual, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any legal entity organized for profit.” 65 Pa.C.S. § 1102 (emphasis supplied). Under the plain language of this definition, Carroll argues that his failure to list his position as president of the non-profit Mayors Club did not violate the Ethics Act because there is “simply nothing” in the Act that requires disclosing affiliations with nonprofit business entities. Moreover, Carroll argues, even if this plain language could be construed to be ambiguous, it would be inequitable and unfair to fault him for failing to predict such an interpretation. Carroll accurately notes that there is no case decision, and no rulings or information from the <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>Ethics Commission, to warn candidates of such a non-textual interpretation.

Garvey stresses the broad language of the provision when read in isolation, <em>i.e., </em>“any office” of “any nature” in “any business entity.” Garvey then notes that the Mayors Club is an active non-profit corporation registered with the Pennsylvania Department of State, and Carroll is its president and sole officer. Therefore, Garvey argues, Carroll had to report this business “office” and his failure to do so was a fatal defect. Notably, Garvey does not address Carroll’s <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>argument that the Act defines “business” in terms of for-profit entities.</p>
    <p id="b843-4" data-blocks='[["BL_843.4",843,[166,431,1156,520]]]'>With regard to Carroll’s positions with DAMA, Garvey argues that Section 1105(b)(1) “obligates” candidates to disclose public positions they hold or held. Garvey then argues that appointed members of municipal authorities are public officials, and therefore, Carroll’s failure to report his position with DAMA was an independent fatal defect. Moreover, Garvey disputes Carroll’s argument that his service on DAMA was a mandatory incident of his elected position as Mayor; to the contrary, Garvey maintains, this association was “purely voluntary.”</p>
    <p id="b843-5" data-blocks='[["BL_843.5",843,[166,977,1155,468]]]'>Garvey also disputes Carroll’s argument that he substantially complied with the Act. Garvey argues that Carroll’s omissions in Blocks 4 and 13 involve associations not otherwise accounted for in the Financial Statement, and that fact renders inoperable the substantial compliance rule set forth in <em>Benninghoff. </em>Garvey concludes that either or both of Carroll’s omissions rendered his Statement of Financial Interests fatally defective under Section 1104(b)(3) of the Act, warranting that his nomination petition be set aside.</p>
    <p id="b843-6" data-blocks='[["BL_843.6",843,[164,1469,1159,896]]]'>Notably, at the outset of his otherwise straightforward argument, Garvey acknowledges that the “purpose” of the fatal defect rule is “to insure public disclosures of relevant financial information.” Brief of Appellee, 10 (emphasis added). Yet, Garvey never discusses the fact that neither of Carroll’s unreported positions implicated his financial information. Nor does Garvey argue, for example, that there is some indirect way in which Carroll’s financial situation was implicated by these non-financial affiliations. Instead, Garvey focuses on the language of the Section 1105(b) affiliations in isolation, separate and apart from the overall financial emphasis of the form and the Act, as well as the purpose he has generally acknowledged, and then declares that any omission of information amounts to a fatal defect. Thus, there is a missing essential ingredient when Garvey later declares that the non-disclosures here deprived voters of “an opportunity to accurately inspect Carroll’s financial portfolio.” <em>Id., </em>17.</p>

The Majority finds support for its exclusive focus on a candidate’s financial entanglements from the Act’s statement of purpose, which, as the Majority appropriately notes, is steeped in language emphasizing the importance of full financial disclosure. <em>See </em>65 Pa.C.S. § 1101.1(a) (“Purpose”). In section 1101.1(c) (“Legislative intent”), however, the legislature charges the independent State Ethics Commission (Commission) with “promoting public confidence in government,” a mandate that I read to encompass more than mere oversight of a candidate’s financial interests. For example, our legislature under the same title has deemed it necessary to preclude a party from holding certain offices contemporaneously, <em>see </em>65 P.S. §§ 1, <em>et seq. </em>(enumerating “incompatible” offices), and has barred “subversive” persons from holding Commonwealth office. <em>See </em>65 P.S. §§ 211, <em>et seq. </em>While these provisions do not appear in the Chapter before us, they illustrate the legislature’s cognizance of the danger of attending only to a candidate’s financial interests when assessing his candidacy, or, alternatively, going through the motions of requiring other disclosures but providing no sanction sufficient to deter noncompliance.</p>

I share the Majority's concern that an overbroad definition of "public position” will simultaneously impose a potentially onerous burden on the most civically active candidates for office, and might leave parties acting in good faith vulnerable to specious challenges. As noted, <em>infra, </em>I believe that the distinction drawn by the Commission between "public position” and "public office” is material, and consistently with the Ethics Act requires disclosure of the position here at issue. I also note, however, that the Act already contains the seeds of much mischief in its broad definition of "public official." Perhaps, to the extent the result reached herein does not reflect legislative intent in either direction, the General Assembly will clarify the disclosures necessary to strike a fair balance between ballot access and transparency.</p>

My resolution of this issue would leave open the possibility that the "substantial compliance” exception carved out by this Court in <em>In re Nomination Petition of Benninghoff, </em><a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="578 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="1329325" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01">578 Pa. 402</a>, <a href="/pa/578/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="852 A.2d 1182" data-case-ids="1329325,9239204" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0402-01,/a2d/852/1182-01">852 A.2d 1182</a> (2004), and distinguished by the Commonwealth Court in this case, would excuse Candidate’s nondisclosure in this case. Although he opined that his appointment to the board of DAMA by the Dallas Borough Council occurred only in virtue of his office as Mayor, Candidate conceded that the position was neither a direct nor a necessary consequence of that office. <em>See </em>N.T. at 24 (acknowledging that the appropriate representative to DAMA was not necessarily the Mayor, but rather “whoever council would appoint,” and that his position as Mayor did not "mandate that [he] serve with a municipal authority,” and that he could have turned the appointment down). Thus, <em>contra </em>our ruling in <em>Benninghoff, </em>the face of the Candidate's form neither expressly revealed his position on the board of DAMA nor justified even the most astute reader in inferring, without more, that one necessarily entailed the other. <em>Benninghoff is </em>distinguishable and should afford Candidate no quarter from the consequences of his non-disclosure.</p>
