Dr. Valliere noted that, in addition to her academic studies involving sexual offenders, she had conducted both psychological and risk assessments on both incarcerated and outpatient sex offenders, assessments which included therapy, evaluation, testing and group therapy. Dr. Valliere noted that she had been a member of the Sex Offender Assessment Board since 1997; that she had both received and provided training in risk assessment of sexual offenders; that she had conducted over 200 sexual offender assessments; and that she had testified as a qualified expert on the question of SVP status in over 100 court proceedings. Dr. Valliere indicated her familiarity with the statutory standard at issue, and noted that she had undergone “hundreds of hours of training in understanding sex offenders’ dynamics, deviate sexual arousal, sexual offense behavior, crime analysis, risk assessment, as well as reading and self-study of all the body of research related [sic].” N.T. 7/18/02, 3-9.

She noted, among other things, that appellant had a significant and deviant sexual arousal response to young girls, <em>ie., </em>that a common thread in appellant’s own description of the three separate sexual offenses he had committed was his view that the children were “highly seductive,” “coming on very sexually aggressive to him,” and that he simply obliged them. In the doctor’s view, “this is more than just your typical denial or victim blaming that we see with offenders. This kind of disclosure reflects their fantasy world.... [I]n their fantasy, the children want it, demand it, that they’re so irresistible; and this enhances the experience.” Such a disclosure, in Dr. Valliere’s view, shows “a high degree of psychological investment in the sexual gratification, and that goes to speaking <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>toward the mental abnormality which is the deviance towards young girls.” <em>Id. </em>at 10-17.</p>

Turning to the question of whether appellant’s behavior was “predatory,” Dr. Valliere opined that the following considerations, among others, suggested an affirmative answer: the fact that appellant approached his victims for his own sexual gratification; the fact that he had multiple victims, thus showing a “pattern of repeated behavior;” his prior criminal history, which revealed a “maladjustment to supervision” as he violated probation and parole; and his polysubstance abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22.</p>

Dr. Valliere noted, however, that “predator” is a “commonly accepted psychological phrase” even if it was not a distinct diagnosis. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 31. Moreover, when asked whether there was a test or methodology within the professional psychological or psychiatric communities which would allow for determining SVP status, the doctor noted that there “is a body of research in terms of risk assessment and risk of recidivism. There are characteristics, and there are behavioral patterns that we look at.” When pressed whether there was some specific diagnostic criteria for making the SVP determination, along the lines of the criteria typically used to assess such <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>things as personality disorders, Dr. Valliere noted that the statute itself set forth the governing criteria. The doctor then added, “there is a body of research that lays out different criteria which the legislature expressly incorporated into the law, like multiple victims, personality disorder; and these are all supported by literature.” <em>Id. </em>at 32-33. The doctor also noted that her task in forming a judgment as to SVP status did not involve a simple clinical judgment or opinion because, under the statute, “I can’t say it’s based just purely on my opinion or judgment. There are things that are outside my judgment that I also use, namely, the research, his behavior, his past records, his previous diagnoses, those things that are not just about my judgment. Pm the one that adds all those things up and say do they meet this criteria, but it’s not simply my judgment or opinion.” <em>Id. </em>at 35.</p>

Appellant claimed that, under the <em>Frye </em>standard, Dr. Valliere’s testimony was inadmissible expert scientific evidence because she made a subjective assessment using statutory terms (“sexually violent predator” and “mental abnormality”) not generally accepted in the relevant scientific community and having no clinically significant meaning in the field of psychology. The panel rejected appellant’s argument in a unanimous, published opinion, finding that the testimony of a psychological or psychiatric expert offered at an SVP proceeding is not novel scientific evidence subject to <em>Frye </em>because the statutory enactment itself provides the factors for the expert to consider in making the SVP determination. The panel further noted that Dr. Valliere had testified that those factors were not created by the General Assembly arbitrarily, but rather reflected a body <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>of psychological literature and research on the subject of sexual predators and their risk of recidivism. The court agreed with the trial court that it would defy logic to ask an expert witness to apply Megan’s Law II in conducting an assessment and then exclude the expert’s testimony merely because she employed Megan’s Law II language in her assessment. Finally, the court concluded that the methodologies used by Dr. Valliere — specifically, her review of appellant’s prior offense history, as well as her reliance on psychological literature and research and her own experience in evaluating sexual predators — were not novel. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>With these authorities in mind, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in entertaining the testimony of Dr. Valliere without first subjecting it to a <em>Frye </em>analysis. This is so primarily because we are satisfied that Dr. Valliere’s testimony did not involve science which could properly be deemed novel under <em>Frye. </em>This case does not pose the classic <em>Frye </em>scenario. The Commonwealth has not come into court and offered penological, psychological or psychiatric literature and research, or the examples of other states with SVP laws, and then asked the court, as a common law matter, to adjudicate SVP status and to devise some sort of consequence attending that designation. Rather, the “science” here (and the SVP designation consequences it triggers) is responsive to, indeed it is a direct byproduct of, a specific legislatively-adopted scheme which sets forth the relevance and contours of the challenged evidence. The General Assembly has determined that a sexual offender’s SVP status is significant to the operation of the registration and notification provisions of the law. The Assembly has defined the triggering term (“sexually violent predator”) and has set forth the factors to be considered in making that determination. This scheme represents a legislative policy judgment concerning the proper response to certain sexual offenders. The question of SVP status is thus a statutory question, not a question of “pure science” and, at least in the absence of a challenge to the propriety of the substance of the statute, the question of evidentiary relevance is framed by the very provisions of the statute itself, not some external source.</p>

The statute does not require proof of a standard of diagnosis that is commonly found and/or accepted in a mental health diagnostic paradigm. As Dr. Valliere testified, the opinion she renders in a sex offender assessment is not strictly diagnostic in the psychological sense; rather, her opinion must account for <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>statutory factors, such as “the research, his behavior, his past records, his previous diagnoses,” all of which affect the opinion she then forms and renders on the <em>statutory </em>question of SVP status. In seeking to protect society against certain sexual offenders, the General Assembly was not obliged to adopt a certain diagnostic construct, and it is the construct that was actually adopted which must control this Court’s analysis of the relevance and admissibility of evidence offered to prove the statutory standard.</p>

The doctor testified that the documents she reviewed in assessing appellant were “records that are regularly relied upon in this kind of evaluation.” N.T. 7/18/02 at 13. As a result of her review of the documents, which included documents related to the current offense and appellant’s prior offenses, Dr. Valliere concluded that appellant has a personality disorder or mental abnormality and that his history of abusing young girls “suggests that he has a deviant sexual arousal toward young females which has resulted in criminally sexually aggressive behavior.” Dr. Valliere found that appellant was driven to sexually assault as demonstrated by the fact that he did not appear to fear being caught — at least one <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>assault was committed while a family member of the victim was in the home, and appellant committed one assault shortly after being arrested for another. She described appellant as fantasy driven because in his version of at least two of the assaults, the victim initiated the sexual contact. Based upon her investigation, education and work experience, Dr. Valliere then opined that appellant met the criteria for classification as an SVP.
