      <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>On May 29, 1995, Richard White, a.k.a. “Pookie,” telephoned Lamar Peterson, a friend of appellant, seeking to buy a large quantity of marijuana to replenish the inventory for his drug dealing operation. Peterson concluded that if White had sold all his marijuana, White would have a significant amount of cash on hand. Peterson suggested to appellant that they rob White through a “stinger;” Peterson would engage White in a drug transaction, during which appellant would suddenly appear and rob them both. Peterson and appellant would reconnect later and share in the pelf.</p>
    <p id="b773-5" data-blocks='[["BL_773.4",773,[162,851,1154,574]]]'>Peterson, appellant, and Curtis French set out to find White, but Peterson could not remember the exact location of White’s apartment. The three returned to Peterson’s apartment where they informed Ralph Logan, a.k.a. “Rah-Rah,” and Luis Avila, a.k.a. “T-Bone,” of the plan. The group decided to make another attempt to find White. This time, Avila called White and informed him he would soon drop by to purchase marijuana. Avila, Logan, and appellant set out on another robbery attempt; however, this too was unsuccessful after the trio went to the wrong apartment. Again, appellant and his cohorts returned to Peterson’s apartment.</p>
    <p id="b773-6" data-blocks='[["BL_773.5",773,[159,1449,1154,572]]]'>Giving the “stinger” one last try, Avila called White again and ascertained his apartment’s exact location; appellant, Avila, and Logan again set out to rob him. White was on his balcony when he saw the trio approaching; White tucked a pistol in the rear of his shorts and headed to the street, where he encountered the group. Appellant demanded White take him to his apartment and hand over his cash. When White refused, pleading with his arms in the air that his children were inside sleeping, appellant pulled out a MAC 10 automatic weapon and fired two bullets into White’s chest and a third into his thigh as he fell to the ground.</p>
    <p id="b773-7" data-blocks='[["BL_773.6",773,[159,2046,1151,306]]]'>With White lying in the street, the group fled back to Peterson’s apartment. Upon their arrival, appellant informed Peterson that because White was uncooperative, he “wetted him lovely,” ie., appellant shot him. N.T. Trial, 7/20/01, at 1891. The other robbers also testified that appellant bragged about shooting White.</p>

      <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>Later that summer, Peterson and appellant were arrested in Baltimore by the FBI for an unrelated bank robbery. Facing federal charges, Peterson told authorities of appellant’s role in the robbery and murder of White. Avila, French, and Logan were also arrested and each corroborated Peterson’s account. The three later testified appellant used the same weapon in many subsequent bank robberies. Photographs in Peterson’s possession at the time of his arrest depicted appellant, Peterson, French, and Logan; one showed appellant posing with the MAC 10 used to kill White.</p>
    <p id="b774-5" data-blocks='[["BL_774.4",774,[254,849,1163,626]]]'>In November, 1996, appellant was convicted in federal court of robbery and was sentenced to 687 months federal incarceration. Having already filed first degree murder charges against appellant, Lehigh County prosecutors monitored appellant’s federal prosecution and attended portions of his federal trial. N.T. Pretrial Hearing, 2/03/00, at 50. Appellant was ultimately transferred to a federal prison in Colorado; Lehigh prosecutors sought extradition. This request was delayed because appellant had previously filed homicide charges pending against him in New Jersey, which was also attempting to secure him. Eventually appellant was transferred to Lehigh County.</p>
    <p id="b774-6" data-blocks='[["BL_774.5",774,[254,1500,1162,523]]]'>Despite repeated warnings and recommendations from the court to the contrary, appellant represented himself during pretrial hearings and at trial. At trial, and with standby counsel assisting when appellant permitted, appellant attempted to undermine the credibility of his accusers, but took the opportunity to personally attack Commonwealth prosecutors, officers, and criminal justice personnel. <em>See </em>N.T. Pretrial Hearing, 10/12/00, at 4 (appellant repeatedly slurred one black prosecutor as “house n* * * *r” and lead prosecutor as conspirator and liar).</p>

Trial, 7/23/01, at 2197-98, 2205-09, 2213-14; <em>id., </em>7/24/01, at 2407-09; <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>
      <em>id., </em>7/27/01, at 3307-08. Appellant suggested French was the triggerman in White’s murder, and maintained a statewide conspiracy was afoot wherein the Lehigh County District Attorney’s Office, numerous police departments, prison staff employees, and even appointed standby defense counsel were acting in concert.</p>
    <p id="b775-5" data-blocks='[["BL_775.4",775,[172,641,1156,784]]]'>Police came into possession of the murder weapon after a failed robbery attempt by appellant, Peterson, French, and another individual. As was their typical strategy, the group tried to rob a drug dealer but were unsuccessful when the dealer brandished a weapon; French dropped the machine gun as the three fled for their lives. Ballistics tests revealed the gun recovered was used in White’s murder. This same weapon was also linked to the bank robbery appellant was convicted of in federal court. The car used in the perpetration of White’s murder was also tracked down by police; it had been rented by an associate of appellant, and had a dent in the fender consistent with the strike of a bullet. Testimony revealed that when appellant shot White, one of the bullets exited White’s body and ricocheted off the getaway car. <em>Id., </em>7/24/01, at 2539-40.</p>
    <p id="b775-6" data-blocks='[["BL_775.5",775,[170,1451,1156,462]]]'>In addition to the physical evidence, the Commonwealth offered expert medical testimony consistent with its other ■witnesses’ version of the killing, particularly the fact that White was shot while his arms were raised. <em>Id., </em>7/23/01, at 2270, 2293-94. The Commonwealth also presented David Miller, an inmate at Lehigh County Prison, who testified appellant admitted to him he had killed somebody and was seeking Miller’s legal advice concerning his case. <em>Id., </em>7/26/01, at 3078.</p>
    <p id="b775-7" data-blocks='[["BL_775.6",775,[168,1946,1156,415]],["BL_776.1",776,[260,313,1159,574]]]'>Besides soliciting Miller’s assistance, appellant spoke to another inmate, Louis Washington, about having one of Washington’s family members provide an alibi for appellant’s whereabouts on the night of White’s murder. <em>See id., </em>7/30/01, at 3584-87 (“So then [appellant] offered me some money, and he offered my family some money to have my mother be his alibi.... ”). Coached by appellant, this woman was to testify appellant was with her during the homicide, and because she <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>had no criminal record or prior involvement with appellant, her story would be believed over appellant’s criminal cohorts. After being threatened by appellant, Washington told the Commonwealth of appellant’s fabrication plans. As a result, and at the meeting arranged by appellant to “go over” this testimony, Washington’s mother was portrayed by state Trooper Regina Stafford; the Commonwealth had previously secured warrants to record the conversations. During the conversation, appellant orchestrated a time sequence placing him with Washington’s mother at the time of White’s murder, and informed her exactly what she was expected to say.</p>
    <p id="b776-5" data-blocks='[["BL_776.4",776,[259,912,1160,683]]]'>At trial, appellant called Washington to authenticate an affidavit exonerating appellant which Washington had signed; Washington testified he signed the affidavit only after being threatened. N.T. Trial, 7/30/01, at 3549-62. Appellant attacked Washington’s credibility and the suggested alibi fabrication story; on cross-examination, the Commonwealth further explored the fabrication story. After appellant again tried to discredit Washington by alleging he invented the alibi story to curry favor with the Commonwealth, the prosecution was granted permission, in rebuttal, to verify Washington’s version of events. Officer Stafford testified to the alibi plot, and the tape recording of the conversation was played for the jury. Appellant was convicted on all charges.</p>
    <p id="b776-6" data-blocks='[["BL_776.5",776,[259,1618,1159,730]]]'>Appellant again represented himself during the penalty hearing, asking the jury to consider his character and the circumstances surrounding the crime, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), and his allegedly minor criminal record, <em>id., </em>§ 9711(e)(1). Appellant argued he was not a violent person and made repeated attacks on the character of the victim, <em>i.e., </em>the victim was armed, a neglectful parent, and a notorious drug dealer. The Commonwealth offered the jury two aggravating circumstances, namely, appellant’s history of violent felonies, <em>id, </em>§ 9711(d)(9), and that appellant committed the murder while in the course of a felony, <em>id, </em>§ 9711(d)(6). The jury found the Commonwealth proved both aggravating circumstances, and rejected all appellant’s proposed mitigating evidence; appellant was sentenced to death.</p>

The court of common pleas, meanwhile, listed a hearing and a pre-trial conference concerning Appellant’s Pennsylvania charges, and set a trial date of September 8, 1997. In March of 1997, however, the federal Bureau of Prisons determined that Appellant should serve his federal sentence at its facility in Florence Colorado (USP Florence); Appellant arrived at USP Florence on March 5, 1997. On June 6, 1997, Lehigh County lodged a detainer against Appellant, signaling Pennsylvania’s intent to try Appellant on his outstanding charges.</p>

It provides that “the running of [the time period prescribed in Article III] shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.” In <em>Montione, </em>this Court addressed the import of Article VI as a matter of first impression. <a href="/a2d/720/0738-01" class="citation" data-index="308" data-cite="720 A.2d 738" data-case-ids="11806099,765966" data-case-paths="/a2d/720/0738-01,/pa/554/0121-01">720 A.2d at 740</a>.

In this case, however, it is undisputed that the prosecutor recognized the gravamen of Appellant's request in the first instance. Indeed, as discussed at greater length <em>infra, </em>within days of its undisputed receipt of Appellant's request for disposition under the IADA Article III, the prosecution contacted Pennsylvania’s IADA coordinator, an act as unequivocal in its connotation as the IADA is in its consequence. To require uniformly strict compliance is inconsistent with binding interpretations of the Act and manifestly contradicts the Act’s Article IX admonition that we must construe the Act liberally "to effectuate its purposes," one of which the Supreme Court has identified as the "protection] of prisoners against whom detainers are outstanding." <em>Cuyler, </em><a href="/us/449/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="350" data-cite="449 U.S. 433" data-case-ids="11716395" data-case-paths="/us/449/0433-01">449 U.S. at 448-49</a>, <a href="/us/449/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="351" data-cite="449 U.S. 433" data-case-ids="11716395" data-case-paths="/us/449/0433-01">101 S.Ct. 703</a>. Where, as here, the prosecution by its conduct manifests clear awareness of the invocation and applicability of the IADA, I would not punish the prisoner where the subsequent delay and failure to request a continuance under the Act falls squarely on the shoulders of authorities, over whom a prisoner necessarily has no control.</p>

I pause to note that the Majority mistakenly characterizes IADA Article IV as the relevant provision rather than Article III. Maj. Op. at <a href="/citations/?q=586%20Pa.%20574" class="citation" data-index="361" data-cite="586 Pa. 574">586 Pa. 574</a>-75 &amp; n. 5, 896 A.2d at 535-36 &amp; n. 5. Appellant, however, explicitly argues from Article III in its brief, and the trial court, where it to addresses the IADA argument, also focuses on Article III. While Article III provides a mechanism by which a prisoner may actively seek disposition of his outstanding charges, and affords the prosecution 180 days to bring prisoner to trial, Article IV provides a mechanism by which a party seeking to prosecute someone imprisoned in another jurisdiction may affirmatively seek to have the prisoner transferred to the prosecutor's jurisdiction. The principal difference between the two provisions is that, while Article III sets a 180-day time limit that is triggered by the detaining jurisdiction’s receipt of prisoner’s request for disposition, Article IV sets a 120-day time limit that is triggered by a prisoner's arrival in the detaining jurisdiction. Both, however, incorporate the same language requiring that a continuance be requested in open court during the running of the applicable time limit. Both mandate dismissal for failure to observe these requirements. No one disputes that Appellant invoked Article III. Accordingly, it is Article III that applies, not Article IV.</p>

Even where the prisoner affirmatively acts to delay his prosecution such that tolling is appropriate, it is not clear that the statute relieves the prosecution of the burden of seeking a continuance in open court, the prisoner and defense counsel being present, within the 180-day period.
