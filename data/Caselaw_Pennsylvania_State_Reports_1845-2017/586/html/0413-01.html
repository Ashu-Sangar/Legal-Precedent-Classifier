McNeil, Jr. (Henry Jr.), appeals the order of the Superior Court affirming the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, which dismissed his action alleging intentional interference with testamentary expectancy. The trial court dismissed the action with prejudice when Henry Jr. declined the court’s invitation to file an amended complaint after it denied his request for pre-complaint discovery. In refusing to amend his complaint, Henry Jr. made clear that, given the trial court’s prior ruling dismissing his complaint without prejudice, and absent pre-complaint discovery, he would be unable to survive a demurrer. Thus, he sought to challenge the trial court’s refusal to permit precomplaint discovery through the appellate process. We granted allocatur to clarify the parameters of pre-complaint discovery in Pennsylvania. Based upon the reasoning stated in Parts I, II, III, and V, which command a majority of the justices participating in this case, we reverse the order of the <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>Superior Court and remand the matter to the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings as directed in Part V.</p>

Henry Sr. was the president of McNeil Laboratories, Inc., the maker of Tylenol and other medicines.

Henry Jr. asserts that by the late 1980s, he and his mother had resumed a full relationship. In fact, he contends that during the ten years preceding her death in 1998, he had regular access to her. Simultaneously, however, Henry Jr. contends that the Jordans, motivated by their zeal for an increased share of Lois’s estate, thwarted his reconciliation with Lois by limiting his access to her and controlling every aspect of her daily life, including prevailing upon her to discharge her independent counsel in favor of their preferred law firm.</p>

Reading these contentions as consistently as possible, Henry Jr. appears to posit that the Jordans took all measures to discourage his relationship with Lois; they failed to the extent that Henry Jr. was able to restore a full relationship with her, but succeeded inasmuch as Lois never modified her estate plan to conform to her alleged intent to restore Henry Jr. to co-equal status with his siblings.</p>

Lois then executed codicils thereto on March 21, 1990, December 8, 1992, and September 17, 1997, before passing away in 1998. Lois died with a personal estate of approximately $10 million, and the right, pursuant to her general power of appointment, to alter Henry Sr.’s direction that the $625 million remaining in the marital trust be distributed equally to all the couple’s children except Henry Jr.</p>

It also is noteworthy that Lois named Henry Jr.’s three siblings as co-executors but excluded Henry Jr. from this role.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[155,920,1156,579]]]'>Henry Jr. did not contest the will and its codicils. Nevertheless, he did obtain permission from his siblings in their capacities as co-executors to review a small portion of his mother’s estate documents. Henry Jr. also hired private investigators to find evidence that Lois intended to change her will to his benefit. Ultimately, on March 9, 1999, Henry Jr. filed a Writ of Summons against the Jordans in their individual capacities in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The Jordans retained counsel, and on April 14, 1999, filed a Praecipe for a Rule requiring Henry Jr. to file a complaint within twenty days.</p>

The court reasoned that this was a conditional statement of intent, and legally insufficient to meet the first element of the tort of intentional interference with testamentary expectancy. Accordingly, on July 11, 2000, the court granted the Jordans’ preliminary objections, and dismissed Henry Jr.’s complaint without prejudice, providing him thirty days to file an amended complaint.</p>

Prior to allowing any documents to be copied or used in the litigation, the court would determine whether the material was relevant to Lois’s intent regarding Henry Jr. Henry Jr. rejected this compro<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>mise, choosing instead to file an amended motion for precomplaint discovery.</p>

Accordingly, on January 8, 2002, the court denied Henry Jr.’s motion for pre-complaint discovery and offered Henry Jr. thirty days to file an amended complaint.

The Jordans then contend that the final order dismissing Henry Jr.’s complaint with prejudice effected no more than a reiteration of the first dismissal order, and thus related back to it. Thus, the argument coalesces: while Henry Jr. takes the instant appeal in form from the order dismissing his complaint with prejudice, in substance it arises from the initial dismissal without prejudice order.

The court opined persuasively that the interests of justice are best served by a policy that limits the scope of precomplaint discovery. In support, it noted that defendants ideally should have the opportunity to test a complaint before submitting to discovery. Thus, when possible, discovery requests should follow pleadings to facilitate the narrowing of issues and concomitant narrowing of discovery. The court echoed <em>Wable </em>that discovery is limited to relevant matters and noted that, absent a complaint, neither a defendant nor a court is in a position to assess relevancy.

First, to articulate our reasoning fully, we must define probable cause <em>vis-vis </em>precomplaint discovery; what a court might reasonably expect a plaintiff to produce to demonstrate probable cause prior to the filing of a complaint differs substantially from the standard it might apply to a litigant who has successfully shepherded a lawsuit through a full trial. These differences are manifest in the two doctrines harmonized above. The Dragonetti Act, in its requirement that the proceedings from which the allegedly tortious conduct arose have been terminated in favor of the Dragonetti plaintiff, requires a hindsight evaluation of a litigant’s reasons for suing in the first instance. This inquiry, necessarily, will be colored by the information revealed during the course of trial. Conversely, any assessment of the propriety of a pre-complaint discovery request can be considered only in light of a plaintiffs offers of proof without benefit of more. Accordingly, even inasmuch as these two inquiries sound in substantially similar terminology, the import of those usages will vary to accommodate their divergent contexts.</p>

The Jordans suggest that Henry Jr. instead should have filed an amended complaint, as invited by the trial court’s initial order dismissing without prejudice, and included in that amended complaint a request for discovery. Only then, they argue, would the pre-complaint discovery issue be encompassed by the final order. We are uncertain how a request for discovery can be incorporated into a complaint. Because we reject the Jordans' entire premise, however, we find it unnecessary to examine further their dubious suggestion in this regard.</p>

      <p id="b662-8" data-blocks='[["BL_662.8",662,[255,2070,1158,273]]]'>. Until 1979, Pa.R.C.P. No. 4007 read that depositions that would "substantially aid” in the preparation of pleadings could be taken. This and other relevant Rules were amended in 1978, effective 1979. The allowance for pre-complaint is now set forth in Pa.R.C.P. No. 4001(c). <em>See supra, </em>pp. at 451-54, 894 A.2d at 1283-84. According to the 1978 Explanatory Note to Pa.R.C.P. No. 4001, the amendments were not intended to change the purposes of pre-complaint discovery.</p>
