(“UPS”). During 1996 and 1997, a group of individuals in Louisville, Kentucky, who performed network planning and logistics functions (part of Appellant’s core business functions), worked exclusively for Appellant. Formally, these individuals were employed by a sister corporation, UPS Aviation Services, Inc. (“Aviation Services”). Aviation Services issued their paychecks and performed tax and other <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>compliance matters required by law.

The Tax Code requires companies that transact some of their business out-of-state to apportion their tax liability according to a three-factor formula, where the three factors are payroll, property, and sales. <em>See </em>72 P.S. §§ 7401(3)2.(a)(2). Thus, the portion of taxes assigned to Pennsylvania consists of a fraction which is the average of three ratios: Pennsylvania payroll divided by overall payroll, Pennsylvania property divided by overall property, and Pennsylvania sales divided by overall sales. <em>See </em>72 P.S. §§ 7401(3)2.(a)(2); <em>Commonwealth v.

In this calculation, Appellant initially omitted any component relating to payroll, because it technically did not have any employees as a matter of employment law. However, Appellant subsequently requested the Department of Revenue (the “Department”) to recalculate these taxes using payroll as a third factor, in view of the Louisville employees having performed work for, and been paid by, Appellant (albeit indirectly). This request was denied. Appellant additionally used payroll as a <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>factor in tax year 1997, but the taxes were resettled by the Department without the payroll factor.

In addition to the reasons it cited, I view this Court’s precedent in <em>American Gas </em>as leading to the same result. In that matter, a parent corporation supplied a subsidiary with corporate officers and administrative support staff, under a written agreement whereby the subsidiary would pay funds back to the parent in return for these services. Although the contract in question specified that “no salaries are to be paid by [the subsidiary] for these Officers, but for their services and the services of their department [the subsidiary] agree[s] to pay [the parent corporation] $5000 per year ....,” this Court held that, in substance, the monies paid back to the parent corporation were payroll costs incurred by the subsidiary, notwithstanding that the individuals involved were formally employees of the parent.
