        "text": "OPINION\nJustice CASTILLE.\nAppellant/candidate Timothy J. Carroll appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court granting appellee/objector Dennis Garvey\u2019s petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s Nomination Petition for the Republican nomination for the office of Representative in the General Assembly from the 117th Legislative District, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania. The effect of the order below was to strike Carroll\u2019s name from the primary ballot. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order setting aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition and we order that Carroll\u2019s name be restored to the primary ballot.\nOn March 1, 2006, Carroll, the Mayor of Dallas Borough, Wyoming County, filed a timely nomination petition with the Secretary of the Commonwealth seeking to have his name placed on the Republican Primary ballot for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly from the 117th Legislative District. Carroll contemporaneously filed a Statement of Financial Interests, as required by Section 1104(b) of the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act (\u201cEthics Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101 et seq.:\n(1) Any candidate for a State-level public office shall file a statement of financial interests for the preceding calendar year with the commission on or before the last day for filing a petition to appear on the ballot for election. A copy of the statement of financial interests shall also be appended to such petition.\n* * * *\n(3) No petition to appear on the ballot for election shall be accepted by the respective State or local election officials unless the petition has appended thereto a statement of financial interests as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2). Failure to file the statement in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any other penalties provided, be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.\nId. \u00a7 1104(b). Block 4 of the Statement of Financial Interests form (which is produced by the State Ethics Commission) directs the filer to list his \u201cPUBLIC POSITION OR PUBLIC OFFICE (member, Commissioner, job title, etc.).\u201d The Block allows the filer to check the position(s) he is seeking, holds or held. Within that block, Carroll listed the positions he holds as \u201cMAYOR\u201d and \u201cLEGISLATIVE AID HOUSE,\u201d and he listed the position he was seeking as \u201cPA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE [sic].\u201d\nOn March 14, 2006, Garvey, a registered Republican and qualified elector in the 117th Legislative District, filed a petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition, alleging that Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests was \u201cfatally\u201d defective under Section 1104(b). Specifically, Garvey claimed that Carroll had failed to list two affiliations he was required to disclose pursuant to Section 1105(b) of the Act, which provides, in relevant part:\n(b) Required information. \u2014 The statement shall include the following information for the prior calendar year with regard to the person required to file the statement:\n(1) Name, address and public position.\n* * * *\n(8) Any office, directorship or employment of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(1), (8). First, Garvey alleged that Carroll violated subsection (b)(1) because he failed to list in Block 4 the unpaid public position he held as a board member and Assistant Secretary of the Dallas Area Municipal Authority (\u201cDAMA\u201d). Second, Garvey alleged that Carroll violated subsection (b)(8) because, in Block 13 of the Financial Statement \u2014 a block requiring filers to list \u201cOFFICE, DIRECTORSHIP OR EMPLOYMENT IN ANY BUSINESS\u201d \u2014 Carroll failed to list his uncompensated presidency of the not-for-profit \u201cTimothy J. Carroll\u2019s Mayors Club of Dallas Borough\u201d (\u201cMayors Club\u201d). Either or both defects, Garvey alleged, rendered Carroll\u2019s nomination petition fatally defective.\nOn March 20, 2006, the Commonwealth Court, per the Honorable James R. Kelley, Senior Judge, held a hearing on Garvey\u2019s Petition. The sole issue before the Court relevant here was the legal question of whether the above two omissions on Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests rendered it \u201cfatally defective\u201d under Section 1104(b)(3), thus warranting that Carroll\u2019s nomination petition be set aside.\nAt the hearing, Carroll testified that he created the Mayors Club to fund community projects. The Club is funded entirely by public donations, including donations by Carroll and people serving on borough council who donate their public salaries. Carroll testified that he gives the Club his entire salary of $600. The average balance in the Club\u2019s account is approximately $3,000.00. This money is used to finance projects that cannot be funded with taxpayer money. For example, the Club assisted the local Boy Scout troop, donated $300 to a scholarship fund, and gave $200 to a group that was assisting victims of Hurricane Katrina. Projects undertaken by the Club are discussed with borough council and reflected in the minutes of borough council meetings. Carroll receives no salary, income, or any benefit in kind from the Club. When asked why he did not report his association with the Club on his Statement of Financial Interests, Carroll responded that he viewed the Club to be part of his duties as Mayor, and that he received no compensation in connection with it. N.T. 3/20/06, 14-19.\nWith regard to his positions with DAMA, Carroll testified that he was appointed as a consequence of his position as Mayor, and that he received no salary, income or any other benefit as a result of serving on DAMA. Carroll further testified that he did not report this position on his Statement of Financial Interest for the same reason he did not report the Mayors Club: he received no compensation for his work and he believed his service to be part of his mayoral duties. Id. at 20.\nOn March 22, 2006, Judge Kelley issued a single-judge order and memorandum opinion which granted Garvey\u2019s petition and \u201cregrettably\u201d set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition. In Judge Kelley\u2019s view, the case was \u201ccontrolled by\u201d In re Nomination Petition of Anastasio, 820 A.2d 880 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2003), aff'd per curiam without opinion, 573 Pa. 512, 827 A.2d 373 (2003). In Anastasio, the candidate (there, for local office) had entered \u201cNone\u201d in block 10 of the Financial Statement \u2014 a block which directs disclosure of \u201cdirect or indirect sources of income.\u201d The candidate in fact had employment income. An objector filed a petition to strike, alleging a fatal defect; the trial court agreed and struck the nomination petition; a three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order in a brief published opinion; and this Court affirmed per curiam, by a vote of 4-3. Judge Kelley reasoned that, like the candidate in Anastasio, Carroll had \u201cfailed to designate anything on his financial statement from which a reviewer could ascertain that he served as the President of the Club and on the Board of DAMA.\u201d\nJudge Kelley also deemed the total non-disclosures here to be sufficient to distinguish the case from In re Nomination Petition of Kerry Benninghoff, 578 Pa. 402, 852 A.2d 1182 (2004). In Benninghoff, the candidate was an incumbent state representative seeking reelection who failed to list the Commonwealth as a direct source of income in Block 10. Benninghoff did, however, advert to his salaried position as a state representative (a salary which was of public record) in multiple other blocks on the form, and he disclosed supplemental income. This Court held that Benninghoff had \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the requirements of the Ethics Act, and thus he should be permitted to amend the form. We therefore reversed the decision below, which had granted a petition to set aside Benninghoff s nomination petition.\nFinally, although Judge Kelley acknowledged Carroll\u2019s argument that the non-disclosures at issue here involved uncompensated service, he summarily rejected that claim as follows: \u201c[t]he Ethics Act and the form instructions require identification of these offices regardless of compensation or financial interest.\u201d Slip op. at 7-8.\nIn his brief to this Court, Carroll argues that the fatal defect rule in Section 1104(b)(3), and as construed in Anastasio, does not apply to a failure to report his non-compensated positions with DAMA and the Mayors Club. Carroll notes that the Act speaks to financial interests, is designed to expose potential financial conflicts, and thereby acts to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people in their government by assuring the impartiality and honesty of public officials. Brief for Appellant, 7 (citing 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a)). Carroll argues that the fatal defect rule is designed to ensure that financial disclosures are fully and timely made, so that they may inform the public about a candidate\u2019s financial interests, thus facilitating the ability of the public to assess whether those financial interests are likely to influence, or conflict with, the candidate\u2019s execution of his public responsibilities. Consistently with this purpose, Carroll notes, the rule to date has been applied to terminate candidacies only where the candidate failed to file a timely financial statement, filed a timely financial statement but failed to disclose the sources of income or debts, or filed the financial statement in the wrong location. Brief for Appellant, 7-8.\nCarroll notes that none of the heretofore-recognized reasons for disqualification exists here. He filed his nomination petition and Statement of Financial Interests in timely fashion; he filed in the right place; and he did not fail to disclose any relevant financial interest. On the last point, Carroll notes that, in the cases where this Court has passed upon alleged defects in the substance of financial statements, we have applied the fatal defect rule only where there were \u201cerrors of omission relating to a candidate\u2019s financial interests.\u201d Id. at 9, citing In re Nominating Petitions of Braxton, 583 Pa. 35, 874 A.2d 1143 (2005) (per curiam) and In re Nomination Petition of Katofsky, 582 Pa. 557, 872 A.2d 1196 (2005) (p er curiam). See and contrast Benninghojf, supra (fatal defect rule not applied where candidate in substantial compliance with requirement to disclose financial interests). Carroll emphasizes that it is undisputed that there is no financial interest implicated in either of the positions he has been accused of wrongly failing to report. Thus, he did not deprive the voting public of information about his financial interests that would allow voters to assess whether those interests potentially conflict with the public trust. Instead, he has been denied the opportunity to appear on the ballot because his full disclosure of his financial interests did not include an exhaustive summary of his non-financial public associations. Carroll maintains that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s extension of the fatal defect rule to failures to report non-financial interests is an \u201cunprecedented expansion\u201d which cannot be squared with the terms or purpose of the Ethics Act and the financial statement requirement.\nBecause he receives no compensation from, and had no financial interest in, either of the associations he failed to report, Carroll argues that his Financial Statement cannot be deemed defective. He then cogently argues that:\nTo decide otherwise would mandate the reporting of any and every voluntary or not-for-profit affiliation which a candidate or public official may hold for fear of falling into the technical trap created by the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling ..., such as President of the Parent Teachers Association, Treasurer of the Township Youth Soccer Program, Chair of a church committee and a myriad of others.\nThe Legislature intended to require the disclosure of potential financial entanglements by Commonwealth officials and employees. The financial disclosure rules are not intended to deter those serving as elected officials from continuing to contribute to community life in other ways. To the contrary, the Legislature recognized that civically active citizens are likely to both run for political office and to continue to participate in ordinary civil life. See 65 Pa.C.S. [\u00a7 ] 1101.1(b) (\u201cIt is recognized that many public officials, including most local officials and members of the General Assembly, are citizen-officials who bring to their public office the knowledge and concerns of ordinary citizens and taxpayers. They should not be discouraged from maintaining their contacts with their community through their occupations and professions.\u201d).\nHere, Garvey seeks to disqualify Carroll not because he failed to disclose positions for which he is compensated or businesses in which he has a financial interest but merely because he failed to list his position with a non-profit organization and his service on a municipal authority, both undertaken solely as an adjunct to his official duties as borough mayor.\nBrief for Appellant, 9-10.\nIn addition to his broad argument stressing that the financial statement required by the Ethics Act is concerned only with financial interests, Carroll also addresses each of the affiliations at issue. With respect to his role in the Mayors Club, which Garvey claimed had to be disclosed as a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d affiliation under Section 1105(b)(8), Carroll notes that the term \u201cbusiness entity\u201d is not defined in the Ethics Act. But, Carroll argues, the elemental term \u201cbusiness\u201d is defined in the Act, and in a way that makes plain that it encompasses only for-profit entities: \u201c[a]ny corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, organization, self-employed individual, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any legal entity organized for profit.\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (emphasis supplied). Under the plain language of this definition, Carroll argues that his failure to list his position as president of the non-profit Mayors Club did not violate the Ethics Act because there is \u201csimply nothing\u201d in the Act that requires disclosing affiliations with nonprofit business entities. Moreover, Carroll argues, even if this plain language could be construed to be ambiguous, it would be inequitable and unfair to fault him for failing to predict such an interpretation. Carroll accurately notes that there is no case decision, and no rulings or information from the Ethics Commission, to warn candidates of such a non-textual interpretation. Carroll notes that the Act explicitly recognizes the need for \u201cclear guidelines,\u201d see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a), yet the novel interpretation invoked against him below was not based upon any extant, clear guideline.\nTurning to DAMA, where his affiliation is as an unpaid Board member and Assistant Secretary, Carroll argues that he serves on the Authority only by virtue of his position as Mayor. Because he listed his mayoralty, Carroll argues, he also effectively disclosed this lesser-included affiliation. In any event, Carroll notes, nothing in the fact of this position, which is but an incident of his (disclosed) public position as Mayor, speaks to his financial situation, as he has no financial stake in DAMA and he receives no compensation. Thus, had he listed the affiliation, Carroll argues, it would have contributed nothing to the public\u2019s understanding of his financial interests.\nFinally, and in the alternative, Carroll argues that even if his Financial Statement could be deemed defective for failing to list these two unpaid associations, he should be permitted to amend it pursuant to the substantial compliance rule announced in Benninghoff.\nGarvey counters with an absolutist position. He argues that Carroll\u2019s \u201cerrors of omission\u201d were fatal defects and thus his nomination petition was rightly set aside. Thus, in Garvey\u2019s view, Section 1105(b)(8) of the Act \u201cmandates\u201d that a candidate \u201cdisclose any office of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\u201d Brief of Appellee, 6. Carroll\u2019s position as president of the Mayors Club therefore had to be reported on his Financial Statement. Garvey stresses the broad language of the provision when read in isolation, i.e., \u201cany office\u201d of \u201cany nature\u201d in \u201cany business entity.\u201d Garvey then notes that the Mayors Club is an active non-profit corporation registered with the Pennsylvania Department of State, and Carroll is its president and sole officer. Therefore, Garvey argues, Carroll had to report this business \u201coffice\u201d and his failure to do so was a fatal defect. Notably, Garvey does not address Carroll\u2019s argument that the Act defines \u201cbusiness\u201d in terms of for-profit entities.\nWith regard to Carroll\u2019s positions with DAMA, Garvey argues that Section 1105(b)(1) \u201cobligates\u201d candidates to disclose public positions they hold or held. Garvey then argues that appointed members of municipal authorities are public officials, and therefore, Carroll\u2019s failure to report his position with DAMA was an independent fatal defect. Moreover, Garvey disputes Carroll\u2019s argument that his service on DAMA was a mandatory incident of his elected position as Mayor; to the contrary, Garvey maintains, this association was \u201cpurely voluntary.\u201d\nGarvey also disputes Carroll\u2019s argument that he substantially complied with the Act. Garvey argues that Carroll\u2019s omissions in Blocks 4 and 13 involve associations not otherwise accounted for in the Financial Statement, and that fact renders inoperable the substantial compliance rule set forth in Benninghoff. Garvey concludes that either or both of Carroll\u2019s omissions rendered his Statement of Financial Interests fatally defective under Section 1104(b)(3) of the Act, warranting that his nomination petition be set aside.\nNotably, at the outset of his otherwise straightforward argument, Garvey acknowledges that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the fatal defect rule is \u201cto insure public disclosures of relevant financial information.\u201d Brief of Appellee, 10 (emphasis added). Yet, Garvey never discusses the fact that neither of Carroll\u2019s unreported positions implicated his financial information. Nor does Garvey argue, for example, that there is some indirect way in which Carroll\u2019s financial situation was implicated by these non-financial affiliations. Instead, Garvey focuses on the language of the Section 1105(b) affiliations in isolation, separate and apart from the overall financial emphasis of the form and the Act, as well as the purpose he has generally acknowledged, and then declares that any omission of information amounts to a fatal defect. Thus, there is a missing essential ingredient when Garvey later declares that the non-disclosures here deprived voters of \u201can opportunity to accurately inspect Carroll\u2019s financial portfolio.\u201d Id., 17.\nIn reviewing an order concerning the validity of a challenge to a nomination petition, this Court may reverse only if the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, there was an abuse of discretion, or there was an error of law. In re Nomination Petition of Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44, 49 (2004); In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001). In this case, the necessary facts are not in dispute, and there is no discretionary ruling of the court below at issue. The question, instead, concerns the proper interpretation of the Ethics Act. As the question is one of statutory interpretation, a purely legal issue, this Court\u2019s substantive review is plenary and non-deferential. E.g. Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manufacturing Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003). The object of interpretation and construction of all statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a); In re Canvass of Absentee Ballots of November 4, 2003 General Election, 577 Pa. 231, 843 A.2d 1223, 1230 (2004). When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, their plain language is generally the best indication of legislative intent. Bowser v. Blom, 569 Pa. 609, 807 A.2d 830, 835 (2002); Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995); i Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). A reviewing court should resort to other considerations to determine legislative intent only when the words of the statute are not explicit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). See Canvass of Absentee Ballots, 843 A.2d at 1230 (citing O\u2019Rourke v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Corrections, 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001)). In ascertaining legislative intent, this Court is guided by, among other things, the primary purpose of the statute, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(4), and the consequences of a particular interpretation. Id. \u00a7 1921(c)(6). See Vitae Corp. v. Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Rozanc), 578 Pa. 574, 854 A.2d 481, 485 (2004).\nPreliminarily, we note that the court below plainly erred to the extent it deemed the issue here to be \u201ccontrolled by\u201d the Anastasio case. Anastasio involved a failure to disclose a direct source of income on a candidate\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests. In contrast, Carroll poses the very distinct question of whether and when a failure to disclose non-financial associations on a Statement of Financial Interests should trigger operation of the fatal defect rule. Anastasio does not purport to resolve that question. Nor does Benninghoff resolve the question as that case, too, involved the question of whether what was unquestionably a financial interest \u2014 the incumbent\u2019s legislative salary \u2014 was adequately accounted for in his financial statement. Although Anastasio and Benninghoff provide a backdrop for the current inquiry, and the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d rule obviously may have applications broader than were at issue in Benninghoff, neither case resolves the distinct question we must decide.\nThe intent and purpose of the Ethics Act is not shrouded in mystery. The Act is part of the \u201caccountability\u201d section of Title 65, which governs \u201cpublic officers.\u201d In Section 1101.1 of the Act, the General Assembly explicitly set forth its \u201cpurpose\u201d as follows:\n(a) Declarations. \u2014 The Legislature hereby declares that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office other than compensation provided by law is a violation of that trust. In order to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this Commonwealth in their government, the Legislature further declares that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or nominees or candidates for public office do not conflict with the public trust. Because public confidence in government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of public officials, this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete financial disclosure as specified in this chapter. Furthermore, it is recognized that clear guidelines are needed in order to guide public officials and employees in their actions. Thus, the General Assembly by this chapter intends to define as clearly as possible those areas which represent conflict with the public trust.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a). The substantive focus of this declaration is on financial interests, and particularly, how complete disclosure of financial interests may further the \u201cpublic trust,\u201d \u201cstrengthen the faith and confidence of the people\u201d in their government, and assure the public that the \u201cfinancial interests\u201d of public officials \u201cdo not conflict with the public trust.\u201d See also Benninghoff, 852 A.2d at 1186 (\u201cThe obvious purpose of the Ethics Act is to mandate disclosure of the financial dealings of public officials.\u201d).\nSection 1102, the definitions section of the Act, defines \u201cfinancial interest\u201d as: \u201cAny financial interest in a legal entity engaged in business for profit which comprises more than 5% of the equity of the business or more than 5% of the assets of the economic interest in indebtedness.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1102. As already noted in discussing Carroll\u2019s argument, the definitions section also defines the term \u201cbusiness\u201d in a way that supports a reading that it intends to cover only for-profit entities. Section 1104 then sets forth the annual \u201cstatement of financial interests\u201d filing requirement, with subsections (a) through (c) describing the obligations of \u201cpublic official or employee,\u201d \u201ccandidate,\u201d and \u201cnominee,\u201d respectively. Subsection 1104(d) then addresses the failure to file, while subsection 1104(e) provides for public inspection and copying. In every instance, the required filing is designated \u201cstatement of financial interests.\u201d Section 1105, which is entitled \u201cStatement of financial interests,\u201d then provides that the statement shall be on a form prescribed by the State Ethics Commission and sets forth what required information must be included in the statement.\nIn light of this construct, we have no difficulty in finding that the Act did not require Carroll to disclose his \u201cinterest\u201d in the non-profit Mayors Club. The Act could not be any clearer that the concern is with financial interests. Moreover, the Act\u2019s definitions of the terms \u201cfinancial interest\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 definitions which, as Carroll reasonably construed them, see supra note 10, are in keeping with the purpose of the legislation announced in Section 1101.1 \u2014 support a finding that Carroll was not required to list his association with it on his Financial Statement. The Mayors Club is a non-profit corporate entity, from which Carroll receives no financial compensation. Indeed, as a financial matter, his connection with the entity is a net loss, as the Mayors Club was funded, in part, from his donated mayoral salary.\nTurning to Carroll\u2019s uncompensated positions with DAMA, we will assume for purposes of decision that these positions are indeed \u201cpublic positions\u201d for purposes of subsection 1105(b)(1) but, like Carroll\u2019s association with the Mayors Club, we conclude that disclosure was not required because the association did not remotely implicate Carroll\u2019s financial interests. Viewed in isolation, subsection (1) is unlike the other subsections in 1105(b) in that it does not address matters that necessarily involve financial information. Instead, the subsection concerns what amounts to the filer\u2019s identifying information: i.e., his \u201cname, address and public position.\u201d This information reveals who it is that is filing and why. It is important to remember that the Act, and the Commission\u2019s form, governs a wide variety of people in public service, people who may have to file for different and overlapping reasons. Some file as incumbent office holders; some as incumbents seeking reelection; some as new candidates for office; some as long-term public employees seeking no office. In any given year, only a small percentage of Ethics Act filers are then actively seeking public office. Most filers are public employees who must detail their financial interests year after year, as the public trust does not go on holiday. Finally, some filers, like Carroll, must file for multiple reasons, i.e., both because of positions currently held as well as an elected position actively being sought.\nFor purposes of the Act\u2019s fatal defect rule \u2014 a rule which applies only to the extent that a filer is filing as a \u201ccandidate\u201d for office, \u00absee 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104(b) \u2014 we do not think that the directive that candidates list their \u201cpublic position\u201d (notably, the General Assembly employed the singular) can be viewed in splendid isolation from the rest of the Act, and thus as requiring a detailing of all existing public associations, irrespective of whether they implicate a candidate\u2019s financial interests or reveal the office the candidate is seeking. A reasonable person interested in seeking public office who consulted the statute, the Commission\u2019s form, and its accompanying instructions \u2014 all of which speak in terms of financial interests \u2014 could reasonably understand the subsection (1) requirement to apply only to those \u201cpositions\u201d necessary to identify the candidate, the office he seeks, and his financial interests. One does not have a financial interest in uncompensated positions one undertakes as a corollary to an official public position. The fact of the matter is that not all public positions and associations implicate a candidate\u2019s financial interests, and nothing in the statute purports to require disclosure of non-financial interests, upon pain of being excluded from seeking office.\nFinally, in determining whether the General Assembly can be said to have intended the fatal defect rule to apply to the sort of \u201cnon-disclosure\u201d alleged here, we must be \u201cmindful of the general command that we presume that it \u2018does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d Koken v. Reliance Ins. Co., 893 A.2d 70, 81 (2006), quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1); see also Street Road Bar & Grille, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd., 583 Pa. 72, 876 A.2d 346, 353 (2005). As part of its statement of \u201cpurpose\u201d in Section 1101.1, the General Assembly included the following \u201crecognition:\u201d\nIt is recognized that many public officials, including most local officials and members of the General Assembly, are citizen-officials who bring to their public office the knowledge and concerns of ordinary citizens and taxpayers. They should not be discouraged from maintaining their contacts with their community through their occupations and professions. Thus, in order to foster maximum compliance with its terms, this chapter shall be administered in a manner that emphasizes guidance to public officials and public employees regarding the ethical standards established by this chapter.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(b). Many candidates for public office\u2014 like many current holders of public office \u2014 have numerous public associations and positions in addition to their official, paid positions. Many of these positions do not involve a financial interest and possible concomitant \u201cviolation of the public trust.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1101.1(a). These associations simply reflect active lives of good citizenship. Upon reading the Act as a whole, and with an eye to its obvious, salutary purpose, we do not believe that the General Assembly remotely intended the disproportionate consequence of denying a candidate the right to run for office to attend a failure to disclose a public \u201cposition\u201d which does not involve the candidate\u2019s financial interests.\nFor these reasons, we hold that the court below erred in finding that Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests was fatally defective and in granting Garvey\u2019s petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and direct that Carroll\u2019s name be restored to the primary ballot.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice NEWMAN and Justices SAYLOR and EAKIN join this opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice BALDWIN.\n. Garvey's petition was filed in the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction, pursuant to Section 764(2) of the Judicial Code. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 764(2). This Court\u2019s direct appeal jurisdiction over Carroll\u2019s appeal is pursuant to Section 723(a) of the Code. Id. \u00a7 723(a).\n. Subsection 1104(b)(2) governs candidates for county or local office and thus is not relevant here.\n. The State Ethics Commission's instructions provide, with respect to Block 4:\nPlease check the appropriate block (seeking, holding, held) for each position you list in the blocks below. List all of the public position(s) which you are seeking, currently hold or have held in the prior calendar year. Please be sure to include job titles and official titles such as \"member\u201d or \"commissioner\u201d (even if serving as alternate/designee).\n. In Block 5, Carroll further identified these public positions, as required.\n. The Ethics Commission's instructions for Block 13 provide:\nOFFICE, DIRECTORSHIP OR EMPLOYMENT IN ANY BUSINESS ENTITY: List your office, directorship or employment in any business. If you do not have such a position to report, then check \u201cNONE\u201d.\n. In his petition to set aside, Garvey also alleged that Carroll failed to list, as a direct or indirect source of yearly income totaling $1300 or more, see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(5), his part-time position as a police officer with the Dallas Township Police Department. Garvey withdrew this claim at the hearing after the parties stipulated that Carroll only received $1268 in income from this employment in 2005. N.T. 3/20/06, 3-4.\n.

We recognize that there are two possible constructions of the \"organized for profit\u201d reference in the Act's definition of \"business,\u201d one which would construe the reference as modifying all previous examples in the definition (which is flow Carroll reads the statute), and one which would construe it as applying only to the last antecedent example. See, e.g., McKinley v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Transp., 564 Pa. 565, 769 A.2d 1153, 1160 n. 10 (2001) (discussing \"last antecedent rule\u201d of grammatical construction). To the extent the definitional language is ambiguous, we may look to principles of construction. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b); Canvass of Absentee Ballots, supra. For reasons set forth at greater length below, the plainly-stated purpose of the statute, and the harsh consequence that would accompany a construction that would lead to a finding of a material non-disclosure, convince us that any ambiguity in the definition should be construed most favorably to candidates seeking ballot access.\n. Section 1105(a) & (b) provide in full:\n(a) Form. \u2014 The statement of financial interests filed pursuant to this chapter shall be on a form prescribed by the commission.

Carroll (Candidate) to appear on the primary ballot despite his failure to make a mandatory disclosure under the Act. Because I believe this result defies the Ethics Act\u2019s plain language, I respectfully dissent.\nThe Commonwealth Court found fatal to Candidate\u2019s nomination petition his failure to disclose his positions as President of the not-for-profit \u201cTimothy J.

I would not reach that question, however, because I believe Candidate\u2019s failure to disclose his position as board member for DAMA standing alone requires that his nomination petition be set aside. The analysis that follows, accordingly, concerns only that aspect of the Majority\u2019s opinion that forgives Candidate\u2019s failure to disclose his undisputedly public position with DAMA.\nOur object in construing a statute is \u201cto effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1921(b). We construe a statute to give effect to all of its provisions, id., rendering the entirety of a statute \u201ceffective and certain,\u201d id. \u00a7 1922(2), and guided by the presumption \u201c[t]hat the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1922(1).\nThe Ethics Act requires each public official and public employee to file an annual statement of financial interests (Statement), 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104(a), and requires a candidate for local, county, or state office to file his Statement on or before the last day for filing a petition to appear on the ballot. Id. \u00a7 1104(b). The Statement is to be filed on a form promulgated by the State Ethics Commission (Commission), id. \u00a7 1105(a), and must contain the information enumerated in \u00a7 1105(b). That section provides, inter alia, that a candidate for public office \u201cshall\u201d disclose his or her \u201c[n]ame, address and public position.\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(1). The Statement of Financial Interests form (Form) promulgated by the Commission is consistent with this provision, requiring, in block 4, the candidate to disclose any \u201cPUBLIC POSITION OR OFFICE (member, Commissioner, job title, etc.) [the candidate is] seeking[,] hold[s, or] held.\u201d The Ethics Act leaves no doubt as to the sanction for noncompliance with \u00a7 1105: \u201cFailure to file the statement in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall ... be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1104(b)(3) (emphasis added).\nThe \u201cfatal defect\u201d rule is the product of the General Assembly\u2019s amendment to the Ethics Act following rulings by this Court allowing for some modicum of leniency in addressing candidates\u2019 good faith failures to observe the Act\u2019s require-merits in cases such as Commonwealth, State Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Baldwin, 498 Pa. 255, 445 A.2d 1208 (1982). See In re Petition of Cioppa, 533 Pa. 564, 626 A.2d 146, 148-49 (1993) (opinion announcing the judgment of the Court). In Cioppa, we discerned in the legislature\u2019s amendment to the Ethics Act, see Act of June 26, 1989, P.L. 26, No. 9, \u00a7 1, its intent to render unequivocal the consequence of a candidate\u2019s failure to file a Statement \u201cin accordance with the provisions\u201d of the Act, and found the \u201cfatal defect\u201d language added to then section \u00a7 404(b)(3) to be \u201cclear and unambiguous.\u201d Id. (quoting 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 404(b)(3), now 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104(b)(3)). In the years since, the legislature has made no effort to alleviate the more severe effects spawned by the decisions of the Commonwealth Court and this Court in the wake of the 1989 amendments and Cioppa, even when those cases set aside nomination petitions due to omissions from timely but incomplete Statements. See In re Nomination Petition of Braxton, 583 Pa. 35, 874 A.2d 1143 (2005) (per curiam) (undisclosed income); In re Nomination Petition of Katofsky, 582 Pa. 557, 872 A.2d 1196 (2005) (per curiam) (same); In re Nomination Petition of Anastasio, 820 A.2d 880 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), aff'd per curiam, 573 Pa. 512, 827 A.2d 373 (2003) (same). But see In re Petition of Benninghoff, 578 Pa. 402, 852 A.2d 1182, 1189 (2004) (Castille, J., concurring) (interpreting the 1989 amendments as requiring application of the \u201cfatal delect\u201d rule only to untimely financial interest statements).\nWhile our interpretive function sometimes requires us to attend to structural cues and the larger picture of a statutory scheme in discerning legislative intent, the Majority crosses the f\u00edne line that separates this salutary approach from disregarding the letter of the law in pursuit of its spirit. The Majority finds support for its exclusive focus on a candidate\u2019s financial entanglements from the Act\u2019s statement of purpose, which, as the Majority appropriately notes, is steeped in language emphasizing the importance of full financial disclosure. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a) (\u201cPurpose\u201d). In section 1101.1(c) (\u201cLegislative intent\u201d), however, the legislature charges the independent State Ethics Commission (Commission) with \u201cpromoting public confidence in government,\u201d a mandate that I read to encompass more than mere oversight of a candidate\u2019s financial interests. For example, our legislature under the same title has deemed it necessary to preclude a party from holding certain offices contemporaneously, see 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1, et seq. (enumerating \u201cincompatible\u201d offices), and has barred \u201csubversive\u201d persons from holding Commonwealth office. See 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211, et seq. While these provisions do not appear in the Chapter before us, they illustrate the legislature\u2019s cognizance of the danger of attending only to a candidate\u2019s financial interests when assessing his candidacy, or, alternatively, going through the motions of requiring other disclosures but providing no sanction sufficient to deter noncompliance.\nThe Majority acknowledges that \u00a7 1105(b)(1) differs in its emphasis on identifying information from \u00a7\u00a7 1105(b)(2)-(10), which require a candidate to divulge information explicitly directed at revealing nascent financial conflicts of interest. Maj. Op. at 586 Pa. 640, 896 A.2d at 575 (acknowledging that \u201csubsection (1) is unlike the other subsections in 1105(b) in that it does not address matters that necessarily involve financial information\u201d). Nevertheless, the Majority finds in the larger statute evidence that this particular provision is directed not at candidates for public office, but rather at career public employees whose \u201cpublic positions\u201d are a form of identifying information and who also are required to file annual Statements. In order to take the statute at face value and require that candidates for public office disclose a \u201cpublic position\u201d regardless of whether the position is compensated, the Majority argues, requires viewing \u00a7 1105(b)(1) in \u201csplendid isolation from the rest of the Act.\u201d Thus, it concludes that \u201c[a] reasonable person interested in seeking public office who consulted the statute, the Commission\u2019s form, and its accompanying instructions \u2014 all of which speak in terms of financial interests \u2014 could reasonably understand the subsection (1) requirement to apply only to those \u2018positions\u2019 necessary to identify the candidate, the office he seeks, and his financial interests.\u201d Maj. Op. at 586 Pa. 641, 896 A.2d at 576 (emphasis in original). This reading fails, however, to give real effect to the term \u201cpublic position\u201d in the context of \u00a7 1105(b)(1) in violation of our interpretive mandate. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe Majority maintains that a contrary reading would lead to an absurd result unintended by the legislature. To this end, the Majority adopts wholesale Appellant\u2019s doomsday scenario: that to require disclosure of his position with DAMA, a \u201cposition\u201d he does not dispute is \u201cpublic\u201d for purposes of the Ethics Act, would be tantamount to requiring disclosure of positions such as \u201cPresident of the Parent Teachers Association, Treasurer of the Township Youth Soccer Program, Chair of a church committee, and a myriad of others.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 10; see Maj. Op. at 586 Pa. 642, 896 A.2d at 577 (noting that \u201c[t]hese associations simply reflect active lives of good citizenship,\u201d and finding \u201cdisproportionate\u201d the \u201cconsequence of denying a candidate the right to run for office [for] failure to disclose a public \u2018position\u2019 which does not involve the candidate\u2019s financial interests\u201d).\nCandidate\u2019s litany, however, is a strawman argument to the extent that it is any argument at all. No positions in the above list would be interpreted by reasonable people as \u201cpublic positions\u201d for purposes of the statute. To find otherwise would require disregarding the narrower definition of \u201cpublic\u201d manifest in the Act\u2019s full title and its definitional section. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101 (identifying the statute as the \u201cPublic Official and Employee Ethics Act\u201d); \u00a7 1102 (defining a \u201cpublic official\u201d as \u201c[a]ny person elected by the public or elected or appointed by a governmental body or an appointed official in the executive, legislative or judicial branch of this Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof\u2019 and \u201cpublic employee,\u201d in relevant part and with exceptions immaterial to this discussion, as \u201c[a]ny individual employed by the Commonwealth or a political subdivision who is responsible for taking or recommending official action of a nonministerial nature\u201d). Informed by these definitions, we can conclude at a minimum that a \u201cpublic position\u201d is one intimately involved with the functions of state or local government.\nTo the extent the Act is less than clear, I would look to the Form promulgated by the Commission in satisfaction of its express statutory responsibility, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(a), which effectively manifests its administrative interpretation of the Act. In block 4, the Form requires disclosure of \u201cPUBLIC POSITION OR PUBLIC OFFICE (member, Commissioner, job title, etc.),\u201d and the accompanying instructions provide as follows:\nPlease check the appropriate block (seeking, holding, held) for each position you list in the blocks below. List all of the public position(s) which you are seeking, currently hold or have held in the prior calendar year, Please be sure to include job titles and official titles such as \u201cmember\u201d or \u201ccommissioner\u201d (even if serving as an alternate/designees).\nMaj. Op. at 586 Pa. 627 n. 3, 896 A.2d at 578 n. 3 (emphasis in original). \u201c[A]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute for which it has enforcement responsibility is entitled to substantial deference.\u201d Borough of Pottstown v. Pennsylvania Mun. Retirement Bd., 551 Pa. 605, 712 A.2d 741, 744 (1998); see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). Of course, where an administrative interpretation of a statute is inconsistent with the statute itself, or where the statute\u2019s meaning is unambiguous, administrative interpretations carry little or no weight. Pottstown, 712 A.2d at 744; 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). In the instant case, however, either \u00a7 1501(b)(l)\u2019s requirements are not clear on their face and are clarified by the Ethics Commission\u2019s uncomplicated reiteration on the Form and its accompanying instructions of the requirement that candidates disclose \u201cpublic position[s]\u201d without regard to whether the positions are compensated, or the statute is unambiguous and means precisely what it says \u2014 that a candidate\u2019s \u201cpublic position[s],\u201d like his name and address, are disclosures required by the Act.\nThe Form and accompanying instructions also resist the Majority\u2019s attempt to limit the \u201cpublic position\u201d language to apply only to \u201cpublic employees,\u201d its only effort at giving effect to the language. The instructions\u2019 express requirement that a signatory detail not only positions currently held but those formerly held during the prior year seldom will apply to public employees filing the Form for purposes of continuing employment. Moreover, the statute clearly identifies public employees as such, and we should not read \u201cpublic position\u201d to apply only to those individuals picked out by another, specifically defined term. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (defining \u201cpublic employees\u201d). The Form calls for the disclosure of any \u201cPUBLIC POSITION OR PUBLIC OFFICE,\u201d and notes parenthetically that these include \u201cmember\u201d and \u201cCommissioner,\u201d but does not require that these be compensated, a circumstance necessitated by the definition of \u201cpublic employee.\u201d See id. Reading these terms in a commonsense fashion and in tandem with the statutory language they effectuate, it is difficult not to conclude that the Commission envisaged the disclosure of more than mere paying public positions.\nI think it far less absurd to interpret 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(1) consistently with the Commission to require disclosure of any \u201cpublic position\u201d held in the year preceding execution of the Form. The Majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 1105 effectively reduces the plain language requirement that candidates for public office disclose any \u201cpublic position\u201d to mere surplusage, an untenable result where an equally reasonable construction of the Act gives substantial effect to that term and all others. I detect no harm in the prospect that the statute should be construed in a way that dictates broader disclosures from prudent candidates for office; certainly, the reading advanced herein is neither absurd nor incapable of execution. Moreover, this reading has the virtue of flowing directly from, and effectuating word by word, the Act\u2019s plain language.\nEven if our ruling were to prod candidates to read the Act overinclusively, little obvious harm would descend from additional disclosures, the burden of which would be offset by the benefit to the electors both in knowledge of whom they are electing and in their confidence that the Commonwealth privileges the sort of transparency the Ethics Act plainly is designed to enhance. For the same reasons, no serious candidate would be deterred by the prospect of such disclosures. Regardless, I believe that to err in favor of disclosure especially of public positions held by a candidate best reflects legislative intent, see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(b) (recognizing the often myriad civic and public involvements of candidates for public office, but underscoring the legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto foster maximum compliance with [the chapter\u2019s] terms\u201d). Especially in light of the 1989 amendments to the Ethics Act, only a far more strained reading could conclude that the legislature intended candidates to parse the statute narrowly to minimize disclosure of public and private involvements that might bear on a candidate\u2019s fitness for office (and intended courts to err in favor of less than forthcoming candidates) based upon overly formal readings of the disclosure statute. Indeed, I find it perversely contrary to manifest legislative intent to encourage candidates to err on the side of nondisclosure.\nIn sum, I believe any reasonable candidate reading the Ethics Act in conjunction with the Commission\u2019s Form, both of which require the disclosure of any \u201cpublic position,\u201d would in prudence disclose a position like Candidate\u2019s board membership with DAMA. In failing to do so, Candidate violated the letter and the spirit of the Act. For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling. Thus, I dissent.\nJustice BALDWIN joins this Dissenting Opinion.\n. My inclination is to construe the term \"public position\" narrowly to avoid undue challenges to would-be candidates\u2019 ballot access. That said, even on a narrow definition, board membership with a municipal sewage authority, which funnels substantial public funds into a function critical to public health, certainly qualifies. Indeed, testifying before the Commonwealth Court, Candidate all but conceded the point. See, e.g., Notes of Testimony, 3/20/06 (N.T.), at 11 (DAMA authorized to expend public funds), 12 (DAMA identified by the Pennsylvania Department of State as a Pennsylvania municipal authority).\n. In Cioppa, Chief Justice Nix authored the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court. Then-Justice Cappy concurred in the result, and Justice Papadakos authored a concurring opinion joined by Justice Larsen. Justices McDermott and Zappala did not participate in the decision.\n. The language of \u00a7 1104(b)(3) does not differ materially from that of former \u00a7 404(b).\n. In Benninghoff, Mr. Justice Castille interpreted Cioppa as signaling that the only fatal defect is timeliness. 852 A.2d at 1192 (Castille, J., concurring) (\"Given the occasion for the amendment [to the Ethics Act], I would conclude that fatal defects are limited to untimely filings.\" (emphasis in original)). I do not read the Court's decision in that case so narrowly, though certainly it was couched in terms of the issues of timeliness that then faced this Court. To the extent the opinion announcing the judgment of the Court in Cioppa was correct that the legislature intended to clarify the Ethics Act in favor of more stern consequences in the wake of our decision in Baldwin, it could have specified that only untimeliness in filing a Statement would constitute a fatal defect. To the contrary, however, the Act\u2019s amended language emphasized that a fatal defect would be found for failure to file a Statement \u2019\u2019in accordance with the provisions\u201d of the Act, a far more sweeping proposition than that espoused by Mr. Justice Castille.\n. This \"could reasonably understand\u201d formulation, it bears noting, is inconsistent with Pennsylvania courts\u2019 prior indifference to whether a candidate's failure to make a mandatory disclosure was in good faith. See In re Nomination Petition of Braxton, 874 A.2d 1143 (Pa.2005); In re Nomination Petition of Anastasio, 820 A.2d 880 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), aff'd per curiam, 573 Pa. 512, 827 A.2d 373 (2003).\n. See supra n. 1 and accompanying text.\n. Notably, the Act\u2019s definition of \"public official\u201d does not require that the official be compensated.\n. I share the Majority's concern that an overbroad definition of \"public position\u201d will simultaneously impose a potentially onerous burden on the most civically active candidates for office, and might leave parties acting in good faith vulnerable to specious challenges. As noted, infra, I believe that the distinction drawn by the Commission between \"public position\u201d and \"public office\u201d is material, and consistently with the Ethics Act requires disclosure of the position here at issue. I also note, however, that the Act already contains the seeds of much mischief in its broad definition of \"public official.\" Perhaps, to the extent the result reached herein does not reflect legislative intent in either direction, the General Assembly will clarify the disclosures necessary to strike a fair balance between ballot access and transparency.\n. Admittedly, the Act envisages circumstances where former public employees will file such a form. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104 (requiring a public official or employees to file a Statement by May 1 of the year after he leaves a covered position).\n. For the same reason, I do not believe our ruling with regard to the term \"public position\" bears on the meaning of \"public official,\" which, as noted, supra n. 7, is defined broadly by the Act.\n. My resolution of this issue would leave open the possibility that the \"substantial compliance\u201d exception carved out by this Court in In re Nomination Petition of Benninghoff, 578 Pa. 402, 852 A.2d 1182 (2004), and distinguished by the Commonwealth Court in this case, would excuse Candidate\u2019s nondisclosure in this case. Although he opined that his appointment to the board of DAMA by the Dallas Borough Council occurred only in virtue of his office as Mayor, Candidate conceded that the position was neither a direct nor a necessary consequence of that office. See N.T. at 24 (acknowledging that the appropriate representative to DAMA was not necessarily the Mayor, but rather \u201cwhoever council would appoint,\u201d and that his position as Mayor did not \"mandate that [he] serve with a municipal authority,\u201d and that he could have turned the appointment down). Thus, contra our ruling in Benninghoff, the face of the Candidate's form neither expressly revealed his position on the board of DAMA nor justified even the most astute reader in inferring, without more, that one necessarily entailed the other. Benninghoff is distinguishable and should afford Candidate no quarter from the consequences of his non-disclosure.",
