        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nExel Logistics appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), which granted Supersedeas Fund reimbursement. We affirm.\nAppellant issued a notice of compensation payable after claimant sustained a work-related shoulder injury while employed at appellant\u2019s business in May, 1993. In August, 1997, pursuant to \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, appellant filed a petition for forfeiture, alleging claimant refused reasonable medical treatment, and requested a supersedeas while its petition was pending. In January, 1998, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) denied appellant\u2019s request for supersedeas; appellant continued to pay compensation and medical benefits. In January, 1999, the WCJ granted appellant\u2019s petition for forfeiture for the period July 14, 1995, through September 30, 1998, finding claimant refused reasonable medical treatment.\nAppellant filed a petition for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, requesting $17,798.67 in compensation and $1,375.25 in medical bills paid while its forfeiture petition was pending. The WCJ denied appellant\u2019s petition, finding it did not fulfill the requirements for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement because the request for forfeiture was made pursuant to \u00a7 306(f.l)(8), and not pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 413 or 430 of the Act. The WCAB, however, granted appellant\u2019s request for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, concluding the request fell under \u00a7 430. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding \u00a7 443 specifically provides for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement only where the request was under \u00a7\u00a7 413 or 430; \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) itself does not allow for reimbursement. Bureau of Workers\u2019 Comp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Exel Logistics), 827 A.2d 529, 533 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). We granted review to consider the application of \u00a7 443 in the context of forfeiture petitions under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8).\nThis Court\u2019s appellate review in workers\u2019 compensation matters is limited to determining whether an error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated, whether practices or procedures of a Commonwealth agency were followed, and whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; Hanna-berry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa. 66, 834 A.2d 524, 527 (2003). In examining questions of law, our scope of review is plenary. Daniels v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (Tristate Transp.), 574 Pa. 61, 828 A.2d 1043, 1046-1047 (2003).\nAppellant argues the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision is unreasonable and absurd in that it allows an injured worker to refuse reasonable medical treatment without the loss of benefits and penalizes an employer by disallowing Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, thus leaving an employer no possibility of monetary recovery. Appellant contends forfeiture petitions under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) have been equated with suspension petitions under \u00a7 413, and that the result here conflicts with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s own precedent.\nThe Commonwealth Court has held where a claimant forfeits his right to compensation by refusing reasonable medical treatment, a petition for suspension of benefits is properly granted. See Litak v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Com-cast Cablevision), 155 Pa.Cmwlth. 147, 624 A.2d 773, 775 (1993); see also Davis v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Acme Markets, Inc.), 711 A.2d 1096 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998) (grant of suspension petition filed in accordance with \u00a7 413 proper where reasonable treatment refused by claimant); Stuart Painting Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Asvestas), 148 Pa.Cmwlth. 411, 611 A.2d 787 (1992) (suspension of benefits for claimant\u2019s refusal to submit to reasonable medical services); Donton v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Prestolite Battery), 125 Pa.Cmwlth. 324, 557 A.2d 450.(1989) (suspension of compensation proper for refusal of reasonable treatment).\nThese cases reflect a sometimes casual use of the term \u201csuspension.\u201d While each turns on the claimant\u2019s refusal of reasonable treatment as required by \u00a7 306, each specifically deals with a petition for suspension. None of these cases hold that a petition alleging the forfeiture of the right to compensation is the same as a petition seeking suspension of benefits. A claimant forfeits his right to benefits when he refuses reasonable medical services for his work-related injuries. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(8). An employer may seek a suspension of benefits for other reasons, however, such as an improvement in earning power altering a claimant\u2019s need for benefits. See Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Div., 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301, 304-05 (1990) (\u201cA \u2018suspension of benefits\u2019 is supported by a finding that the earning power of the claimant is no longer affected by his disability, whether it arises from his employer offering suitable replacement employment, or from the ability of the claimant to secure other suitable employment that provides equal or greater compensation.\u201d). Forfeiture is based on the claimant\u2019s own unwillingness to receive treatment rather than a change in status. With forfeiture, there is no requirement of a change which alters a claimant\u2019s right to benefits, as exists with a suspension of benefits. Because appellant\u2019s petition was under the forfeiture section, it was not a suspension petition, and cannot fall under \u00a7 413; thus, appellant is not entitled to reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund.\nFurther, contrary to the conclusion of the WCAB, a forfeiture petition does not fall under \u00a7 430. Section 430 prohibits an employer from terminating, decreasing, or refusing to make a payment after benefits have been awarded without first filing and being granted a supersedeas. An employer filing a forfeiture petition, however, is not contesting disability but rather is alleging a claimant has forfeited his right to benefits by refusing reasonable medical treatment.\nAppellant contends Commonwealth Court precedent has permitted Supersedeas Fund relief for petitions filed under \u00a7 306(f) of the Act for medical expenses ultimately determined to have been erroneously paid. Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Commercial Union Ins.

Once again, we are not persuaded by these decisions that a petition for forfeiture is the equivalent to a petition for suspension or termination under \u00a7 413 or \u00a7 430, and find the plain language of \u00a7 443 does not authorize reimbursement to employers seeking relief under \u00a7 306(f) of the Act.\nSection 443(b) of the Act speaks of the establishment of the Supersedeas Fund with the purpose of providing moneys for payments pursuant to \u00a7 443(a). See 77 P.S. \u00a7 999(b). Looking at the plain language of subsection (a), the supersedeas must have been requested under \u00a7 413 or \u00a7 430, to warrant reimbursement. See id., \u00a7 999(a). Simply put, \u00a7 443 does not authorize reimbursement for a \u00a7 306(f) claim, and the language of \u00a7 306(f) itself does not allow supersedeas reimbursement. Based on the plain language of the statute, Supersedeas Fund reimbursement is not available for petitions filed under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8).\nOrder affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justices NIGRO and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion in which Justices CASTILLE and BAER join.\n.

        "text": "DISSENTING OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nThe Majority concludes that Exel Logistics (Employer) is not entitled to Supersedeas Fund reimbursement in the instant matter because a petition seeking a forfeiture of benefits is not the functional equivalent of a suspension petition. I disagree with this characterization and conclude that this result is clearly erroneous. Therefore, I must dissent.\nOn June 7, 1993, Employer issued a Notice of Compensation Payable to Donald Buehler (Claimant) for a May 19, 1993 work-related injury to his right shoulder. On August 11, 1997, pursuant to Section 306(f.l)(8), 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(8), alleging that Claimant refused reasonable medical treatment, Employer filed a Petition entitled Petition for Forfeiture of Benefits, subsequently filing its request for supersedeas on September 8, 1997. According to the Majority, \u201cSection 306(f.l)(8) itself does not allow for reimbursement.\u201d (Majority Op. 586 Pa. at 88, 92, 890 A.2d at 1048, 1050.) However, I believe this misstates the effect of Section 306(f.l)(8), which does not preclude reimbursement; rather it is merely silent as to reimbursement.\nThe legal source of the right to reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund is Section 443(a) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). That Section, in pertinent part, provides as follows:\nIf, in any case in which a supersedeas has been requested and denied under the provisions of section 413 or section 430, payments of compensation are made as a result thereof and upon the final outcome of the proceedings, it is determined that such compensation was not, in fact, payable, the insurer who has made such payments shall be reimbursed therefor.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 999(a) (footnote omitted). Section 443(b) created the Supersedeas Fund from which reimbursement flows, delineates its statutory purpose, and provides in relevant part:\n(b) There is hereby established a special fund in the State Treasury, separate and apart from all other public moneys or funds of this Commonwealth, to be known as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Supersedeas Fund. The purpose of this fund shall be to provide moneys for payments pursuant to subsection (a), to include reimbursement to the Commonwealth for any such payments made from general revenues.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 999(b) (emphasis added). The General Assembly created the Supersedeas Fund to balance the rights of employers against the requirement that injured employees receive compensatory benefits immediately, even where an employer disputes his or her entitlement. Section 443 is explicit in stating that supersedeas reimbursement is limited to those instances where the request was made pursuant to Section 413 or Section 430 and was denied. The elements require that: (1) supersedeas be requested pursuant to Section 413; (2) the request for supersedeas be denied; (3) payments were continued because of the supersedeas denial (4) the proceedings became final; and (5) the compensation was not payable.\nSection 413 of the Act sets forth the authority of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) to \u201cat any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate ... an award of the department or its workers\u2019 compensation judge upon petition filed by either party ...\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 772. Section 413 is the only place in the Act where the broad grant of authority to change the compensation due to a claimant appears. Elsewhere, the Act contains only specific grants of authority for actions that may be taken by a WCJ.\nSection 413 is also important for establishing requirements for both an automatic supersedeas and one like that at issue, one that is discretionary. Section 413 also indicates that, when a petition is filed pursuant to Section 413, it will serve to \u201csuspend payment of compensation in whole or to such extent as the facts alleged in the petition would, if proved, require.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 774(2). Thus, Section 413 extends its reach to all those petitions that seek to alter the workers\u2019 compensation award. A forfeiture of benefits is such a petition and, thus, comes within the purview of Section 413.\nSection 413 further indicates that a WCJ may approve a request for supersedeas upon \u201cproof of any other fact which would serve to modify or terminate payment of compensation .... \u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 774(2). There is nothing in this language that limits approval of a supersedeas request to only certain types of petitions. The limiting language, where there is any, is contained in the detailed statutory sections relative to each specific action. That is why Section 314, 77 P.S. \u00a7 651, for example, specifies that any monies paid by an employer to a claimant while the claimant is refusing to undergo a physical examination are to be recouped from future compensation payments and Section 306(f.l)(8) is silent in terms of a remedy. Section 306(f.l)(8) is silent on the subject because, in my view, it comes within the ambit of Section 413.\nSection 413(b) also mandates that an employer not suspend payments to a claimant without requesting and being granted a supersedeas. 77 P.S. \u00a7 774.1. The unstated intent of this section is to penalize any action by an employer pursuing self help by withholding compensation rather than availing itself of its remedies and securing a supersedeas. This is also analogous to Section 430, upon which the Board grounded its decision. The Majority determines that the Board was mistaken and that a forfeiture petition cannot fall under Section 430. Yet, an employer, who is obligated to pay a claimant benefits, may cease paying benefits only if it satisfies one of the following conditions: (1) submits a supplemental agreement to a WCJ pursuant to Section 408 (77 P.S. \u00a7 732); (2) submits a final receipt to a WCJ signed by the claimant pursuant to Section 434 (77 P.S. \u00a7 1001); (3) secures an order from a WCJ granting a discretionary supersedeas initiated by petition (77 P.S. \u00a7 774); (4) files a Notice of Suspension upon the claimant\u2019s return to work pursuant to Section 413(c) (77 P.S. \u00a7 774.2); or (5) secures a final order from a WCJ terminating benefits. In the instant matter, Employer submitted a Petition pursuant to Section 413 specifically requesting a discretionary supersedeas and, upon its denial, continued compensation payments.\nTherefore, the General Assembly has carefully constructed a comprehensive scheme for suspending, modifying, reinstating, or terminating benefits, with accompanying provisions for a supersedeas. Included within this scheme is the forfeiture of benefits where a claimant has refused reasonable medical treatment. Contrary to the Majority\u2019s belief that there are no cases holding that a petition alleging a forfeiture is the same as a petition seeking suspension of benefits, the courts of this Commonwealth have treated a forfeiture of benefits as a suspension in part because, when a claimant recants and chooses to undergo the reasonable medical treatment, the forfeiture is lifted. Stuart Painting Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Asvestas), 148 Pa.Cmwlth. 411, 611 A.2d 787 (1992) (holding that forfeiture pursuant to statute providing that employee who refuses reasonable medical treatment shall forfeit all rights to compensation for any injury or any increase in his incapacity shown to have resulted from such refusal is to be treated as a suspension rather than a termination). We also previously addressed the filing of a Section 306(f.1) claim as a Section 413 Petition in Muse v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Western Electric), 514 Pa. 1, 522 A.2d 533 (1987). Accord Joyce Western Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (William P. Fichtorn), 518 Pa. 191, 542 A.2d 990 (1988).\nThe Majority grounds its decision on the premise that there is no requirement for a change in the claimant\u2019s condition when a petition requesting a forfeiture of benefits is presented. However, a review of the cases and the Section 413 \u201cPetition to:\u201d (Form LIBC-378) reveals that this petition is used when a claimant has refused employment, refused reasonable medical treatment, refused a physical examination, requests a change to the notice of compensation payable, or a correction in the average weekly wage, none of which require a change in physical condition and the first three of which can result in a suspension of benefits.\nWithin this legislatively created workers\u2019 compensation scheme, there are a limited number of petitions that can be filed to commence a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. There is a Claim Petition, a \u201cPetition to\u201d (review, modify, terminate, suspend, or reinstate) (Form LIBC-378), Petition for Physical Examination or Expert Interview, Utilization Review Request, Application for Supersedeas Fund Reimbursement, and Request for Designation of a Physician. There is no specific petition designated as a forfeiture petition. This is because, to obtain a forfeiture of benefits, the employer must file a \u201cPetition to:\u201d.\nThe Claim Petition commences proceedings seeking a determination as to whether the claimant has a compensable injury and entitlement to benefits. Form LIBC-378 is a Section 413 Petition and the document utilized when an action implicating the workers\u2019 compensation award is initiated, in check-the-box format. The form itself states that the employer/employee is asking the WCJ to take one or more specific actions to alter the award, which are listed at the top of the form \u2014 none of those listed actions is the forfeiture of benefits. To make use of the form, the employer selects the action it requires (such as \u201cSuspend Compensation Benefits\u201d) in the top portion of the form. In the lower third of the form are various boxes to check to indicate the basis on which the request is made. Box number six is entitled \u201cReasonable Treatment Refused,\u201d which is based on Section 306(f.l)(8). Thus, Form LIBC-378 is a Section 413 Petition. Clearly, then, the request is made pursuant to Section 413, which governs modification, suspension, termination, or reinstatement of benefits by a WCJ. Finally, the second page of Form LIBC-378 has a place to check whether a supersedeas is requested pursuant to Section 413, 77 P.S. \u00a7 772, when a supersedeas is not automatic pursuant to 77 P.S. \u00a7 771. Employer checked this box.\nI recognize that Employer filed a more formal document in this ease seeking the forfeiture of Claimant\u2019s benefits because he did not accept reasonable medical treatment. Employer followed this document with a Form LIBC-378 and checked the box on the reverse side requesting a Section 413 supersedeas. Also, Employer believed that it was filing a Section 413 Petition. (See Original Record, Appeal from Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law dated December 20, 2001, appealing from Finding of Fact 3(a) as \u201ca mischaracterization of the Suspension Petition filed by the Employer under Section 413 of the Act.\u201d) Further, we have indicated that the form of the petition is not controlling where there is entitlement to relief. See generally Westinghouse Elec. Corp./CBS v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Korach), 584 Pa. 411, 883 A.2d 579 (2005).\nSection 443 requires that the Petition be filed pursuant to Section 413 or 430. It demands that the request for supersedeas be denied and that payments made as a result of that denial be unwarranted. I believe that Employer has satisfied all of the required elements: (1) it sought a supersedeas pursuant to a Section 413 Petition to Suspend; (2) the supersedeas was denied by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) in January of 1998; (3) the proceedings became final upon the Order issued in January of 1999 when the WCJ granted Employer\u2019s Petition for the closed period between July 14, 1995 through September 30, 1998; and (4) compensation was not payable during that period. I can perceive no valid reason for holding that an insurer cannot recover benefits when it is ultimately determined that they should not have been paid. As noted in the Commonwealth Court dissent, the Supersedeas Fund consists solely of payments made by insurers and self-insurers within the Commonwealth for the purpose of reimbursing an insurer that has been forced to pay benefits to which a claimant is not entitled. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nJustices CASTILLE and BAER join this Dissenting Opinion.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 999(a).\n. See, e.g., Davis v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Acme Markets, Inc.), 711 A.2d 1096 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998) (holding that the WCJ properly granted a suspension petition under Section 413 where the claimant refused medical treatment); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Lear), 707 A.2d 618, 619 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1998) (employer filed a \"petition to terminate, modify or suspend Claimant's benefits [alleging] that Claimant has refused and/or is unwilling to undergo reasonable and necessary medical treatment\u201d); Litak v. Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd. (Comcast Cablevision), 155 Pa.Cmwlth. 147, 624 A.2d 773 (1993) (where employer filed a Petition to Review Benefits alleging that the claimant refused to undergo reasonable and necessary treatment); Stuart Painting.\n. Form LIBC-378 is entitled merely \u201cPETITION TO:\u201d because of the many different actions that a claimant or an employer may request pursuant to this petition. Either party may request review, termination, modification, reinstatement, or suspension of an award for any of the reasons listed in the bottom portion of the form. This form is also used to request that a final receipt be set aside or seek approval of a compromise and release agreement. All of the actions that may be taken by filing this form impact the workers' compensation award.\n. Section 306(f.l)(8) has been compared to a Section 314 request for physical examination. However, the General Assembly included a specific remedy in Section 314 for the instance in which a claimant refuses to undergo a physical examination or expert interview. The failure of the General Assembly to include such a remedy in Section 306(f.l)(8) must be considered intentional and the attempts to apply the Section 314 remedy to Section 306(f.l)(8) can have no validity.",
