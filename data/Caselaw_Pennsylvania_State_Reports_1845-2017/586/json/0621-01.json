On appeal, Appellant raises issues regarding the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments and the jury instructions during his criminal trial. Our Court now dismisses Appellant\u2019s appeal as having been improvidently granted.\nI write separately to note that although Appellant complains of the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments and the jury instructions, he has not provided this- Court with a transcript covering the complained-of closing remarks and jury charge, making substantive review impossible. I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition because it is incumbent on Appellant to ensure that this Court is provided with documents necessary to a complete assessment of his arguments for reversal, and Appellant has failed to do so. See Pa.R.A.P.1931, explanatory cmt. (2004). Whether such failure is the result of ineffective assistance of counsel must be left for another day. See Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002).\nJustice NEWMAN joins this concurring statement.",
