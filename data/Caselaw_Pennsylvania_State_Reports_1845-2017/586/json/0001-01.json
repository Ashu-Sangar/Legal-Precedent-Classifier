        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE EAKIN.\nThe sole issue before this Court is whether a bank must have actual knowledge that it is dealing with a fiduciary at the time of a transaction in order for the bank to be entitled to the protections of \u00a7 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act (UFA). We hold that a bank need not have actual knowledge it is dealing with a fiduciary in order to be protected under \u00a7 9 of the UFA, and therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nAppellee, Springfield Township, retained Robert J. Kuss through his firm, Robert J. Kuss & Associates, Inc., to manage and administer pension plans for the Township\u2019s employees. As a fiduciary of the Township, Kuss had the authority to open accounts for the Township, to sign and endorse checks payable to the Township\u2019s pension plans, and to transfer funds for the Township. Kuss misappropriated eight checks payable to the Township\u2019s Pension Plan by depositing the checks in an escrow account established under the name \u201cRobert J. Kuss & Associates, Inc.,\u201d which Kuss maintained through appellant, Mellon PSFS Bank. The checks were issued between June 7, 1989 and March 23, 1990, and were payable to \u201cThe Board of Commissioners TTEE Springfield Township PEN PLS.\u201d Kuss endorsed seven of the eight checks: \u201cFor Deposit Only 2-196-061.\u201d He endorsed the eighth check: \u201cFor Deposit Only 2-196-061 On Account Springfield Twp Pen Plan.\u201d\nIn April, 1993, after discovering Kuss\u2019s misappropriation, the Township commenced an action against Mellon by filing a writ of summons in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. In September, 1995, the Township filed a complaint, in which it sought to recover the amount of the eight checks Mellon credited to Kuss\u2019s account. In its complaint, the Township included claims for statutory conversion, negligence, and \u201cmoney had and received.\u201d The Township withdrew its negligence claim prior to trial.\nThroughout these proceedings, including a motion for summary judgment, Mellon asserted the affirmative defense that the UFA barred the Township\u2019s claims, regardless of whether Mellon had knowledge of Kuss\u2019s fiduciary status. Mellon specifically argued that Jones v. Van Norman, 513 Pa. 572, 522 A.2d 503 (1987), stands for the proposition that the UFA shields a bank from liability to a principal when an authorized fiduciary deposits and misappropriates the principal\u2019s funds, as long as the fiduciary was \u201cin fact\u201d empowered to endorse the checks at the time of the deposit. According to Mellon, the protections of the UFA were available regardless of whether bank personnel had actual knowledge they were dealing with a fiduciary at the time of the transactions.\nThe Township asserted Jones did not control. Instead, the Township averred the trial court was bound by the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Levy v. First Pennsylvania Bank, N.A., 338 Pa.Super. 73, 487 A.2d 857 (1985), which held that in order for a bank to benefit from the protections of the UFA, the bank was required to know at the time of the transaction that it was dealing with a fiduciary. The Township argued that if the jury determined Mellon did not know it was dealing with a fiduciary when Kuss deposited the eight checks into his Mellon account, then the UFA did not protect Mellon.\nThe trial court was persuaded by the Township\u2019s position and specifically instructed the jury that in order for the UFA to apply in this case, \u201c[first, Mellon Bank must prove [by a preponderance of the evidence] that it knew that it was dealing with a fiduciary for Springfield when it accepted the eight checks at issue in this case for deposit.\u201d N.T., 8/7/01, at 102 (R.R., at 2131). The jury found that, as to all eight checks, Mellon personnel did not have actual knowledge that Kuss was a fiduciary for the Township\u2019s pension plans when they accepted the checks for deposit. The jury also determined, with respect to the seven checks endorsed with \u201cFor Deposit Only 2-196-061,\u201d the Township established claims for conversion and for \u201cmoney had and received.\u201d Therefore, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Township in the amount of the seven checks.\nMellon filed a motion for post-trial relief, in which it argued the trial court erred in \u201cinstructing the jury that in order for the [UFA] to bar [the Township\u2019s] claims [], Mellon had to have actual knowledge that Robert J. Kuss was a fiduciary.\u201d Mellon\u2019s Motion for Post-Trial Relief, at 2. After argument, the trial court denied Mellon\u2019s motion and entered final judgment in favor of the Township in the amount of $504,944.43. Mellon filed timely notice of appeal.\nIn its appeal to the Superior Court, Mellon renewed its argument that \u00a7 9 of the UFA, 7 P.S. \u00a7 6393, shielded the bank from liability and this Court\u2019s decision in Jones overruled the Superior Court\u2019s holding in Levy. The Superior Court was unpersuaded and, relying on Levy, held that because the jury made a factual determination that Mellon\u2019s employees did not know they were dealing with a fiduciary when accepting Kuss\u2019s transactions, the trial court properly concluded the UFA did not apply. Accordingly, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment. Mellon petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal, which we granted, limited to the issue of whether a bank must have actual knowledge it is dealing with a fiduciary before it may invoke the protections of \u00a7 9 of the UFA.\nPennsylvania enacted the UFA in 1923. The Act \u201cwas designed to facilitate banking transactions by relieving the depositary of the responsibility of seeing that an authorized fiduciary uses entrusted funds for proper purposes.\u201d Lehigh Presbytery v. Merchants Bancorp, Inc., 410 Pa.Super. 557, 600 A.2d 593, 595 (1991) (citing Robinson Protective Alarm Co. v. Bolger & Picker, 512 Pa. 116, 516 A.2d 299, 304 (1986)). Various transactions are included in the UFA; this appeal deals only with \u00a7 9, which states, in pertinent part:\nIf a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank to his personal credit ... of checks payable to his principal and indorsed by him, if he is empowered to indorse such checks ... the bank receiving such deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, and the bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit, or any part thereof, upon the personal check of the fiduciary, without being liable to the principal, unless the bank receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making such deposit or in drawing such check or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.\n7 P.S. \u00a7 6393 (emphasis added).\nWhen interpreting a statute, we must abide by the rules of statutory construction. It is a basic tenet of statutory interpretation that, \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). The plain language of \u00a7 9 clearly states that if a fiduciary is empowered to endorse checks and deposit them into his personal bank account, a bank is not required to investigate the purpose of the deposit any further. Over time, however, certain ambiguities have been read into this statute, which we now dispel.\nIn Jones, Mr. Jones had authorized Mrs. Van Norman to endorse checks payable to him, which she ultimately deposited into her personal checking account without Mr. Jones\u2019s permission. We held that, pursuant to \u00a7 3-419 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3419, the bank where Mrs. Van Norman deposited the checks could be held responsible for conversion only if the signatures on those checks were unauthorized or forged endorsements. Jones, at 509. In a footnote, we noted the bank\u2019s counsel had failed to argue that \u00a7 9 of the UFA barred liability on the part of the bank. Id., at 508 n. 6. In that footnote, this Court explained the protections afforded a bank pursuant to the UFA and summarized the application of \u00a7 9 in two prior cases, Bacher v. City National Bank of Philadelphia, 347 Pa. 80, 31 A.2d 725 (1943), and Strong v. City National Bank of Philadelphia, 355 Pa. 390, 50 A.2d 323 (1947):\nIn Bacher, an administratrix of a decedent\u2019s estate gave her attorney the authorization \u201cto collect any and all monies due the said estate and to endorse any and all checks payable to ... administratrix of the said estate, and to deposit the funds so collected on his attorney\u2019s account.\u201d The attorney received the cash and deposited them in his personal account. He used the funds by writing personal checks on his account. We said there that: \u201c[Ujnder Section 9 of the [UFA], it is provided that, unless the bank has actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, it is justified, if the fiduciary is empowered to endorse checks payable to his principal, in accepting them as a deposit to his personal credit.\u201d The summary judgment entered by the trial court in favor of administratrix Bacher was reversed. The case went back to the lower court for trial.\nJones, at 508 n. 6 (citations omitted in original). On remand in Bacher, the trial court held the UFA did not protect the bank because it had no knowledge of the attorney\u2019s authority to endorse the checks. Id. The case was re-captioned as Strong, and appealed to this Court once again. We reversed, holding:\nThe bank, as provided in section 9 of the [UFA], was authorized to pay the amount of the deposits on [the attorney\u2019s] personal checks unless it had actual knowledge of the limitations of his authority in that regard, but its knowledge or lack of knowledge as to his right to [e]ndorse the checks was wholly immaterial. The condition prescribed by the [UFA] as necessary to relieve the bank from liability is that the fiduciary must in fact have been empowered to [endorse the checks, not that the bank must have known that he had such authority.\nStrong, at 324-25 (emphasis in original).\nThe divergence in interpreting \u00a7 9 arose when the Superior Court published its opinion in Levy, supra, decided after Bacher and Strong but before Jones. In Levy, a law firm was hired to handle the sale of the Levys\u2019 business, Novelty Printing. The Levys instructed a partner at the firm to open an account at a local brokerage firm on their behalf. When the treasury bills purchased by the broker matured, the partner was to deposit the checks into the Levys\u2019 accounts at two banks. The partner impermissibly deposited three checks from the broker into his personal account instead of into the Levys\u2019 accounts; he later misappropriated the funds. The Levys sued the partner\u2019s bank for conversion. A jury found in favor of the Levys, awarding them the amount of the checks plus interest.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court held that the UFA did not shield the bank from liability in Levy because the partner did not have the power to endorse the checks as he did. Levy, at 861. The court stated that \u201c[\u00a7 9 of the UFA] relieves banks of liability only when the fiduciary has the power to endorse.\u201d Id. In a footnote, the Levy court distinguished that case from Bacher and Strong, stating the endorsements in those cases indicated the depositor was a fiduciary, whereas in Levy, the checks were endorsed with the names of the payees and the partner\u2019s bank account number. Id., at 861 n. 13. Thus, the court determined Bacher and Strong did not apply to Levy, especially in light of the UFA\u2019s Prefatory Note, which states, \u201cThe Act covers situations which arise where one person deals with another person whom he knows to be a fiduciary.\u201d Levy, at 862 n. 13 (quoting 7A Uniform Laws Annotated 127 (West 1978)).\nIn the instant case, the Superior Court relied on Levy when it determined \u00a7 9 did not protect Mellon because its personnel did not know Kuss was the Township\u2019s fiduciary; thus, it held the UFA is not applicable. The court rejected Mellon\u2019s argument that Jones overruled Levy because Jones did not involve the UFA, and the discussion of \u00a7 9 in the footnote of that case was obiter dictum.\nMellon argues that our decision in Jones explains the object of \u00a7 9 of the UFA and controls the outcome of this case. Specifically, Mellon contends that in Jones, this Court affirmatively cited to our decisions in Bacher and Strong for the proposition that where a fiduciary was empowered to endorse checks for the principal when the fiduciary deposited the principal\u2019s funds into a bank, the UFA shields the bank from liability to the principal if the authorized fiduciary subsequently misappropriates the principal\u2019s funds. Furthermore, Mellon contends that Jones does not require a bank to have actual knowledge at the time of a transaction that it is dealing with a fiduciary for the UFA\u2019s protections to apply. Based on this reading of Jones, Mellon asserts its knowledge of Kuss\u2019s status as a fiduciary of the Township is wholly immaterial and, because the Township had authorized Kuss to endorse all checks payable to the Township\u2019s pension plan, including the eight in question, the UFA shields Mellon from liability in this case. Mellon asserts this Court has already properly decided this issue in Jones, Backer, and Strong. Accordingly, Mellon advocates overruling Levy and reversing the Superior Court\u2019s decision below.\nThe Township asserts Mellon\u2019s reliance on Jones is erroneous. The Township argues the Superior Court correctly determined the discussion of the UFA in footnote 6 of Jones is dicta because Jones did not involve a claim under the UFA, and therefore, it cannot stand as this Court\u2019s authoritative interpretation of \u00a7 9. The Township also contends that in any event, footnote 6 of Jones merely discussed this Court\u2019s previous decisions in Backer and Strong. According to the Township, in Backer and Strong, we found the UFA did not require a bank to inquire into the extent of a fiduciary\u2019s authority as fiduciary at the time of a transaction. The Township avers that in those cases, we did not determine that a bank may invoke the protections of the UFA without knowing the status of a fiduciary as fiduciary. According to the Township, Mellon has created a false conflict between our holdings in Jones/Backer/Strong, which the Township argues dealt with whether a bank needs to inquire into the extent of a fiduciary\u2019s authority, and the Superior Court\u2019s holding in Levy, which concluded a bank must know of a fiduciary\u2019s status as a fiduciary in order to benefit from the protections of the UFA.\nThe Township further argues that the protections provided in \u00a7 9 can only arise when a bank knows that it is dealing with a fiduciary. According to the Township, \u00a7 9 of the UFA was designed solely to relieve banks of the duty to inquire into whether fiduciaries are committing breaches of their obligations as fiduciaries. The Township states that \u201c[i]f [a] bank had no idea that it was dealing with a fiduciary, [then] it would have no duty to inquire because it would not know that there was anything about which to inquire.\u201d Township\u2019s Brief, at 9. The Township asserts that unless a bank knows it is' dealing with a fiduciary, \u00a7 9 is meaningless.\nWe cannot endorse this proposition. The plain language of the statute states that if a fiduciary has the power to do that which the bank allows him to do, ie., endorse and deposit checks \u201cin a bank to his personal credit\u201d \u2014 or in this case to his business account \u2014 the bank is not liable regardless of whether it knew of his fiduciary status. The statute does not list knowledge of a fiduciary\u2019s status as a requisite to the bank\u2019s insulation from liability; that element, that prerequisite to protection, simply does not exist in the statute. \u201cOnly if a statute is unclear may a court embark on the task of ascertaining the intent of the legislature by reviewing the necessity of the act, the object to be attained, circumstances under which it was enacted and the mischief to be remedied.\u201d Coretsky v. Board of Commissioners of Butler Township, 520 Pa. 513, 555 A.2d 72, 74 (1989) (citation omitted). This is not a case of ambiguity, where we must search for the legislative intent behind the words of the statute. This is a case where the Court is asked to add an element to the statute; this we cannot do.\nKuss was a fiduciary of the Township, and had the authority to open accounts for the Township, to sign and endorse checks payable to the Township\u2019s pension plans, and to transfer funds for the Township. In general, when Kuss deposited the Township\u2019s checks, endorsed by him, he did nothing improper. The Township trusted Kuss and granted him power to administer its pension funds. It was not until he used the already-deposited funds inappropriately that the Township cried foul and sought to blame the bank for not inquiring into his authority before deposit. Certainly, when the bank did not inquire into his authority to deposit pension fund checks into his business account, it was taking the risk he did not have the authority to do so. However, the bank cannot be held liable simply because it did not ask if Kuss had the power to deposit those checks; had the bank inquired, it would have found he did have the power.\nThe Township argues the history behind the enactment of the UFA supports its contention that the UFA presumes a bank must know it is dealing with a fiduciary to be entitled to the protections of the UFA. Most significantly, the Township cites Levy\u2019s reliance on the UFA\u2019s Prefatory Note, in which, as noted above, the drafters of the UFA stated that \u201c[t]he Act covers situations which arise where one person deals with another person whom he knows to be a fiduciary.\u201d Township\u2019s Brief, at 11 (citing Levy, at 861 n. 13) (emphasis supplied).\nAlthough the language of the Prefatory Note evinces intent that the UFA applies when a person is known to be a fiduciary, that note was not adopted in Pennsylvania. The failure to adopt that preface may or may not signal a repudiation of its terms by our legislature, but it certainly cannot be taken as an endorsement of the notion. This unpublished language clearly does not add an element to the plain language of \u00a7 9, and while it may signify the intent of the drafters of the UFA, those drafters are not the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, whose intent controls. See 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921. And even if the UFA was designed to allow a bank to dispense with formalities when it knows it is dealing with a fiduciary, this does not equate to the opposite: where a bank does not know it is dealing with a fiduciary, it has no defense under the UFA. Section 9 requires only that the fiduciary actually was \u201cempowered to indorse such checks.\u201d See 7 P.S. \u00a7 6393; see also Strong, at 324-25 (under UFA \u00a7 9, \u201c[t]he condition prescribed by the Act as necessary to relieve the bank from liability is that the fiduciary must in fact have been empowered to indorse the checks, not that the bank must have known he had such authority.\u201d) (emphasis in original); Backer (holding when fiduciary had power to endorse checks, bank is relieved of liability for fiduciary\u2019s misappropriation of funds).\nThe UFA is a uniform act and, as such, we endeavor to interpret it consistently with those other states that have enacted it. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1927 (\u201cStatutes uniform with those of other states shall be interpreted and construed to effect their general purpose to make uniform laws of those states which enact them.\u201d); 7 P.S. \u00a7 6403 (\u201cTh[e UFA] shall be interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law of those States which enact it.\u201d). Our interpretation of \u00a7 9 of the UFA is consistent with the interpretation given by those jurisdictions that have applied the provision. Many of the cases from other jurisdictions cite the Prefatory Note\u2019s language; however, none of those cases deal with the issue of whether a bank must know it is dealing with a fiduciary in order to be protected by \u00a7 9-nor do they rely on that language to form the basis for interpretation of \u00a7 9. See Heffner v. Cahaba Bank and Trust Co., 523 So.2d 113 (Ala. 1988) (grant of summary judgment affirmed where no evidence of bad faith under UFA \u00a7 9, Ala.Code \u00a7 19-1-9 was shown on part of bank); Arvada Hardwood Floor Co. v.

As such, the decision of the Superior Court is reversed, and we overrule that portion of the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Levy dealing with the UFA.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice CASTILLE, Justice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR join the opinion.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a dissenting opinion in which Justices N1GRO and BAER join.\n. 7 P.S. \u00a7 6351 et seq.\n. A claim for \u201cmoney had and received\u201d is a common law action \u201cby which the plaintiff could recover money paid to the defendant, the money usually being recoverable because (1) the money had been paid by mistake or under compulsion, or (2) the consideration was insufficient.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, at 29 (7th edition).\n. The issue we address in this appeal raises a question of law. Therefore, our standard of review is de novo, and to the extent necessary, the scope of review is plenary. See Buffalo Township v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 813 A.2d 659, 663 n. 4 (2002).\n. The UFA was approved in 1922 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Bar Association. It has been adopted into law in 24 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. For list, see Uniform Fiduciaries Act, Table of Jurisdictions, printed immediately preceding 7 P.S. \u00a7 6351.\n. Mellon also argues that under its reading of Jones, the UFA and the UCC are consistent. According to Mellon, the UCC merely requires a fiduciary to have authority to endorse checks in order for the principal to be responsible for the acts of the fiduciary. Mellon contends that the UCC does not require banks to know of this authority in order for principals to assume this responsibility.\n. The business account into which Kuss deposited the checks was an escrow account; thus, on some level the bank had to know he was a fiduciary, the verdict notwithstanding.\n. The dissent would adopt the Wisconsin Court of Appeals interpretation of \u00a7 9 in Larson v. Kleist Builders, Ltd., 203 Wis.2d 341, 553 N.W.2d 281 (Ct.App.1996). That case is factually distinguishable; although the court did intex pret \u00a7 9 of the UFA, it ultimately held that the person who misappropriated the funds in question was not a fiduciary. Thus, the statute was found to be inapplicable, and the court\u2019s statement that a bank is protected when it knows the presenter of a check is a fiduciary appears to be dicta.\n. The jury was not asked by specific interrogatory whether Kuss actually had the authority to deposit the checks into his business account; the statute does not require proof the fiduciary was empowered to do so.\n. The Dissent adopts the Township's position that the purpose and intent of \u00a7 9 and the UFA was not \u201cto reward serendipity.\" Dissent Op., 586 Pa. at 19, 889 A.2d at 1196 (quoting Township\u2019s Brief, at 8). Serendipity or not, Kuss was, in fact, the Township\u2019s fiduciary; the bank has been in no way \"rewarded.\u201d The bank did not take the money here, Kuss did. The bank allowed Kuss to do exactly what Kuss was authorized to do, yet when Kuss later stole the money, the dissent would have the bank repay his debt to the Township; not having to repay money the bank did not help him take is not a \"reward.\u201d\n. In the 21st century, one may have an entirely electronic relationship with his bank. Banking procedures have changed since the UFA was drafted in 1922; today, it is no longer necessary to go to the bank to deposit checks face-to-face with a teller who knows you by name. Through Automatic Teller Machines and the internet, withdrawals and deposits can be made and bank accounts can be managed without ever setting foot inside a brick-and-mortar establishment. See http: //www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/elbank.htm (\"Electronic banking ... uses computer and electronic technology as a substitute for checks and other paper transactions.\u201d).\nIn this regard, the General Assembly has adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, 73 P.S. \u00a7 2260.101 et seq., in order to \"enhance and promote the reliability of electronic commerce,\" because \"electronic commerce is expanding rapidly and is an engine for economic growth....\u201d Id.., \u00a7 2260.102. There are also provisions of the Banking Code which govern electronic funds transfer systems. See 7 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6121, 6122. The General Assembly has also adopted that portion of the UCC dealing with electronic funds transfers. See 13 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4A101 et seq. Congress has enacted the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693 et seq., finding that \"the use of electronic systems to transfer funds provides the potential for substantial benefits to consumers.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1693(a). This is but a sampling of federal and state statutes dealing with the utilization of computer and other technology to facilitate banking and commercial transactions. Personal inquiry by a teller before accepting a deposit is less significant than a generation ago, reinforcing our conclusion that actual authority is more important than perceived authority. In an age where predeposit perceptions of authority do not exist, this appears the better rule.\n. This Court has cited to the Prefatory Notes to Uniform Acts for persuasive authority, but we have never used one to form the primary basis for the interpretation of an unambiguous statutory provision. In addition, the General Assembly has published the prefatory language of certain uniform laws (e.g., in Title 68 of Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, immediately preceding the Uniform Planned Community Act, 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5101 et seq., the Uniform Law Comment has been published); it chose not to do so here. If the prefatory language speaks to the element of knowledge, the only place actual knowledge appears in the Uniform Act, rejection of that language must include rejection of that element.\n. One federal district court case, factually similar to the instant case, is in conflict with our decision. In Terre Haute Industries, Inc. v. Pawlik, 765 F.Supp. 925 (N.D.Ill.1991), the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois refused to grant summary judgment in favor of First National Bank of Dolton based on the bank's claim that the UFA insulated it from liability. The bank allowed the principal\u2019s employee to deposit into his personal account checks written from the principal to the bank. The court based its denial on the fact that the bank, assuming the employee was the principal\u2019s fiduciary, did not know the employee was a fiduciary. The district court came to this interpretation of the UFA on its own, relying on cases which are distinguishable because knowledge of the agent\u2019s fiduciary status was not at issue there. See id., at 929-30 (distinguishing St. Stephen's Church v. Seaway Nat\u2019l Bank, 38 Ill.App.3d 1021, 350 N.E.2d 128 (1976) and Johnson v.

        "text": "DISSENTING OPINION\nCHIEF JUSTICE CAPPY.\nI respectfully dissent. In my view, the Legislature intended that a bank have actual knowledge that it is dealing with a fiduciary in order for the bank to be entitled to the protections of Section 9 of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act (\u201cUFA\u201d), 7 P.S. \u00a7 6393. Thus, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nAccording to the Majority, \u201c[t]he plain language of [Section 9 of the UFA] states that if a fiduciary has the power to do that which the bank allows him to do, i.e., endorse and deposit checks \u2018in a bank to his personal credit\u2019 ... the bank is not liable regardless of whether it knew of his fiduciary status.\u201d Majority Opinion 586 Pa. at 11, 889 A.2d at 1190 (emphasis added). If, indeed, the plain language of Section 9 of the UFA stated as such, the Majority obviously would be correct in concluding that a bank need not have actual knowledge that it is dealing with a fiduciary in order to enjoy the protections of Section 9 of the UFA. Section 9 of the UFA, however, is not nearly so lucid. Section 9 states as follows:\nDeposit in fiduciary\u2019s personal account. If a fiduciary makes a deposit in a bank to his personal credit of checks drawn by him upon an account in his own name as fiduciary; or of cheeks payable to him as fiduciary; or of checks drawn by him upon an account in the name of his principal, if he is empowered to draw checks thereon; or of checks payable to his principal and indorsed by him, if he is empowered to indorse such checks; or if he otherwise makes a deposit of funds held by him as fiduciary, \u2014 the bank receiving such deposit is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing thereby a breach of his obligation as fiduciary, and the bank is authorized to pay the amount of the deposit, or any part thereof, upon the personal check of the fiduciary, without being liable to the principal, unless the bank receives the deposit or pays the check with actual knowledge that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in making such deposit or in drawing such check or with knowledge of such facts that its action in receiving the deposit or paying the check amounts to bad faith.\n7 P.S. \u00a7 6393. Based on the above, it is clear that Section 9 of the UFA does not contain \u201cplain language\u201d stating that a bank is protected from liability when dealing with a fiduciary \u201cregardless of whether it knew of [the] fidwiiavyCs] status\u201d\nSection 9 of the UFA is not explicit regarding the issue at hand, and therefore, the Court is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature by considering, among other matters, the factors delineated in Section 1921(c) of the Statutory Construction Act. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c) (\u201cWhen the words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters:\u201d the factors enumerated (l)-(8).).\nWhile Section 9 of the UFA relieves a bank, acting honestly and in good faith, of much of its common law duty to inquire into whether a fiduciary will use entrusted funds for proper purposes, the statute\u2019s protections are not without limitation. The drafters of the UFA did not craft the Act in a manner which anticipates that a bank should benefit from the protections of the UFA when the bank is completely unaware of a person\u2019s status as fiduciary. As the Township aptly points out, \u201c[t]he objective of Section 9 of the UFA, in particular, and the purpose and intent of the UFA, in general, establish that it was not enacted to reward serendipity.\u201d Township\u2019s Brief at 8.\nIn addition, Section 9 of the UFA provides two explicit ways a bank can forfeit the protections of the UFA: if the bank had actual knowledge that the fiduciary was breaching his or her obligations as fiduciary or if the bank\u2019s actions in dealing with the fiduciary amount to bad faith. 7 P.S. \u00a7 6393. Simply stated, a bank could not act in bad faith or have actual knowledge that the fiduciary was breaching his or her obligations to a principal if the bank never knew the fiduciary was, in fact, a fiduciary. Thus, a bank\u2019s knowledge that it is dealing with a fiduciary is necessary in order for the statute to have meaning. Under the Majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 9, however, a bank has more incentive to remain ignorant of any relationship between a principal and a fiduciary than it does to learn of such a relationship.\nMoreover, the drafters of the UFA specifically stated in the first line of the Act\u2019s Prefatory Note that\u201c[t]he Act covers situations which arise where one person deals with another person whom he knows to be a fiduciary.\u201d Uniform Laws Annotated, Volume 7A, Pt. 1 (West 2002) (emphasis added). While a Prefatory Note does not control the disposition of the issue before the Court, it certainly demonstrates the drafter\u2019s intent, which is particularly relevant here since our Legislature adopted Section 9 of the UFA in the exact same substantive form as the uniform law drafted by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and the emphasized language above clearly indicates that the drafters of the UFA intended for the Act to protect banks in situations where banks know that they are dealing with fiduciaries.\nI also disagree with the Majority\u2019s uniformity analysis. See Majority Opinion at 12-14. According to the Majority, its interpretation of Section 9 of the UFA is consistent with the interpretation given by those jurisdictions that have applied the statute, save a federal court\u2019s decision in Terre Haute Industries, Inc. v. Pawlik, 765 F.Supp. 925 (N.D.Ill.1991). I, however, respectfully submit that the cases cited by the Majority do not find that a bank is entitled to the protections of the UFA when it is unaware of a person\u2019s status as fiduciary. Rather, these cases merely hold that a bank forfeits the protections of the UFA if the purported fiduciary was not, in fact, a fiduciary of the principal and if, in dealing with a fiduciary, the defendant-bank acted in bad faith or with actual knowledge that the fiduciary was misappropriating the principal\u2019s funds. These cases are aligned with our caselaw in this area, see, e.g., Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, 337 Pa. 456, 12 A.2d 66 (1940), and are entirely consistent with my position.\nMoreover, the cases from our sister states, which the Majority summarily dismisses, squarely demonstrate that all of these jurisdictions recognize the legal principal that the protections of the UFA are not triggered unless a bank knows that it is dealing with a fiduciary. E.g., Master Chemical Corporation v. Inkrott, 55 Ohio St.3d 23, 563 N.E.2d 26, 30 (1990) (\u201cThe Uniform Fiduciaries Act shields a bank from liability when the bank knoivs that the individual is acting for the benefit of another. The inquiry to be made is not only ivhether the bank had knowledge of the existence of the fiduciary relationship but also whether the fiduciary in fact possessed the authority to conduct the transaction in question. This test is consistent with the purposes of the Act to protect those who honestly deal with another knowing him to be a fiduciary and to place the responsibility of employing honest fiduciaries on the principal.\u201d) (citations omitted and emphasis added); Zions First National Bank v. Clark Clinic Corporation, 762 P.2d 1090, 1101 (Utah 1988) {\u201c[T]he Act may shield a bank from negligence only when the bank knows that the party before it is acting for another. Assuming then that the trial court correctly determined that [the fiduciary] was a fiduciary under the meaning of the Act and that the bank knew he was acting as such, the most significant determination for purposes of our review and for deciding whether [the defendant-bank] may be shielded from liability under the Act is whether [the fiduciary] was an authorized fiduciary empowered to conduct and consummate the transactions at issue.\u201d) (citation omitted and emphasis added); see Boutros v. Riggs National Bank, D.C., 655 F.2d 1257, 1259 (D.C.Cir.1981) (stating that \u201c[t]he [UFA] applies only \u2018when one person honestly deals with another knowing him to be a fiduciary \u2019 \u201d and finding that the trial court\u2019s grant of a judgment n.o.v. to the defendant-bank was improper because \u201ca reasonable jury could have found that [the fiduciary] had not been authorized to make withdrawals from the account and that [the defendant-bank] did not \u2018know\u2019 that it was dealing with a fiduciary \u201d) (citation omitted).\nFor these reasons, as I would affirm the order of the Superior Court, I respectfully dissent.\nJustices NIGRO and BAER join this dissenting opinion.\n. If a plain language approach were to apply, then I would be inclined to follow the rationale employed in Larson v. Kleist Builders, Ltd., 203 Wis.2d 341, 553 N.W.2d 281 (Ct.App.1996). In Larson, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals was called upon to determine whether a bank is protected from liability under its version of Section 9 of the UFA, Wis. Stat. 112.01(10). In doing so, the court found that Section 9 of the UFA clearly and unambiguously requires that in order for the statute to apply and protect a bank, the person that misappropriated the funds must have been, in fact, a fiduciary of the company. The court specifically stated the following, with which I concur:\n[Section 9 of UFA] applies when a bank is aware that it is dealing with a fiduciary. Indeed, the statute presumes a bank's knowledge of the presenter as a fiduciary and, contrary to [the defendant-bank's] argument, the \"actual knowledge\u201d and \"bad faith\u201d components of the statute relate to the known fiduciary\u2019s conduct with regard to the check presented.\n. I also respectfully disagree with the Majority\u2019s reliance on \"21st century\u201d banking practices and modem banking legislation as support for its \u201cplain language\u201d resolution of the issue in this case. See Majority Opinion 586 Pa. at 11-12 n. 8, 889 A.2d at 1191 n. 8. First, the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws drafted the UFA in 1922, and this Commonwealth adopted the UFA in 1923; therefore, \"21st century\u201d banking practices and legislative schemes have no bearing on the intent of the Legislature in adopting the UFA. Additionally, as to the issue raised in this case, the impact of the method by which a fiduciary deposits or withdraws money into and from a bank is irrelevant. Regardless of whether a fiduciary deposits or withdraws funds in person or via the internet or automatic teller, the question underlying this matter remains: if the fiduciary misappropriates the funds, does Section 9 of the UFA protect the bank from liability if the bank was unaware of the fiduciary\u2019s status as fiduciary?\n.
