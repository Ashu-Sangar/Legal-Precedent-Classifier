Hartnett Construction Company, Inc. (Hartnett), Appellee, to construct The Engineering and Business Technologies Center (the EBTC). Hartnett subcontracted with Appellee, Clarence B. Haney Mason Contractor, Inc. (Haney), who hired Masonry Systems of Pennsylvania, Inc. (MSI), Appellee, to construct the building’s exterior — prefabricated, split-stone, masonry panels (panels). These panels were assembled with mortar and a bonding agent called “Sarabond” and fastened to the exterior of the building. Sarabond, a saran latex mortar additive, designed to create a superior bond when used in mortar, was sold by Appellee, Dow Chemical U.S.A. (Dow).</p>

Approximately six years later, on January 12, 1979, Dow informed the Northampton County Area Community College Vice President for Administrative Services, Leon Reichwein, that the panels on the EBTC which were bonded with Sarabond, may cause corrosion to the panels if they were unprotected. Dow encouraged the Appellants to have the panels inspected by a qualified person and requested, if such an inspection took place, that it be present.</p>
    <p id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.4",638,[229,870,1160,471]]]'>The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds personally inspected the panels and discovered cracks in the mortar and rust stains on the panels. He reported his findings to the architect and the College’s legal counsel who recommended that the Appellants immediately retain an independent party to inspect the panels. The Appellants contacted an architect to conduct an inspection, but the inspection never occurred. Finally, in May of 1980, the College contacted Dow and asked it to inspect the panels.</p>
    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[226,1360,1161,731]]]'>Dow agreed to inspect the panels and instructed the college to cut and to remove panel sections for testing. Fourteen months later, Dow issued its report and concluded that the cracks were not the result of Sarabond’s adverse effect on unprotected steel. Instead, it concluded that the cracks were caused by freeze-thaw conditions. Nevertheless, the Appellants continued to detect new evidence of exterior cracking, as well as corrosion of the steel rods embedded within the panels. Consequently, the Appellants approached a Sarabond expert and requested him to review Dow’s report. The expert reviewed the report and, contrary to Dow’s opinion, concluded that the cracks in the panels and the corrosion of the steel rods were a direct result of the adverse effects of Sarabond.</p>

Dow moved for summary judgment and argued that the applicable statute of limitations barred the Appellants’ tort claims. The trial court granted the Appellants’ motion for additional discovery, and the Appellants claimed that they were Commonwealth agencies and, as such, any statute of limitations defense raised must fail under the doctrine of <em>nullum tempus occurrit regí (nullum tempus).</em>

      <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>The true nature of a Municipal Authority is that which is set forth in the earliest case of this court involving this type of public corporation. Section 2 of the Municipality Authority Act of 1945, 53 P.S. § 302(a)), defines the term “Authority” as meaning “A body politic and corporate, created pursuant to this act or pursuant to the ‘Municipality Authorities Act of 1935’ repealed hereby.” It has been consistently held in cases in point, both under the Municipality Authorities Act of 1935 and 1945 and under other legislation involving authorities that an authority is not the creature, agent or representative of the municipality organizing it. In <em>Tranter v. Allegheny County Authority, </em><a href="/pa/316/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="316 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1158989" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0065-01">316 Pa. 65</a>, 79, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20289" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="173 A. 289">173 A. 289</a>, 295 (1934), this court refers to the Authority “as the agent created for the purpose by the state” (emphasis supplied), notwithstanding the fact that under the Second Class County Authority Act the Authority therein provided for would not come into being until the county commissioners so declared. Much unnecessary confusion has been injected into this field in the past years, apparently on the erroneous impression that an Authority is merely the child or instrumentality of the municipality incorporating it, under the authority of such isolated and unfortunate expressions as set forth in <em>State College Borough Authority v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, </em><a href="/citations/?q=152%20Pa.%20Super.%20588" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="152 Pa.

R. 12, 16 (1941). Moreover, constitutionally, such authorities must be state created, and they must be separate and distinct entities from the municipalities which compose them. This is to avoid violating Article 3, Section 31 of our Pennsylvania Constitution prohibiting the direct delegation of certain powers (such as the power to make and supervise municipal improvements, to levy taxes, or to perform municipal functions) to any special commission, private corporation or association. <em>Lighton v.
