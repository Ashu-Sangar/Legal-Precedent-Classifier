Although discovery was completed prior to that date, the Commonwealth requested a continuance because a subpoenaed police officer was unable to testify. The case was continued to March 12, 1987. On that date, Appellant requested a continuance for further preparation. The case was continued to June 17, 1987. A Commonwealth witness, Captain Schneiders of the Fire Marshall’s Office, was unable to testify at trial on June 17th because he was on vacation. The case then was listed for trial on July 6, 1987.</p>
    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.6",241,[259,1021,1151,1003]]]'>The Commonwealth and Appellant were ready to proceed to trial on the latest scheduled trial date. Prior to trial, a Rule 1100 evidentiary hearing was held as to the Commonwealth’s petition to extend and Appellant’s motion to dismiss. It was established at this hearing that the Commonwealth failed to provide the requested discovery prior to the August 6, 1986 trial date. The trial court found, through the testimony of Detective Everett, that both Appellant’s statement and the police incident report were sent to the District Attorney’s Office on April 5, 1986 contemporaneously with his detective investigation report which was the only discovery document initially given Appellant. Detective Everett also testified that two weeks before the August listing the Commonwealth asked him to send the discovery documents a second time which he immediately did. The inevitable conclusion reached by the trial court was that the Commonwealth either intentionally or negligently failed to provide Appellant with the required discovery in its possession before the first trial listing.</p>
    <p id="b241-7" data-blocks='[["BL_241.7",241,[259,2043,1153,310]],["BL_242.1",242,[252,314,1162,626]]]'>As to the Fire Marshall’s report, the trial court determined, through the testimony of Captain Schneiders, that this requested discovery document was not provided to Appellant before the August 6th trial date. It was found that the Fire Marshall’s report was an essential document in Appellant’s preparation for trial. Nevertheless, the trial <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>court ascertained from Captain Schneiders’ testimony that no request for this report was ever made by the Commonwealth until November 28, 1986, over three months after the August 6th trial listing. Captain Schneiders testified that two days after he was advised of the need for his report it was mailed to the Commonwealth. The trial court concluded that the Commonwealth took no reasonable steps whatsoever to obtain the mandatory discovery material and transmit it to Appellant in sufficient time for the case to be tried on August 6, 1986. This continuance, according to the trial court, was the result of the Commonwealth’s failure to bring the case to trial.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[250,959,1159,256]]]'>The case was continued to the earliest possible date, December 3, 1986.

Captain Schneiders testified at the evidentiary hearing that he was two hours away from the courthouse in Ocean City. The trial court found that he had been in court on March 12, 1987 when the June 17th date was given. Captain Schneiders’ testimony also revealed that he was made aware of the new trial date when he was subpoenaed first by mail on March 16th and later by personal service. Finally, the trial court determined that although Captain Schneiders knew of his vacation well in advance of the June 17th trial date, the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence that it advised him of the necessity of his appearance or attempted to have the trial date administratively changed. The trial court concluded that the Commonwealth offered no explanation for this continuance.</p>

Captain Schneiders was also made aware of the June 17th trial date when he was subpoenaed first by mail on March 16th and later by personal service. Furthermore, Captain Schneiders knew of his vacation well in advance of the June 17th listing date. The trial court concluded that the Commonwealth offered no explanation of this continuance.</p>
    <p id="b245-7" data-blocks='[["BL_245.6",245,[199,1312,1153,680]]]'>As occurred with the discovery request issue, the Superi- or Court arrived at a contrary conclusion on the basis of its own assumptions. Specifically, the Superior Court refers to the testimony of Captain Schneiders who claims not to recall receiving the March 16, 1987 subpoena. He also testified that the first time he became aware of the June 17th trial date was a week or two before that date. The trial court discounted this portion of Captain Schneiders’ testimony. Furthermore, Captain Schneiders’ testimony only serves to underscore the trial court’s finding that the Commonwealth failed to present any evidence that it advised him of the necessity of his appearance or attempted to have the trial date administratively changed.</p>

I sincerely hope that the person or persons in the District Attorney’s Office responsible for this result do not go unpunished.</p>
