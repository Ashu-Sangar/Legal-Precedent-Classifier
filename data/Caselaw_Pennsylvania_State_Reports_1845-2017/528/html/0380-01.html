These convictions stem from appellant’s participation in the armed robbery of Frank’s Jewelry Store on July 20, 1985. On that date, appellant waited in the car while his two accomplices, posing as a young couple interested in purchasing an engagement ring, entered the jewelry store and asked to see some rings. One of the accomplices held the owner at gunpoint while the other took two trays of rings.

The Superior Court remanded the matter for resentencing, finding merit in the claim of appellant that his counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to reconsider sentence based upon the failure of the trial court to indicate sentencing factors. On remand, the trial court imposed a sentence of two concurrent eleven and one-half to twenty-three month sentences. The Commonwealth filed a petition for reconsideration/modification of sentence which petition the trial court denied. The Commonwealth then appealed arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred in failing to impose the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714 based upon appellant’s prior court martial convictions for robbery. The Superior Court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing finding that appellant’s court-martial convictions constituted prior convictions within the meaning of § 9714.

As such, the primary goal of section 9714 is to proyide an enhanced punishment for those individuals who by their repeated acts, demonstrate that they are a greater danger to society and are in need of additional punishment. The clear intent of the legislature in enacting § 9714 was to assure that repeat offenders of crimes of violence be imprisoned for a minimum of five years. Appellant would have us apply a technical approach to the statute and find that since the legislature did not specifically mention court-martial convictions, application of section 9714 to the facts of the instant case is improper. However, we believe that to apply such an overly technical approach here would yield an absurd result and one that was clearly not intended by the General Assembly.</p>

    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[228,645,1154,1016]]]'>Appellant also argues that the Commonwealth failed to sufficiently prove the existence of a prior record at the sentencing hearing. He contends that the Commonwealth failed to introduce any evidence of the prior convictions during the sentencing hearing. The record, however, belies appellant’s contention. At the original sentencing hearing held on October 29, 1986, the Commonwealth presented to the court a certified copy of the court-martial convictions. Upon remand for the purpose of resentencing appellant, the court again noted that the Commonwealth had presented the court with a certified copy of the court-martial proceedings. The certified copy was, however, inadvertently omitted from the record certified to the Superior Court on appeal. This omission was subsequently corrected by order of court granting the petition to certify supplement to the original record filed by the Commonwealth which order was in accordance with Pa.R.A.P 1926. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth properly introduced evidence of appellant’s prior court-martial convictions.</p>

Section 9714(b)(2) provides that the previous convictions must have occurred within seven years of the date of the instant offense. <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>However, that section goes on to state that any time during which the offender was incarcerated in any penitentiary, prison or other place of detention shall not be considered in computing the relevant seven-year period. The robberies giving rise to appellant’s court-martial convictions occurred on February 16, 1978; February 27, 1978; and March 2, 1978. The instant conviction arose from a robbery occurring on July 20, 1985. The total time which elapsed between the crimes therefore, was in excess of seven years. The court-martial records indicate that appellant received a sentence of seven years. While the court-martial records fail to indicate whether appellant served his entire sentence, the notarized bond information form, which contains information personally provided by appellant, indicates that he was released from incarceration for these charges in October, 1982. Thus, in excluding from our computation the four years appellant was incarcerated at Fort Leavenworth, the prior convictions fall within the relevant seven year limitation. Accordingly, appellant’s prior court-martial convictions were not too remote in time to be considered for sentencing purposes pursuant to section 9714.</p>

Appellant’s contention is wholly without merit. In <em>Commonwealth v. Sojourner, </em><a href="/pa/513/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="513 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="1802589" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0036-01">513 Pa. 36</a>, <a href="/pa/513/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="518 A.2d 1145" data-case-ids="1802553,1802589" data-case-paths="/pa/513/0035-01,/pa/513/0036-01">518 A.2d 1145</a> (1986), we specifically held that the imposition of an increased sentence on the appeal of the Commonwealth does not violate a defendant’s double jeopardy rights under the United States or Pennsylvania Constitution where the statute at issue permits authorities to obtain an increased sentence on appeal. In so holding, we relied upon <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">449 U.S. 117</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">101 S.Ct. 426</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">66 L.Ed.2d 328</a> (1980) wherein the United States Supreme Court held that where punishment pursuant to a particular statute is clear and explicit, there is no violation of double jeopardy principles where that statute permits authorities to obtain an increased sentence on appeal. A defendant is charged with <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>knowledge of the appeal provisions of such a statute and thus, has no expectation of finality in his sentence until the appeal is concluded or the time period for appeal is expired. The connotation of finality necessary for a violation of double jeopardy rights is not, therefore, present where a defendant is being resentenced pursuant to a sentence enhancement statute. <em>See, United States v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">Id.,</a> <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">449 U.S. at 136</a>, <a href="/us/449/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="449 U.S. 117" data-case-ids="11715584" data-case-paths="/us/449/0117-01">101 S.Ct. at 437</a>.
