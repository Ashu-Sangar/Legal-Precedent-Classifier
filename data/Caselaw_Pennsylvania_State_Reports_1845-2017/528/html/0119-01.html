On December 14, 1987, the first day of doe hunting season, Kathy and Bruce Davis observed appellee Harvey L. Burkholder get out of his pickup truck with a shotgun and shoot three times across a public roadway at three deer running in a field on the other side of the road.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
      <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>The third shot hit one of the deer in the shoulder, causing it to fall. The deer, however, regained its footing and attempted to run away. Harvey L. Burkholder then fired two more shots at the deer, connecting with the second shot. Burkholder and Kathy Davis then proceeded, separately, to the site where the deer had fallen the second time. At the site, she engaged in a conversation with Burkholder. Burk-holder told Ms. Davis that he had already killed a deer earlier in the day.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He then proceeded to slit the deer’s throat. After the deer’s throat was slit, Burkholder’s son, appellee Ricky Lee Burkholder, arrived on the scene. With the father’s consent, the son then gutted the deer. The deer, without being tagged as statutorily required,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> was then dragged to and loaded on the father’s pickup truck.</p>
    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.6",255,[194,1049,1153,310]],["BL_256.1",256,[222,301,1158,672]]]'>Later in the day, the Davises, who were familiar with hunting regulations, reported their observations to James Binder, a Pennsylvania Game Commission Wildlife Conservation Officer. The next day the officer, during the course of his duties, happened upon Harvey Burkholder and questioned him about the allegations made by the Davises. <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>Burkholder advised the officer that his son Ricky had shot the deer in question and properly tagged it at the scene. Burkholder completely denied the version of the facts relayed by the Davises.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Later in the day, Officer Binder interviewed Ricky Burkholder, whose account of the facts “more or less matched that of his father’s.” <em>See </em>N.T. at 55. The following day, December 16, 1987, Officer Binder inspected the roadway area where the Davises reported the shooting had taken place. At the scene, he recovered one empty 30-06 Remington-Peters cartridge case. Earlier in the day, another gaming officer, Gerald C. Magee, investigating the incident, had found a matching 30-06 empty cartridge case.</p>

On that date, the gaming officers sought and obtained a search warrant for Harvey Burkholder’s residence; the described objects of the search were any 30-06 weapons or cartridges. The warrant was executed the next morning at 8:35 A.M. A number of weapons and cartridges were seized, all of which were returned to Burk-holder except one 30-06 rifle which was later tested and determined to be the rifle from which the two spent cartridges found in the roadway area had been fired. Both appellees were subsequently arrested and charged with various violations of the Game and Wildlife Code.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Appel<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>lees filed a pre-trial suppression motion contesting the scope of the execution of the search warrant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It should be noted that the only evidence obtained during the search which was in any way referred to during the trial was the 30-06 rifle seized at Harvey Burkholder’s house. The Commonwealth had this rifle analyzed, and introduced a lab report demonstrating that the cartridges found by the gaming officer two days after the incident were fired from this gun. The trial court, after hearing all the testimony in the case, denied the suppression motion and both appellees were found guilty of all charges. A month later, the court sentenced appellees to pay the costs of prosecution and imposed fines totalling $1,100.00 against Harvey Burkholder and $600.00 against Ricky Burkholder.</p>
    <p id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.4",257,[192,1056,1155,693]]]'>On appeal, a panel of Superior Court Judges (Brosky, Beck and Hoffman, JJ., Beck, J. dissenting) reversed the trial court’s suppression ruling, vacated the judgments of sentence, and remanded for a new trial. In ruling as it did, the court held: “We find that because of the length of time that elapsed between the shooting of the deer and the date of the warrant and the lack of proof of criminal activity, the evidence seized at the home of appellant Harvey Burkholder was the fruit of a search without a valid warrant. This evidence, therefore, should have been suppressed.” <em>Commonwealth v. Burkholder, </em><a href="/pa-super/388/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 Pa.

    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.4",258,[220,458,1163,1472]]]'>With respect to the waiver issue, it is clear from the record that at no time prior to trial, during trial, or in post-trial motions, did appellees contest the validity of the search warrant because of staleness, lack of probable cause or otherwise. Rather, appellees merely contested the execution of the warrant, arguing that “the seizure of ammunition was beyond the scope of the warrant and therefore should be suppressed.” <em>See </em>N.T. at 5. The Commonwealth contends therefore that the issue has been waived. Appellees respond that “[I]t is true that in the instant case, the staleness claim, as an <em>independent </em>claim, was raised for the first time on appeal. But the issue of staleness, due to unexcused delay, was indeed an issue the thread of which was woven throughout the fabric of the testimony regarding the search warrant given at trial.” <em>See </em>Appellees’ Brief p. 8. However, appellees’ references to the trial transcript give no indication whatsoever that appellees contested the time lapse between the initial investigation and the securement of the search warrant; nor is such a contention found elsewhere in the record, including pre-trial, trial and post-trial motions. Since the issue was not raised at the trial level, it was waived and should not have been addressed by the Superior Court. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal”); <em>Commonwealth v.
