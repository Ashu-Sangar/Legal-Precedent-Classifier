By Edgerton’s account, on the evening of Sunday, October 24, 1982, he was stopped by Officer Quigley for running a stop sign, and was unable to produce a driver’s license. He further testified that Quigley directed him to empty his pockets, which he did, removing a bag of marijuana and his wallet, which contained a piece of paper with two three-digit numbers on it. According to Edgerton, after Quigley asked which offense he wanted to be arrested on (to which he replied neither), Quigley returned the marijuana and instructed Edgerton to meet him the next day at 35th and Fairmount and to have between thirty-five and forty numbers on him.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[209,1404,1161,905]]]'>Edgerton testified that he did not meet Quigley the next day because he was sleeping, but on Tuesday he called the Internal Affairs division of the Police Department and related the above story. He then met with Lieutenant Losco, who asked him to write down some numbers and return to 35th and Fairmount. After waiting there in his car for several hours, Edgerton testified, he saw a police car go to the housing project at 35th and Fairmount and later leave with a woman and her children. As they left, he said, the car stopped beside his car and Quigley got out and asked Edgerton if he had the numbers. Edgerton testified that he gave Quigley the paper and Quigley returned it, telling Edgerton to wait until he had taken the woman and her children to the hospital. According to Edgerton, upon Quigley’s return he moved his car to the other side of the street, gave Quigley the paper with the numbers, and got into the police car.</p>

It was this, he told Losco, that prompted him to take the events of the previous night more seriously and caused him to call Internal Affairs. After further discussion, Losco testified, he told Edgerton to create a paper with numbers, gave him some money, and told him to go to 35th and Fairmount, where Losco set up surveillance. There, Losco observed patrol car 1616 pull alongside Edgerton’s car and a white object, which Losco assumed was the piece of paper with numbers, being held up. When the police car returned, Losco observed Edgerton move his car to the other side of the street and walk back to the police car. After a few minutes, he saw Edgerton remove his cap and scratch his head, the signal he had been instructed to give when the officers had either the numbers or the money in their possession. Edgerton was then placed in the car and the surveillance was terminated.</p>

Quigley also testified that Edgerton continually tried to persuade him to not write the ticket by offering to supply him with information about drug sales and numbers operations in the area. He denied finding any marijuana or other contraband and denied making arrangements to meet Edgerton at a future time. According to Quigley, he next saw Edgerton two days later when Edger-ton flagged his patrol car down while it was en route to the hospital from the housing project. At that time, Edgerton again offered to supply information about illegal activities in the area, and Quigley told him to wait until he returned. When he did return, Quigley testified, Edgerton asked that they talk somewhere else, since he lived in the neighborhood and didn’t want to be seen giving the police informa<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>tion. After they had gone a short distance, however, Quigley realized that Edgerton wanted to make a deal so that the police would not give him any more trouble about driving, and he was only offering information that was common knowledge. Therefore, Quigley was put out of the car on 36th Street between Haverford and Spring Garden, about two and a half blocks from where he had gotten in. According to Quigley, the officers continued on routine patrol of the neighborhood, and encountered Edgerton again just a few minutes later, leaving a known numbers house on the corner of 35th Street and Haverford. It was then that he discovered the sheet with numbers on it protruding from Edgerton’s pocket, and Edgerton was arrested.</p>

On each occasion, objections to the testimony were overruled. On cross-examination, Losco acknowledged that Edgerton admitted to having lied in his initial interview. Contrary to the first explanation he gave Losco as to what prompted him to approach Internal Affairs, Edgerton later told him that on Sunday October 24, he did not know the number of the patrol car or the name or badge number of the officer, and that he did not see police car 1616 pull up behind his car on Monday afternoon (and thus he could not have recognized either the car or the officer from the night before.) On redirect examination, counsel for the City sought an explanation from Losco as to the reason Edgerton had given for initially telling the lie, that being that Edgerton’s friends supposedly had seen officers observing his car and he did not want to get them involved. In the course of trying to. elicit this response, counsel sought to make use of the report of the polygraph examination to refresh Losco’s recollection. Objection to use of the document was sustained, but when Losco ultimately was able to refresh his <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>recollection from his notes, counsel for the City pursued the matter by inquiring</p>

In our judgment, the statement referred to, though indeed not supported by the record, establishes that the numerous references to the polygraph examination and the context in which they were made caused the Commission to infer that Edgerton had passed the test.

In its conclusions, the Commission began by stating its finding that “Edger-ton’s testimony is credible”.

The conclusion is inescapable that the Commission’s tainted finding as to credibility affected its view of the entire record. For example, although the Commission determined that “it was more than coincidental that the Quigley-Edgerton rendezvous occurred at the time and place which Edgerton advised it would happen,” the record plainly shows that Edgerton mentioned a Monday afternoon meeting, and Quigley’s encounter occurred on Tuesday afternoon in the course of a routine response to a radio call. By way of further example, the Commission stated “[b]oth Captain Losco and Edgerton testified that the meeting occurred at 35th and Fairmount but appellant Quigley testified that it happened at 35th and Haverford.” In fact, Quigley acknowledged that he encountered Edgerton at 35th and Fairmount; he claimed that the arrest was made at 35th and Haverford, after Edgerton had been driven a few blocks from 35th and Fairmount, put out of the car, and encountered again several minutes later at 35th and Haverford, all after Losco’s surveillance had been terminated. And finally, although the Commission by rhetorical question indicated <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>that Losco would have no apparent motive for falsifying a location or framing colleagues, it gave no thought to the question why Quigley would forgo a certain vice arrest upon finding numbers and marijuana in Edgerton’s possession in order to fabricate a numbers arrest the next day.</p>

I, however, disagree that we should simply, generally and without qualification remand this case to the Commission for a new hearing sans reference to the polygraph examination. If any of members of the present Philadelphia Civil Service Commission was a member of the Commission in 1986 which heard and denied Appellant Quigley’s appeal of his dismissal from the Philadelphia Police Department, such member must be disqualified from participating in a new hearing. The taint to the Commission which resulted from the many references to the lie detector test made by the prosecution in the original hearing lingers with those Commission members and will prejudice the appellant in any new hearing before a Commission which includes any of the same members. Those original members heard repeated references to the polygraph examination and the implication that the results were positive. The impact of the references to the polygraph test upon the Commission members is obvious.

That pollution cannot be obliterated by merely filtering out the contaminant before plunging anew into the same waters. All that is accomplished by such action is the prevention of further and additional contamination from the same source. The original pollution remains unabated.</p>

The fact that the prosecution is precluded from any mention of the polygraph test in the new hearing does not erase the original taint caused by the repeated references to the test at the original hearing. The individual Commission members who listened to those numerous references to the polygraph test and who drew the inference that the witness Edgerton had “passed” the test, cannot forget those references and that inference. The entire proceeding must be cleansed of the pollution and that means that the appellant is entitled to a new hearing before an entirely new tribunal. We must be scrupulous in insuring that every person who is accused of wrongdoing and whose liberty and/or substantial property interests are at risk is afforded a fair trial before a fair and impartial tribunal.
