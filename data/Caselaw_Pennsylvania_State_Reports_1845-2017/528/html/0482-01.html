There the subject beneficiary was a resident of a hospital for the “insane". By the terms of his mother’s will “there was bequeathed to a brother ... certain sum in trust for the purpose of investment, the income to be used, at his discretion, for the ‘comfortable support and maintenance’ of the [subject beneficiary], with the right to use part or all of the corpus of the estate for this purpose, if necessary. It was directed that this property and the income arising therefrom should not be subjected to or be in any manner liable for the debts, engagements or liabilities of the cestui que trust. The balance remaining, if any, after his death, was given to their named residuary legatees.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20408" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="123 A. 408">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/278/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="278 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1080494" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0421-01">278 Pa. at 423</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20408" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="123 A. 408">123 A. at 408</a>.</p>

The Court then considered the trust language and concluded that ‘‘[t]he trust ... was intended to secure the comfort of the insane person: and the devotion of the income, or a part of the principal, to the satisfaction of obligations, incurred on his behalf, is the mere carrying out of the testatrix’s directions”. <em><a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20408" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="123 A. 408">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/278/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="278 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1080494" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0421-01">278 Pa. at 424-425</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20408" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="123 A. 408">123 A. at 409</a> [citation omitted].</p>

Additionally, the majority now improperly relies upon the testator’s “duty” to support his mother during his lifetime in order to ascertain his intent when creating the trust at issue. The testator’s intent that the trustee provide for his mother’s care to the exclusion of the remaindermen can be clearly ascertained from the “four corners” of the document which created the trust. Where there is no ambiguity in the trust instrument, we must look no further in determining whether public welfare benefits are precluded due to the existence of another “available resource.”</p>
