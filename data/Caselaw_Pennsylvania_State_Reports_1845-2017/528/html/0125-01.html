At approximately 11:00 p.m. Officer Daiss returned to his home on Roosevelt Boulevard in the City of Philadelphia. Soon thereafter, Officer Daiss was shot to death in his basement. The Philadelphia Police discovered his body on July 30, 1985. A video cassette recorder, briefcase and service revolver were missing from Officer Daiss’ residence.</p>

Tilley waived his Miranda rights and indicated that he would talk to the Philadelphia Police. Thereafter, he was interrogated by two Philadelphia Police Officers for approximately three and one-half hours during which time he also spoke with three witnesses to whom he had allegedly admitted responsibility for the murder of Officer Daiss. During this initial interrogation, he answered general questions but did not admit his involvement in the murder of Officer Daiss. Immediately thereafter, two other Philadelphia Police Officers commenced interrogation of Tilley. They adyised him of his Miranda rights again, and after approximately ten <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>minutes, Tilley gave a statement admitting that he had killed Officer Daiss. A motion to suppress this statement was subsequently denied by the trial court and is not a subject of this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b268-5" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[215,491,1159,671]]]'>At trial, Tilley testified that he had forcibly entered the home of Philadelphia police officer Robert Daiss with the intention of committing a burglary. Tilley stated that during the burglary Officer Daiss returned home and he fled to the basement with a .38 caliber service revolver that he had removed from Officer Daiss’ bedroom. He was unable to exit the home through the basement so he hid behind a refrigerator. Officer Daiss then proceeded into the basement with his handgun drawn whereupon Tilley sprang from behind the refrigerator and shot Officer Daiss in the chest and in the jaw/neck. Thereafter, as Officer Daiss lay paralyzed and unable to speak, Tilley shot Officer Daiss in his left nostril to assure that he was dead.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

These items were obtained from people who stated that Tilley had given the items to them. Other witnesses testified that the remaining contents of Officer Daiss’ briefcase were divided among several individuals in order to secure their silence concerning Tilley’s commission of the murder of Officer <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>Daiss. In addition, no less than six witnesses testified at trial that Tilley had confessed to them that he had killed Officer Daiss during the commission of the robbery/burglary.

Wingo, </em><a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">407 U.S. 514</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">92 S.Ct. 2182</a>, <a href="/us/407/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="407 U.S. 514" data-case-ids="9139028" data-case-paths="/us/407/0514-01">33 L.Ed.2d 101</a> (1972); <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Smith, <a href="/pa/524/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="524 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1822846" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0072-01">524 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="524 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1822846" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0072-01">569 A.2d 337</a> (1990). The evidence presented at Tilley’s Rule 1100 hearings clearly shows that the Commonwealth was prepared to proceed to trial at all times, and that Tilley caused virtually all of the trial delay through numerous continuances, unavailability of counsel, and changes in counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The trial delay actually caused by the court was minimal, and the Commonwealth was clearly diligent in its efforts to bring Tilley to trial. Furthermore, Tilley did not request dismissal based upon this alleged speedy trial violation until nearly a year after the original run date.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.3",270,[248,288,1162,854]]]'>
      <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>Finally, Tilley’s assertion that he was prejudiced by the delay in that Officer Daiss’ shirt was not available for purposes of refuting the Medical Examiner’s opinion that Officer Daiss suffered a hard contact wound is without merit. Tilley never requested the production of this shirt before or during trial, and his mere speculation that this shirt may now be unavailable cannot be used to bolster a speedy trial claim. Accordingly, the balancing plainly weighs with determinative heaviness against his claim. Thus, we reject Tilley’s claimed violation of his right to a speedy trial under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Similarly, for the foregoing reasons and because Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c)(3) specifically provides that such delay caused by Tilley must be excluded from the computation of the period for commencément of trial, Tilley’s rights under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100 were not violated.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[240,1208,1163,1111]]]'>Second, Tilley argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for jury instructions on voluntary intoxication because there was sufficient evidence of record to support the defense of intoxication. This contention is meritless. In order for Tilley to have been entitled to a charge on voluntary intoxication there must have been evidence that he was “overwhelmed or overpowered by alcoholic liquor to the point of losing his ... faculties or sensibilities....” <em>Commonwealth v. Reiff, </em><a href="/pa/489/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="489 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1762384" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0012-01">489 Pa. 12</a>, 15, <a href="/pa/489/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="489 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="1762384" data-case-paths="/pa/489/0012-01">413 A.2d 672</a>, 674 (1980). While there was evidence that Tilley consumed some alcohol during the afternoon of July 27, 1985, and at some point appeared drunk to one of his friends, this is certainly not sufficient to support the conclusion that he was “overwhelmed or overpowered” to such an extent as to be incapable of forming the requisite specific intent to kill Officer Daiss. In fact, Tilley’s testimony showed that he was thinking and acting coherently and methodically during the entire ordeal. Accordingly, as there was no basis for such an intoxication defense the trial court correctly chose not to provide the requested voluntary intoxication instructions.</p>
    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.3",271,[248,314,1152,734]]]'>
      <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>Third, Tilley argues that the trial court erred in refusing to declare a mistrial after the prosecutor had raised the existence of prior criminal acts of Tilley. This contention is also meritless. Specifically, on re-direct examination of one of Tilley’s friends, the prosecutor asked if she knew Tilley to burglarize houses. After a timely objection to this question by defense counsel the trial court initiated a sidebar discussion where the prosecutor argued that defense counsel had opened the door for such testimony by asking the witness on cross-examination if she knew whether Tilley usually carried a gun. The trial court sustained the objection, denied Tilley’s request for a mistrial because the witness did not answer the question, and gave the following curative instruction:</p>
    <blockquote id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[290,1062,1111,366]]]'>You will disregard the last question by the District Attorney. Remember as I told you before at the very commencement of this trial, I told you that you should not assume that a fact may be true merely because the lawyer asks questions which assumes or suggests that a fact is true. So I am striking from the record that last question. (R. 131-132).</blockquote>
    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[247,1446,1154,468]]]'>This instruction was clearly adequate to cure the possible inference of prior criminal acts which could have prejudiced Tilley, and he did not object to the adequacy of the curative instruction at trial. Simply, there was no evidence of Tilley’s prior criminal record elicited since the trial court sustained Tilley’s objection and the witness did not answer the question. <em>Commonwealth v.

The jury returned with a question that read “we have no information of any prior arrests or criminal convictions in order to consider mitigating circum<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>stance number one.” (R. 46).

He forcibly entered the home of Officer Daiss with the intention of committing a burglary, and then, when he believed that he was about to be discovered by Officer Daiss, Tilley sprang from his hiding place and shot Officer Daiss three times.

Furthermore, Tilley could not reasonably have believed that Officer Daiss intended to kill him or cause great bodily harm. While it is true that Officer Daiss did not request police “back-up” from the nearby station or request Tilley to come out or give himself up; and that Officer Daiss owned many firearms, and that he had turned and begun to raise his gun when he approached Tilley’s hiding place, these facts do not reasonably support the conclusion that <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>Officer Daiss intended anything beyond the arrest of an intruder.</p>

Finally, Tilley clearly violated his duty to retreat or avoid the danger. While it is true that Tilley did attempt to exit the premises through the basement when Officer Daiss came home, his conduct thereafter was violative of his duty to retreat or avoid the danger.

    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[252,957,1160,959]]]'>Tilley’s fifth claim of ineffectiveness is that trial counsel failed to engage in proper pre-trial investigation on matters critical to his credibility as a witness. Specifically, Tilley argues that counsel’s failure to obtain and secure expert examination of the shirt that Officer Daiss was wearing when he was murdered or photographs of Officer Daiss’s corpse precluded Tilley from refuting the medical examiner’s testimony as to the distance from which one of the three close range shots was fired. While this claim is meritless for a variety of reasons, the clearest is the complete lack of prejudice arising from the absence of the shirt and photographs. Clearly, the best that Tilley could hope for would be that the jury would find that one of the shots was fired further from Officer Daiss’ body. Such a finding could not alter the first degree murder conviction. Accordingly, as there was no prejudice, counsel cannot be deemed to have been ineffective pursuant to this claim. <em>Commonwealth v.
