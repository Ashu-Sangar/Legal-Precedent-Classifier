In further support of its position Jones has contended that because Donegal collected a premium from one of the involved parties that they should be required to pay benefits before anyone else. This argument is specious. The premium received by Donegal was clearly collected on the basis that its liability would be limited. To now impose greater liability on Donegal than it agreed to cover would be violative of public policy in that it would be in contravention of a valid contract. Moreover, Jones is being disingenuous when it suggests that Donegal was the only party who collected a premium. Jones itself collected a <em>de facto </em>premium in the form of lease payments for which it contractually agreed to provide liability coverage of one million dollars.</p>
