The Fifth Amendment right is intended to protect the suspect’s desire to deal with the police only through counsel in order to counteract the inherent pressures of custodial interrogation.

However, this decision preceded the decision of the Court in <em>Minnick. </em>Accordingly, in <em>McNeil, </em>when the Court was presented with the question of custodial interrogation on separate offenses that occurred after its decision in <em>Minnick, </em>it was necessary for the Court to interpret its decision in <em>Roberson </em>as mandating application of the protections of <em>Edwards, </em>as clarified by its decision in <em>Minnick, </em>to unrelated offenses. Again, we note that the trial court had only the guidance provided by <em>Edwards. </em>Accordingly, since counsel was made available to Santiago prior to the interrogation, which seemingly satisfied <em>Edwards, </em>we would not have expected the trial court to further anticipate the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Roberson </em>or <em>McNeil.</em>

We attach no significance to the artificial distinction between "reinterrogation” and "initial interrogation.” For practical purposes, there is simply no difference from the suspect's point of view concerning this distinction. All that the suspect knows is that he has been in continuous custody and that he is being interrogated again. Whether it happens to be an "initial” interrogation by certain officials is irrelevant. The suspect has already been interrogated at least once while he has been in custody, and thus, even this "initial” interrogation by the Pittsburgh police detectives is more properly classified as “reinterrogation.”</p>
