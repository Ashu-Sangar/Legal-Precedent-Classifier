In 1984, Porreca became aware that police were investigating his involvement in this activity and he approached authorities and voluntarily implicated himself in 112 crimes concerning the stolen car ring.

        <em>. </em>Insofar as Porreca’s assertion is that the court erred in not abiding by the 1985 agreement, the claim is also without merit. Under Rule 319, there is no plea agreement unless it is presented to the court. The 1985 agreement was never presented to the court. Moreover, even if the 1985 agreement had been presented to a court, paragraph 17 of the 1986 agreement, <em>supra, </em>clearly states that the 1986 agreement superseded all other agreements, that it is the only plea agreement then extant, and that it states the complete agreement between the parties.</p>
