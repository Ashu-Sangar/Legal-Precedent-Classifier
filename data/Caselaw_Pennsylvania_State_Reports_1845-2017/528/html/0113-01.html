Having pur<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>chased the beer Kenny Watson then transported the teenagers to a location where they met one Norman Cousins. Mr. Cousins then transported Mr. Thomas and friends to what ultimately became the site of the accident. This site was property owned by the Pittsburgh Chartiers &amp; Youghiogheny Railway Company (Pittsburgh C &amp; Y), upon which was located an electrical tower owned by the Duquesne Light Company (Duquesne Light). During the course of the day’s activities Mr. Thomas decided to climb the tower. While engaged in this climb Mr. Thomas came into contact with the aforementioned wire, the result of which was that Mr. Thomas fell and sustained the injuries which are the underlying basis of this suit.</p>

Kenny Watson, despite being properly served, never responded to the complaint, and a default judgment was entered against him. The case proceeded to trial against all other defendants. At the close of plaintiffs’ trial presentation the trial court granted the motion of defendant Dario’s Distributors for a nonsuit and dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against it. The claims against the remaining defendants were permitted to go to the jury.</p>

Although the default judgment entered against him has rendered him liable to the plaintiffs to the full extent of their actual damages, the extent to which his negligence in fact contributed to the minor plaintiff's injuries must be determined in order to apportion fault among the remaining parties to this litigation. Recovery by the plaintiffs against all defendants other than Watson will be precluded only if the minor plaintiff’s negligence exceeds the combined negligence of all defendants.

There was considerable confusion surrounding this verdict, caused in large part by the isolation by the jury of Kenny Watson’s participation in this incident. Unfortunately, the responses by the trial judge to the jurors’ questions fostered this confusion. For instance, at one point during the deliberations the jury sent the following question to the trial judge: "If the jury should find in favor of the defendants, is Kenny Watson automatically responsible for over 50 percent?” (Trial transcript p. 269) To this question the judge responded: "In the event you find a verdict for the defendants other than Kenny Watson, you should make a determination of the total damages suffered by the plaintiffs. If you find that Charles Scott Thomas was negligent, then <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>you should determine the percentage of his negligence in relation to the total causal negligence of the plaintiff and Kenny Watson.” (Trial transcript pp. 269-270) This exchange was followed by more jury questions regarding the effect of Mr. Watson’s negligence on the ultimate recovery by the Thomases, to each of which the trial judge responded with instructions which served to isolate Mr. Watson’s negligence from that of the other defendants.</p>
