Having drawn his weapon before the door was opened, the police officer pointed the weapon at Mr. Chambers.

The Superior Court affirmed, concluding that the evidence supported the court’s finding that the police violated the knock and announce rule by failing to wait a reasonable period of time after announcing their identity before forcibly entering the premises. <a href="/pa-super/385/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="385 Pa.

They then went into the apartment without being invited, announcing as they went the purpose of their obvious unwelcomed visit. If I understand the majority opinion, the fruits of this search would be admissible if the police had announced their purpose and then walked in, as opposed to the other way around. Granted the former would have been better practice, but the issue is whether suppression is the right remedy for the relatively minor error of taking certain steps out of sequence.</p>
