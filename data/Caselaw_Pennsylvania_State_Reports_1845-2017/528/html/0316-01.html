Heath, Jr. from an order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County. <a href="/citations/?q=400%20Pa.%20Super.%20618" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="400 Pa.

The question presented is whether the court, which resentenced appellant after his original sentence was vacated, erred by imposing the mandatory minimum sentence for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9718, when the original sentence was vacated by Superior Court for the Commonwealth’s failure to give notice of its intent to seek the mandatory minimum prior to the sentencing hearing. We find that the Commonwealth’s failure to give notice prior to the original sentence is not relevant to the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence and thus affirm.</p>

All of the offenses charged involved the same five-year-old child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In the first sentencing proceeding, the trial court sentenced appellant to a total of seven to nineteen years imprisonment and seven years probation.

    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.4",452,[257,446,1159,474]]]'>In appellant’s first appeal to Superior Court, he argued, inter alia, that the trial judge erred when he imposed the mandatory minimum sentence under § 9718 since the Commonwealth had not first provided notice of its intention to seek the sentence. As stated above, a panel of the Superior Court agreed that notice was required, vacated the judgment of sentence, and remanded the matter for resentencing. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[253,942,1160,636]]]'>On remand, the Commonwealth gave notice of its intention to seek the mandatory minimum sentence. The trial court then imposed the identical sentence that it had imposed at the first sentencing. Heath appealed that judgment of sentence to Superior Court, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the same sentence because the Commonwealth had not given notice of its intention to seek the mandatory minimum sentence under § 9718 until after remand. As stated, the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence, finding that the sentence imposed was correct and that the procedure followed by the trial court was consistent with the Sentencing Code.</p>

In this, he received more than the statute required. His argument is simply that the Commonwealth waived any right it may have had to seek the mandatory minimum sentence since it did not provide such notice before the original sentencing and it did not appeal from the Superior Court order of remand.</p>
