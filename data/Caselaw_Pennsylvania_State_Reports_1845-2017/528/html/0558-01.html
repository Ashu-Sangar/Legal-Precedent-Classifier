Immediately following the jury’s return of its guilty verdicts, the Honorable Joseph E. Erb; of the Court of Common Pleas of York County, commenced a sentencing hearing in which the same jury found one aggravating circumstance to be present, i.e., that the killing occurred during the commission of a robbery (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)). The jury also determined that one mitigating circumstance was present, i.e., that the Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal offenses. (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1)) (R., pp. 1216-17). The jury found the aggra<a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>vating circumstance to outweigh the mitigating circumstance and determined that the sentence of death should be imposed.

On Saturday, February 1, 1986, at or near 3:30 p.m., the victim, Anna Mae Morris, entered the C &amp; M Variety store (hereinafter the “Fish Store”) to purchase groceries with proceeds from her Social Security check which she had cashed the preceding day. The clerk filled her order and tallied her purchases. The victim then reached under her shirt for her wallet, <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>tendered the amount due, put the change in her wallet, replaced her wallet under her shirt and left the store. At the same time, Appellant and a group of his friends were playing pinball and eating fish sandwiches in plain view of the victim. They had recently come from the home of Adam McKinney, a member of this group, where they had smoked some marijuana and drank some alcoholic beverages. These friends testified that Appellant neglected to place money into the common fund they collected for food purchases that day at the fish store and that moments after the victim departed, Appellant told his friends that he had something to do, adding he would meet them later in the evening at Adam McKinney’s house. Appellant quickly left the fish store.</p>
    <p id="b700-5" data-blocks='[["BL_700.4",700,[271,1103,1159,258]]]'>No one saw the Appellant, or the victim, until approximately 4:15 p.m. or 4:30 p.m. when Edgar Coder and Travis Wolfe stated that they saw the Appellant and the victim on the Silver Bridge (so named because of its color). They were the last people to see the victim alive.</p>
    <p id="b700-6" data-blocks='[["BL_700.5",700,[271,1378,1160,846]]]'>These witnesses testified that, although they could not hear what the Appellant and the victim were saying to each other, they appeared to be arguing. In addition, Edgar Coder testified that the Appellant had what appeared to be a large stick in one of his hands. Sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., another witness, Kevin Hartmen, while walking his dog there, noticed a body under the Maryland-Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge (hereinafter the “Black Bridge” so named because of its painted color). (The Black Bridge is in close proximity to the Silver Bridge and both of these structures span the Codorus Creek.) Kevin Hartmen immediately contacted his friend, Donald Snell, who also saw the body. Mr. Snell approached his father about what he had seen. His father then told a retired policeman. In turn, the retired policeman contacted the York Police Department and reported the body beneath the Black Bridge.</p>

The autopsy revealed the victim was beaten to death by a blunt instrument and the cause of death was later determined to be a subdural hemorrhage or brain hemorrhage (R., p. 590).</p>

Before he was permitted to enter the bar, the manager, John Ettline, ordered Appellant to leave this club outside because Mr. Ettline did not want patrons carrying weapons into his establishment. Appellant complied and meandered through the Shady Dell for a time and left without re-claiming his stick. From there he proceeded to Adam McKinney’s home. When he arrived at Adam’s home, Appellant now possessed alcohol, marijuana, and money. Appellant did not tell his friends where he had been, what he had done, or where he obtained the money to make his purchases, whereas a few hours before he did not have funds to contribute to their kitty.</p>

The questioning of witnesses revealed that the Appellant often carried an axe handle, that he told his friends the police considered him a prime suspect, and that the police stopped Appellant as he was attempting to leave town. Debra Phillips, a woman who knew the Appellant, told the police she gave the axe handle to him because of a foot injury he received in an altercation with Debra’s nephew some time before the murder. At that time, she suspected he could use the handle as a cane. Intense questioning of the Appellant’s acquaintances confirmed that on the day of the murder the Appellant was seen carrying this axe handle. Their testimony also revealed that when he entered the fish store on the day of the murder, he had the axe handle with him but the owners requested he leave it outside. When Appellant’s friends left the fish store after the Appellant had departed, they noticed that the stick was gone. And finally, they noted <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>that the Appellant did not have “his stick” when he rejoined them later in the evening at Adam’s house.</p>

Appellant said, “that when he asked the victim for her money and she refused, he hit her and took the money.” The next day Jeffrey Hutchenson contacted his attorney, who notified the police. An arrest warrant was then issued on December 12, 1986, for the Appellant.</p>

True, all of the evidence was circumstantial; however, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction “so long as the combination of the evidence links the accused to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Commonwealth v.

These witnesses were able not only to place the Appellant at or near the scene of the crime, they were also able to provide proof 'of a motive. Circumstantial evidence can be as reliable and persuasive as eyewitness testimony and may be of sufficient quantity and quality to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Tedford, </em><a href="/pa/523/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="523 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1820303,1820354" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0305-01,/pa/523/0305-02">523 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0305-02" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="567 A.2d 610" data-case-ids="1820354" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0305-02">567 A.2d 610</a>, 618 (1989).

The standard in evaluating whether a prosecutor crossed the line in his closing argument is whether his comments would have “the effect of arousing the jury’s emotion to such a degree that it becomes impossible for the jury to impose sentence based on consideration of the relevant evidence according to the standards of the statute.” <em>Commonwealth v. Travaglia, </em><a href="/pa/502/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="136" data-cite="502 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1784536" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0474-01">502 Pa. 474</a>, 502, <a href="/pa/502/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="137" data-cite="502 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1784536" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0474-01">467 A.2d 288</a>, 302 (1983). In this case the isolated comment of the prosecutor was the last sentence in a brief closing. This was not emotional oratory calling for divinely motivated retribution; rather it was a reference to one of the texts from which our social system has evolved. The majority opinion is an unmerited censure of citizens called to such vast responsibility. To believe them swayed from their solemn, sworn duty by a single reference to a <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>legal irrelevance is a presciosity that undermines the very essence of trial by jury.</p>
