Although it is impossible to determine with any degree of precision what percentage of highway use occurred between April 1, 1987, and June 23, 1987, and what percentage occurred after, we think it appropriate to pro-rate the payment according to the relation that the period for which such taxation was allowable bears to the period for which the payment was actually made.

Under the lease agreements, the amount of the tax would then be deducted from the owner-operators’ revenue settlements with the carriers. Thus, although the owner-operators in fact paid the taxes, this fact is not reflected in the records of the Department of Revenue.

Huson, </em><a href="/us/404/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="404 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6171158" data-case-paths="/us/404/0097-01">404 U.S. 97</a>, <a href="/us/404/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="404 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6171158" data-case-paths="/us/404/0097-01">92 S.Ct. 349</a>, <a href="/us/404/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="404 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6171158" data-case-paths="/us/404/0097-01">30 L.Ed.2d 296</a> (1971), we should reach that very conclusion. But I believe that <em>Scheiner </em>cannot be applied in a <em>purely </em>prospective way here to the detriment of Appellees themselves because <em>McKesson </em>requires us to consider the due process requirement of providing these taxpayers (who procured, as it were, the decision in Scheiner) with a meaningful remedy; and that in doing so the scales are unavoidably tipped against a <em>purely </em>prospective application of <em>Scheiner. </em>I would refund to Appellees all of the taxes they paid and for which they sought refunds in this litigation.</p>

As to the taxpayers in the instant case, <em>McKesson </em>would apply from the beginning of this litigation because Appellees instigated the decision in which the instant tax was declared unconstitutional and hence Appellees are entitled to refunds from the beginning.</p>

After all, the refunds promised to be made by the Commonwealth could only be made on a retroactive basis since the taxes herein were not paid prospectively. There has been a “final decision on the merits.” The stipulations of the parties themselves, as well as constitutional doctrines of fairness and due process, obligate us to give Appellees the full refunds to which they are entitled.</p>
