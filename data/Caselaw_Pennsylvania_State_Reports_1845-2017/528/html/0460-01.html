As a peace officer, and as a process server, a constable belongs analytically to the executive branch of government, even though his job is obviously related to the courts. It is the constable’s job to enforce the law and carry it out, just as the same is the job of district attorneys, sheriffs, and the police generally. Act 147 is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers doctrine in our Constitution because it attempts to place constables within the judicial branch of government and under the supervisory authority of the judicial branch. It attempts to make constables “personnel of the [judicial] system” and this can no more be done than attempting to make the governor, members of the legislature, district attorneys or sheriffs “personnel of the system.” At most, constables are “related staff”, under the Rules of Judicial Administration. They cannot, however, be made part of the judicial branch under our Constitution. See, <em>Rosenwald, <a href="/pa/501/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="501 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="1782414" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0563-01">supra.</a> </em>To attempt to do so <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>constitutes a gross violation of the separation of powers. Personnel whose central functions and activities partake of exercising executive powers cannot be arbitrarily made part of another branch of government whose functions they do not perform. To do so interferes with the supervisory authority of the Supreme Court just as much as attempting to dictate how that authority is to be exercised over personnel who are properly part of the judicial system. See, <em>Kremer, <a href="/pa/503/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="503 Pa. 358" data-case-ids="1785881" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0358-01">supra.</a> </em>In consequence, we find Act 147 unconstitutional and invalid.
