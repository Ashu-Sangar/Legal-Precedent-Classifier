At that time, the child’s maternal grandmother stated that although she never witnessed any incidents of abuse, she knew that incidents occurred because she was clairvoyant. Hearing this statement, the trial judge interviewed the child along with counsel in chambers. During that in-chambers <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>interrogation, the child never mentioned anything about any incidents of sexual abuse.</p>

As a result of its investigation, PAAR made no report to the Allegheny County Children and Youth Services Department (CYS) or to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office. Furthermore, a court-ordered child psychologist also reported after an investigation that no sexual abuse occurred. Finally, the Appellant requested that the Allegheny County Detectives’ Office administer a lie detector test with regard to the allegations of sexual abuse of A.S., which Appellant passed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[200,1142,1154,585]]]'>A complaint was then made to CYS which in turn conducted its own investigation consisting of interviews with the child, her counselor, her mother, and the Appellant. Based upon its investigation, CYS concluded that the alleged incidents of sexual abuse were supported by substantial evidence and issued an indicated report of child abuse. Appellant then filed an appeal to the Department of Public Welfare requesting that the report be expunged. The Secretary of the Department granted Appellant’s request for a hearing which was conducted by the Office of Hearings and Appeals on January 11, 1988.</p>

Although sometimes Appellant was on top of the child when kissing, the child testified that there was no touching of the genital or breast areas. The child also testified that the Appellant did not touch her sexually with his hands.

By statute, a “good cause” for expunging an indicated report is a determination that the report of alleged abuse is not supported by substantial evidence which is based on medical evidence, the child protective service investigation or any admissions of abuse by the child’s parents or persons responsible for the child’s welfare. 11 P.S. § 2203. Finally, the child protective service has the burden to establish by substantial evidence that the indicated report of abuse is accurate and being maintained in a manner consistent with the law. 11 P.S. § 2215(12)(d).</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[227,863,1152,1264]]]'>Here, the Appellant has been accused of sexual abuse of his daughter. The Public Welfare Code defines sexual abuse, in relevant part, as “sexual involvement, including the touching or exposing of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person, for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire in either the perpetrator or subject child.” 55 Pa.Code § 3940.4. Given the record, it is clear that the Appellee has failed to sustain its burden of establishing by substantial evidence that the indicated report of abuse is accurate. Because of the time delay between the alleged incidents and the reporting, no medical evidence existed. Furthermore, the father specifically denied any incidents of sexual abuse. Finally, the investigation conducted by CYS was limited to interviews with the child, her counselor, and her parents. Given the history of the case it would have been more appropriate to expand the investigation to include an examination or interview of the PAAR counselor, the county detectives and possibly a review of the court proceedings before Judge Novak. Without the entire picture, it is doubtful that CYS’s investigation can be considered conclusive resulting in a decision supported by substantial evidence. To the contrary, it may reasonably be concluded that CYS did little or nothing to investigate the case.</p>
