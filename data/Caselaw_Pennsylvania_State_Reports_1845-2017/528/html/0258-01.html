The change effected by the amendment is that the judgment is created based upon the existence of a valid support order and non-payment of the order without first reviewing the certificate generated by the domestic relations office demonstrating the amount of arrearages owed.

Until that change, the law in the Commonwealth had been that a court may remit, correct, or reduce the amount of the arrearages at any time. The discretionary powers of the court were restricted by the legislature in order to comply with the Child Support Enforcement Amendment of 1986, a Congressional amendment to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. Congress amended Title IV-D in 1986 to require the states to prohibit retroactive modification of arrearages as a condition for the continued receipt of AFDC funds by the state. <em>See, </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20666" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 666">42 U.S.C. § 666</a>(a)(9); <em>Jackman v.

The notice required under subsection (g) of the statute was intended to <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>alert obligors of the need to promptly request a modification as soon as circumstances change. The failure of the domestic relations section to provide the notice to Appellee arguably affected the Appellee’s ability to adjust arrearages, if in fact circumstances warranted it. Taking into consideration the legislative presumption against statutory retroactivity and the domestic relation’s office’s failure to timely notify the Appellee of the substantial change in the law, it would be inequitable to permit a judgment to be entered for arrearages incurred prior to March 25, 1988, the effective date of section 4352(e).</p>
    <p id="b399-4" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[267,921,1154,738]]]'>The Commonwealth Court held that to permit a judgment by operation of law with regard to alleged arrearages existing as of the date of the Act without notice and a reasonable opportunity to act would be an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law. To a certain extent we agree. By promulgating the notice provisions of section 4352(g), the legislature evinced its concern and intent to give notice to existing obligors under current orders prior to the implementation of the new provisions regarding modification of arrearages. Thus on all orders subsequent to the effective date of § 4352(e), obligors would be on notice of their responsibility to immediately seek modification of their support order should there be a decline in their earning capacity.</p>

Under the new amendment, the Appellee would have to notify the domestic relation’s office as soon as he was laid off in order to receive any modification. Prior to the amendment, this was not the case. Since the legislature did not demonstrate its intent to alter the Court’s authority to retroactively modify arrearages for a period of time prior to the filing of a petition for modification, we decline to do so. Thus, arrearages occurring prior to March 25, 1988, would not be subject to § 4352(e). The Appellee is entitled to seek retroactive modification of his arrearages for the period prior to March 25, 1988, based upon his alleged unemploy<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>ment.
