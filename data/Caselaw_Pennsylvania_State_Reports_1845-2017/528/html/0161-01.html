Given our resolution of the Commonwealth’s first issue there is no reason to address the second issue. We note, however, that without the finding that the stop itself was illegal under this Act, the Superior Court’s discussion concerning the proper remedy for an illegal stop becomes theoretical, and hence should not be considered a binding interpretation of the law on the issue of appropriate remedy for a violation of this Act.</p>

It appears from the record that in patrolling their area, the Etna police routinely travelled through the Boroughs of Sharpsburg and Aspinwall to access Route 28, a limited access highway which crosses over the Borough of Etna. Neither counsel delved into the reasons why the Etna police used the exact route on which they were travel-ling.</p>
