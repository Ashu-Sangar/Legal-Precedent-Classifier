The Commonwealth Court found no constitutional violation and affirmed the Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court’s order dismissing the action. We disagree. After review, we find that by designating the theater building as historic, over the objections of the owner, the City of Philadelphia through its Historical Commission has “taken” the appellee’s property for public use without just compensation in violation of Article 1, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and we, therefore, reverse.</p>

The Commission’s letter explained its views as to the benefits, limitations and responsibilities which derive from the ownership of property which is designated historic. The then owner, Sameric Corporation, investigated the Commission’s proposal of historic designation and did not favor the idea. Sameric Corporation was able to obtain a continuance of the proposed consideration of its building for historic designation at the April 30, 1986 meeting. Subsequently, the matter was continued on five additional occasions. Eventually, consideration of the proposed historic designation was rescheduled for the Commission’s meeting of January 28, 1987. Sameric Corporation responded by filing two consecutive lawsuits seeking to enjoin the Commission from holding a meeting on the proposed designation, both of which lawsuits ended without the injunction Sameric Corporation sought. Thereafter, on March 25, 1987, the Commission met, denied Sameric Corporation’s motion for a further continuance, presumedly proceeded to hear evidence and argument, and then voted to designate the Boyd Theater as historic. On that same day, Sameric Corporation returned to court requesting an order that the historic designation be vacated and the matter be rescheduled at a Commission <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>meeting held no earlier than April 2, 1987. Sameric Corporation’s request was granted and the proposal to designate the Boyd Theater as historic was rescheduled by the Commission for consideration at a public meeting on April 2, 1987.</p>

Montgomery, Jr. who recognized Commissioner David Brownlee. Commissioner Brownlee took the floor and, specifically referring to the unanimous recommendation of the Designation Committee, raised the matter of the proposed historic designation of the Boyd Theater. Commissioner Brownlee then gave testimony and argument in support of the Commission’s proposal to designate the Boyd Theater as historic. (R.R., pps. 53a-63a). Commissioner Brownlee advanced three reasons in support of the recommendation of historic designation: (1) the building is an important example of art deco architecture; (2) the building is the work of an important Philadelphia architectural firm; and (3) the building as a movie palace represents a significant phase in American cultural history and in the history of Philadelphia.
