The conduct of the Appellants promoted their scheme of gaining complete control of the <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>roofing industry. The allegations of the federal indictment and state criminal complaint disclose individual acts of bribery, threats, and intimidation, all designed to achieve that purpose. By focusing on particular acts designed to achieve the purpose, the trial court’s definition of the scheme was circumscribed by those particular acts. The Appellants’ scheme was effectuated by employing threatening, intimidating, and cajoling tactics against individuals acting in different capacities, but the scheme was unquestionably single-minded — i.e., control of the roofing industry.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[234,844,1156,419]]]'>We conclude that Counts 1 and 2 of the state criminal complaint are based on the same conduct for which the Appellants were prosecuted by the federal government. As noted previously, the Commonwealth has conceded that this finding precludes its prosecution of the Appellants. Therefore, no further inquiry must be made. The order of the Superior Court is reversed insofar as it affirmed the trial court’s order denying the Appellants’ Motion to Dismiss.</p>
