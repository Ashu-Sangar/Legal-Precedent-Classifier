The surcharges levied against the Sheriff were consolidated for trial following which the trial court dismissed a portion of those expenditures on which the surcharges were based, thereby substantially reducing the amount of the surcharge levied against the Sheriff. Post-trial motions were filed whereupon the trial court reaffirmed its determination with respect to the Commissioners, but further reduced the amount surcharged against the Sheriff. Cross-appeals were filed in the Commonwealth Court.

It is the Controller’s contention that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of the relevant provisions of the County Code creates an unworkable system of county government and deprives the public of a mechanism by which to recoup unauthorized or illegal expenditures. In the alternative, she argues that even if a prerequisite refusal to pay does exist, such requirement should have been excused here because she had been denied an auditor.</p>

In addition, early discovery of misspent funds helps protect the public treasury. We agree with this rationale and would add, as the trial court so aptly noted, that the imposition of surcharges should be reserved for those situations involving personal gain, favoritism, fraud or other instances where the questionable nature of a claim would not have come to the attention of the controller at the time such claim was originally presented. Most importantly, we agree with the Commonwealth Court’s conclusion that this interpretation of the County Code would foreclose the likelihood of a controller, who knows of the questionable nature of a claim, from avoiding giving notice to the claimant, thus permitting these claims to accrue and then subsequently surcharging county officials for amounts in excess of the original claim merely as a retaliatory tactic.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The original contract entered into between Felice and the County, dated July 13, 1972, set the rate of compensation at $45.00 per hour. In September, 1980, Felice sent a letter to the Commissioners requesting a $5.00 per hour increase for its services. The Commissioners agreed to this increase, but failed to provide the Controller a copy of the letter agreeing to this increase. From September 1980 to February 1984 vouchers were submitted and approved at the increased rate of $50.00 per hour. In February 1984, the Controller notified the Commissioners that she would process invoices at the rate of $45.00 per hour, but that she would be happy to honor an amendment to the agreement. The Commissioners entered into a formal agreement with Felice in September 1984 setting the hourly rate at $50.00 and making the increase retroactive to September 1980. In the 1983 Annual Report, the Controller surcharged the Commissioners in the amount of $1155.00 which represented the number of hours invoiced in 1983 multiplied by five. By agreement of the parties, this amount was reduced to $1135.00.</p>

There were two written contracts entered into between RBA and the County, one of which covered programming services and equipment to the Domestic Relations and the other one for leasing equipment. During 1983 and 1984, a number of services were performed by RBA which did not fall within either of the two existing contracts. Nevertheless, the Controller approved several invoices submitted by various personnel which covered services rendered by RBA. Following the filing of the 1983 Annual Financial Report, the Controller surcharged the Commissioners in the amount of $16,544.90 representing the total payments made to R.B.A. for which there was no written contract.</p>

The trial court found as fact that whenever any of the departments experienced a problem with the County’s computer system, or were in need of service or programming thereon, they would contact the Computer Manager for the County, Jack Welty, who would initially attempt to correct the problem. However, if he needed further assistance, he would contact RBA to get an estimate of the amount of work required and the cost. RBA would then either submit its estimate to Mr. Welty or directly to the manager of the department requesting the work. The matter would then be submitted to the Commissioners for approval.</p>

Mr. Welty and the Controller then met with a representative of RBA to discuss the work to be performed. Thereafter, RBA sent a letter to the Controller confirming that the services she requested would cost $1,500 to $2,000. The Controller <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>authorized the work without first seeking the approval of the Commissioners. Following performance of the required services by RBA, the Controller approved a voucher payable to RBA, but the Commissioners refused to honor the voucher because they had not authorized the work. Thereafter, the Controller levied the surcharges at issue here against the Commissioners for allegedly authorizing vouchers for payments to RBA based upon the approval of other department managers. While the Controller submitted that other departments were not required to seek approval from the Commissioners before engaging RBA’s services, the evidence belied this contention.</p>

The Controller never notified the Commissioners that she questioned the legality of the contract with Bedway. Indeed, her continuing approval of all vouchers submitted for Bedway’s services quite clearly evinced that she had tacitly approved the contract. The Controller was in possession of the agreements entered into with Bedway. Had shq withheld her approval of any vouchers when such were first submitted as she is required to do under 16 P.S. § 1752, the validity of the contract could have been determined prior to monies being paid from the County treasury for an entire year.

For instance, some services may require advanced technological capabilities which makes the quality of the service more valuable than the price of the service. In other words, where quality is of little concern, perhaps because the product or service varies little from company to company, competitive bidding should be required. For example, contracts for office supplies or equipment would be, generally, subject to the public bidding requirements. But, where quality of the service is the paramount concern, the service should be exempt from the bidding requirements found in the County Code. In setting forth these guidelines, we remain mindful of the public policy concerns underlying the general requirement that public contracts be competitively bid.

The Commissioners entered into a contract with Aptech for the purchase of data processing software and equipment. The program developed by Aptech enabled the County to monitor the telephone lines of the various county departments. At the end of each month, Aptech submitted a report to the County which included information such as the cost, the department making the phone call, and the trunk line that was used.

In addition, these reports facilitated billing by providing the Controller’s office with the proper apportionment of calls, thus permitting each department to be billed for the actual number of calls made. The testimony revealed that the services performed by Aptech were, indeed, specialized. The manager of the County’s communication system testified that she contacted several computer companies to inquire as to whether they could perform the same service, none of which were even familiar with this type of service. Among those contacted was AT &amp; T which also failed to be of any assistance in this matter. This computer program developed by Aptech for the collection and processing of this information belonged exclusively to Aptech. The fact that the services provided by Aptech did not include any recommendations, but, only information, does not render its services something other than “professional.” These services required special skill, technology, and training. Thus, we conclude that the services rendered by Aptech constitute “professional services” under to 18 P.S. § 1802(h)(5) and, therefore, the contract entered into for such services is exempt from the bidding requirement. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of those surcharges imposed on the Commissioners as a result of their failure to bid this particular contract.</p>

The fund was used to reimburse the Sheriff and/or his deputies for expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. At times, the funds were given in advance, prior to an expenditure. Any cash not spent would be returned to the fund along with receipts for any expenditures. The Sheriffs office periodically requested the Controller’s Office to reimburse the fund. Receipts were submitted to the Controller who would then approve or disapprove the expenditure. The Controller, at all times relevant to this matter, does not dispute the fact that the Sheriff and his deputies were entitled to be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of their duties.

The Controller’s remedy where she finds that an expense is not justified to her satisfaction is to impose a surcharge which is exactly what she did here. The surcharged official then has a right to appeal from the surcharge to the Court of Common Pleas. 16 P.S. § 1731.

The argument as to the failure to provide an adequate auditing staff relates to the surcharges levied against the Sheriff (discussed infra). However, assuming arguendo that she was inadequately staffed, the alleged failures of the Salary Board and the Controller’s staff cannot be attributed to the Sheriff. As for her argument that without a solicitor she was unable to understand her statutory duties, we note that it appears that she did have a solicitor during the period in question and that even if not, the lack of a solicitor is irrelevant as she, alone, is responsible for performing her duties in accordance with law.</p>
