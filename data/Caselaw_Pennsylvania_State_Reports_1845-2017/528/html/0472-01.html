The examiner concluded further that those issues should be submitted to the interest arbitration panel convened under Section 805 to fashion an award. An award issued pursuant to Section 805 could then be reviewed by the Board to determine whether the award was a proper exercise of the arbitrator’s authority. <em>See infra </em>note 7.

It argues, in the alternative, that any disputes concerning whether or not issues deal with inherent managerial policy are exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to resolve, and that an arbitrator or an arbitration panel are without jurisdiction to make such a determination. Thus, the Commonwealth argues that the conclusion reached by the Board, vesting in an arbitration panel the power to determine whether the issues involved are matters of inherent managerial policy, is necessarily an error of law. For the reasons that follow, we are constrained to disagree with this argument and must reverse the Commonwealth Court which agreed with the Commonwealth.</p>

Clearly, the event which triggers the provision of this Section is the arrival at an “impasse” between the parties attempting to negotiate conditions of their collective bargaining agreement. An “impasse” has been defined as “[a] situation offering no escape, difficulty without solution or an argument where no agreement is possible; deadlock.” Webster’s New World Dictionary, 703 (Second College Edition, 1982). In the present matter, the Commonwealth on June 6, 1985, declined to appoint an arbitrator and unequivocally refused to proceed to arbitration. Since no bargaining or resolution of disputes can occur if one of the parties refuses to participate in discussions, <em>a fortiori, </em>an impasse is created. Accordingly, pursuant to the express statutory scheme of Section 805, the unresolved issues were required to be sent to arbitration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
