While the matter was pending, the tax was repealed. The Court of Common Pleas granted summary judgment in favor of the City as to the claim for declaratory relief on the grounds of mootness. The court also granted the City summary judgment on the claims for refunds. Considering the grant of retroactive relief to be discretion<a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>ary, the court determined that even if it found the statute unconstitutional it would not award such relief. On this basis, the court avoided deciding the question of the constitutionality of the tax ordinance.

Inasmuch as <em>McNulty </em>involved precisely the same type of tax as was at issue in <em>Smith, </em>we had no cause to address the distinctions between <em>Smith </em>and <em>McKesson. </em>In light of <em>McKesson, </em>however, there is significant question whether <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>the lower courts’ determination not to grant retroactive relief in the circumstances of this case would comport with due process. <em>McKesson </em>involved a Florida liquor excise tax. For years, the tax had provided preferential treatment for beverages manufactured from certain Florida-grown citrus and other crops. After the U.S. Supreme Court held that a similar preference system in Hawaii violated the Commerce Clause, the statute was amended, dropping the explicit preference for Florida-grown products, but retaining a preferential treatment for beverages made from specifically identified citrus, grape, and sugarcane products, all of which are commonly grown in Florida. Upon challenge by a distributor whose products did not qualify for the rate reductions, the tax was held unconstitutional, but the Florida courts declined to order a refund or any other form of relief for the taxes previously paid.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[248,1205,1161,522]]]'>The Florida Supreme Court offered two equitable grounds for ordering only prospective relief: that the tax scheme was implemented in reliance on a presumptively valid statute and that refunds would in all likelihood result in a windfall, since the added cost had likely been passed on to consumers. The Supreme Court found neither of these considerations “sufficient to override the constitutional requirement that Florida provide retrospective relief as part of its postdeprivation procedure.” 496 U.S. at 44, 110 S.Ct. at 2254.</p>

The Court cited a number of procedural protections a state could adopt to allow for sound fiscal planning while maintaining the ability to provide relief for taxes unlawfully collected. The Court also noted that the State could hardly have been surprised at the invalidation of the statute, which had only been superficially <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>changed from a form identical to the statute invalidated in the Hawaii case.</p>
