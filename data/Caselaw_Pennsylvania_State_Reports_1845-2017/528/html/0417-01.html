Appellant admits to the fatal stabbing but asserts that she did so in self-defense after the decedent, who was drunk at the time, attacked her. At trial, appellant testified that the decedent had become violent when drinking and beaten her on numerous occasions (T.T., 11/4/87, pp. 7-8).</p>

According to the offer of proof, Weinert would have testified that “during the time he visited the home, he and his friends, James Dillon Sr.’s, would get in the basement at which time they would drink and smoke marijuana and inhale it and he would get drunk and mean and vicious.” The trial court refused to admit Weinert’s testimony because it considered the testimony irrelevant and incompetent. The trial court did, however, permit two Commonwealth witnesses to testify on rebuttal that decedent was normal and happy when drinking (T.T., 11/4/87, pp. 100, 113).</p>

Appellant sought to introduce Weinert’s testimony to explain the decedent’s general character and reputation when drinking. At the very least, Weinert’s testimony would have shown that the decedent was “mean and vicious” when drunk. Since there was evidence to show that the decedent had been drinking prior to the stabbing,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Weinert’s testimony would be relevant to corroborate appellant’s state of fear, and therefore, the testimony should have been admitted.</p>

This Court, as far back as 1884, has permitted the introduction of character evidence to prove the decedent’s violent propensities, where self-defense is asserted and where there is an issue as to who was the aggressor. <em>Alexander v.

On cross examination, however, the Commonwealth tried to establish that appellant did not feel that her life was threatened and that she stabbed the decedent out of anger (T.T., 11/4/87, p. 59). Because there was a question as to who was the aggressor, appellant should have been permitted to show the decedent’s violent propensities through Weinert’s testimony.</p>

The behavioral patterns that emerge in a study of battered women are collectively referred to as “learned helplessness.” 135 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 432. This learned helplessness and its resulting feeling of inability to control the beatings lead to a process of victimization, rendering the woman psychologically paralyzed and unable to perceive the existence of any available options.</p>

However, traditional concepts of self-defense do not include this particular cycle of behavior, but instead focuses on the immediacy of the perceived harm rather than the systematic and cumulative damage inflicted on the abused individual.

Part of the very root of the problem with courts accepting the battered woman’s syndrome is the so called “reasonable man" standard. How a reasonable man may perceive danger is quite possibly wholly different from how a reasonable woman may perceive danger. In Schneider, Jordan &amp; Arguedas, <em>Representation of Women Who Defend Themselves in Response to Physical or Sexual Assaults, </em>4 Nat’l J.Crim.Def. 141, 153 (1978), the authors note:</p>
      <blockquote id="b567-8" data-blocks='[["BL_567.7",567,[307,1753,1085,587]]]'>Sex bias permeates the legal doctrine regarding the perception of imminent and lethal danger. The law assumes that both the attacker and the victim have approximately equal capacities. While a man is assumed to have the ability to perceive danger accurately and respond appropriately, a woman is viewed as responding hysterically and inappropriately to physical threat. However, certain factors relevant to women’s experiences are not taken into account. For example, women are less likely to have had training or experience in hand-to-hand fighting. Socially imposed proscriptions inhibit their ability to fend off an attacker. The fact that women generally are of slighter build also gives a male assailant an advantage. All of these conditions will have an impact on the reasonableness of a woman’s perception of an imminent and lethal threat to her life such as would justify the use of deadly force. These factors, however, have not usually been considered during the trial.</blockquote>
