The appeal to Superior Court was untimely filed, and Superior Court properly quashed it as such. Notice of judgment was entered on the Judgment Docket on October 9, 1987, and notice of judgment was mailed the same day. Petitioners argue that because judgment was not recorded on the General Docket until some time in March of 1988, their appeal to Superior Court on November 20, 1987, was timely filed.</p>

The equal protection clause of the United States Constitution will mandate that any party may hereafter successfully file untimely appeals on the basis of this Court’s ill-considered decision in this case.</p>
