Thereafter, he framed his <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>own findings of fact and conclusions of law which we have summarized below. The Appellee, PRN Nursing Agency, although it is not a health care provider, entered into agreements with various hospitals, nursing homes, and private individuals, for the purpose of supplying registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants, to those parties as their needs arose. At its office in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Appellee maintained its records, received telephone calls from institutions and individuals requesting its staff, and dispatched its employees to various locations throughout the Allegheny County area. Appellee did not require its employees to report to its office for assignment; instead, Appellee would contact its employees at their homes, one week in advance of the assignment, to inquire as to whether they were interested in accepting a work assignment. When an employee accepted a work assignment, Appellee instructed the employee where to report for work, when to report to work, and to arrive in uniform.</p>

Employees were paid an hourly rate, calculated from the time they signed in at the assigned work-place to the time they signed out of that work-place. Work hours were totaled by the work-place and forwarded to the Appellee, who used those figures to compute an employee’s gross wages. The Appellee paid its employees by check, after it made the necessary deductions.</p>

The Appellee did not instruct the Appellant to make any stops, to deliver any messages, to pick up any materials, or to perform any service on behalf of PRN prior to reporting to work at Montefiore. In fact, Appellant was free to select any route to and from her worksite.</p>

As a consequence, the Appellee did not file an Employer’s Report of Injury.

Although the Board agreed that the Appellant had no permanent, or fixed, place of work, it concluded that she had a fixed place of employment each day. Hence, the Board concluded that the Appellant was no different than any other employee who travelled to Montefiore Hospital each day, and determined that exception number two (of Setley) only applies to situations where the employee travels during her workday.</p>

It concluded that Appellant’s injuries were not compensable since her contract did not include reimbursement for her transportation expenses, and rejected the Appellant’s assertion that she was on a special mission, because it found nothing special about a daily commute to work. The Appellee’s requirement that its employees dress at home was nothing more than the performance of incidental, work-related, functions prior to a commute, and the Appellant’s argument that she had no fixed place of work each day failed because she did not travel from location to location during her workday. In conclusion, the court did not consider her situation any different from any other employee, who travelled to work each day, labored through her work day at a specific office, and then returned home at the end of the day.</p>

See, <em>Campagna, supra. </em>An exception was also found to arise where there is some special duty undertaken for, and directed by, the employer. See, <em>Butrin, supra. </em>Yet, this duty must not be an act done for the mere convenience of the employee, but by order of the employer, express or implied. See, <em>Cronin v.

It insists that the Appellant does not fall within any of the created exceptions. More specifically, the Appellee illustrates its argument by raising the following points: 1) The assignment to Montefiore Hospital constituted a fixed place of work; 2) The Appellee neither compensated Appellant for her transportation expenses, nor did it pay her for her travel time; 3) The Appellant’s journey to work did not constitute a special mission since she exercised her right to accept this work assignment; And, 4) the Appellant’s acceptance of this assignment did not create any special circumstances wherein she was furthering her employer’s business. According to the Appellee, all of its employees fall within the parameters of the general rule unless the employee receives compensation for her travel.

    <p id="b422-10" data-blocks='[["BL_422.10",422,[220,1307,1158,257]]]'>I dissent. The majority holds that when an employee is dispatched to one of a number of possible job sites by his employer, the employee is eligible for workmen’s compensation benefits when he is injured en route to the job. This is not, has never been, and should not be the law.</p>
    <p id="b422-11" data-blocks='[["BL_422.11",422,[218,1585,1159,528]],["BL_423.1",423,[212,321,1150,197]]]'>The general rule, as correctly expressed by the majority, is that if an injury is sustained while an employee is going to or coming from work, the injury is not compensable. An exception to this rule is that the employee may be compensated for such injury if his employment contract provides for transportation to and from work; if he has no fixed place of work; if he is on a special mission for the employer; or if he was furthering the business of the employer. Citing <em>Setley v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>69 Pa.Commwlth.Ct. 241, <a href="/citations/?q=451%20A.2d%2010" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="451 A.2d 10">451 A.2d 10</a> (1982), the majority <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>determines that the claimant in this case had no fixed place of work and was, therefore, eligible for workmen’s compensation benefits for injuries sustained in an accident going to work.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[210,548,1153,852]]]'>The <em>Setley </em>case itself, however, cites <em>Davis v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, </em><a href="/pa-commw/41/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="41 Pa. Commw. 262" data-case-ids="1895290" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/41/0262-01">41 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 262</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=398%20A.2d%201105" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="398 A.2d 1105">398 A.2d 1105</a> (1979) as authority for its articulation of the “going and coming rule.” In <em>Davis </em>the employee was a pharmacist who worked for a supermarket in Reading. As part of Davis’s employment contract, he was required as well to work at other stores operated by his employer in Allentown and Bethlehem. Davis was killed in an auto accident while returning from the Bethlehem store to his home in Reading and his wife applied for worker’s compensation benefits. Although Commonwealth Court acknowledged the “going and coming” rule, it denied benefits on the grounds that his injuries were not suffered in the course of his employment and he did not fall within any of the exceptions to the “going and coming rule,” including the fixed place of work exception.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[211,1424,1153,575]]]'>The present case is indistinguishable from <em>Davis. </em>Here an employee was dispatched to one of several possible work sites and was injured on the way to the job. That the employee was sent to one job site rather than another does not mean that the employee had no fixed place of work within the meaning of the exception to the “going and coming” rule. The exception to the rule, rather, concerns employees who are moved from one site to another <em>after they have already begun to work at an initial site. </em>The decision of Commonwealth Court should be affirmed and the claim denied.</p>
