Ordinance No. 638 designated a certain geographic area known as the “Hill District” as a residential parking district. The impact of ordinance No. 638 was to restrict parking by nonresidents within the “Hill District,” by issuing parking permits to residents while limiting the time non-residents were permitted to park within the area. The portion of ordinance No. 638 containing the specific restrictions as to non-residents, provides as follows:</p>

Motor vehicles not displaying a valid residential parking district permit may not be parked on the streets of the Hill District for more than one (1) hour, with the exception of metered parking spaces on Sarah Street. The parking restrictions set forth in this subsection shall not apply on the following holidays: New Years Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas. The permit term for the Hill District shall commence on October 1 and expire two (2) years later on September 30.</blockquote>

The Borough of Stroudsburg is declaring, in effect, that the motor vehicles of nonresidents create hazardous traffic conditions in residential parking districts, if they are allowed to park all day in those districts during business hours, but that the motor vehicles of residents with permits do not create hazardous traffic conditions under the same circumstances. This is a distinction that is both artificial and clearly without merit. The provisions of Ordinances No. 636 and No. 638 of the Borough of Stroudsburg which distinguish between the motor vehicles of residents and those of nonresidents and which are intended to alleviate hazardous traffic conditions do not have a “real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be obtained.”</p>
