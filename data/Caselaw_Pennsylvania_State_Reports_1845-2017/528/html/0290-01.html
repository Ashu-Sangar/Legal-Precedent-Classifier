      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>On May 31, 1986, at approximately 1:00 A.M., Upper Darby Township (Delaware County) uniformed police officers Raymond Graff and John Cunningham responded to a radio call of a reported stabbing of a police officer. Upon arriving at the scene, they noticed a large crowd of thirty (30) to fifty (50) persons. As they approached, the officers saw appellee hurrying away from a small group which appeared to the officers to be the focal point of the incident. The officers stopped appellee and instructed him to remain until they made an assessment of the situation. Appellee answered Officer Graff by stating that he was leaving and he directed the officer to get out of his way. Officer Graff repeated to appellee that he was not to leave until the officers understood what was going on. At this juncture, appellee shouted at Officer Graff, “Get out of my f-way.” Officer Graff placed his hands on appellee’s shoulders and repeated his instructions, but appellee pushed the officer’s hands off his shoulders while loudly stating, “Yes I’m leaving. Get the f— out of my way.” Immediately following this statement, appellee was arrested.</p>

    <p id="b427-7" data-blocks='[["BL_427.6",427,[247,827,1153,678]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court improperly based its reversal on its conclusion that the obscene language attributed to the appellee was not the type of language sought to be prohibited by the disorderly conduct statute. The Commonwealth further contends that the intent requirement for a conviction of disorderly conduct is fulfilled where the appellee recklessly creates a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm. It is the Commonwealth’s position that because appellee’s language was obscene, abusive, and made in a loud voice, coupled with the knocking away of the officer’s hands, all of which occurred in close proximity to the crowd, his acts recklessly created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm.</p>

Such a situation is, by its nature, fraught with danger; danger not only to participants in whatever incident may have been the genesis of such a scene, but danger to bystanders, passersby and arriving police officers.

The majority characterizes the Appellee’s response to the police officer’s instruction as the type of spark the statute so plainly seeks to extinguish before it becomes a flame. While a report of a stabbing in the early morning hours outside a tavern with a large crowd may offer a potential volatile situation, the record is devoid of any evidence that the incident presented any danger to bystanders, passersby or the arriving police officers. In fact, there is no evidence that the crowd was even aware of the confrontation between the police officer and Appellee. Therefore, it is mere' speculation that Appellee’s words and actions recklessly created a risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm. Instead, the majority would use this statute as the means to prohibit Appellee’s use of language <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>which was not even directed to the police officer personally.
