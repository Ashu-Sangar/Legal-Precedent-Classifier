The Commission urges that section 977 of the Election Code has no application here. Instead, the Commission argues that its action was brought under the Ethics Act for a violation of the same, and thus it (the Commission) is not subject to the filing requirements of the Election Code.</p>
    <p id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[230,878,1150,853]]]'>In support of its position, the Commission relies in part on our decision in <em>Abraham v.

Reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. In <em>Abraham, </em>a case concerning a challenge to a declaration for candidacy for retention election to the Commonwealth Court of an executive appointee pursuant to the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 3131, we held, <em>inter alia, </em>that the petition to challenge was not subject to the filing periods under the Election Code since the challenge there was contesting the filing of judicial retention papers and the filing of such papers was governed by Article 5, § 15(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution and by the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 3153. Therefore, we held that the Election Code provisions were not applicable.</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[229,1760,1152,365]]]'>In the instant case, however, the nomination petitions and papers filed by the candidates were filed pursuant to the Election Code itself. Since the actual document the Commission seeks to attack, i.e., the nomination petition, is a creation of the Election Code, the specific time limit imposed by the Code for objecting to such petitions must also apply.</p>
    <p id="b477-7" data-blocks='[["BL_477.7",477,[229,2154,1151,197]]]'>The Commission further argues that the Ethics Act should be construed as pre-empting the Election Code by virtue of the following provision contained within the Ethics Act:</p>

    <p id="b478-4" data-blocks='[["BL_478.4",478,[224,492,1163,798]]]'>65 P.S. § 412. Moreover, the Commission contends that since the Ethics Act was promulgated after the Election Code, the Ethics Act would govern any conflict related to time periods for filing challenges to nominating petitions. These arguments are meritless. The Ethics Act is silent on when a petition to set aside must be filed. There is, therefore, no conflict. Since aspects of these statutes relate to the same subject matter, i.e., requirements for filing of nomination petitions, they are in <em>pari materia </em>and must be construed together. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Therefore, in light of the expressed time limit contained within the provision of the Election Code with respect to challenging nomination petitions, and the absence of a temporal framework in the Ethics Act, there is no conflict and the Election Code must apply.</p>
