The cell block was 146 yards long with one gate for ingress and egress. Around 9:00 p.m., Hawkins approached appellant, who was standing at the midpoint of the cell block in the corridor which runs between the cells. The two men heatedly exchanged words. Hawkins threw a punch that missed appellant, but which prompted one of the block guards, Robert Quinones, to separate the men.</p>
    <p id="b578-6" data-blocks='[["BL_578.5",578,[224,1415,1161,742]]]'>An hour later, Hawkins again approached appellant, who was in the rear of the cell block conversing with several other inmates. There is no clear consensus among the witnesses as to the precise facts of this confrontation. What was apparent, however, was that one of the two inmates was armed with a homemade knife. The most logical version of the facts, consistent with the jury’s verdict, is that Hawkins initiated the fight, drawing first blood from appellant. Appellant then came into possession of the knife and pursued Hawkins. The entire cell block disrupted around this activity. Inmates began throwing benches and garbage cans and a mob of more than fifty inmates formed in the rear of the cell block moving toward the front gate in pursuit of Hawkins.</p>

Within seconds, the guards opened the gate and Hawkins fell to the ground. He was rushed to the hospital .where he was unsuccessfully operated on, and pronounced dead. Appellant was also taken to the emergency room and was treated and released.</p>

Experience teaches us that the very <em>exercise </em>of an individual’s right not to testify, under Article I, Section 9, may <em>endanger </em>that right if the jury is left free to draw negative inferences from the defendant’s decision to exercise his or her constitutional privilege. The trial court, being in a unique position to protect a defendant’s constitutionally secured right through the jury charge, is the only bulwark to ensure that the exercise of a fundamental right does not turn into an act of constitutional suicide. Having determined in this Commonwealth that a “no-adverse-inference” charge is necessary to secure the guarantees of Article I, Section 9, the judge has either given the charge or he has not.

Although the Commonwealth introduced significant direct and circumstantial evidence to indicate that defendant was the individual who stabbed Michael Hawkins during the uprising in cell block G, there was certainly a colorable dispute over the facts surrounding the confrontation. Particularly, there was a significant question whether decedent Hawkins had instigated the fight. Appellant presented evidence to indicate that decedent, Hawkins, was “high on speed,” pulled a homemade knife or “shiv” on appellant, and made the first assault. The evidence presented by both the Commonwealth and appellant indicated that 40 to 60 inmates joined in the insurgence along with appellant, chasing Hawkins towards the locked gate. Moreover, one of the prison guards confirmed that appellant was already bleeding, apparently from a neck and chest wound, at the time the confrontation occurred at the gate. Although two guards, Robert Quinones and Leroy Randolph, testified that they observed appellant stab Hawkins at the gate, the jury was certainly free to consider the defense’s contention that someone else in the mob may have struck the fatal blow; or that appellant acted in self defense; or that Hawkins had provoked the incident and appellant was acting without premeditation or malice. Despite the significant evidence produced by the Commonwealth, we cannot state beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure of appellant to take the stand and the failure of the trial court to give the “no-adverse-inference” instruction might not have contributed to the verdict of murder in the first degree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Thus, under the law of Pennsylvania, we <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>conclude that the trial court’s failure to give the instruction was not “harmless error.”</p>

Here, appellant was unquestionably entitled to a "non-adverse inference” charge, and since it was not given to the jury, an award of a new trial must be granted.</p>

In short, they now provide that this error, however plainly harmless, must yield to the majority’s doctrine that it is never harmless if a “no adverse” charge is not given when requested; which is, of course, to say the facts of this nightmare murder were not proven, or could not be proven, to their satisfaction even if that which could not reasonably be expected to help is not done. To come to this conclusion they find that a “colorable” argument could be or was made that rendered the eyewitness testimony of the prison guards suspect. Their testimony was that the appellant had the knife that killed in his hand when he and a howling mob pursued the deceased against the prison gate yelling “kill him.” The blood of the deceased was on that knife. To some that may raise “colorable” questions. The jurors who saw and heard the evidence, however, were not so easily persuaded.</p>

It is conceivable that such error can recur despite the clear ruling, and prove as harmless as it proves here. For that reason, I would not slam the door shut by using the power to transcend what has not yet been mandated by the United States Supreme Court. The temptation to go beyond what is mandated by the United States Supreme Court by enlarging our State Constitution is a journey into areas best left to the legislature. Such journeys may make Pennsylvania unique and stranded in unworkable locks in the search for the truth: in many cases giving benefits, not constitutionally required, to those that count the rights of others as small change.</p>
    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.5",593,[241,1296,1151,1048]]]'>Finally, in passing on whether the issue was waived because counsel did not press the matter, the majority finds it to have been an unbecoming burden on counsel to press with firmness and appropriate courtesy for a proof, but inches away in the court reporter’s machine. To my mind, for counsel not to do so was an abdication of his duty to the court and to his client. Here, counsel knew the charge was not given and the court was mistaken. To yield without more smacks of intention to hopefully leave an uncorrectable error in the case to the cost of his client, the court and, of course, seemingly last but certainly not least, the truth. The majority’s view that one need not “scratch, scream or plead” for the truth is like minding one’s business as the blind man walks off the cliff. The majority has apparently grown thinner skin than trial judges in the daily realities of trial where counsel are expected to press their points with “logic and vigor.” Polite silence in the presence of a known and immediately reachable and rectifiable error is more than unbecoming.</p>
