On that date, Carolyn Royer was injured when the vehicle she was operating struck a utility pole. She was arrested for driving under the influence of a controlled substance in connection with this accident. Following the accident, she was taken by a police officer to Centre Community Hospital for treatment of a head injury she sustained in the accident. The physician who examined Ms. Royer ordered x-rays to be taken of <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>her head.

He then penetrated her vagina with his fingers and when she began protesting and crying, appellee told her to “shut up.” He subsequently climbed onto the examination table and raped her.

Appellee had Ms. Royer disrobe, put on a paper gown, and lie on an examination table. He asked Ms. Royer several times whether she remembered him to which she responded “yes.” After taking the x-rays, appellee told Ms. Royer she looked sad and asked her if she needed a hug.

She was examined by a doctor who ordered that x-rays be taken of her head. She was taken by wheelchair to an isolated area of the hospital where she was met by appellee. Appellee took Roberta into the x-ray room and told her if she was good, he would give her “a kiss on the forehead or something.” After taking several x-rays, appellee suddenly hugged Roberta and kissed her, penetrating her mouth with his tongue.

Post-verdict motions were filed and denied and appellee was sentenced to two consecutive terms of ten to twenty years imprisonment.

The prejudice of which Rule 1128 speaks is, rather, that which would occur if the evidence tended to convict appellant only by showing his propensity to commit crimes, or because the jury was incapable of separating the evidence or could not avoid cumulating the evidence.</blockquote>

In my view, the need of opinions, generally, from trial courts is an anachronism that we can no longer afford in this litigious age of crowded court calendars and congested dockets. I continue to call for the release of our trial judges from the imprisonment of opinion writing as has been done in 45 of our sister states.</p>
