The issue presented is whether a court of equity has authority to require the attendance of school board members and union negotiators at bargaining sessions of a frequency and duration determined by the court under the supervision of a state mediator when the equity court has issued an injunction stopping the school strike. For the following reasons, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

On September 3, 1986, the Teachers commenced a work stoppage against the District. On October 8, 1986, the Teachers voluntarily <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>returned to work without a new contract. On January 5, 1987, the strike resumed and, on the same day, the District filed a complaint against the teachers pursuant to section 1003 of the Public Employee Relations Act (“PERA”), 43 Pa.S. § 1101.1003<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>, asking the Court of Common Pleas of Armstrong County to end the work stoppage by issuing an injunction. The Court ordered the Teachers to return to work under the terms of the prior agreement. The trial court conditioned the injunction upon the parties’ engaging in daily negotiating sessions until an agreement was reached. The court later amended its order to require that the sessions last at least ten hours each day and that the entire Teacher’s negotiating team and the School Board attend if the mediator deemed it advisable.</p>

The Common<a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>wealth Court reasoned that, by issuing such an order, the trial court had usurped the authority of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board over instances where it is alleged that a party refused to bargain in good faith in violation of Section 1201(a)(5) of PERA, 43 P.S. § 1101.1201(a)(5). <em>Armstrong Educ.

Second, once a court of equity has jurisdiction the chancellor may impose reasonable regulations and conditions in order to effectuate the relief granted. And third, appellant submits once the District invoked equity jurisdiction based upon claims that the strike created a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the PLRB’s exclusive jurisdiction was ousted.</p>

The response is visceral and invalid.</p>

In such cases, the Act gives the right to a public employer to initiate an action for equitable relief in the common pleas court. It is significant that § 1003 is structured as an authorization for the <em>public employer </em>to seek relief from a strike, including injunctive relief. The Act does not provide an unlimited grant of authority for the <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>court to step in to resolve a dispute, and, notably, the public employees are given no right to approach the court for relief.</p>

Argument can easily be made that the phrase was intended only to clarify that injunctive relief was permitted, and not to suggest that the court has unfettered discretion to act as a super-arbitrator. Much more is at stake than a disagreement as to the meaning of the phrase, however.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[207,997,1152,363]]]'>The majority has lost sight of the overall scheme developed by the Legislature.

Section 1003 of the Act does not have to be interpreted so as to permit the court to wield power to compel attendance and to direct the hours of negotiation in order to preserve the court’s authority to grant equitable relief. Negotiations require finesse, not a judicial steamroller.</p>
