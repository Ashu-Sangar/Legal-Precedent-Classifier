The informant, followed by the two officers in an unmarked car, proceeded to Petro’s Bar in Uniontown where he met with Appellee. Appellee and the informant left Petro’s together and, still followed by the officers, drove to another area of Union-town. After instructing the informant to wait in the car, Appellee walked away from the vehicle. Upon observing Appellee walking away from the informant’s car, the officers left their car and walked to a point where they observed Appellee entering Bake’s Bar. After waiting for more than an hour, the officers directed the informant to look for Appellee in Bake’s Bar. The informant returned to the officers’ car and reported that Appellee was not in the bar. The informant was searched at this point, and neither money nor drugs were found on his person. The informant testified at trial that he had given Appellee $350.00 to purchase cocaine, but never received the drugs in question. The record contains no direct evidence of any kind that Appellee promised to deliver drugs or anything else to the informant. The $350.00 has never been recovered by the <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>Commonwealth.

In reversing the judgment of sentence in this case, the Superior Court properly relied upon this Court’s decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

Under § 3922 of the Crimes Code, “deception as to a person’s intention to perform a promise shall not be inferred from the fact alone that he did not subsequently perform the promise.” Yet, that is what the jury did here. Appellee was convicted on the basis of the fact that he did not deliver cocaine to the informant. Nothing more. There are no additional facts in the record from which the intent to deceive could reasonably be inferred. Appellee did testify on his own behalf at trial and denied taking the money or deceiving the informant with a promise to deliver cocaine. Perforce, he denied any <em>intent </em>to deceive. The Commonwealth cannot sustain its burden of proof solely on the jury’s disbelief of Appellee’s testimony. It has been long accepted that the disbelief <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>of a denial does not, taken alone, afford affirmative proof that the denied fact existed so as to satisfy a proponent’s burden of proving that fact. <em>Cruzan v.

See also, Fleming James, Jr., <em>Civil Procedure </em>(Little Brown &amp; Co. 1965), § 7.11. Without disbelief of Appellee’s denial, all that is left of the Commonwealth’s case is the fact that Appellee never returned with the promised cocaine. That is not enough to show deceptive intent under § 3922 of the Crimes Code. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

The record reveals that members of a state police narcotics squad had employed the informant in this case over a seven-month period for the purpose of making undercover drug purchases. During that time, the informant received $350.00 from two of the narcotics squad members for the purpose of making a purchase of cocaine. The informant met with appellee at a Uniontown bar and transferred the $350.00 to appellee with the understanding that appellee would purchase for the informant one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine. Appellee and the informant left the bar together and drove in the informant’s car to another Uniontown bar where the cocaine was to be obtained. Appellee directed the informant to wait in his car while appellee entered the bar and obtained the cocaine. The informant was under surveillance by the two narcotics squad officers who followed him in an unmarked car from the point at which he was given the $350.00. The informant waited for over an hour before being told by the officers to go into the bar appellee had entered to determine if appellee was still inside. The informant entered the bar and determined that appellee was not there. Appellee neither returned the $350.00 nor delivered the promised cocaine.</p>
