    <p id="b200-7" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[232,1408,1158,302]]]'>Arthur Faulkner was hired by SJS Archeological Services as a laborer in November of 1987. SJS was a small archeological excavating company owned by Anne Jensen and Glenn Sheehan (husband and wife), which employed approximately ten to fifteen people, including the victims Clarice Dorner and Annaliese Killoran.</p>
    <p id="b200-8" data-blocks='[["BL_200.7",200,[228,1736,1161,636]]]'>On April 1, 1988, Good Friday, Ms. Dorner, Ms. Killoran and Mr. Faulkner were planning to work at the laboratory of SJS at 10 Woodmont Road in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. 10 Woodmont Road was a rowhouse in which the SJS laboratory was located. Mr. Sheehan and Ms. Jensen resided at 3 Woodmont Road, just down the street. Mr. Sheehan and Ms. Jensen had returned home from breakfast sometime before 10:00 a.m. and were planning to go to an 11:00 a.m. appointment before attending Good Friday church services. Ms. Jensen testified that she walked up the street to the office to see if the employees had enough work to carry them through the day.</p>
    <p id="b201-3" data-blocks='[["BL_201.3",201,[227,301,1153,839]]]'>
      <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>Ms. Jensen walked into the office building, saw Mr. Faulkner coming down the stairs and moved to get out of his way. As she turned to go up the stairs, she was grabbed from behind by Faulkner. He put his left arm around her neck, held a knife to her chest and forced her to the second floor of the building. Faulkner stated “Why didn’t you and Glenn tell those bitches to give me some pussy?” Ms. Jensen tried to calm him down and told him that she was pregnant and that he did not want to do this. He replied, “it can’t get any worse, one person is dead already.” When Ms. Jensen tried to convince him that maybe the person was not really dead and again reminded him that she was pregnant, Faulkner replied “I don’t want to hear that shit.” Ms. Jensen noticed that the room on the second floor was in disarray and that there was blood all over the room and water all over the floor.</p>
    <p id="b201-4" data-blocks='[["BL_201.4",201,[227,1166,1152,471]]]'>At that time, Ms. Jensen saw another employee, Annaliese Killoran, coming up the stairs and screamed to her to get away and get help, telling her that Faulkner had a knife. As Ms. Killoran turned back down the stairs to run away, Faulkner stabbed Ms. Jensen in the back several times, threw her down and ran down the stairs and out the door in pursuit of Ms. Killoran. Ms. Jensen held her hand over the wound sites as best she could and headed back down the stairs, looking for help.</p>
    <p id="b201-5" data-blocks='[["BL_201.5",201,[227,1656,1154,688]],["BL_202.1",202,[272,304,1157,254]]]'>She headed outside and in the direction of her home when she saw Faulkner repeatedly stabbing Ms. Killoran who was lying on her side in a fetal position in front of the office building. Ms. Jensen ran between two of the row houses and realized that Faulkner was chasing her. In order to escape from him, she jumped off a ten-to-fifteen foot wall onto an abandoned road, known as Old River Road. She yelled to two men standing outside a pickup truck that she was pregnant and had been stabbed and asked that they get help. The two men got into the truck and drove away. She turned and saw Mr. Faulkner trying to gain access to River Road through a gate. She kept running the other way. When she turned back to the gate, she saw that Faulkner <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>had turned and headed back toward the houses. She eventually collapsed on River Road, but worried that she would bleed to death and unable to walk, she began to roll down the road. She was eventually found and taken to the hospital.</p>
    <p id="b202-4" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[266,577,1163,894]]]'>While Mr. Sheehan was at home talking on the telephone, he heard a scream that he believed sounded like his wife. He dropped the telephone and ran out of the house, where he encountered Ms. Killoran lying on a concrete patio. She had been stabbed and there was a pool of blood under her head. As Mr. Sheehan was telling her he was going to get help, Mr. Faulkner surprised him and grabbed him in a bear hug and began stabbing him. Faulkner kept repeating that “he had to get the keys.” Mr. Sheehan broke away and ran off, looking for help. As he was running away, he noticed Faulkner bending over Ms. Killoran. Mr. Sheehan opened the door to one of the houses and yelled for help. He told them to call the police and an ambulance and said that he could not find his wife, who was pregnant. He then went up the street to a construction site and asked people at the site if they would move their vehicles to block the road so that Faulkner could not escape.</p>
    <p id="b202-5" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[262,1491,1162,683]]]'>Before the police arrived, Faulkner had left the scene in a truck owned by Ms. Killoran. One of the people at the construction site saw a large black man getting into a truck and driving away. A neighbor had his camera and took photographs of the truck leaving the scene. According to documents later discovered, the appellant went to his bank terminal and withdrew the maximum allowable daily limit of three hundred dollars. Faulkner then went home and changed his bloody clothes. He was apprehended nine days later when a New York City policeman saw Faulkner sitting in Ms. Killoran’s vehicle. He was arrested and later gave a statement to the police in which he admitted having sex with Ms. Dorner and stabbing her and the other victims.</p>

She was found naked from the waist down, lying on the floor, with blood covering parts of her body. There were numerous stab marks on her body, including her chest, abdomen and right hand. The police also found a rope tied to the back of the chair in the room in which the victim was discovered. During the trial, none of the SJS employees recalled ever seeing a rope in the offices before the murders. Semen consistent with Faulkner’s was discovered on the chair.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[242,786,1151,429]]]'>The pathologist testified that the causes of Ms. Dorner’s death were multiple stab wounds, blunt impact to the head, and manual strangulation. Additional testimony established that semen was discovered in her oral cavity. There was testimony that the knife found on appellant was capable of making such wounds. The same pathologist examined the body of Ms. Killoran and determined that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[242,1247,1152,254]]]'>The physician who treated Ms. Jensen at the hospital after the incident testified that she arrived in a state of shock, requiring blood transfusions and chest intubation in order to save her life and the life of her twenty-week old fetus. Both she and her child survived.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[242,1541,1152,372]]]'>Mr. Sheehan’s treating physician testified that Mr. Sheehan presented at the hospital with multiple wounds consistent with being stabbed by a knife. Certain of these stabs wounds punctured his lung, collapsing it. At the time of his admission to the hospital, he was in a life-threatening condition and was required to undergo chest intubation as well as surgery to save his life.</p>
    <p id="b203-8" data-blocks='[["BL_203.7",203,[242,1945,1152,365]]]'>It is beyond question that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant’s convictions for two counts of first degree murder, rape, deviate sexual intercourse and attempted homicide.

    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.3",204,[223,276,1157,256]]]'>
      <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>Appellant’s main claims of error involve the refusal of the trial judge to permit him to introduce expert psychiatric testimony during the guilt phase — as opposed to the penalty phase — of the trial.

Appellant chose two experts, Dr. Robert Sadoff, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Gerald Cooke, a psychologist. Since appellant would not consent to be examined by a Commonwealth psychiatrist, the trial court required appellant to reduce the opinions of the experts to writings and provide them to the court and the prosecutor.</p>

This Court has never allowed the type of testimony the defendant proposed to be introduced during the guilt phase of a first degree murder case.

    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[229,960,1152,736]]]'>The proposed testimony of the experts would have established that Faulkner may have believed that he engaged in consensual sex with the victim, Annaliese Killoran, and was being set up by his co-workers to look as if he had raped her. He allegedly also believed that he was going to be killed by his co-workers. Both psychiatric experts stated in their reports that Faulkner was probably psychotic and may have been delusional at the time of the events in question. However, Dr. Sadoff stated that “the evidence indicates that he knew the nature and quality of his acts and knew that what he was doing was wrong....” The other expert, Dr. Cooke, stated that “the details of the offense indicate that he was aware of the nature and quality of his behavior.”</p>

In <em>Frisoli, </em>the Government sought the defendant’s psychiatric reports, which the court refused to order. However, in that case, the trial court directed Friscoli to submit to a psychiatric examination (which he did) so the Commonwealth might determine for itself the defendant’s mental condition. Thus, there was no pressing need for the prosecution to review the psychiatric reports of the defendant’s experts. In the instant case, appellant refused to submit to a psychiatric examination and the prosecutor had a much stronger need to know the substance of the psychiatric experts testimony. As such, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering appellant to turn over to the Commonwealth its reports of Dr. Cooke and Dr. Sadoff.</p>

Appellant argues that “Dr. Michals’ testimony could have been presented by the Commonwealth in its case in chief in light of the fact that the Commonwealth had been heretofore supplied with a copy of the reports of Drs. Cooke and Sadoff.” This argument is meritless. Drs. Cooke and <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>Sadoff testified during the penalty phase. Since appellant refused to be examined by a Commonwealth psychiatric expert, the court permitted Dr. Michals to listen to their testimony and then testify on rebuttal. It is difficult to even ascertain the essence of appellant’s argument. That Dr. Michals could have testified in the guilt phase (to which appellant would have objected), does not mean that he was precluded from testifying as a rebuttal witness during the penalty phase. Furthermore, we note that during the penalty phase the jury found as a mitigating circumstance that appellant suffered from a degree of mental illness.
