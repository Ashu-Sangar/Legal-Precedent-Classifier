Klopp’s Motion for Summary Judgment which denied appellant Keystone Insurance Companies the right to rescind a policy of automobile insurance. The issue presented by this appeal is whether an automobile insurance carrier may rescind an insurance binder and policy on the grounds that the contract was void <em>ab initio </em>because of a misrepresentation of fact made by the intended insured at the inception of the policy.</p>

On the basis of that notice Keystone refused to provide insurance coverage for the February 8, 1985, accident because of misrepresentations made by the Klopps during the application process. These misrepresentations, which were not discovered until after the February 8, 1985, accident, include failure to disclose two speeding violations received by Richard Klopp on April 27, 1982, and August 27, 1982, respectively, and <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>failure to disclose a vehicle accident involving Sylvia Klopp on August 25, 1983. Under Keystone’s underwriting guidelines, speeding violations and vehicle accidents occurring within three years of the binder and policy application date are considered material to the risk insured and consequently, applicants involved in such violations or accidents are not to be issued a binder and policy. In addition, the parties stipulated to the fact that the insurance binder and policy at issue herein would not have been issued had the Klopps disclosed their driving indiscretions. Following cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled that Keystone was obligated to provide coverage to the Klopps on the ground that rescission is not a remedy available to Keystone.</p>

Keystone contends the protection afforded by Act 78 cannot be invoked until 60 days after coverage is initiated, <em>see </em>40 Pa.S. § 1008.6, and that the policy herein was rescinded within that 60-day period. Since the coverage in this case was initiated on February 7, 1985, and rescinded 57 days later on April 4, 1985, Keystone contends that Act 78 was not yet effective and therefore the company retained the common law right to rescind the contract because of the aforementioned fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>In our view, a reading of the text of § 1008.6 reflects that insurance companies are free from the remedial constraints of Act 78 for a period of sixty days. Even assuming, as the Klopps argue, that Act 78 is intended to supersede all common law rights, those rights cannot be abrogated until the statute becomes effective. The Klopps’ assertion that Act 78 is intended to preempt the common law is premised upon the inference that the compendious scheme of Act 78 manifests the legislature’s intent to provide the sole methodology for terminating automobile insurance contracts. While this argument may be appealing for the period after Act 78 takes effect, it overlooks the legislature’s omission of any detailed guidance during the sixty days after initial binders are issued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The insurmountable weakness of this assertion is that the legislature could not have intended to create a remedial void for the sixty days prior to the operation of the Act when it passed section 1008.6.</p>

Such an absurd result must be avoided. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1). From the clear language of Act 78 itself it is apparent that the restrictions are intended to be applied to a contract which is cognizable under the Act and free of fraud in the inducement by the insured. Section 1008.6 explicitly limits the triggering mechanisms under the Act to afford the insurer an opportunity to verify the assertions upon which the determination is made to issue the policy. Therefore, we hold that an insurer is entitled to all its common law rights until such time as Act 78 applies.</p>

They were seeking to insure themselves from financial losses arising from the use of their automobile. Keystone is a writer of insurance which issues, or declines to issue, policies based on a driver’s propensity to incur losses as measured by that driver’s past experience. The Klopps failed to disclose to Keystone the truth about their checkered driving history. As noted previously, the stipulation of the parties indicates that had Keystone been aware of the Klopps’ driving record, coverage would not have been extended. Under basic contract principles, the omission was a material misrepresentation which would certainly justify the rescission of the contract. <em>See, e.g., Metropolitan Property and Liability Co. v.

Through the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (“MVFRL”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> the legislature has mandated that <em>all </em>owners of motor vehicles in Pennsylvania obtain liability insurance. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1702 (“financial responsibility” defined) and 1781-1787 (requiring owners of motor vehicles to provide proof of financial responsibility). This requirement is not intended to protect the interests of the policy holder or the insurance company. Rather, it is wholly intended to protect the innocent and injured third party public. Its specific purpose is to ensure that all owners of motor vehicles will be able to respond financially for their “liability on account of accidents arising out of their use of the motor vehicle.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[261,1297,1160,528]]]'>This overriding governmental interest, which is apparent from the very definition of “financial responsibility,” would dictate that common law concepts of the rights of third party beneficiaries,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> to-wit, the innocent and injured third party, be rendered inapplicable. In effect, the rights of third party beneficiaries would be considered to be original, rather than derived from the rights of the insured.

Thus, it is my view that, with regard to innocent and injured third parties, the insurance company would be bound to honor the liability provisions of the insurance contract and may cancel said provisions only pursuant to § 1008.5 of Act 78.</p>
