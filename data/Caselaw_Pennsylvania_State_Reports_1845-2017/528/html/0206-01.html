Respondent sought an extension of time to respond to the petition. The request was denied by per curiam order of this Court dated September 14, 1990.</p>
    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[264,511,1159,686]]]'>The record in this case consists of the JIRB’s petition, which includes a certified copy of the criminal information setting forth the charges made against the Respondent and certified copies of the sentencing orders entered on January 29, 1990, and the Respondent’s petition for an extension of time. The JIRB has alleged, and the sentencing orders indicate as well, that the Respondent was convicted of hindering apprehension or prosecution, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5105(a)(3), and obstructing administration of law or other governmental function, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5101. The only description of the conduct giving rise to the criminal charges is contained in the information of the Berks County District Attorney’s office.</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[258,1229,1162,688]]]'>With respect to the charges for which Respondent was sentenced, the information states that on or about March 13, 1988 to October 25, 1988, the Respondent “... did with intent to hinder the apprehension, prosecution, conviction or punishment of another for crime, conceal or destroy evidence of a crime or tampered with a witness, informant, document or other source of information ...”, and “... did intentionally obstruct impair or pervert the administration of law or other governmental function by force, violence, physical interference or obstacle, breach of official duty....” No more detail of the Respondent’s conduct than that contained in the information has been advanced by the JIRB’s petition.</p>

It may not be applicable every time a sitting jurist commits a crime unrelated to his or her judicial responsibilities. However, where the jurist has been convicted of hindering apprehension or prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5105(a)(3),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> or obstructing administration of law under 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> the conviction of those offenses by definition establishes a sufficient basis for concluding that the jurist has “misbehaved in office” under Article V, § 18(l). The conduct need not be confined to matters over which the jurist was personally presiding; it is sufficient if it is shown that he or she has used the office to improperly intervene or importune in any legal proceeding with the intent of influencing the outcome for the benefit of one of the litigants therein.</p>
