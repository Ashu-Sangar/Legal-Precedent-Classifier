        "text": "Mr. Justice Trunkey\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nExtra work and materials done and furnished by a contractor during performance of his agreement, may be included in and constitute a part of his claim, if the claim be filed within six months after completion of the contract. Though outside the contract, they are so closely connected with it, that they have always been included with those done and furnished under the contract, in filing the claim. As shown by the learned judge below, the lien will be continued if the claim be filed within six months after the extra work was done, but more than six months after work on the contract was completed. He was clearly right in holding the converse. Including contract and-extra work in same lien subserves the interests of both contractor and owner, and it accords with such interests, as well as with the statute, that the claim may be filed within six months after the building is finished, even if one kind, in fact,-was not within six months of the filing.\nThis claim states that the work and materials were done and furnished within six months last past, and refers to the bill of particulars as setting forth the time when they were done. At the foot of said bill is the following: \u201c The work was commenced on or about the 14th day of June 1872, and finished on the 28th day of June 1873, on which day the last work was done, in which time said materials also were furnished.\u201d \u2019 The lien was filed December ,27th 1873. Prefixed to the first item, in the bill for extra, is the date Febuary 19th 1878, and all others follow without mention of time. Doubtingly and reluctantly the court struck from the record so much of the lien as relates to extra work and materials, because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory \u201crequirements as to kind, quality, amount and time.\u201d\nIn Bayer v. Reeside, 2 Harris 167, the claim set forth that the work and materials were done and furnished \u201c within, six months last past, to wit, between the 1st June 1848, and 1st April 1849,\u201d and the bill of particulars was without date. The defendant demurred, assigning for cause that time was not well stated. No question was before this court other than the validity of the lien, and. the judgment was affirmed. True, it is said in the opinion, that after a trial on the merits, technical objections are disregarded, but the demurrer.was before trial and treated as raising the question as pointedly as would a motion to strike off. That decision has not been overruled. The date of a bill of particulars for materials \u201cfurnished within six months\u201d was December 3d 1868, the time of filing; in the margin to the first item was June 9th, without any year; there was no date to any other item. After a sheriff\u2019s sale of the premises, upon application of a subsequent lien-creditor, the court struck off the mechanics\u2019 lien, which judgment was reversed. \u201cAll that is required is such certainty as will enable those interested to discover during what period the materials were delivered, or the work done so as to individuate the transaction: Calhoun v. Mahon, 2 Harris 56. \u201c It has been more .than once said we must not be hypercritical \u201d when scanning this species of lien and estimating its sufficiency.\u201d Per Bell, J.: McClintock v. Rush, 13 P. F. Smith 203. Both these cases were under the Act of 1836. Shields v. Garrett, 5 W. N. C. 120, was by a sub-contractor, and the claim was sought to be .sustained under the Act of 1849, in force in Philadelphia and Chester counties. Hahn\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright 409, was a case under the Act of 1845, and relates to claims for work under contract.\nIn the light of Bayer v. Reeside, and McClintock v. Rush, it is manifest there is no departure from previous decisions in holding that no portion of this lien is defective because of insufficient setting out of time. The rule is certainty to a common intent, not precision, in statement. If the entire bill is to be deemed of the date, February 19th 1873, it cannot be struck out, for the contract work was done within six months of filing the claim. But it is unreasonable to say the whole bill is of that date, for on its face it is patent that the items of work and material were at different times. That really applies to the bill of coal, to the other items only by fiction.\nThe extra bill includes many things apparently within the contract for erection of the building, but where they are well stated they cannot be struck off on motion. The claimant may be able to show, at trial, by sufficient proofs, that they are without the contract and furnished at the owner\u2019s request.\nDoes the phrase, \u201carchitect\u2019s charges and fees\u201d exhibit the nature and kind of work he did ? The claimants so affirm, resting on authority of The Bank of Pennsylvania v. Gries, 11 Casey 423. There the architect had a contract to perform labor in and about the erection of the buildings, of which this court said, \u201c This is labor, mechanical labor of a high order, contributing its proportionate value to the beauty, strength, and convenience of the edifice.\u201d In sa\u00edne opinion it is said, \u201cA mere naked architect, and who may be such without being an operative mechanic, who draws plans in anticipation of building, usually could hardly be supposed to be within the act which provides a lien for work \u2018 done for or about the erection or construction of the building.\u2019\u201d In Price v. Kirk, C. P. Chester county, ante, page 47, it was decided that a claim by an architect, for preparing drawings and specifications for a building, is not the subject of a mechanic\u2019s lien. Butler, P. J., gave conclusive reasons for the judgment, which has just been affirmed in this court. When an architect claims to have a lien for charges and fees he must show work done, for which the statute gives a lien, and such work is not shown by the name of his calling. Especially should the kind of work be set forth, distinctly, when it is claimed as extra by the contractor. It will hardly be presumed that he is entitled to a lien for fees for superintending and directing himself in the performance of his own contract.\nThe items, \u201cbill of Phillipsburg Iron Co.\u201d and \u201cT. M. Lesher & Bro.\u2019s extra bill,\u201d contain no sign of any kind of work or material in the construction of the building. It is vain to surmise what they are for \u2014 the statute requires expression, not occultness.\nThe \u201c bill of coal and carting same\u201d exhibits the kind of materials ; it is not a subject for mechanics\u2019lien. Of like character is \u201cextra boarding for Householder for extra time.\u201d\nJudgment reversed, except as to the following items, namely, \u201cbill of coal and carting same, $489,50; \u201cbill of Phillipsburg Iron Co., $794.30; \u201c extra boarding for Householder for extra time, $19.60; \u201cT. M. Lesher & Bro.\u2019s extra bill, $3701.12;\u201d \u201carchitect\u2019s charges and fees, $3617.65;\u201d and as to these excepted items, affirmed, and procedendo awarded.",

On July 1st 1878, after argument, the court (Meyers, P. J.), made the rule absolute, in an opinion, inter alia, saying:\n\u201c The question then, is, have the plaintiffs complied in respect to said extra work and materials,'with the Act of 1826. This act provides, inter alia, \u2018that every claim must set forth the amount or sums claimed to be due, and the nature and kind of the work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished, and the time when the materials were furnished, or the work was done, as the case may be.\u2019 On reading the statute, it would seem that the meaning of the language would scarcely admit of any doubt that nothing less than a full, precise and distinct statement of the nature or kind of work done, and the kind and amount of materials furnished, and the year, month and date when so done and furnished, would be a full compliance with the statute. On the question of the construction the books are full of cases. Many of them are apparently conflicting, and some of them difficult, if not impossible to be reconciled with each other. It must be observed, however, that some of the decisions are under the Act of 1845; others are raised on the trial, such trial being held a waiver of all defects; others on a motion to strike off the lien, or on demurrer, and still others on a special Act of Assembly applicable only to certain localities. I have examined with care, probably every Pennsylvania case having any direct or remote bearing on the question. * * * In some of them, reasons are given at considerable length and with great force as to the necessity for such certainty, viz.: to individuate the work and materials, by description, quantity and dates, so as to protect the owners of property and others interested against error and imposition. Sergeant, J., in Witman v. Walker, 9 W. & S. 186, in speaking of this provision of the statute, says: \u2018 that the amount or sum claimed to be due and the nature or kind of- work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished, and the time when the materials were furnished or the work was done, are, or ought to be within the peculiar knowledge of the claimant from his books or otherwise, and must be furnished by him when filing his claim. When dispute arises they are essential to the owner of the building, the purchaser and lien creditor to enable them to trace out the truth of the claim and guard against error or imposition. * * * Where, as often is the ease, a contractor carries on several dispersed buildings and work is done and materials furnished for them by the same mechanic or material-man, the enumeration in the claim of these items furnishes the best means of ascertaining how far the particular building in question is liable.\u2019 This language is specially applicable to this lien. Considering that here is a special contract for $58,644.77 for work done and materials furnished, and while in the process of its erection extra work is done and materials furnished in and about the erection of the same building for $11,562.05, it will be seen at a glance how necessary it is that there should be strict compliance with the statute in specifying, as to said extra work and materials, the nature and kind of said work, the kind and amount' of materials, and the time the same was done and furnished. If in an ordinary case the law requires this to be done to prevent error or imposition, how much more is it necessary where a special contract for work and materials is in process of erection concurrently with' extra work done and materials furnished outside of the special contract in the erection of the same building ? How easily could a claimant introduce in his bill for extra work and materials, such work and materials which properly belongs to the special contract, if not compelled to keep an accurate account of the extra work and materials, the nature, kind and amount thereof and the time when done and furnished. Even that might fail to protect the oAvner and parties interested against error and imposition, but it is the best which the law-affords. It is true that many of the items as to kind and amount are sufficiently certain, Avhile others are manifestly defective and deficient, as for example, the item \u2018 Bill Phillipsburg Iron Co. $794.30;\u2019 \u2018T. M. Lesher & Bro., Extra Bill, $3701.12;\u2019 \u2018Architect\u2019s charges and fees, $3617.65,\u2019 and others. There is no reason why the plaintiffs could not have complied with these simple requirements as to kind, quality, amount and time. Having failed to do so, we have come to the conclusion, somewhat doubtingly as to the law, and may also add reluctantly (as such claims are generally deemed meritorious), that so much of the lien relating to \u2018extra work and materials,\u2019 must be stricken from the record.\u201d\n- The claimants took this writ, assigning for error the order of the court making the rule absolute.\n- Reeder Reeder, for plaintiffs in error.\nThe claim of lien filed shows that it is comprised of two parts; the first being for a specific sum, the amount being fixed by a special contract and amounting to $53,644.77, and the other a bill for extra work and materials amounting to $11,562.05. \u25a0 The order of the court below affects only the bill for extra work and materials. The first item in this'bill bears date February 19th 1873. No other item is dated. Attached to the bill and immediately folloAving the last item thereof, appears this sentence: \u201c The work was commenced on or about the 14th day of June 1872, and finished on the 28th day of June 1873, on Avhich day the last work was done, in Avhich time also said materials were furnished.\u201d This is such a statement of time as sufficiently complies with the requirements of the Act of the 13th of June 1836: Driesbach v. Keller, 2 Barr 77; Hillary v. Pollock, 1 Harris 186; McCay\u2019s Appeal, 1 Wright 125; Bayer v. Reeside, 2 Harris 167; MeClintock v. Rush, 13 P. F. Smith 204.\nThere are charges for Avork done and materials furnished which often enter into a bill of particulars, for Avhich it is impossible to give a specific and exact date. Take, for instance, the item \u201c architects\u2019 charges and fees, $3617.65\u201d (which item is the most important one involved in this case). Work of this character begins cotemporaneously Avith the commencement of the building \u2014 indeed, often precedes any Avork whatever upon the building \u2014 and continues until the last nail is driven or the last brushful of paint applied. The architect\u2019s services in superintending the structure are often unnecessary for continuous Aveeks, and then again are necessary every day. His charges are never regulated by the time Avhich he is required to be present during the erection of the building, but upon the actual cost of the structure. This is the custom of architects everywhere. How, then, can such charges be given a date in a bill of particulars, or how can such services be described other than as \u201carchitect\u2019s charges and fees ?\u201d\nIncident to nearly every contract for the erection of buildings for a specific sum is a bill for extra work and materials. This hill is. one springing out'of the original contract by reason of changes in, and alterations of, the special contract, made as the work progresses, at the suggestion of the owner of the building himself. By reason of the peculiar position of the contractor as owner of all the materials purchased for the work under the special contract, and both the material used in the extra work and under the special contract being taken from the common store, it is in most instances almost impossible, in some cases utterly so, for the contractor to ascertain the exact amount of material used or labor performed in the erection of the extra work until after the completion of the structure.\nWhere a builder is erecting a building not under contract, it is easy enough to file a lien; he files his liens as he keeps his account for the work in detail as it is performed. But where the contract and the alterations or extra work are so connected that they are parallel to a certain extent, the same work being part under special contract and part in consequence of the alteration, how can he file his lien with the exactness required by the Act of 1836 ?\nFor these reasons we contend that the law should regard the bill for extra work as a contract springing from the special contract and running parallel with it, and should not require for such bill the same exactness they would require in a claim where there was no contract.\nW. S. Kirkpatrick and Robert K Jones, for defendant in error.\n\u2014The bank petitioned to strike off this defective lien; this was the proper course. Judgment-creditors are parties interested, and greater exactness and conformity is required against subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers than against defendants in mechanics\u2019 liens: Lehman v. Thomas, 5 W. & S. 263; Howell v. Philadelphia, 2 Wright 471; Hahn\u2019s Appeal, 3 Id. 409; McClintock v. Rush, 13 P. F. Smith 203; Lee v. Burke, 16 Id. 336.\nOn its face the claim declares expressly that the bill for extra work and materials, $11,562.05, was incurred more than six months before filing, and it is therefore void. The claim is dated Dec. 26th 1873, but the lien was not filed until the 27th, and the averment \u201c within six months last past,\u201d refers to the date of the claim, and not of the filing of lien: Ellice v. Paul, 2 Phila. R. 102. The \u201c extra bill\u201d does not set out the time of doing the work or furnishing the materials, because February 19th 1873 is the date of only the first item, viz.: Bill of coal and carting same, $389.50.\nOn the other hand, if February 19th is assumed as the time when the whole of the extra bill was incurred, then surely it is all barred by lapse of time. At the end of the lien the following occurs: \u201c The work was commenced on or about the 14th day of June 1872, and finished on the 28th day of June 1873, on w'hich day the last work was done, in which time said materials also were furnished.\u201d There is no pretence that the work was done continuously, but, on the contrary, the lien expressly declares that it was not, nor under a continuous contract, for it is extra work, outside of and additional thereto. The statement above as to the commencement and end of the work, &c., is of no effect whatever as regards any of the items under the Act of 1836. It can refer only to the contract work. This court has so declared in Shields v. Garrett, 5 W. N. C. 120, a most carefully considered case. The Act of 1849 does not apply to our lien, but if it did there is no statement of time according to its provisions. The bill is confessedly for extra work, and the charges made in the lump. The beginning and ending of the whole work is given, not the beginning and ending of each charge, and this is a fatal defect: Shields v. Garrett, supra; Van Roden v. Campbell, 5 W. N. C. 126; Ellice v. Paul, supra; Smaltz v. Knott, 3 Grant 227. Many of the charges were not sufficiently' stated, such as the architect\u2019s fees, and others.\nMay 5th 1879."
