J., Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Woodward, Trunkey and Sterrett, JJ.\nCertiorari to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Huntingdon county : Of May Term 1879, No. 187.\nEelix Toole petitioned the court for a license to keep a tavern or inn, and filed his bond and recommendations, and fully complied with all the requirements of the Act of April 12th 1875, Purd. Dig. 2027, and the rules of court. Twenty citizens signed the recommendation attached to his petition. There was. no remonstrance or objection of any kind to the granting of the license. The court, however, refused the license, and when asked to state their reasons, declined to do so.\nToole then took this writ, and assigned this refusal for error.\nPetrilcen McNeil, for plaintiff in error.\nThe clear intention of the Act of Assembly is that the court should exercise a sound judicial discretion in the granting of license, when objection was made to the granting of any particular license, and that discretion was to be exercised on the evidence before the court. There would or could be nothing else upon which to call into exercise or rest a legal or judicial discretion. .\nNo counsel contra.\nJune 9th 1879,"
