It appears by the pleadings and the records and proceedings of this court laid before us by the defendants in support of their motion, that the goods and chattels, declared by the plaintiff to have been taken and carried away to his damage, were on the 15th of November 1876, levied upon by the sheriif, Joseph Totton, under an execution issued by the Harrisburg National Bank against Zaeharias &amp; Co. et al., to No. 1 January Term 1877; that the property thus levied upon was claimed by George A. Zaeharias, and on the petition of the sheriff setting forth the facts of the levy and adverse claim of Zaeharias, the court awarded an issue, under the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act, wherein Zaeharias was plaintiff, and the Harrisburg National Bank was defendant, to determine the claimant’s right to the property. The first order on the sheriff’s petition was made by the'court on the 4th December 1876, by which a rule was granted upon the parties to appear and show cause, &amp;c., and having appeared the feigned issue was <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>awarded the 9th December 1876. Zacharias appeared and filed his declaration as directed by the court but failed to give the required bond, and the property, excepting one hundred and six barrels of whiskey, was under an order of the court sold by the sheriff and the proceeds brought into court to await the determination of the feigned- issue. Afterwards the trial of the feigned issue resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of Zacharias, and thereupon he took out of court the proceeds of the sale of the property. The question is, whethe'r the sheriff and execution-creditor are now liable to the claimant’s action for this seizure and sale of his property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[177,820,1170,1165]]]'>“The Interpleader Act, as the preamble shows, was passed for the relief of the sheriff, and was intended to exempt him from the hazard and expense of actions that might otherwise be brought against him by persons claiming the goods upon which he had levied, who were not the parties against whom the process issued.There is nothing in the act which makes it imperative on the court to grant an issue when applied for by the sheriff. Its award or refusal is not a matter of right, but of sound discretion under all the circumstances of the case: Bain <em>v. </em>Funk, 11 P. F. Smith 185. But when the court, upon consideration of the circumstances of the case, has in the exercise of this discretion granted the issue for the relief and protection of the sheriff, and that issue has been determined between the claimant and the execution-creditor, I think, the sheriff’s liability, to the claimant’s action for a trespass in the seizure and sale of the goods, is at an end. If it were otherwise, the act would be of but little use. And if the sheriff is relieved from liability to the claimant's action of trespass, it follows that the execution-creditor is also relieved. If any just cause existed why the relief prayed for by the sheriff in this case should not have been granted the claimant should have shown it in answer to the rule upon him to appear and show cause. It is now too late. I am of the opinion that the proceedings and determination of the issue under the Interpleader Act constitutes a complete bar to the claimant’s action of trespass against the sheriff as well as the execution-creditor for the seizure- or sale of the property, and that the defendants in this action aré entitled to judgment on the issue raised by the special pleadings.</p>

The Interpleader Law has never been construed to authorize the court to assess damages suffered up to the time of filing the petition. In England the protection of the court begins only with the granting of the rule to interplead, and liability remains for all damage done before that time: Walker <em>v. </em>Olding, 1 H. &amp; C. 621. Nor was it necessary to make a levy under fiie circumstances. The property was in the actual possession of the plaintiff in this case; had been extensively advertised for sale at a public sale, to be held on the 15th November; the bidders were actually present, and the sale about to begin, when the sheriff made his levy; he had refused to make the seizure because of the open and apparent possession and ownership of the plaintiff, and demanded a bond of indemnity before doing so. Instead of demanding this bond, he could have applied for his rule before proceeding: Philips <em>v. </em>Reagan, 25 P. F. Smith 381. He assumed the risk of levy without the protection of the Interpleader Act, and the evidence alone could show whether he acted in such a way as to make himself liable for damages.

Such a construction of the act was never contemplated; nor is the sheriff required to incur any such risk. In Day <em>v. </em>Carr, 7 Exch. 883, it is said, “ In many cases he will be justified in applying to the court before he perils himself by an actual seizure, under circumstances which might perhaps subject him not only to an action for the value of the goods, but also for damages for taking them.” After quoting this sentence with approbation, the present chief justice, in Phillips <em>v. </em>Reagan, 25 P. F. Smith 381, says, <em>“ </em>There is great reason, when the goods of one man may be taken under an execution against another, why an actual levy should not be necessary. Every purpose of the act may be accomplished without it. Especially is this so when the goods are in the actual possession, not of the defendant in the execution, but of an adverse claimant. A very serious injury might be done to such a party by closing his store and putting a watchman in charge, even for the short period of time necessary to procure- the order of court for the interpleader.”</p>

If the court thought proper to entertain the application, it had full power to make all necessary orders in the premises. The sheriff might thus have acted from the beginning under the protection of the court, without committing any actual trespass; but instead of doing so, he disregarded the plaintiff’s claim, levied on and took possession of the goods, on November 15th 1877. Although his petition for the rule on the parties is dated six days thereafter, it was not presented until the fourth day of December following. In the absence of explanation this delay was uncalled for. When the court was applied to it acted promptly in granting the rule, and subsequently, in awarding the issue; but no other order was either made or applied for.

The act provides a mode by which the title to personal property, and consequently its liability to execution ás between the claimant and execution-creditor may be judicially determined; and, in the absence of proper averment and proof of malicious abuse of civil process, the parties to the proceeding cannot be considered trespassers while pursuing, in good faith, the remedy provided by law.</p>
