    <p class="summary" id="b472-11" data-blocks='[["BL_472.12",472,[179,1275,1171,819]]]'>William Weightman obtained a judgment in the Court of Common Pleas of said county, against Peter Ilerdic, to No. 209, September Term 1878. Upon this judgment an execution was issued to No. 155, September Term 1878, E. D., and by virtue thereof the sheriff sold certain real estate of the defendant, Peter Herdic, specifically described in his return to said writ, for the sum of $46,425. The said real estate was purchased by William Weightman, a lien-creditor of the defendant in said judgment, through his attorney R. J. C. Walker, Esq. A deed was executed, acknowledged in open court and delivered by the sheriff to the purchaser at said sale. This deed was subsequently placed on record. In his return to said writ, the sheriff stated that he had applied said purchase-money as follows: To first mortgage of William Weightman, the sum of $16,036.31, and the balance of said proceeds of sale, after paying certain specific liens and the costs, to wit, $24,988.49, upon a second mortgage of said William Weightman. By this application a number of liens upon the real estate sold, intervening between the said two mortgages of William Weightman, did not receive any of the proceeds of said sale.</p>

The writ was not read in open court at a time fixed by the court, and the other lien-creditors had no opportunity to contest the right of Mr.' Weightman to receive said deed and have the money applied to his liens, to the exclusion of the intervening lien-creditors. The deed was acknowledged in court, regardless of the duty imposed by this act upon the sheriff, and the other lien-creditors had a right to suppose that the sheriff had in his hands the money arising from said sale, applicable to their judgments. Whether a want of compliance by the sheriff with the requirements of the statute will affect the title of the purchaser, is is not necessary now to consider and determine. That the sheriff has been derelict in his duty cannot be controverted. Had the sheriff read in open court his return, and attached thereto a list of the liens upon the property sold, as was his duty, it would have appeared that there were intervening liens upon the property sold entitled to the fund realized from the sale, which had priority over the second mortgage of Weightman. The Act of April 20th 1846, is imperative: ‘It shall be the duty of the sheriff.’ Having neglected to comply with the positive^ requirements of this Act of Assembly, the sheriff is answerable to the process of this court for his neglect in this particular, and as the lien-creditors of said Peter Herdic, who have judgments intervening between, the first and second mortgage of said Weightman, have had no opportunity to contest the right of said Weightman to have the entire proceedings of said sale applied upon his liens, and as it is not disputed that there are intervening liens upon the property sold, between said two' mortgages, and these lien-creditors claim that they are entitled to be paid from the proceeds of said sale, it is ordered that the sheriff pay into court, within ten days from notice of this order, a sufficient amount of the proceeds of said sale to cover the debt, interest and costs of the judgments that inter<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>vene between the two mortgages of the said Weightman, and an auditor is hereby appointed to distribute said fund, when paid into court, together with the fund already paid into court which arose from said sale. The sheriff cannot shield himself behind the return made to said writ No. 155, September Term 1878. He has failed to discharge a duty imposed upon him by the statute, and it is our duty to enforce a compliance. Upon a failure to comply with this order, an attachment is directed to issue against the sheriff.”</p>

He has made the money and refused to obey the exigency of his writ by producing it to the court. No matter touching the execution of his writ is in question, but only the law of distribution. The sheriff has usurped the function of the court. He is not responsible. It is not pretended that he could personally respond to the amount of this misappropriation, if it should be held to have been erroneous. Nor is he relieved by the amount of his bail,, which is only $10,000. The controversy has relation, not only to the practice, but to the power of the court. If the act of the sheriff is beyond control, and the party must look only, as contended here, to the personal responsibility of the sheriff and his hail, it opens wide avenues of fraud, and restricts the court in the control of its executive officer, and in that function of its power which is of its largest and most frequent exercise, and liable beyond all others, to abuse by subordinate officers.</p>

The proceeding in the court below was a rule upon the sheriff to show cause why he should not be attached, as for a contempt, in not paying into court the proceeds of the sale of certain real estate, sold by him as the property of Peter Herdic, under an execution issued out of the Common Pleas of Lycoming county, No. 155, September Term 1878, for the sum of $46,425. To the rule for an attachment, the sheriff answered substantially, that he had prepared and completed his return to said writ gbout the first day of September 1878, <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>although, by inadvertence, it was not actually filed in the prothonotary’s office until the 29th of November following, when, at the same time, he paid into the hands of the prothonotary the sum of $8690.75, being the balance remaining undistributed; that the rest of the money made upon said execution had been applied to the liens entitled to the same; that the deeds to the purchasers of the respective properties were made and acknowledged at September term of the court, prior to the issuing of any rule upon the sheriff, and without objection on the part of creditors or any other persons. No notice was given to, or rule taken upon, the sheriff to pay the money into court until the 19th day of November 1877, at the term of the court next after the sale. The sheriff having declined to pay in the money for the reason that he had already applied it to the liens entitled, as he avers, to the same, the court below made absolute the rule for an attachment, which order is assigned for error.</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[156,1052,1173,1341]]]'>The real cause of controversy is, that the sheriff applied the sum of $24,988.44 to the mortgage of William Weightman, of date of 16th May 1876, when there were sufficient prior judgments to have absorbed the whole of it. But these prior judgments, as we gather from the record, were liens upon other real estate amply sufficient to protect them. In fact, the. same had been already sold upon proceedings issued out of the United States Circuit Court, and a fund raised thereby ample to pay said judgments awaiting distribution in that court. We do not propose to discuss here the question of the legality of the distribution made by the sheriff. He has taken the responsibility, and is liable to a suit on the part of the disappointed creditors. It will be a sufficient answer to such suits to show that he has applied the money as the law would apply it. If he has not,- he is liable upon his official bond. That a sheriff may, in the absence of any notice or rule to pay the money into court, apply it to the liens, is well settled. He does so, however, upon his own responsibility, and is responsible on his official bond for any mistakes. The rule is correctly stated in Mather <em>v. </em>McMichael, 1 Harris 302. “ He (the sheriff) may, if he will, pay the money into court according to the command of his writ, and where ignorance or doubt exists, or controversy is threatened, his safety lies in this course. Because of the expense and delay attendant upon it, this ought not to be done where the officer sees his way clear; yet, if he choose to undertake distribution, it is, unquestionably, on his own responsibility.” We need not multiply authorities upon so plain a proposition. When parties are not satisfied for the sheriff to make distribution, they can always prevent it by a proper application to the court in seasonable time. But it comes too late when made long after the return-day of the writ, and after the sheriff has, in good faith, appliéd the money to the liens.</p>

An examination of the return in this case, shows that it was not, and could not properly have been made under this act. William Weightman, the mortgage-creditor, to whose mortgage the fund was applied, bought a number of tracts of unseated land, and paid the money therefor to the sheriff. The remaining properties, and by far the most valuable, were purchased by R. J. C. Walker, J. W. Maynard and others. This position was practically abandoned upon the argument.</p>
