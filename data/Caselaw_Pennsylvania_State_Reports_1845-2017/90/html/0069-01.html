Flagg &amp; Co., of $146.05, the personal property of the company was sold, and the proceeds are now in the hands of the sheriff. On the affidavit of Charles Downing and Edward Downing, a rule was granted by the court to show cause why the judgments of Hopkins, Johnson (trustee), and Sharpless, on which executions had been issued, should not be opened, and the defendant let into a defence; and on the hearing of this rule, the master was appointed to hear the case, and report distribution of the moneys in the hands of the sheriff. After the hearing had proceeded to the completion of the taking of the evidence, a question arose as to the powers of the master. The decree of the court appointing the master had never been certified to him, and was lost or mislaid. Whether it had ever been filed does not appear. The master adjourned the further hearing of the case to allow a motion to be made to the court for a decree. Nothing, however, has been certified to the master, and he will proceed to determine the) matter, and make distribution according to his understanding <em>o\ </em>his powers and duties, as gathered from the conduct of the case before him.</p>

It embodies, however, substantially what the master conceives to be his duty; to consider the proceeding as in equity, on bill and answer, founded upon the statement of plaintiff’s claims, and affidavits of the Messrs. Downing.</p>

This is objected to, and after examination the master is satisfied it should not be allowed. The affairs of the company, except the furnishing of money, were almost exclusively carried on by the president of the company, who was, so far as its management was concerned, the company, and the services rendered by Dr. Hopkins as secretary and treasurer were comparatively small. It appears that at a meeting of the directors, held May 13th 1875, the salaries of the president and secretary were fixed at $80 per month, dating from February 1st 1874. This, however, was at the end of the year for which the services were charged, and in view of the condition of the company at that time, should not be allowed. The master finds, however, that no fraud was intended in giving the note for $4000, and he therefore finds the, amount due to Dr. Hopkins, as already stated, to be $3000, and interest from the corrected date of the note.</p>

It is claimed, on behalf of the first execution-creditors, Dr. E. Hopkins, William C. Johnson, trustee, and J. C. Sharpless, that they are entitled to the money in court, so far as it will extend to pay their respective executions. On the behalf of Charles Downing, a subsequent execution-creditor, it is contended that the first executions should be set aside and the moneys awarded to him. It will be observed that Hopkins, Johnson and Downing were all directors of the company during nearly the whole of the period of its active existepce, and that they were all stockholders. In view of the facts that Hopkins and Johnson were officers, the one president, and the other secretary and treasurer, when the suits were brought on the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>notes held by them respectively; that service of the writs óf summons was made on Hopkins, as secretary and treasurer, and judgment taken by default, and that they were stockholders, the master is of the opinion that they are not entitled to a preference by reason of their executions. Neither is Charles Downing entitled to a preference by reason of his execution. His judgment was entered on a judgment bond given by William C. Johnson, president of the company, without any authority from the board of directors, and not for any debt due or owing to him by the company, but it was a sale by him to the company, of the mortgage he had received from Hopkins, and the bond in question given therefor. The mortgage was, however, afterwards sold by the president of the company for $3400, and the proceeds went to the credit of the company; and this would create the company a debtor of Charles Downing, independently of the bond. Mr. Downing was also a director during ■the period when the active operations of the company were carried on, and its debts contracted, and also a stockholder, and stands in the same position, so far as any preference is concerned, as Johnson and Hopkins.</p>

The whole proceeding, however, shows a scramble between Hopkins and Johnson, on the one hand, and Downing on the other — all stockholders, and virtually the owners of the company —to obtain a preference over each other in the collection or payment of the amounts due them.</p>

    <p id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.9",76,[176,1454,1170,860]]]'>This contention is for a fund raised by sheriff’s sale of personal estate of the Chester Valley Wheel and Axle Company, an insolvent corporation. The appellants and one Sharpless were the sole directors of the company, at the time the judgments were obtained, on which the executions issued. Johnson was also the president, and Hopkins the secretary and treasurer. ..The notes on which the judgments were procured were signed and attested by the appellants in their respective oflicial capacity, and given to each of said three directors. The master has found as a fact “ that when these notes were given, and proceedings instituted thereon, the company was insolvent. It was embarrassed and unable to continue its operations, unless more capital or other means was secured.” The insolvency was manifestly known to the appellants, and the notes given to each of them undoubtedly with a view of giving a preference over other creditors; yet, as they were given for an existing indebtedness, the master found <em>“ </em>there was no intention to collude and commit actual fraud;” nevertheless, he was “of the opinion, that the proceedings of Hopkins and Johnson, acting together as •before stated, were, under the circumstances and in the insolvent condition of the company, a fraud in law on the other creditors.”'</p>

But defects which <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>might otherwise have proved fatal to the whole proceeding, were cured by agreement of parties, including the appellants. They agreed that the question, -whether their respective judgments were obtained in fraud of the creditors of the company, should be referred to a master and examiner named, with like effect as if tried by a jury, and that he should make distribution of the money as upon a bill in equity, filed by Downing, a creditor of the company, against the appellants, charging them with fraud, and with holding the money in trust for the creditors and stockholders of the company. By this agreement, signed by the appellants and certain creditors of the company, the court acquired jurisdiction of the proceeding. Although irregular in form, the parties agreed to treat it as a bill in equity. The court having entertained it as such, it became subject to amendment, like other bills, so far as to add the names of other creditors, in furtherance of the specific object of the bill. We therefore discover no error in the court having permitted an amendment, adding the names of other creditors; more especially as the claims of those creditors had, apparently -without objection, actually been considered by the master. Under all the circumstances, the amendment was in time.</p>
    <p id="b77-6" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[116,1217,1169,175]]]'>The master reported that the money should be distributed among all the creditors, giving no preference to any of the execution-creditors. The court below confirmed the report, and decreed accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b77-7" data-blocks='[["BL_77.5",77,[110,1389,1172,824]]]'>As a general rule, it may be conceded that between creditors claiming a fund raised by sheriff’s sale, only those who are parties to the record, and have a lien on the property, can be heard. In the distribution of the personal estate of an insolvent corporation, a different rule prevails. Prior to the Act of 7th April 1870, Purd. Dig. 291, pi. 52, the remedy to enforce execution against a corporation was by sequestration. That remedy was superseded by this act: Philadelphia and Baltimore Central Railroad Co.’s Appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 355; Bayard’s Appeal, 22 <a href="/citations/?q=37%20N.Y.%20319" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="37 N.Y. 319">Id. 453</a>. Although the act authorized the personal property and franchises of a corporation to be sold on a fieri facias, yet it did not intend that the whole property of an insolvent corporation should be for the sole use and benefit of the plaintiff in the execution. The levy on property of such a corporation does not give a preferred lien on the property thus seized. The proceeds are to be distributed among all the creditors, as in case of insolvency: <a href="/citations/?q=37%20N.Y.%20319" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="37 N.Y. 319">Id.</a> It follow’s, therefore, notwithstanding the anomalous proceeding, yet aided by the agreement of the parties, substantial justice has been done, and the decree ought not to be disturbed.</p>
