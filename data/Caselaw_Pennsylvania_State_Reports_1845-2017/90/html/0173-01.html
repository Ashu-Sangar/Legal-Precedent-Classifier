There were certain liens upon the property. The sale was for cash, but for the conyenience of the parties new judgment bonds were given by the purchaser to these lien creditors, for the amount of their respective claims. Each of the judgment bonds thus given contained a recital that they were for the purchase-money of the property sold. A certain amount remained charged on the land, and another judgment was given to the guardian of the minor children of the decedent to secure their interest. The purchaser made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and upon a sale of the real estate by the assignee, claimed his exemption of §300 out of the proceeds, which the court allowed. <em>Held, </em>that this was error.</p>

J., inter alia, said: “Are these judgments, judgments for purchase-money ? What constitutes a judgment for purchase-money under our statute? In Nottes’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20362" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Wright 362">9 Wright 362</a>, Woodward, J., says: ‘Liens for purchase-money may be by mortgage, judgment, or by executory articles of bargain and sale, but they are always created in favor of vendors, and exist for their protection and benefit, or that of their assignees or other legal representatives. The possessors of such liens are a well-defined class of creditors. They are those who have parted with their lands in consideration of the price agreed to be paid. The sound principle (said he), was, however, asserted in Stansall <em>v. </em>Robert, 13 Ohio R. 148, that a third person advancing money to the purchaser of real estate cannot claim a vendor’s lien.’ It is argued that this decision is overruled by, or in conflict with the later decision in Ulrich’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20489" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="12 Wright 489">12 Wright 489</a>. We do not so understand it. * * * In the case before us the administratrix of the estate of Andrew Stewart, deceased, under and by virtue of an order of the Orphans’ Court, was the vendor of the real estate. Henry Andrews was the purchaser. • These judgment-creditors cannot claim, in the character of vendors, they never had any interest in or title to the property sold. They are, therefore, the loan-creditors of Henry Andrews, and nothing more; their liens are the liens of third parties loaning Henry Andrews money, to pay for real estate purchased by him from the administratrix of the estate of Andrew Stewart, deceased. And the fact that they have called the money loaned, in each bond, the purchase-money of a house and lot therein designated, to which they never had title, never sold or conveyed, does not make it so. Said judgments, in our opinion, not being liens for the purchase-money of real estate, do not prevent or preclude Henry Andrews, the assignor, from claiming and receiving out of the funds, in the hands of the <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>assignee, the sum of $180, the balance of the $300 reserved by him in his assignment.</p>

We have only to consider it as between the parties. The judgment is clearly a part of the consideration Andrews was to pay for the real estate. The administratrix sold' the latter in pursuance of an order of the Orphans’ Court, for the sum of $3800. There were certain liens upon the property; one in favor of Abram Denlinger for $1500, and one in favor of Catharine Stewart for $450. The sale was for cash, but for the convenience of the parties, new judgments were given by the purchaser to Denlinger and Catharine Stewart for the amount of their respective claims; $343.51 remained charged upon the land for the benefit of the widow, and the judgment of $687.02 was given to the appellant as guardian of the minor children to secure their interest. Andrews, the purchaser, having made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, claimed, and was allowed $120' exemption out of his personal estate, and now demands the balance of the exemption, $180, out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. To allow it would reduce the fund applicable to the plaintiff’s judgment by a corresponding amount.</p>
    <p id="b177-6" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[112,1138,1168,820]]]'>That there is no equity in his claim is manifest. He has not paid for the property out of which he claims the exemption, and he seeks to get it from the parties to whom the purchase-money belongs, to wit, the minor children of Andrew Stewart, deceased, the intestate, whose property was sold and purchased by Andrews. There is no exemption as to purchase-money creditors, the proviso expressly excepting such debts from the operation of the enacting clause of the statute: Nottes’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Wright 361">9 Wright 361</a>; Ulrich’s Appeal, 12 <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Wright 361">Id. 489</a>. The appellee contends, however, that the appellant’s judgment was not for purchase-money. In this he is flatly contradicted by his own bond, which contains this clause: “The same being for purchase-money on house and lot of ground, southwest corner of West Orange and Mulberry streets, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.” While it may be that in a contest between lien-creditors, this statement in the bond might not amount to much,‘yet, as between the parties it is important. As to them, it is an agreement that the judgment shall have the force and effect of a purchase-money lien. We are of opinion that it amounts to an estoppel, and that the application of this principle meets the justice of the case.</p>
