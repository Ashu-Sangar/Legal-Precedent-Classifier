A survey was made May 17th 1793, as containing two hundred and sixteen acres and allowance, calling for an ash as the south-east corner, twenty-one perches east of Hammond’s run, by the plot; thence north eighteen east to white oak one hundred and five (by the figure or draft the course is plotted about north eighteen west)-; thence north forty-five east one hundred and eighteen perches to white oak at intersection of top line crossing Main run and branch, plotted as thirty perches in length, but by measurement on the ground and scale of draft forty-four perches long. The survey, as made on the ground, and as called for in the patent granted April 17th 1794, to Jennet Hepburn, intermarried with Matthew Wilson, is for a course north eighteen east from an ash corner. Jennet Wilson and Matthew Wilson died intestate, leaving five heirs, one of whom, Mary, intermarried with Manning Stevenson. By articles of agreement and deed, the one undivided fifth part of the Jennet Hepburn survey was sold to Samuel Titus, one of the defendants, who took possession of the same, May first 1827, cutting timber up to the line as claimed by defendants, the same year.</p>

Wallis, including Hagerman’s run, in Washington township, one mile south of the Susquehanna river; surveyed May 8th 1794, containing two hundred and four acres. On January 24th 1828, the warrant was sold for taxes by the treasurer of Lycoming •county, to John Yanderbelt, William Harris, Peter Vanderbelt, and Charles Low, -who, with William Wilson, a surveyor and congressman (not related to the William Wilson who was one of the heirs of Jennet Hepburn Wilson), petitioned the board of property for a resurvey of the Jean Brady, alleging it interfered with the Jennet Hepburn survey and others. December 30th 1828, a resurvey was ordered, providing it does not interfere with others, &amp;c. August 27th 1830, a resurvey was made, returned and patented to William Harris, John Yanderbelt', Peter Yanderbelt and Charles Low. This resurvey crosses the south-east corner of the Jennet Hepburn, by giving it its official courses and distances, by twenty-one and three-tenths perches at the south line of the Jennet Hepburn, including Hammond’s run as part of the Jean Brady survey, which ran from the white oak witness at the north-east corner of the Jennet Hepburn tract, and does not close at the ash corner and pine witness at the south-east corner of the Jennet Hepburn survey. The survey as claimed by these plaintiffs in the writ docs not cross Hammond’s run by dropping eight perches on each of the two lines — the south forty-eight west one hundred and ten line (a reverse of north forty-five east one hundred and eighteen) from the upper white oak, thence south twenty-one west ninety-seven and two-tenths'(a reverse of north eighteen east one hundred and five), coming within five or seven feet of the run to a post. The ash corner is shown by the scale on the plot and measurement to be from seventeen to twenty perches eastward from the run. In the year 1832, the owners of the Jennet Hepburn survey amicably divided the Jennet Hepburn survey, leaving the strip of land interfered with by the Jean Brady resurvey undivided, with an agreement among themselves, that whoever of them contended for the same should have the other heirs’ interests therein, as the same belonged to their survey..</p>

If Bill-man were an assignor within the sense of the statute, as to matters which occurred in his lifetime, the competency of Titus to testify would be determined by rules that existed before its enactment. Where the subject of the action is a contract, it is obvious that a deceased party thereto, whose rights have passed to one of the parties in the action, is an assignor in the intendment of the proviso,, as clearly so as if the suit were by or against an executor. Then it is easily seen that the case is within the true spirit of the proviso which has been said “ to be that where a party to a thing or contract in action is dead, and his rights have passed, either by his. own act or that of the law, to another, who represents his interest in the subject of controversy, the surviving party to that subject shall not testify to matters occurring in the lifetime of the adverse party, whose lips are now closed:” Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, 16 P. F. Smith 297. But when the subject of litigation is real estate, it often seems difficult to decide if the act applies; yet the spirit and reason of the law will as surely guide as if the subject were a contract. A grantor of the title on one side may be dead; if he had no transaction or communication of any kind with the adverse party, or one under whom he claims, he is not an assignor in the meaning of the statute. Where there was no privity between the deceased assignor and the opposing party, as a general rule the act •applies. The converse is equally true, if nothing occurred in the lifetime of the deceased between him and the survivor, the case is unlike one where the subject is a contract. The decisions accord with the rule stated. In Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, supra, the pivotal question was the validity of a lease, which Parker, one of the defendants, had given to James P. Tanner, whose title after his decease had become vested in the plaintiff. So in Arthurs <em>v. </em>King, 3 Norris 525, each parity claimed the land under Zimmerman; Arthurs by deed from Zimmerman’s executor; King under a deed executed by Zimmerman in his lifetime to Baseom, in pursuance of a parol contract with Boyer, as alleged. Held that Boyer and Baseom were incompetent to prove the contract and delivery of the deed. The privity between the decedent and adverse survivor, in each of these cases, is manifest. In the latter, Sterrett, J., said: “ In construing the act, it has been held that where one of two parties to a transaction is dead, the survivor and the party representing the deceased stand on an unequal footing as to the knowledge of the transaction occurring in the lifetime of the deceased. The proviso was intended to exclude parties to the transaction from being witnesses in regard to it when the opposite party is dead and his rights have become vested in others, by his own act or by ope<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>ration of law.” Craig <em>v. </em>Brendel, 19 P. F. Smith 153, decided in less than a year after Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, illustrates the principle where privity was not an element. Craig purchased the land at sheriff’s sale as the property of Brendel, brought ejectment, died, and his devisees were substituted. Brendel never claimed title; it was in his wife; and he was held a competent witness. After referring to Karns <em>v. </em>Tanner, Agnew, J., said: “It will be observed that there Parker and Tanner stood in the relation of opposing parties to the same, matter or contract of lease, and also in relation to the thing itself which was the subject of their contract or lease.” “But the present case is essentially different. While it may be considered as true that John Craig, the devisor of the plaintiffs, is their assignor in law, according to Karns <em>n. </em>Tanner, yet Frederick L. Brendel, the defendant here, who was offered as the witness, does'not stand p.s the party opposite to them in the thing or transaction which is the subject of the controversy in this suit.” We need not note the remarks in effect that Brendel was competent and his wife not; the gist of the reason for Brendel’s competency was absence of privity of any transaction between him and John Craig relative to the land in controversy. He was not called to testify to anything that had occurred between him and Craig, and could not have been, for nothing had passed between them.</p>

There is no semblance of contract relation. Nor are their respective titles links of the same chain. Before Billman had an interest in the Brady tract, while he lived, and since his death, Titus claimed the land in suit as part of the Hepburn warrant. The plaintiffs, holding under Billman and others, demand nothing beyond the Brady survey. Aside from location of the original tract line, Titus sets up title under the Statute of Limitations, the very nature of which excludes its derivation from Billman. There was no proposal to prove by Titus anything that Billman ever said or did, and plaintiffs point to nothing tending to show that there ever was any communication between them respecting the land. If the survivor is incompetent, where will competency begin when some grantor in the chain of title of the opposing party is dead ? Can it be that if one party derives title through or under a deceased grantor, however remote, neither can be a witness ? Proximity or remoteness of the deceased grantor is of no consequence, for the true inquiry is, has death sealed the lips of one party to a <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>..transaction of which both had knowledge ?
