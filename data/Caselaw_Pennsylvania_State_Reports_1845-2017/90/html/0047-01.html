The drawings of plans and specifications of itself, is not ‘ work’ within the meaning of the statute; not work in the ordinary sense of the term. An architect is not a mechanic or laborer. The plaintiff here has no better claim to a lien than the scrivener who copies specifications or draws contracts for the building or the surveyor who draws the plan upon the ground. Judgment must, therefore, be entered for the defendant.”</p>

In Bank <em>v. </em>Gries, 11 Casey 423, the architect was employed not <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>only to make plans and specifications for the building, but to direct and oversee its erection in accordance therewith. His claim, therefore, was for work done about the erection of the building within the words of the law. The mere drawing of the plan and writing' out the specifications is no more of this character than would be the work of an attorney in preparing the contract.</p>
