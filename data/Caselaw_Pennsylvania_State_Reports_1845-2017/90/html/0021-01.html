Under this power in the constitution, the legislature, by general law, Act of May 14th 1874, P.

All that the constitution requires is, that the <em>object </em>of the institution shall be a <em>purely </em>public charity. It may be founded, endowed and maintained by private charity; that is to say, by private benevolence, good-will, liberality and alms-giving. Most public charities are so endowed: 2 Kent 274. The only question, therefore, to be now decided is, whether the institution of which the defendants are the trustees is a <em>‘purely </em>public charity;’ if it is, then the plaintiffs admit it to be exempt from taxation, but if not, the judgment must be for’ the plaintiffs upon the case stated.</p>

They mostly relate to the distinction between public and private corporations; but it is quite clear that a charitable corporation may be strictly a private one, yet the charities it dispenses may be purely public. The question in this case is not, whether the Burd Orphan Asylum of St. Stephen’s Church is a public or private corporation, but whether the charity the cor<a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>poration dispenses is of <em>a, purely </em>public nature. This depends upon the extensiveness of the objects of the institution. A college or a hospital founded by a public benefactor, which extends its benefits to the people of any municipal division of the public, no matter how small its territorial limits may be, is a public charity; thus a hospital for the use of the people of a particular parish, though a private corporation, is nevertheless a public charity. Every charity which is extensive in its object may, in a certain sense, be called a public charity: Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Pearce, 2 Atk. 88.</p>

It may be for the poor, the blind, for widows, or for orphans of a parish or township, or of a city, county, state or government. Our constitution requires that the charity shall not only be of a public nature, <em>bnipurely </em>of a public one. A charity, therefore, restricted to a particular religious denomination, or to persons baptised in a certain faith, is not a <em>purely </em>public charity, no matter how extensive its object may be among the persons of the religious faith to whom it is restricted. When the people of Pennsylvania adopted the present constitution, they saw proper to restrict the charities, which were to be exempt from taxation, to <em>purely </em>public ones. As before stated, they did not mean those only which might be founded or endowed by the public, but they required that the <em>objects </em>should be public, and they inserted the adverb <em>purely </em>before the word <em>public </em>for some purpose. We have no authority to strike it out. The word in its ordinary meaning signifies: without any mixture of that which is foreign; without connection with, or dependence upon, anything else; absolutely, entirely. If the charity depends upon a religious test, or is restricted to a particular sect, or if the preference is to be given to persons baptised in a certain faith, in such a manner as probably to absorb the entire benefit of the founder’s bounty, it is not <em>a, purely </em>public charity.- By applying these principles to the institution in question, we can easily ascertain whether it is such a <em>purely </em>public charity as is contemplated by the constitution and Act of Assembly, as above cited.</p>

It is to be taken for granted that the institution is limited in its capacity. It would most likely be filled by orphans who have been baptised in the Protestant Episcopal Church in the city of Philadelphia. If any. room remains the orphans, so baptised, throughout the whole state of Pennsylvania, are to be next provided for, and if there is still accommodation for more, then the daughters of Episcopal clergymen throughout the world are to be received before the children of the general public of the city of Philadelphia, or any other place, can enter it.

It was there said, “ The essential feature of a public use is that it is not confined to privileged individuals, but is open to the indefinite public. It is this <em>indefinite </em>or unrestricted quality that gives it its public character. The smallest street in the smallest village is a public • highway of the Commonwealth, and none the less so because a vast majority of the citizens will certainly never derive any benefit from its use. It is enough that they may do so if they choose. So there is no charity conceivable which will not, in its practical operation, exclude a large part of mankind, and there are few which do not do so in express terms, or by the restrictive force of the description of the persons for whose benefit they are intended. Thus, Girard College excludes by a single word, half the public, by requiring that only <em>male </em>children shall be received; the great Pennsylvania Hospital closes its gates to all but <em>recent </em>injuries, yet no one questions that they are public charities in the widest and most exacting <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>sense. * * * Next, and last, we have to consider the force to he given to the word ‘ purely’ in the constitutional phrase, ‘ purely public charity.’ In this connection, and in its ordinary sense, the word purely means completely, entirely, unqualifiedly, and this is the meaning we. must presume the people to have intended in adopting it in their constitution.” Per Mitchell, J., in C. P.</p>
    <p id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[95,616,1169,517]]]'>From the foregoing, it is at once seen that a public use, whether for all men or a class, is one not confined to privileged persons. The smallest street is public, for all have an equal right to travel on it; but a way used by thousands, which may be shut against a stranger, is private. Would Girard College be a public charity if the male children entitled to admission were limited to sons of deceased Masons or Odd Fellows ? If Pennsylvania Hospital closed its gates to all hut Methodists or Baptists, having recent injuries, the people would not believe it a purely public charity in the intendment of their constitution. A charity for the poor of a parish or township is public; but not, if confined to poor Presbyterians in the municipality.</p>

To open its doors only to the blind of a particular religious denomination, or of a beneficial association, or of a. political party, shuts them against the public. A known and recognised class, though not generally poor, or diseased or decrepit, may be the subject of a public charity, as sailors; yet if the endowment were limited in its benefits to sailors who are members of a designated sect, there could hardly be two opinions of its character.</p>

This court has frequently ruled that the whole power of taxation is one of the exclusive functions of the legislative department of the government. The legislature has said that this class of property shall not be taxed, and that declaration must prevail, unless it is an unlawful exercise of legislative power.

And if such a charity should be limited to the white female orphan children of such persons between the ages of four and eight years, such limitations, though they would very greatly restrict the class and the number of the beneficiaries, would constitute no valid objection to the purely public character of the charity. But seamen and stone masons are only designated classes of persons distinguished by their occupations. A charity for the support of poor widows, or indigent old men, or the insane poor, of a city, county, borough or township would be equally a purely public char ity, no matter how small would be the number of the beneficiaries or how limited the class.</p>
    <p id="b35-6" data-blocks='[["BL_35.4",35,[131,926,1167,1366]]]'>Why, then, would not a charity for the support of poor Episcopalians, Catholics, Jews or Presbyterians of a state or city, be purely public; or a charity for the education and maintenance of the orphan children of such persons ? No private gain or profit is subserved; the objects of such a charity are certain and definite, and the persons benefited are indefinite within the specified class. The circumstance that the beneficiaries are to be of a particular religious faith is only of importance as designating the class. It indicates a certain portion of the whole community who are to be recipients of the charity. It has the same effect in this respect as the words seamen, stone masons, blind persons, poor widows, &amp;c., in the cases already mentioned. For the purpose of defining the class of persons, who, as distinguished from all other persons in the community, are to enjoy the benefit of the donor’s bounty, the legal effect is the same, whether the words used be seamen, Episcopalians, blind persons, Catholics, poor widows,-Jews, stone masons or Presbyterians. The argument that to sustain, as purely public, a charity in favor of persons of a particular religious faith, would be to maintain sectarianism, is of no weight. It is not discrimination in favor of a sect, for it is treating all sects alike. It is not even extending a preference to sectarians; it is merely recognising them as a class of persons. We see no reason why that community which ranges persons into classes, so far as this subject is concerned, may not be a community of religious faith, as well as of occupation, condition in life, sex, color, age, disability, physical or mental, or nationality. As to the meaning of the word “purely,” when used in this connection, we concur in the construction which was given by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the case of Gerke <em>v. </em>Purcell, <a href="/ohio-st/25/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="25 Ohio St. 229" data-case-ids="44879" data-case-paths="/ohio-st/25/0229-01">25 Ohio St. Rep. 229</a>, that, “ when the charity is public, the exclusion of all idea of private gain or profit is equivalent in effect to the force of ‘purely,’ as applied to public charity in the constitution.”</p>
    <p id="b35-7" data-blocks='[["BL_35.5",35,[131,2303,1166,85]],["BL_36.1",36,[223,362,1163,388]]]'>But there is another and a broader ground upon which this particular charity must be sustained as purely public. It is this: the <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>third class of persons enumerated in the will of the testatrix as the objects of her bounty are, “all other white female orphan children of legitimate birth, not less than four years of age, and of not more than eight years, without respect to any other description or qualification whatever, except that at all times and in every case the orphan children of clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church shall have the preference.” It will of course not be disputed that if this were the only class of beneficiaries mentioned in the will, the charity would be purely public in the strictest sense.</p>
    <p id="b36-5" data-blocks='[["BL_36.4",36,[225,749,1164,946]]]'>Does the circumstance that two other classes .are first named take away that character, and if so, how? The learned judge of the court below stated and answered this question by saying that “ the exclusion of the general public is so great as to amount to almost absolute rejection.” This position makes the <em>legal </em>character of the charity to depend upon a question of fact. The argument <em>assumes, </em>for the purpose of testing the quality of the charity as being “ purely public,” that the orphan children of the general public cannot be admitted (because they are in point of fact excluded by the numbers of the persons to be admitted) in the first and second classes. Now in legal contemplation the persons of the third class are beneficiaries upon the same title, and with the same abstract rights as those of the first and second. In any case of application for admission by one of the third class, it would be no answer to say that there were other orphan children? in the city or state who were of the Episcopal baptism, and had the other qualifications, and therefore the applicant could not be admitted. If there were actual vacancies in the asylum for more pupils, and no applications from persons of the first or second class, undoubtedly the applicant would be entitled to admission. And further, when once admitted such pupils would not be liable to be ejected in order to make room for subsequent applicants of the first or second class.</p>
    <p id="b36-6" data-blocks='[["BL_36.5",36,[229,1693,1163,387]]]'>In other words, in such a case the only adequate reply that could be made to an applicant of the third class would be, that <em>at the time of the application </em>the asylum was already full. But that reply would be good in any case of a purely public charity. Hence, the only barrier to admission would be one that is common to all the classes and peculiar to none. How then can it be said that it is not a purely public charity because it is not open to the general public ? In law it <em>is </em>open to them, and hence, by a court defining its legal meaning, it must be held to be purely public. .</p>
    <p id="b36-7" data-blocks='[["BL_36.6",36,[230,2078,1165,300]],["BL_37.1",37,[132,348,1167,260]]]'>But it is said that the children of the general public will be in point of fact excluded, because the preferred classes will always exhaust the physical capacity of the charity. How do we know this, or what right have we to assume it? We certainly cannot assume it as a matter of law, for it is a pure matter of fact; and we cannot adopt it as a fact, because there is no evidence in support of it on this record. This cause comes before us on a case stated, and <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>we are confined to the facts there set forth. Nothing of this kind is there alleged, and we have no right to infer it. The only assertion in the ease stated that relates to this subject implies the very reverse of this allegation, because it states that “ children have been received without regard as to their residence as to either state or county.”</p>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[122,608,1172,1769]],["BL_38.1",38,[208,357,1163,132]]]'>If it were proper to dispose of the question by considering the probabilities as to the facts, we think they favor the theory that the children of the third class would have free admission to the asylum. The limitations are so sweeping and numerous that they reduce the preferred beneficiaries to an extremely small class. They must be of Episcopal baptism, which, at once, makes an immense reduction in the possible applicants. Further, they are to be white <em>females </em>and orphans, and between the ages <em>oí four and eight years. </em>Each one of these qualifications diminishes enormously the number of those who are preferred. There are probably many Episcopal congregations in which there is not a single child coming within all these limitations. Moreover, there are other extensive limitations, not fixed by the will, but which would be practically operative. All female orphan children who have means or friends to provide for them, would as a general rule abstain- from entering a charity school, especially one from which they are to be placed out at some employment. Outside of Philadelphia and a few neighboring counties this charity would be but little known, and this want of knowledge would increase with increasing distance. It must be considered, therefore, that orphan children whose nearest relatives are ignorant of the charity, and those who are unwilling to receive its benefits should be excluded from the computation. We can hence readily see how extremely small in number must be the preferred classes of beneficiaries likely to seek admission to this charity. We are not informed as to how many children can be accommodated, but it is not less than sixty, as that number are now provided for. The case stated, says: “A large amount of property” was given by the testatrix to establish the asylum, and that a tract of forty-five acres was purchased upon which the buildings were erected. If there is money enough there is certainly ground enough upon which to maintain a much larger number than sixty. In any event it is apparent that we are not at liberty to conclude, either as matter of fact or law, that the capacity of this charity is or will be exhausted by the reception of such applicants of the first and second classes as may desire to avail themselves of its benefits. As to .the exception in favor of the children of Protestant Episcopal clergymen, all who would be at all likely to seek admission, are already included in the first and second classes. As to those living out of the state, we are not informed whether any such have ever sought admission, but the probable number would be so very small as not to affect the result. We are of <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>opinion that the appellant is a purely public charity within the constitutional provision, and is within the letter of the Act of 14th May 1874, and therefore exempt from taxation.</p>
