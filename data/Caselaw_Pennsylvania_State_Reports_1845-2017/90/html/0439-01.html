Laporte for the use of Huston Hepburn, now for the use of R. B. Claxton and Crecy Claxton, his wife, in right of said wife, against Jacob Gamble. On the 16th day of May 1867, Huston Hepburn and C. M. Laporte sold to Jacob Gamble several tracts of timber-land and a saw-mill. They executed and delivered a deed to Gamble, and he gave them a mortgage to secure the purchase-money, and entered into possession of the premises. He paid all of the bonds secured by the mortgage, except the last, one of $500. Laporte assigned his interest in this last bond to Hepburn, on the 16th day of June 1871. Hepburn assigned his interest to Crecy Claxton. On the refusal of Gamble to pay the bond a scire facias was issued upon the mortgage, in the names of Huston Hepburn and C. M. Laporte, for the use of Crecy Claxton. Mrs.' Claxton having died after suit was commenced, her administrator was substituted. The court rejected Gamble as a witness, on the ground that he was the defendant, and was not rendered competent by the Act of 1869. The defendant then called Laporte, one of the plaintiffs, who was also excluded by the court. The verdict was for plaintiffs, when defendant took this writ and, inter alia, assigned for error the rejection of the witnesses as above set forth.</p>

Hepburn and Laporte were the legal plaintiffs, and the offer was to prove their acts and declarations while they were the holders of the bond. They are both living, and are both competent witnesses; both could have been called to contradict Gamble. What principle, therefore, would be violated by permitting Gamble to be sworn, and who would be injured ?

There might be force in these objections if Laporte had offered himself as a witness, but he was called by the defendant, and the Act of 1865 and the Act of 1869 clearly permitted this to be done.</p>

The scire facias was issued in the name of the mortgagees, Hepburn and Laporte, to the use of Crecy Claxton, assignee of the last bond secured by the mortgage. She subsequently died, arid her administrator was substituted on the record as equitable plaintiff. In this form the case came to trial. Under the proviso to the Act of 1869, the defendant was incompetent to testify, in his own behalf, to anything that <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>occurred prior to the death of Mrs. Claxton. His status, in this regard, was the same as though the act had never been passed. The competency imparted in general terms by the enacting clause of the first section to persons theretofore excluded on the ground of interest or policy of law, is limited by the proviso, which declares, among other things, that the act shall not apply to actions by or against executors, administrators or guardians. The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error contended, however, that inasmuch as the legal plaintiffs were both living and could be called to rebut his testimony, the defendant was competent to prove their acts and declarations while they were holders of the bonds, and that the equitable plaintiff had no right to complain because his intestate took the bond subject to all the equities between the original parties. So far as the legal plaintiffs are concerned, the soundness of this position might perhaps be conceded, but as to the equitable plaintiff, it assumes what may not be the fact, that the bond in the hands of Mrs. Claxton was subject to all the equities existing between the original parties. Before taking the assignment, it was her duty to inquire whether the obligor had any defence, and we have no right to assume that she neglected to do so. If she were living, and could testify that, upon inquiry, he informed her that he had no set-off or defence, the previous acts and declarations of the obligees would be of no avail. In this position of affairs, it is obvious that the living defendant would have an undue advantage over the personal representative of the deceased equitable plaintiff, that was never intended to be accorded to any party in interest. This principle has been recently ruled in a case not yet reported. But it is unnecessary to go beyond/ the act itself in search of a valid objection to the competency of the defendant in a case like the present. He is expressly excluded by the words of the act, and as was said in Taylor <em>v. </em>Kelly, 30 P. F. Smith 95, “ a true enforcement of the statute requires us to hold that it means what it says, when it declares, <em>‘ </em>this act shall not apply to actions by or against executors, administrators or guardians.’ ” Under the Act of'April 3870, he would have been competent to testify to matters occurring since the death of Mrs. Claxton, and affecting the right of her administrator to recover, but he was not called for that purpose.</p>

These enactments are just as clear and explicit in regard to the right of either party to call his adversary, as is the first section of the latter act in regard <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>to excluding a party, in a suit by or against an executor, administrator or guardian, from testifying in his own behalf.</p>
