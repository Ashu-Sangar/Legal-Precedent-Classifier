'and, secondly, if taxable* at what amount should that tax be rated ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-10" data-blocks='[["BL_308.8",308,[183,1627,1170,777]],["BL_309.1",309,[131,350,1174,915]]]'>“ The statute, after enumerating various other companies, speaks of ‘transportation companies,’ ‘and every other company now or hereafter incorporated by or under any law of this Commonwealth,’ and. after providing for other companies incorporated by other states, doing business here, goes on to say, ‘or device for the transportation of freight or passengers, or in any way engaged in the transportation of freight or passsengers, shall be subject to and pay a tax into the treasury of the Commonwealth annually, at the rate of nine-tenths of one mill upon its capital stock for each one per cent, of dividend made or declared by such company.’ It is conceded in the argument, that the principal, and, probably, all of the business of this company, is in flowing petroleum or oil from place to place, mentioned in the charter of incorporation, by means of pipes, through which the oil or petroleum flows, or is pumped, and is thus moved by flowing or pumping, according to the character of the grade from the oil wells to the place of manufacture, and, probably, the prepared oil from thence to the points on the railroad for shipment. It is contended that this moving of petroleum, by <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>means of pipes, is not ‘transporting,’ and, therefore, that this is not a transportation company. The defendant’s counsel contends, that to transport is ‘to carry,’ and that this transit company does not carry, but the petroleum flows — we consider this too narrow a construction. If we look into the dictionary for the meaning of the word ‘transport,’ Webster defines it, ‘ to carry or convey from one place to another,’ again, ‘ to remove from one place to another,’ and throughout all of the derivations from the word transport we find the same part of the definition ‘ to remove; ’ as transported is, inter alia, defined ‘removed.’ This petroleum is certainly removed. To look into the origin of the word, composed of <em>trans, </em>‘ over,’ ‘from one place to another,’ and <em>portus, </em>‘moving or carrying,’ and <em>portatus, </em>‘ bearing or bringing,’ is going into too much refinement, but such was the character of the argument. We must construe wmrds, not according to their original etymology, but by the common parlance'of the country. In the present case, we have a much better guide — the words of the charter of incorporation, the third section of whibh authorizes the company to transport petroleum, and, for that purpose, to lay down pipes from the points named, and for the purpose of transportation of petroleum, oil, &amp;c., may lay down pipes or tubing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[137,1266,1168,387]]]'>“ Again, the fourth section gives like authority: to lay down pipes or tubing to supply the refinery with oil. Again, in the Act of March 12th 1872, P. L. 23, we find similar language used in regard to the transportation of petroleum in certain counties ; they are authorized to lay down pipes, tubing, &amp;c., to transport petroleum. This being the general language used by the legislature in regard to the removal of petroleum from place to place, by means of pipes, why shall we not believe that the same was meant when the tax is laid on all transportation companies ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[137,1654,1168,305]]]'>“Again, this 4th section of the Act of 1874, in speaking of the companies to be taxed, also says, after enumerating certain kinds of companies, ‘ or device for the transportation of freight or passengers, or in any way engaged in the transportation of freight or passengers.’ Under this language we cannot doubt that this is a company engaged in the transportation of freight, within the Act of Assembly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-8" data-blocks='[["BL_309.6",309,[120,1958,1183,432]],["BL_310.1",310,[186,352,1170,302]]]'>“ The second is a question of greater difficulty. In assessing this tax on the capital stock, the state officers have no other data than the report made by the company officers, under oath, as required by law. The return shows very clearly that between the 15th day of February and the first Monday of November, the sum of $200,000 was received and divided among the stockholders, on •a capital of $350,000. All of this was paid over, from month to month, during the year 1876, as made. The return shows, however, that during the year the corporation met with losses, which, ■ although they did not reduce the dividends, had to be made up by <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>the stockholders, who furnished petroleum from time to time, to cover the evaporation and supply the place of that which was burned, amounting in all to $89,429.58, the net profits of the year being only $110,570.42. Can the court allow a credit for that loss, or, under the words of the statute, must we tax the capital stock according to the ‘ dividends made or declared by the company ? ’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[183,655,1170,987]]]'>“ If the tax was imposed on the net profits there would be no difficulty. The sum which the stockholders were obliged to pay would be deducted. The profit to them is lessened by that much. Such is not the form of the assessment or the words of the statute. It is not even a tax on dividend, but on the “ <em>capital stock, measured by the amount of dividend </em>made or declared.” The dividends in the present case were not only made and declared, but actually paid over to the stockholders. They preferred receiving their dividends, and making up the loss by eváporation or fire by delivering more petroleum, and if they chose to transact their business in that way it did not lesson the amount of dividends, yet it did of clear profit at the end of the year. The stockholders need not receive their dividends until the end of the year, and can then have the losses paid before the dividend is declared. That course was not pursued here; but, on the contrary, the dividends were all paid over, and the losses afterwards voluntarily made up by contribution of the stockholders. Sometimes dividends are so declared in order to ostensibly increase the value of the stock for the purpose of speculation by sales. Be the object what it may, the dividends in the case under consideration were actually made and declared, and fixes the tax on the capital stock. We therefore report against this corporation and in favor of the Commonwealth, as per report filed with this opinion.”</p>

But the creditors gave time until the earnings were sufficient to pay the debt and make a dividend besides. Then the debt and dividend were paid together. These facts were not denied, but because the distribution was made in the <em>form </em>of a dividend, <em>substantial justice </em>was refused, and the company was taxed for its losses as well as its profits.</p>
