The bill averred in substance, that, in 1845 the plaintiff and his brother Edward were co-tenants in fee of Mount Hope Furnace, in Lancaster county, and also, with others, co-tenants of the “ Cornwall Ore-banks ”; that at that time Edward Grubb and defendant, A. Bates Grubb, were copartners in the manufacture of iron at Mount Hope Furnace; that in 1845 plaintiff and defendant agreed that plaintiff’s individual half of Mount Hope should be conveyed to defendant, “ together also with the right, title and interest, so far as the said Alfred Bates Grubb’s right under this conveyance in the said Mount Hope Furnace is interested and concerned, of them, the said Clement B. Grubb and Mary Ann Grubb, his wife, to raise, dig up and carry away, for the use and advantage of said furnace, iron ore out of and from * * * the ‘ Cornwall Ore-banks ’ * * * for the purpose only of procuring ore for the said Mount Hope Furnace * * * ; ” that Edward Grubb and defendant operated the furnace as ^copartners until the death of Edward, in 1867, during which period the ore was obtained from said banks; that in 1870 the heirs of Edward began certain proceedings in partition against defendant, the result of which was that the defendant, in April 1874, became the sole owner of said Mount Hope Furnace; that the defendant recently asserted a right to take ore from said banks, without limit, instead of a moiety thereof. The bill further alleged that this claim to a full supply instead of a moiety was contrary to the agreement of purchase and the construction of the deed; that plaintiff owned one-twelfth of said Cornwall banks, and that he had articles of agreement with his co-proprietors, under which the ore taken by defendant was considered as taken by plaintiff, and was at his exclusive cost; that the wrong of taking the ore being continuous and recurring would cause a multiplicity of suits, against which relief could be had in equity alone, and it therefore prayed that it should be decreed that defendant’s right is to take but one-half of the ore used at Mount Hope: that if the words of the deed of ■ 1845 did not clearly confine the defendant’s right to a half supply, the deed should be reformed; that defendant be decreed to account to the proprietors of Cornwall for one-half of the ore; that defendant be decreed to submit to such method of determining the rights involved as is necessary to protect plaintiff, and in the meantime that he be enjoined from acting under his grant; that plaintiff should have such further relief as would prevent a surcharge of the grant made or intended to be made.</p>

The court, Livingston, P.

    <p id="b233-10" data-blocks='[["BL_233.11",233,[150,1455,1171,860]]]'>The bill stripped of all unnecessary matter, is a proceeding to compel the appellant to pay for one-half the ore hauled from the Cornwall ore-banks to the Mount Hope Furnace. Whether he ought to pay for it depends upon the construction of the deed of 1845 of Clement B. Grubb and wife to Alfred Bates Grubb. These are both legal questions properly belonging to a court of law. If this were all, we would at once dismiss the bill for want of jurisdiction. But as some other matters have been introduced into it, evidently with the view of bringing the case within the cognisance of a court of equity, we will consider them briefly. They are first— That the claim of a full supply, instead of a moiety, is contrary to the agreement of purchase, to the construction of the deed, and to the continuous and uninterrupted usage thereunder, and that if the terms of the license are vague the deed should be reformed. In support of this averment there is the prayer, “that if the.words of the deed of 1845 do not clearly confine the defendant’s right to a half supply, the deed should be reformed.” It is sufficient to say in regard to this that the proper <em>construction </em>of the deed is not a subject of equity jurisdiction, and that as to its reformation, there is neither averment nor proof of fraud, accident or mistake.</p>

Has he done anything prejudicial to the rights of the appellee which is sufficient to give a court of equity jurisdiction? The contention of the appellee is that the case comes within the same rule as waste, which may be restrained by injunction as well as by writ of estrepement, and of continuing trespasses, which equity will restrain to prevent multiplicity of suits; and Denny <em>v. </em>Brunson, 5 Casey 385, Scheetz’s Appeal, 11 Id. 88, and other cases were cited in support of this view. I have no' fault to find with the authorities cited, but their application is not manifest. Noi question of waste is raised by this record. Waste is spoil or destruction done or allowed to be done to houses, woods, lands or other corporeal hereditaments by the tenant thereof, to the prejudice of the heir, or of those in reversion or remainder. By the Act of 27th of March 1833, Pamph. L. 99, the provisions of' the second section of the Act of 2d April 1803, restraining waste, are extended to quarrying and mining. But it has never been held that a person who is not a tenant in possession, but possessing a right to dig ores, is guilty of committing waste when he takes out more ore than his contract or his rights call for. Nor does the case come within the rule of repeated trespasses for the reason that the appellant is not a trespasser. His right to dig ore at the Cornwall banks is not disputed. The question whether he has a right to a whole supply for his furnace or only a half is another matter, and has no bearing upon the question of trespass. If his right is limited to a half supply, and as to this we express no opinion, it becomes a mere question of accounting for the surplus. I am of opinion that the question of a half supply will be found to be full of practical difficulties when it comes to be established, if it ever shall be. For the present it is sufficient to say that the mere fact, if it exists, that the appellant has taken more ore than he was entitled to under the deed of 1845, does not make him a trespasser. Even if it did the equity jurisdiction of the ’court would not attach in the face of the appellant’s denial of the appellee’s right. A bill in equity is not a panacea. It was never intended, nor has it ever been used to settle disputed rights in trespass. Where the right is clear it will restrain the commission of repeated acts of trespass on the sole ground of preventing a multiplicity of suits.</p>

Even if they had been joined as plaintiffs, the account is a mere matter of charge for certain number of tons of ore, with no entries on the other side of the account. It was clearly the subject of an action at law, and the appropriate form of action is assumpsit.</p>

Orders and decrees in equity where there is no jurisdiction, are simply <em>coram non judice.</em>
