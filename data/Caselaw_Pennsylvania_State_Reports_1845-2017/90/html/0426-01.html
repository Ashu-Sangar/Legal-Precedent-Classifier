This conveyance 'was expressly made subject to the payment by Nichols of the balance of the debt and interest due upon both of the aforesaid mortgages, and the fact that part or all of the bonds thereby secured had been assigned to third parties was distinctly recognised. This deed also contained a covenant by Nichols “to assume and pay the balance of the debt and interest owing upon said two mortgages and bonds secured thereby, and to save harmless the said Wonderly from any liability for the same;” and it was moreover expressed that the performance of said covenant and by said Nichols was a part of the consideration of said deed, and the deed was executed by Nichols as well as the grantors.

To this report exceptions were filed on the 31st of December 1878, by the City National Bank and the York County National Bank, and the case referred back to the auditor to make a new distribution on the principles indicated in the opinion of the court, to wit, that Nichols, by virtue of his succession to Wonderly’s half interest in the property, and having paid off the mortgage, was entitled to subrogation as against Potter, but confirming the distribution so far as applied to the Hall mortgage. The auditor made a second report, distributing the $4500 <em>pro rata, </em>upon the whole of the Porter bond and the one-half of the amount of the bonds held by said banks. To this report Oliver Watson and Oliver Watson, Jr. filed exceptions on the 18th of April 1879, alleging as error that the auditor erred in not distributing the whole balance of $4475 to the Porter bond; that the distribution was not in accordance with the law and .the facts, and that there was error in the court in refusing to confirm the first report and in referring the same back to the auditor.</p>

We contend that Wonderly paid the whole of the mortgage-debt, not the half thereof as the court intimated in their opinion, by the sale of his undivided interest in the property to Nichols. The satisfaction of the mortgage and cancellation of the bonds were a part of the consideration of Nichols’s purchase, and as was said by Thompson, O. J., in Abbott <em>v. </em>Kasson, 22 P. F. Smith 183: “ It would be a novelty for a purchaser of land to keep on foot his own mortgage against his own estate.” Granted that Potter was not a party to the transaction, still surely in a sci. fa. by Nichols, if he. continued to hold the bond, Potter could make defence that the mortgage had been paid in full by Wonderly in any way. ■ Nichols would be estopped from recovery on the mortgage by the covenant in the deed from Wonderly, by which he agreed, as part of the consideration, to satisfy the mortgage and cancel the bonds, and his assignees can stand in this respect in no better position than himself, even if the deed from Wonderly to Nichols, recorded years before they came into possession of the bonds, was no notice to them.</p>

    <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[160,448,1167,1066]]]'>This fund, in contention, is the proceeds of a sale of lands formerly owned by Ozias Potter and Joseph H. Wonderly, as tenants in common. While thus owning the land, in November 1866, they jointly executed a mortgage thereon to Albert T. Nichols, to secure the payment of eleven bonds, ten of $2000 each, and 'one of $4000. In December of the next year, Nichols assigned nine of the $2000 bonds to one Piper, and .guaranteed their payment. About the same time, Nichols borrowed money of one Porter, and gave him the $4000 bond as collateral security. Nichols failed to pay Porter, and the latter transferred the bond to one of the appellants. After the obligors had paid and taken up two of the $2000 bonds, in January 1871, Wonderly conveyed his undivided one-half of the property to Nichols. The deed contained a covenant of Nichols, by which he agreed to assume and pay the'balance owing on said mortgage, and to save harmless, said Wonderly, his heirs, executors and administrators from the payment of the same of any part thereof. After this, Nichols procured a re-assignment of the seven bonds from Piper, and the appellees acquired and hold them under later transfers from Nichols. The present contention is between the appellees on the one side, who hold the bonds thus taken up and negotiated again by Nichols; and the appellants on the other side, who hold the $4000 bond not taken up. The appellants contend that the bonds re-assigned to Nichols, were, thereby, by operation of law, paid and satisfied.</p>

As-to the other half, each is surety for the other: Gearhart <em>v. </em>Jordan, <a href="/nc/46/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Jones 325" data-case-ids="8682409" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0325-01">1 Jones 325</a>. As no partnership existed between the mortgagors, none of the incidents applicable to copartners can be invoked. The rule which denies subrogation in case of a debt arising in a partnership transaction before settlement of the partnership accounts, does not apply. On the conveyance by Wonderly of his interest in the land to Nichols, the latter became a tenant in common with Potter. Thenceforth they sustained the same relation in regard to the payment of the mortgage, as Wonderly and Potter had previously sustained. No consideration passed from Potter. He .was a stranger to the contract between Wonderly and Nichols. His rights were unaffected thereby. They were neither enlarged nor diminished. The covenant of Nichols obligated him to protect Wonderly from all liability on the mortgage and bonds; but not to protect or relieve Potter therefrom. It follows, when Nichols paid and took up the bonds, secured by the mortgage, which he and Potter were jointly obligated <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>to pay, he thereby acquired a right to collect the one-half thereof out of the estate of Potter. He was not driven to an action to enforce this right; but was entitled to all the securities and all the remedies given by the mortgage: Wright <em>v. </em>Grover &amp; Baker, 1 Norris 80. By virtue of subsequent assignments, all these rights and remedies passed to the appellees, and they are justly entitled to the sum decreed to them.</p>
