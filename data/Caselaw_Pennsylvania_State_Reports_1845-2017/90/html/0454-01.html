L. 514, railroad companies in Warren county are required to fence their roads “ for the protection of farmers and owners of cattle, &amp;c., residing along the line of such railroads,” and also, “ to construct sufficient cattle-guards at all road-crossings;” and by the Act of April 17th 1869, the failure to perform these duties, renders the railroad company liable for the value of cattle, &amp;c., injured in consequence of such neglect. Mead lived about half a mile from the railroad company’s track and owned no land along its line, but pastured his cow in the field of one Dalrymple, south of and near the railroad station, but not adjoining its land or right of way. Between this pasture and the railroad company’s land at the nearest point was the public highway, fenced on both sides, and betxveen this pasture and the railroad track at the point where the cow was killed a fenced field intervenes. The public road crosses the railroad just east of the depot. There is a side track extending some distance east and west of the depot, and the land east of the depot is used for yard and shipping purposes, piling ties and lumber, loading and unloading freight, and the track through this yard and east of it nearly to the bridge across Andrew’s run, as well as west across the- public road, is used by the railroad company in switching, arranging and making up trains, and more or less of this work is done by night. To put in cattle-guards where the public road crosses the railroad, or at any point where they would be crossed in switching and making up trains, it was alleged, would seriously endanger the lives of the trainsmen and railroad employees. <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>The entire south side of the railroad company’s right'of way and yard, the side toward the Dalrymple pasture, is well fenced. The entire north side of the right of way and the yard are also well fenced. The part of the west end of the company’s yard north of the railroad track, is left unfenced for the convenience of the public, in passing in and out with freight, ties, &amp;c. The plaintiff’s cow is supposed to have escaped in some way from the pasture into the public highway, and to have strayed thence through defendant’s yard, on to and along the track east toward the bridge, and was struck a few rods west of the bridge.</p>

In default of that, the owner of any cattle may recover damages for the killing, in consequence of such a cattle-guard not having been placed in the place pointed out by the Act of Assembly.] It is alleged on the part of the railroad company, that this plaintiff does not come within the provisions of this Act of Assembly, because he did not occupy the land along the railroad track. It appears by this draft and by evidence, that he was pasturing his cow in Dalrymple’s pasture. This pasture comes down, as appears by this draft, to two highways ; one of the highways running across the railroad, right at <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>the depot. It appears in evidence, that the defendant’s track is fenced the whole distance, according to the Act of Assembly, except at a point opposite the depot, where the track-yard of the defendant’s railroad abuts against this highway, and there is no ■ fence there, neither is there any cattle-guard. There is a fence at the east end of the yard proper where there are switch-gates, but there are no cattle-guards; and it is evident that this beast had gone down through towards the bridge easterly, and past the yard proper, and there it Avas killed..</p>

It is % general police regulation, incidentally, if not principally intended to protect the public, like the special act for Erie county, which was so. interpreted in Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Riblet, 16 P.

The j.ury have found that they could have placed a cattle-guard at the east end of the yard, without inconvenience or danger. The. plaintiff’s cow was killed at a point beyond where this guard should have been. The plaintiff’s recovery is not defeated by the fact that his cow came upon the track from the highway.

This the court refused to do, saying that as the plaintiff was depasturing his cow upon land near to, though not directly abutting upon, the railroad, it was sufficient, and if the cow escaped from the enclosure without any default on his part, and was killed in consequence of the neglect of the company in not fencing its track according to the terms of the statute, he was entitled to recover. In this we discover nothing wrong. It is true the act recites that it is for the protection of farmers and owners of cattle residing <em>along the line </em>of any railroad in the county of Warren. But here, first, it is obvious the intent is to protect all owners of live stock, whether farmers or other persons; whether, therefore, they own or occupy land or not is of no consequence; and hence, also, in order to give proper force to this intent, we must construe the words “along the line of,” to mean in the vicinity of; otherwise only such stock-owners as own or occupy land adjoining the lines of railways would be protected; and so even those who were in the lawful occupancy of highways crossing the defendant’s improvements, unless they were adjoining landowners, would not be within the terms of the act. This, however, would limit the act not to stock-owners, or even to landowners generally, but to such only as happened to have or occupy lands adjoining railroads. Such an interpretation as this, since it accords neither with the words nor spirit of the act, cannot be the true one.</p>
