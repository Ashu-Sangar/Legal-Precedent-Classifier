He was the owner, at the time of the sale, of all the judgments entered prior to that in which he was trustee for Mrs. Burns. The 'sheriff made a special return at the instance of Elias Lahr, the purchaser. From that return it appeared that the sheriff retained the following costs: Attorney $4.25; crier, 15c.; piothonotary, $8.65, and $21.45 costs of sale, and $10 on account of former sheriff’s costs, amounting, in aggregate, to the sum of $44.50. That sum was pajd to the sheriff by the purchaser. The balance of the purchase-money was claimed by the purchaser ás the first lien-creditor on the judgments he had purchased which preceded the Lahr judgment.

The appellants contend that the plaintiff in a judgment, not reached in a distribution of the proceeds of real estate, is not entitled to any costs, excepting the actual costs to effect the sale; that the costs incurred upon prior fruitless efforts to bring about this sale cannot be allowed to affect a lien-creditor: Fry’s Appeal, <em>26 </em>P.

The unrécorded mortgage of the building association can take nothing as against these liens in point of law. Nor is it entitled to any preference in equity. If it is, it must be by bringing home to these several plaintiffs actual notice of the existence of this unrecorded mortgage, not only before their respective liens attached, but before the debts upon which they are founded were contracted by Burns.” .This principle, -governing-the distribution, has been uniformly held by the courts, <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>from Semple <em>v. </em>Burd, 7 S. &amp; R. 286, to Corpman <em>v. </em>Baccastow, 3 Norris 363.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.4",510,[160,463,1166,1290]]]'>In Britton’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20127" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Wright 127">9 Wright 127</a>, it was decided that a mortgage, executed before, but not recorded until after, judgments had been entered against the mortgagor, is entitled to priority over them in the distribution, when the judgment-creditors had actual knowledge of the mortgage before the debts were contracted for which their judgments were obtained. The fact of such knowledge was emphasized by Justice Strong. His reasoning places him who gives credit and takes judgment after notice of the mortgage on the footing of a purchaser with notice, and does not apply to one- who gave credit without notice or knowledge. As respects the latter, the ruling of the auditor is a reflex of the professional understanding, as expressed in the phrase, “such mortgage is good against a judgment-creditor with notice before his debt was contracted,” repeated as late as McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Ihmsen, 4 Norris 364. No equitable principle demands postponement where the credit was given prior to the mortgage or the creditor’s knowledge thereof. Then he stands as clear of wrong as an innocent purchaser, and his judgment, though entered after knowledge of the mortgage, will take as the first lien. The reason for postponement where credit is given with notice or knowledge, is the same as applies to a purchaser under like circumstances, namely, that if he seeks to defeat the estate of the mortgagee he is guilty of fraud, but when the credit is given before, the element of fraud in contracting the debt is wanting. It matters not that the creditor was present at the execution of the mortgage and was silent. That will not preclude his use of lawful remedies, nor give the -mortgagee a superior equity. Creditors are equal in merit and the law favors the vigilant. Where a debtor gives one a.mortgage, and another, whose contract was prior, a judgment-mote, the latter, if first entered of record, is the prior equitable as well as legal lien.</p>
    <p id="b510-7" data-blocks='[["BL_510.5",510,[154,1753,1163,558]]]'>Burns’s wife joined in the mortgage and undoubtedly knew the contents of both its parts and of the accompanying bond. About five years thereafter, 'he gave a judgment note to Elias Lahr for her use. The auditor finds the consideration of that note was money she got from her father’s estate, ten or eleven years ago, which she loaned to her husband, taking no security for it until this judgment was given. Hence, at the date of the mortgage, this debt had run a little over three years. To characterize it as a “stale debt,” “barred by the Statute of Limitations before the unrecorded mortgage was executed,” ill accords with the fact found, or the law. The Statute of Limitations does not begin to run against a married woman, on a loan to her husband, till his death: Towers <em>v. </em>Hagner, <a href="/whart/3/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Whart. 48" data-case-ids="1833442" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0048-01">3 Whart. 48</a>; Kutz’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%2090" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Wright 90">4 Wright 90</a>.</p>

The statute does not disturb the relation of husband and wife — a union of two persons — but to some extent upsets the theory that her legal existence is suspended during coverture. Their unity, his headship, his power and influence over her, are facts as distinctly recognised in the statutes as in the common law. Therefore, she cannot convey or encumber her property, save as authorized by statute ; and very rarely, if at all, will her silence or acts in presence of her husband operate as an estoppel. Nothing can be more natural than that she will lend her money to her husband, and that he will give her a security for it whenever he sees financial embarrassment approaching. Such loans and securities are sanctioned by numerous decisions. She has the same right to loan to him as to a stranger; it is as lawful for him to secure that loan as any other. Strangers may sue him and obtain judgment adversely — his wife cannot. The law permits an insolvent debtor to give judgments to his creditors as he prefers. An honest judgment, voluntarily given by a husband to secure a debt owing to his wife, is just in law, and he who denounces the act as wrong in morals, must take a singular view of the promptings of affection and interest. Who could be more worthy his preference than she ? And for whom could he feel greater concern? Until the legislature changes the law, these loans will be made and securities given. Her property vests in her as her separate estate; and the husband’s is his separate estate. In view Of their respective rights of property, why should her judgment be postponed to one who loaned him money, though he used it to improve his land. Were a stranger holding a judgment in the place where Mrs. Burns’s stands, he would take the money. Hers is equally meritorious. For prevention of fraud, clear and satisfactory proof of a wife’s claim against her husband is exacted in a degree not required of others, but when established she is entitled as another would be.</p>

It cannot tend to defeat the judgment of Harriet Burns to give a detailed description of the parts of the mortgage — one, in form, an absolute conveyance, the other a defeasance — when, if it be not a mere mortgage, for that reason, it cannot take a dollar of the fund. The rights and disabilities of married women, except as secured or removed by statutes, remain as at common law. We fail to discover, in the facts found by the auditor, an act of Harriet Burns which estops her from demanding and receiving the money due on her judgment. To hold that anything she did is an equitable estoppel, as between her and the mortgagee, would be to assert a principle <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>most dangerous to the rights of married women, unsupported by-reason or precedent.</p>
