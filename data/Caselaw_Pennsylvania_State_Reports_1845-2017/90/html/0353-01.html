On July 13th 1877, Stallsmith made an assignment to Herbst for the benefit of creditors. The assignee applied to the court for an order to sell the real estate discharged of liens under the provisions of the Act of February 17th 1876. The order was granted and the sale made, and on the 15th of October 1877, the assignee made return, when the sale was confirmed, the first instalment of the purchase-money to be paid on the 1st of April 1878. When the sale was made and confirmed, the judgment of Mary Campbell was a lien, but the five years expired on December 6th 1877. On the receipt of the purchase-money, on April 1st 1878, the assignee refused to pay'her judgment, on the ground that her lien had expired béfore the conversion of the property, and was not, therefore, payable out of the fund. She then petitioned the court for a rule on the assignee and the judgment-creditors to show cause why her judgment should not be paid in full out of the proceeds of the real estate. The rule was granted, and after an answer filed and a hearing, the court made it absolute. Herbst,. the assignee, and Buehler, a judgment-creditor, took this appeal, and assigned this action of the court for error.</p>

      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>This fund in contention was produced by a sale under the Act of 17th February 1876. It authorizes the Court of Common Pleas to order an assignee in trust for the benefit of creditors, to make sale of the assigned real estate, which is encumbered by liens. The assignment of error presents the single question whether a judgment which, at the time of sale and of confirmation, is a lien and would then be entitled to be paid out of the proceeds, is deprived of all right thereto by reason of the expiration of five years from its-entry, before payment of the purchase-money and delivery of the deed. That it is not, is expressly ruled in Tomlinson’s Appeal, ante, p. 224. The language and object of this Act of 17th February, are there carefully considered. It is shown that such a construction would be contrary to the manifest purpose and spirit of the act. As it expressly declares the judgment-liens are discharged by the confirmation of the sale, the rights of the owners of the 'judgments then attach to the fund. The confirmation is an act separate and distinct from a payment of the purchase-money : Carver’s Appeal, 8 Norris 296. A right vested at the time of confirmation is not divested by a postponement of the payment of the purchase-money. It is unnecessary to repeat the reasons given in Tomlin-son’s Appeal. They fully sustain the learned judge in holding that the right of the appellee was not forfeited after the confirmation of' the sale. Herbst, as assignee, has no such, interest in this distribution between creditors, as to give him a right of appeal, and his appeal is quashed as to the other appellant.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[312,1466,991,87]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>
