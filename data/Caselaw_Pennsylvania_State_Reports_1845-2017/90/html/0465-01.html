On the 4th of May 1869, F. M. Hartshorne and M. L. Clay, doing business as E. M. Hartshorne &amp; Co., obtained an insurance in this company on a steam planing-mill and fixtures situated in the city of Williamsport, and in consideration thereof, signed and delivered to the company plaintiff a premium note for $2000, bearing interest at the rate of 5 per cent, the interest payable annually in advance, and the principal “ at such times and by such instalments as the board of directors shall demand, and order pursuant to the act of incorporation and rules and regulations of the said company.”</p>

In pursuance of this right a lien was entered in the prothonotary’s office of Lycoming county, on the premium-note given by Hartshorne &amp; Co., and an execution issued to enforce the payment of their assessments, and the unpaid interest which had occurred on this note. On the application of the defendants, this execution was stayed and rules granted to show cause why the judgment should not be opened and to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off. After argument on these rules in the court below both were made absolute. A writ of error was taken to the decree of the court making these rules absolute, and the Supreme Court reversed the decree (see report of case 3 Norris 453) making absolute the rule to strike off the judgment, allowing the decree to open the judgment to stand.

The presumption is that the directors, representing the members of the company, made the assessments properly. The secretary’s certificate as to the assessments is prima facie evidence of their correctness, but it may be rebutted by showing either fraud, illegality or gross mistake in making the assessments.</p>
    <p id="b470-9" data-blocks='[["BL_470.10",470,[174,1217,1171,819]]]'>The offers of evidence to which the first and second assignments relate were made for that purpose, and we cannot say that the testimony was irrelevant. It might be impossible to show illegality or gross mistake in particular assessments, if testimony as to previous losses, assessments'and revenues of the company was excluded. The company has a right to rely in the first instance on the prima facies of the secretary’s certificate. The <em>onus </em>of rebutting it, by proving illegality or gross mistake is on the defendant, and for this purpose great latitude should be allowed. If the transactions of the. company have been fair and legal, its records will exhibit the fact, and no injury can result from an examination of its affairs. It was claimed moreover by the plaintiff that defendants were liable to assessment for losses and for money borrowed or advanced to pay losses Avhich occurred before they became members of the company. To meet this position they were entitled to introduce testimony as to previous losses and assessments made to meet the same. The defendants alleged and endeavored to prove that the receipts of the company from assessments, premiums, &amp;c., very largely exceeded its aggregate losses and expenses.</p>

To have affirmed this point as presented, would have been a binding instruction to the jury to disregard all of defendant’s testimony, and render a verdict for the full amount of plaintiff’s claim. This was asking too much. The plaintiff was not entitled to such sweeping instruction as this, when there was some testimony at least for the consideration of the jury. In the concluding part of his charge, the learned judge instructed the jury to determine from the evidence what portion, if any, of the assessments the plaintiff was entitled to recover. And having ascertained that amount, to allow interest thereon from the time the assessments were due and payable. “ On the $1600, there would be interest recoverable, deducting the payments that have been made. The note bears interest on the $1600, at the rate of five per cent, per annum, deducting the payments that have been already' made.” The attention of the jury was thus specially called to the interest on the note, one of the items embraced in the point which as a whole was refused, and rightly so. We have no means of knowing why the jury failed to find anything either for interest or principal. It must be presumed that they obeyed the instructions of the court, and it.may be that they found the payments referred to as already made, fully covered the interest. If the jury made a mistake or disobeyed instructions, the court had an opportunity of applying the appropriate remedy, when the case was before it on the motion for new trial.</p>
