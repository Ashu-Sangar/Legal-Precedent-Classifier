Davis was committed to prison by the Court of Quarter Sessions, in default of giving security to comply with the order of said court, in a proceeding for the support and maintenance of his wife and children, under the 2d section of the Act of April 13th 1867. After an actual confinement in prison for three months, Davis made application for his discharge under the insolvent laws, and on his final petition, objection was made to his discharge on two grounds, viz.: 1. That the court has no jurisdiction to grant relief to persons in confinement under a sentence or order of a criminal court, except in the cases provided for by the 47th section of the Act of June 16th 1836. 2. That this application is not within the provisions of the 2d section of the same act, conferring jurisdiction in cases of insolvency.</p>

Assuming that the court had jurisdiction under the insolvent laws prior to April 15th 1869, in a ease like the one under consideration, we are, however, met by the act of that date, which provides, ‘ that whenever the Court of Quarter Sessions of any county in the Commonwealth shall, under the 2d section of the act to which this is a supplement, commit the person complained of to the county prison, there to remain until he comply with their order or give security, &amp;c., it shall be lawful for the said court, at any time after three months, if they shall be' satisfied of the inability of such person to comply with the said order and give such security to discharge him from imprisonment.’</p>

While the act is entitled ‘ A supplement to the act for the relief of wives deserted by their husbands, in the county of Lancaster and other counties, approved the 27th day of February 1877,’ it was held in Keller <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 21 P. F. Smith 413, that this act was intended as a supplement to the general act relative to desertions by husbands, &amp;c., passed April 13th 1867. In proceedings for relief under the insolvent laws, the applicant is required, inter alia, to execute an assignment of all his estate, property and effects, &amp;c., but under no circumstances is he required to satisfy the court in a case like this of his inability to comply with the order of the court and give such security.</p>

For these reasons, the discharge of Edward H. Davis is withheld. Being of opinion, therefore, that the petitioner is not entitled to his discharge under the insolvent laws of this Commonwealth, we hereby order and decree that the petitioner’s application for discharge be dismissed.”</p>

He was within the provisions of sect. 2, of the Act of 16th June 1836. He was “detained” “for the non-performance of a sentence for the payment of money.” In George Texas’s Case, 1 Ash. 175, Judge King says: “ If George Texas is in confinement under a decree or sentence for the payment of money,’ he is entitled to the relief he asks for.” And Judge King decided that he was entitled to his discharge under the insolvent laws. This decision was under the Insolvent Act of 1814. The language of that act is precisely similar to that used in the second <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>section of the Act of 1836, viz.: “for the non-performance of any decree or sentence for the payment of money.”</p>

But the court Says, that although he was within the provisions of the Insolvent Law, yet “ when the Act of 1869 was passed, the legislature must have intended, that a mere surrender of his property contemplated by the insolvent laws ought not to entitle a person in confinement for deserting his wife and children to his discharge.”</p>

There is no repeal of the Act of 1836 in express words by the Act of 1869. That is not pretended. Then it must be a repeal by implication. “ A statute will not be deemed to be repealed by implication, unless there be a clear and strong inconsistency between the two enactments:” Street <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 209" data-case-ids="480097" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0209-01">6 W. &amp; S. 209</a>; Cohen <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 6 Barr 111; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Easton Bank, 10 Barr 442; Egypt <em>v. </em>Street, <a href="/grant/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Grant 455" data-case-ids="227684" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0455-01">2 Grant 455</a>.</p>
