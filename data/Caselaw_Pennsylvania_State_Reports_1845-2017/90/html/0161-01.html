And if the law, out of regard to an ancient dogma, that the defence of duress is only available by him on whom the duress is practised should hold, in this enlightened day, that a recovery may be had in such' circumstances, then it will result that if a band of cut-throats can capture the person of a citizen, and compel him through .fear of his life to write a note and send it by mail to a friend and procure his endorsement of it, a recovery may be had on such endorsement by the criminal to whom it was given.</p>

In all the cases cited, the duress was either upon the party seeking to avoid the instrument sued upon, or it was <em>known </em>to him. Thus, in Robinson <em>v. </em>Could, supra, the action was on a note made by A. to B., to procure the release of C. from an unlawful arrest, brought about by B. Here A. entered into an independent contract, not as surety, but as principal, with a full knowledge of all the facts, and as the court said, upon a sufficient consideration: “ The case, therefore,” in the language of the court, “ is exactly this: A promise by the defendant, upon a valid consideration, fully assented to by him without coercion or restraint of any kind.” McClintick <em>v. </em>Cummins, <a href="/f-cas/15/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="3 McLean 158" data-case-ids="6668761" data-case-paths="/f-cas/15/1272-01">3 McLean 158</a>, decides nothing that affects the case in hand. The court said: “ It is not necessary to decide this question (the duress), as, from the facts, it does not appear that the imprisonment of Johnson was unlawful, or that he was detained until he executed the notes.” Plummer <em>v: </em>The People, <a href="/ill/16/0358-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="16 Ill. 358" data-case-ids="2590644" data-case-paths="/ill/16/0358-01">supra,</a> was a suit upon a recognisance against the principal and the sureties. The principal was committed by a magistrate in the state of Illinois for a larceny committed in another state. Afterwards, the magistrate, in the absence of the accused, and without proof, made out a second <em>mittimus </em>for .an offence committed within the state. The accused, to relieve himself from confinement, gave the recognisance in question. The defendants pleaded duress, and the court below gave judgment in their favor upon the plea. ■The court above affirmed the judgment as to the principal, and reversed it as to his sureties, saying: “I do not hold that the same facts might not also have been made available by the sureties, at th.e proper time, and in a proper form of-plea, but they cannot avail themselves 'of them by a plea of duress of their principal.” This case recognises the doctrine I have already suggested, that duress, as a plea, is bad if the duress set up was upon some person other than the party pleading it. It also appeared that the sureties had knowledge of the duress when they signed the recognisance. This was also the case in Strong <em>v. </em>Grannis, <em><a href="/barb/26/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="26 Barb. 122" data-case-ids="5007515" data-case-paths="/barb/26/0122-01">supra,</a> </em>cited by the defendant. Here the action was against two persons as makers of a promissory note; the defence set up was that the note was executed under duress of imprisonment of one of the makérs, and to procure his release therefrom, and was signed by the other as his surety. The court held that the surety might avail himself of the duress. This was a case in the Supreme Court. Osborn <em>v. </em>Robbins, <em><a href="/ny/36/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="36 N.Y. 365" data-case-ids="498876" data-case-paths="/ny/36/0365-01">supra,</a> </em>was in the Court of Errors and Appeals. The note was given by a <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>son, with his father as surety, in settlement of an arrest upon the charge of rape, under circumstances that indicated an abuse of legal process, for the purpose of oppression. The court held that the surety could avail himself of the duress. This case is not authority to the extent claimed for it by the defendant, for the reason that the surety was the father of the defendant. This is one of the exceptions recognised in Huscombe <em>v. </em>Standing, and most of the old authorities.</p>
    <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[142,708,1174,1040]]]'>It by no means follows that because duress of another is not a good plea, and that in some instances it may not even avail as a defence, that it cannot be set up successfully in any case. Had the defendant, after endorsing these notes, passed them to the plaintiffs and received the money therefor, it is very clear he could not set up the defence of duress of the maker; so if he had endorsed them with notice of the duress, or if the notes were in the hands of an innocent third party for value. In these and many other instances that might be named, the defence referred to would, for obvious reasons, be unavailing. The case in hand, however, differs materially from them and from all the cases cited. Here the defendant was the surety of the maker, nothing more, and defends under the broad plea of non assumpsit. The form of the transaction is not material, so long as the contention is between the original parties. The defendant’s contract is to pay the notes, if his principal fails to do so; and he may be proceeded against immediately upon such failure. But upon payment of the money he has his remedy over against his principal. It is a recognised doctrine in the law of surety, that whatever discharges the principal debtor, also discharges the surety. There are exceptions to the rule, as where one had signed a joint and several note with a married woman as surety : 1 Pars, on Bills and Notes 244. Nor will this rule apply to cases in which a surety is required, for the very reason that the principal <em>may </em>have a defence that will defeat the claim against him.</p>

He is not, therefore, misled. The defendant endorsed the notes without any knowledge, or anything to put him upon inquiry, of the duress practised upon his principal. The result will be, if a recovery is had against the defendant, he will have no redress against the maker, and this by reason of the duress upon the maker, the act of the plaintiffs. He is therefore directly injured by it, and has a right to defend upon that ground. Had he signed the notes with knowledge of the duress, it would have been his own folly, and the consideration being good, the plaintiffs would have been entitled to recover. But they made the mistake of keeping the maker a <em>quasi </em>prisoner in New York by threats of an arrest, whilst the notes were sent to the endorser for his signature, thus depriving him of his remedy over <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>against his principal. In doing this, the plaintiffs overreached themselves.</p>

    <p id="b168-5" data-blocks='[["BL_168.5",168,[185,561,1171,133]]]'>As the case must be affirmed under the foregoing views of the law, it is needless to discuss the Sunday question. It is an interesting subject, but may well be deferred.</p>
