Kirk, for forgery; that he replied they would have to do it; that Fulton said the best thing the defendant could do was to sign the notes, and that the matter would all be fixed without anybody knowing about it, and that if defendant would put his name to them he would not be disturbed; that defendant’s son Elisha was present when these things were said.

Or was it simply the settlement of a dispute or uncertainty, respecting the defendant’s previous responsibility, growing out of the original endorsement of his name on the notes, and on which they were discounted by the bank ? As we have before said [if the transaction here described, and the consideration for the defendant’s acts were such as the defendant construes and represents them to have been, the consideration was unlawful and the endorsements and signatures on the new note created no obligation.] If on the other hand the transaction was simply the settlement of a dispute or uncertainty respecting the defendant’s previous liability, the consideration was lawful and good, and the defendant became bound for the debt, though he may not have been liable before, and the plaintiff may therefore recover.”</p>

The only authority to -which reference is made in support of such a proposition is the case of Fulton <em>v. </em>Hood, 10 Casey 365. In that case the suit was upon a bond, and the defendant sought to be relieved from it upon the ground that the agent who obtained it made <em>false representations </em>as to <em>the intentions </em>of the creditors of the sons of the defendant to prosecute them. This court refused to relieve the defendant upon the ground that the representations, if false, were simply as to alleged intentions of other parties, and therefore related to matters resting on opinion, or to a fact equally open to the knowledge or inquiry of both parties; and in the second place, the statements did not relate to the interests of the defendant or affect him personally, and therefore that <em>the falseness </em>of the representations could not be considered as material.</p>

Now it was fairly submitted to the jury by the learned judge below, whether such a concealment was not the consideration upon which the defendant executed the note sued on. Fulton <em>v. </em>Wood, 10 Casey, 365, does not, as the learned counsel for the plaintiff in error contend, rule this case. That was a false representation that other persons threatened prosecution, which was held not to constitute duress <em>per minas, </em>and bears no resemblance to the law as applied to the facts of this case.</p>
