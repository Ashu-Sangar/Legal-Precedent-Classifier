Judgment was entered thereon <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>in November 1875. An application was made by appellant to open the judgment, and under a rule to show cause why it should not be opened, depositions were taken. From these depositions it appeared that-about the 1st of April 1875, John Hickernell was indebted to John Flickinger to the amount of $1855 on two bonds, on one of which the appellant ivas surety. It was then agreed between the parties that for these two bonds a judgment-bond for the whole amount should be given by John Hickernell to Flickinger, and said bond having been executed, David Hickernell became surety thereon. There was evidence on the part of defendant that Flickinger, before the execution of the bond, had agreed to enter it up at once, so that it would become a lien upon the real estate of John Hickernell, which was then more than sufficient to pay the debt. On the contrary, on behalf of plaintiff there was testimony that although plaintiff had been asked subsequently to the execution of the bond to enter it up, he had never agreed to do so. John Hickernell became insolvent in June 1875. The judgment on the bond was entered in the following 'November, when this application to open it was made, on the ground that defendant had been injured by the negligence of plaintiff in not entering judgment on the bond. I’n the court below the appellant contended that if the said David Hickernell, the petitioner to open said judgment, has made out a prima facie case, he is entitled to have said judgment opened, and to have the same tried by jury; and that the testimony taken by Flickinger was irrelevant, and could not be read in the cause.</p>

The defendant took this appeal, under the Act of April 4th 1877, Pamph L. 53, and alleged that the court erred in refusing to open the judgment and in discharging the rule.</p>

The appeal was given by the Act of 1877, in order that the exercise of that discretion should be reviewed in this court. Before that act there wTas no appeal, and the decision of the lower court was final. The allegation of the appellant here was, that at the time the bond and warrant was executed, the obligee promised to enter it up, so as to be a lien on the real estate of John Hickernell. ■ There was some evidence of this. We think, however, upon a careful examination of the whole testimony, it did not appear to have been made the condition upon which the bond was executed. Without this is shown, the legal rights of the holder of the bond ought not to be affected by the parol evidence of loose conversations. Had the surety in this case desired that the bond should be entered up, a notice to do so would have been sufficient. The legislature, recognising the danger of parol evidence in such cases, has provided", by the Act of May 14th 1874, that such notice shall be in writing.</p>
