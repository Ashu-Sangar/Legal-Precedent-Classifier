Each bank kept both debit and credit sides of the account. The Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank sent to the Third National Bank notes for collection, checks and drafts on other banks, currency and other cash items ; all of which it charged in its account to the Third National Bank, and the latter in its account credited to the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank. The Third National Bank also discounted for the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank notes taken by the latter, and also notes drawn by the individuals composing the directors of the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank for the accommodation of the latter. The proceeds of these notes were in like manner respectively charged and credited in the accounts kept by each bank with the other. The. Farmers’ arid Mechanics’ Bank also issued drafts on-the Third National Bank, which were credited and charged in the several accounts. The Third National Bank sent collections, checks on other banks and currency to the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank, and all these items entered into the accounts. At the end of each month, the Third National Bank sent an account-current, as kept by it during the month, to the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank. The latter, after examining the account and comparing it with its own, reported to the Third National Bank that it had received the account; that it agreed with its books, and what the balance due was. With this balance, the account for the ensuing month in the Third National Bank would open, and the credits and debits were then continued during this month until its close; and so the accounts continued from month to month. The last report made by the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank was in March 1875, for the month of February 1875. About September 1873, the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank began to be indebted to the Third National Bank, and in November of that year its overdraft became very heavy. To secure this the above note was drawn by the individual members of the board of directors. This note was duly 'endorsed by J. Hiram Hubley, cashier, and delivered to the Third National Bank, and this suit was brought thereon to recover the overdraft by the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank on the Third National Bank.- On the average daily balance due by the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank for each month interest would be charged and entered in the account. The <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>interest thus included in the overdraft amounted to $7893.30, and was in excess of the legal rate.

These defendants are not entitled to it. Deducting it then from the aggregate usurious interest, $7893.30, leaves the sum of $6569.15, which must be recouped from the balance sued for.

It cannot be disputed, that the defendants would be entitled to the benefit of whatever defence would he available to the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank. The plaintiffs, being a national bank, by charging more than six per cent, interest on these overdrafts, lost the right to recover any interest at all. The point then, does the Act of Congress forfeit interest beyond the maturity of the note sued on, does not arise. No recovery was had on the note; it was evidence merely of the obligation of the defendants to meet and answer the liability of the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank on the overdrafts. Admitting that the monthly accounts were stated accounts, that certainly never has been held to preclude a defendant from setting up an illegal charge of usury. Nor can the fact that the Farmers’.and Mechanics’ Bank charged illegal interest to their customers on the notes discounted for them by the plaintiff, affect their right to set up as against the plaintiffs, their violation of the Act of Congress, under which alone they have any right to do business at all.</p>
