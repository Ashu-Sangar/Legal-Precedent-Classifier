Mr. Reynolds acted as Chief Clerk of both sets of County Commissioners (who, under the' Institution District Statute, act. for the District) and had possession of the official records. Appellant, Heilig Bros. Co. Inc;, were the high bidders at the sale. The bid of $25,000 was rejected and the property was withdrawn from sale. Appellant, through its agent, then made a bid of $30,000 to the Commissioners. This offer was also rejected. The bidder was told by the Commissioners to make a better offer. On July 7,1947 appellant by letter to the District made an offer of $36,500 accompanied by a. check for $7000 as down money. The Commissioners then decided to <em>present </em>five acres of the land to the City as a playground. The <em>offer </em>was withdrawn as .appellant; would not pay $36,500 for the rest, or 10 acres.

The next day <em>one </em>of the appraisers in a conversation with Kohler, president of the board, suggested that the land was worth from $22,000 to $25,000. The Commissioners then orally offered to sell <em>the land to the appellee, </em>the Reliance Manufacturing Company, for' $25,000, and the offer was accepted. There was no formal meeting of the board, no written contract- executed and no down payment made. A few days thereafter the other two appraisers reported-to the board. One appraiser fixed the value at $30,000 and the other at from $30,000 to $37,500.

Mr. Kling then reported this fact to the meeting. The attorney for Reliance and a representative of the title company were present in the meeting room whsn Kling made this report. The stated reason for their presence at the meeting was to examine the resolution and deed. Koh-ler, the chairman of the board, despite this notice, proceeded to execute the deed. The telephone rang. Appellant’s director and treasurer was calling Kohler to confirm the fact that the offer of $36,500 still was open. The telephone was held open by the secretary of the board <em>while the deed was being notarised. </em>When Kohler answered the telephone and was informed that the offer was still open, he told appellant’s director and treasurer that the deed had just been executed. The deed, however, had not been formally delivered. The Reliance Company’s check was yet on the desk. Mr. Heilig, a director and treasurer of appellant, then telephoned counsel and together they went to Mr. Kohler and again renewed the $36,500 offer. Meantime the deed had been recorded.

The purchaser, the Reliance Manufacturing Company, the other appellee, made the identical defense. The court below sustained these contentions and gave the additional reason that “Reliance Mfg. Co.

While the bill does not <em>aver </em>that plaintiff is a <em>tax</em>payer, counsel for appellant asserted at the oral argument and in his paper book, that appellant pays taxes on real estate in the city of York and which was not refuted. Plaintiff is a Pennsylvania corporation doing business in York. A corporation, so chartered and operating within the Commonwealth, is necessarily a taxpayer to the Commonwealth. Indeed it could not avoid being one. A county institution district is a state agency performing a governmental function: <em>Chester County Institution District et al. v.

Such denial however, was not based upon the fact that court approval was unnecessary.</p>

The present situation is <em>not </em>one where a higher offer was made AFTER a consummated <em>bona fide </em>sale. Here a much greater price was offered BEFORE the sale was made. We need not again recite the facts and circumstances leading up to the sale and conveyance of the District’s real estate. In secrecy and with no convincing reason assigned for the inordinate haste the Commissioners sold the land to Reliance Manufacturing Company for f&gt;25,000. Insofar as the Commissioners of the Institution District are concerned, it was a clear breach of trust and a fraud for them to sell public land without the slightest effort to ascertain whether the greatly increased offer over the contemplated sale price was still good, especially after actual notice immediately prior to and during the execution of the deed. The above facts establish the Commissioners’ negligence and wrongful conduct which ordinarily would require the setting aside of such an iniquitous transaction.</p>

After receiving a negative reply, Kling called plaintiff who told him that the original bid of $36,500 still stood. Kling immediately returned to the meeting room and informed the board of plaintiff’s re-offer. It is a necessary deduction that representatives of Reliance were present when Kling returned and informed them of plaintiff’s re-offer. Mr. Eckert, a member of the board, stated: “Q. And what took place after they [representatives of Reliance] arrived? A.

Thus, despite the knowledge of <em>both </em>appellees of a higher offer they proceeded with the settlement. The deed, previously prepared, was signed. The check was lying on the table. While Kohler was acknowledging the deed, the telephone rang. Plaintiff confirmed what he had already stated to Kling, i. e., that his offer of $36,500 still stood. The secretary of the board held the phone until Kohler had completed his acknowledgment and then handed the telephone to Kohler.
