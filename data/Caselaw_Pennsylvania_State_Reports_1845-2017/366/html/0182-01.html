However, instead of returning directly to the college, they rode out of town and into the open' country. When they reached an isolated spot several miles from the city she commented on the view and defendant stopped the car so that they both might- enjoy it. While sitting there he suddenly reached over and began choking her. She broke away and got out of the car. He followed her and after choking her again, he returned to the car, unlocked and opened the luggage compartment, removed the lug wrench, and beat her: over the head with it until she was dead. He then left but later returned to hide the body and remove any incriminating evidence. The body was not discovered until four days later.</p>

Frucci, </em><a href="/pa/216/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="216 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="950334" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0084-01">216 Pa. 84</a>, 85, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.%20879" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="64 A. 879">64 A. 879</a>. However, when the statement in the <em>Frueci </em>case and the one in t.hiyt case are read in their contexts it is readily apparent that there is a vast difference in the meanings they conveyed to the jury. In the <em>Frueci </em>case the statement complained of followed immediately after the statutory definition of murder, thus creating the impression that second degree murder as well as all other means of committing first degree murder were to be eliminated from consideration. In this case, on the other hand, after the trial judge read the statutory definition of murder he went on to say: “You will note that under this Act murder in the first degree may be poison or lying in wait. There is no evidence of such means in this case. Or, it may be any willful, deliberate and premeditated killing. In the case which you are <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>trying we have to deal only with the hind of murder described as ‘Willful, deliberate and premeditated’.” Following that he discussed those elements of first degree murder and then proceeded to define and explain second degree murder. From that it is quite clear that the trial "judge was not removing second degree murder from the consideration of the jury but rather was eliminating only the other methods of killing which constitute first degree murder. That was to defendant’s advantage and was clearly correct: <em>Commonwealth v. Del Giorno, </em><a href="/pa/303/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="303 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1130000" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0509-01">303 Pa. 509</a>, 517, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20786" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="154 A. 786">154 A. 786</a>; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Drum, <a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">supra at p. 16</a>.</p>

There the court in stating the possible verdicts that the jury could return, did hot include second degree murder. However, it is elementary that the charge must be read as a whole and its correctness and adequacy determined from that reading: <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/321/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="321 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="1165918" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0327-01">321 Pa. 327</a>, 330, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%2097" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="184 A. 97">184 A. 97</a>. Here the learned trial judge defined and explained murder in the second degree competently and thoroughly. • He explained with equal clarity that the jury had the sole right to determine the degree of murder of vdiich defendant was guilty. In fact, immediately prior to the portion of the charge here complained of, he said: “If you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt as to the defendant’s guilt, then it is your duty to convict him and <em>to fix the degree you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of which he is guilty.” </em>(Italics added). Then, immediately following the complained of statement, he read to the jury those of defendant’s points:which he affirmed. The last one of these, and consequently the-last words said to the jury before they retired, was as follows: “If the jury believes that the killing of Marian Louise Baker was not a willful, 'deliberate and premeditated killing, their <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>verdict must be murder in second degree.” That point when read to the jury became a part of the charge and must be considered with it: <em>Commonwealth v. Payne, </em><a href="/pa/242/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="242 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="998836" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0394-01">242 Pa. 394</a>, 401, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.%20559" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="89 A. 559">89 A. 559</a>; <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b229-3" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[162,593,1154,923]]]'>Certainly when these instructions, including the above quoted point submitted by counsel for defendant, are read in their entirety it.is quite clear that the jury was not deprived of the.right to fix the degree of the crime. It is not necessary for the court in every part of its charge to reiterate to the jury their right to fix the degree: <em>Commonwealth v. Bishop, </em><a href="/pa/285/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="285 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1095096" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0049-01">285 Pa. 49</a>, 58, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20657" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="131 A. 657">131 A. 657</a>.

But if the charge amounts to a binding instruction to find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, if guilty a,t all, the jury’s right to fix .the degree is destroyed: <em>Commonwealth v. Ferko, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v. Fellows, </em><a href="/pa/212/0297-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="212 Pa. 297" data-case-ids="941864" data-case-paths="/pa/212/0297-01">212 Pa. 297</a>, 300, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.%20922" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="61 A. 922">61 A. 922</a>. The cases convincingly demonstrate that this charge did not amount to a binding instruction.</p>
