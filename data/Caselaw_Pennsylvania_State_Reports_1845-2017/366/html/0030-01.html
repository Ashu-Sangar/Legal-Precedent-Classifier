    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.7",70,[242,587,1153,428]]]'>Ruth Shechter filed a bill in equity against her husband, Oscar Shechter, his sister, Sarah Shechter and John Doe, seeking to collect arrearages due for support and reduced to a judgment of $1,983.00 with interest as of September 7, 1945, and also for accumulated arrearages of a support order for the period from September 7, 1945, to August 29, 1946, making the total due as of August 29, 1946, $3,296.00.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.8",70,[242,1022,1154,971]]]'>The bill was filed September 19, 1946, and its purpose was to reach the assets of a business conducted under the name of Pittsburgh Paper Stock Company which it was charged was established by Shechter and was still owned by him in spite of a colorable attempt to transfer the same to his sister Sarah. Shechter, although claiming to be now a nonresident, and his sister, both appeared and filed answers. The cause proceeded to a hearing and at the conclusion of plaintiff’s testimony counsel for the defendants moved the court to dismiss the bill for failure of plaintiff to establish a cause of action, which motion the chancellor granted. Later, after argument of exceptions filed the court en banc upheld the dismissal in a brief general opinion, without any discussion or analysis of the testimony, on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove Oscar Shechter’s ownership of the assets. From that final decree we have this appeal.</p>

    <p id="b71-3" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[153,821,1155,647]]]'>What tbe plaintiff here sought to show was a fraudulent transfer by Oscar Shecbter of bis assets with tbe design to “binder, delay and defraud” a creditor. Tbe fact that bis wife was that creditor in our opinion is a matter of no consequence. In fact the bitterness engendered by matrimonial differences if anything was more apt to induce a husband to go even farther to defeat his estranged family’s claim for support, than in tbe case of an ordinary creditor. In any event tbe Statute of 13 Elizabeth Ch. 5, Rob. Dig. 295, 39 P.S. page 262, is undoubtedly applicable here since she is a judgment creditor under the County Court’s decree.</p>
    <p id="b71-4" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[153,1480,1156,867]],["BL_72.1",72,[248,336,1158,1685]]]'>Before analyzing tbe evidence adduced to support tbe charge it should be remembered that fraud of this nature is never proclaimed from the housetops nor is it done otherwise than surreptitiously with every effort usually made to conceal the truth of what is being done. So fraud can rarely if ever be shown by direct proof. It must necessarily be largely inferred from the surrounding circumstances. As was written by one of the great Chief Justices of this Commonwealth (Black) in <em>Kaine v. Weigley, </em><a href="/pa/22/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="22 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="413719" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0179-01">22 Pa. 179</a>, at p. 183-184 (1853), “It is said that fraud must be proved, and is never to be presumed. This proposition can be admitted only in a qualified and very limited sense .... It amounts but to this: that a contract, honest and lawful on its face, must be treated as such until it is shown to be otherwise by evidence of some hind, either <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>positive or circumstantial. It is not true that fraud can <em>never </em>be presumed. Presumptions- are of two kinds, legal and natural. Allegations of fraud are sometimes supported by one and sometimes by tbe other, and are seldom, almost ■ never, sustained by that direct and plenary proof- which excludes all presumption. A sale of chattels without delivery, or a conveyance of land without consideration, is conclusively presumed to be fraudulent as against creditors, not only without proof of any dishonest intent, but in opposition to the most convincing evidence that the motives and objects of the parties were fair. This is an example of fraud established by a mere presumption of law. A natural presumption is the deduction of one fact from another. For instance: a person deeply indebted, and on the eve of bankruptcy, makes over his property to a near relative, who is known not to have the means of paying for it. From these facts a jury may infer the fact of a fraudulent intent to hinder and delay creditors. A presumption of fraud is thus created, which the party who denies it must repel by clear evidence, or else stand convicted. When creditors are about to be cheated, it is very uncommon for the perpetrators to proclaim their purpose, and call in witnesses to see it done. A resort to presumptive evidence, therefore, becomes absolutely necessary to protect the rights of honest men from this, as from other invasions .... It is no hardship upon an honest man to require a reasonable explanation of every suspicious circumstance, and rogues are not entitled to a veto upon the means employed for their detection.”</p>

On October 28, <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>1931, be filed a fictitious name certificate as sole proprietor of tbe business known as Pittsburgh Paper Stock Company. He also on December 17, 1934, filed another fictitious name certificate as sole proprietor of a paper shredding business transacted under the name of American Shredding Company. In the meanwhile matrimonial trouble developed. From the record it may fairly be inferred that trouble developed between the defendant Oscar and his wife sometime in 1932. When it actually started is not clear from the testimony. However, there is testimony that he absented himself from his family in October, 1932 (two months before his last child was born). He apparently returned for a while, but on January 3, 1933, he deserted his family permanently.</p>
    <p id="b73-4" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[156,1166,1156,979]]]'>On June 12, 1933, plaintiff filed a support complaint in the Allegheny County Court, which on June 26, 1933, resulted in a support order. That defendant Shechter was apparently unwilling to discharge his support obligation appears from the record of the Docket Entries of that Court. Within three months attachment proceedings were commenced to enforce the order and from that time some seven or more attachment proceedings were instituted to collect arrearages until the defendant left the jurisdiction. In 1943, he went to California and sought a divorce, but his wife contested the action and the suit was dismissed. Undeterred he went to Nevada in January, 1946, and according to his Answer obtained a divorce decree in that State. From all of which it may be inferred that his bitterness against his wife was such that he sought to evade by every possible means his duty and obligation to support his family.</p>

The capital was $5,000 divided into 500 <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>shares, of $10 par value each. The charter application named as incorporators with amount of their respective subscriptions, the following. Morris Shechter, 50 shares (father of defendants), Oscar Shechter, 5 shares, Harry Schilit 25- shares, Sadie Feld, 420 shares. It will be noted that Sarah’s name does not appear.

Asked whether she remembered signing the application for the Charter she answered she didn’t remember a thing about it; that she never lived at 5449 Black Street, the address opposite her name in the Charter; that she never subscribed for or undertook to buy 420 shares of stock in said company. She testified that when Oscar Shechter had a little store (that was in 1930) she loaned him $250 but Oscar never told her he would give her stock for the $250; that one day Sarah Shechter brought her the $250 at the store but there was no discussion of the corporation nor was the money paid her for any interest which she was supposed to have in the corporation. Finally she was asked, “Then do I understand that you never consciously, that is to your knowledge, were a stockholder of the company? That is, you never con<a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>sciously put any money into it as an investment? A. That is correct.”</p>

Feld as Secretary, that Oscar Shechter was Treasurer and was the only one authorized to sign checks against the company account, when shown the card, would not admit it was his signature. He said, “I never remember signing anything like that in the bank.” “It doesn’t look like my signature . . . The S’es look different.” He testified he was in the produce business. He denied he ever put any money into the Pittsburgh Paper Stock Company for stock; that 25 shares were given him by Oscar Shechter to whom he had “loaned money a long time ago.” He testified also that no meetings of the directors or stockholders were ever held of. the corporation of which he was supposed to be president. There were no minutes of any meetings ever kept by the company. He produced the stock certificate of 25 shares, testified it was never called in, never knew the corporation was dissolved, or that an out of existence statement was filed in Harrisburg.</p>

It had no real existence. Oscar Shechter apparently just used his friends’ names as corpora-tors, designated them as officers and directors without meetings and without any money paid by the two principal incorporators who were supposed to have subscribed to 445 out of its 500 shares. Merely obtaining a charter does not automatically establish a corporation in business. Much more is necessary. There must be an organization meeting of the incorporators, the election of directors and officers, acquisition of the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>assets, either for stock, or cash as may be directed by the stockholders or the directors pursuant to resolutions duly adopted. Then the customary evidence of the transfer of the assets to this corporation would be by bill of sale, executed by the vendor showing price paid, etc. All of these things are done at meetings of directors and stockholders of which minutes are kept. When therefore there is testimony of two of the principal incorporators that no meetings were held and there were no minutes or records kept, fortified moreover by the fact that the fictitious name certificate of Oscar Shechter as sole proprietor of the business was never revoked or cancelled,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> the burden certainly shifted to Oscar and his sister (who claims title through this corporation) to prove the contrary.</p>

According to the testimony of several witnesses who did business with him, he fixed prices, bought and sold the waste paper, etc., hired and discharged employees, negotiated the lease, and ostensibly exercised the same control as he did before.</p>
