    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.8",235,[180,645,1155,918]]]'>Plaintiffs are the executors named in the will of John Rutherford, deceased, and his daughter and granddaughters being beneficiaries under the will. In one suit the defendant is a son while in the other suit defendant is a stranger in blood to the testator, but who disclaims any personal interest and has filed a declaration of trust for the benefit of the settlor and for John Rutherford’s son George. In both bills it is averred that the grantor was in his 82nd year at the date of transfer and was weak in body and mind, easily influenced, and not possessed of sufficient mental capacity to make the transfers intelligently. The defendants were charged with exercising undue influence and with fraud. Answers were filed and the two cases were heard together. Separate adjudications and opinions were filed. The appeals followed the dismissal of the bills.</p>

The consideration was $1.00. On December 1, 1943, the same grantor executed and delivered another deed to his son George, conveying a strip of land of .about 6 feet In depth which, it was testified, was for the purpose of giving a back entrance to the other tract of land so conveyed.</p>

Cuthill, his real estate agent (defendant), a deed for another piece of land situate in Delaware County. The grantee executed and delivered a declaration of trust that he held the land <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>for tbe use of John Rutherford during life and thereafter for the use of the son George.</p>

The grantor, one year after the first transfer, executes a will, probated after his death, with same beneficiaries as plaintiffs in these suits. It is asserted that while the grantor was incompetent to <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>make tbe .transfer on July 13, 1943, he was competent to execute the will on July .13,1944, under which plaintiffs claim. It is true that less capacity is required to make a will than to transact ordinary business. The situation here presented required careful examination of the evidence., ,</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[180,651,1155,1089]]]'>In evaluating the evidence, its nature and effect must be measured in the light of the decided cases. Mental capacity, .undue influence and confidential relation have been so repeatedly defined by this, Court that it seems unnecessary to again repeat what we have so frequently decided. The evidence discloses no.sufficient proof of the absence of intelligent, knowledge and understanding by grantor of what he was transferring. There was no proof of imprisonment of body or mind, inordinate flattery, or physical or moral coercion to prejudice the mind or destroy grantor’s free agency so as to operate as a present restraint upon him. Nor was there evidence of a confidential relation between either of the defendants and grantor.

      <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>The learned chancellor heard the cases with thoroughness and fairness. In his adjudications he accurately reviewed and analyzed the evidence and made findings of fact that the grantor was mentally competent, the deeds were not procured by undue influence and that the grantor was not cheated or defrauded. These findings, amply supported by the evidence, were approved by the court in banc. The 106 exceptions of plaintiffs in one case and 103 in the other were adequately disposed of by the court in banc. The weakness in plaintiffs’ cases was the obvious insufficiency and inadequacy of testimony which was not cured by the existence of surmise and suspicion, colloquy of counsel or the inordinate number of exceptions and assignments of error.</p>
