Appellants are the Commonwealth’s Attorney General, its Insurance Commissioner and the Committee. The Statutory Liquidator interposes no objection to the intervention but reserves his right to question the validity of any plan of rehabilitation. The Ancillary Receiver for the State of Maryland intervened as a party defendant in opposition to any plan of rehabilitation.</p>
    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.8",189,[168,1158,1155,762]]]'>The reasons which motivated the Court to deny the intervention may be thus summarized: (a) a decree of dissolution was entered by the Court; (b) that after corporate dissolution there can be no reestablishment of the corporate entity; (c) that there is no authority for the proposed plan to turn over the assets to officers and directors of the dissolved company; (d) that an intervenor takes the litigation “as he finds it” and this petition is in effect “an attack upon the proceedings” and is in the nature of a bill for review. Perhaps the foundation of the Court’s objection is, as stated in its opinion, <em>“Were we to allow this peti</em>tion, <em>we would be required to hear evidence and pass upon the validity of our decree [of </em>dissolution] . . . .”</p>

In its petition it was averred that the Committee believed that the company was not insolvent;, that its assets far exceeded the liabilities and expressed the belief that reinstatement and rehabilitation of the company was “feasible”. This Committee consisted of six members representing policyholders, and whose chairman was Duverney Mat-lack and was thereafter referred to as the Matlack Committee. On <em>February 21, 1950 </em>the court granted permission to this Committee to withdraw as intervening party “. . . with leave to make further appearance at a later date for the purpose of requesting an appropriate allowance for expenses and counsel fee of said Committee . . . .” On <em>March, 10, 1950 </em>the present application to intervene was made by five authorized individuals, as a Policyholders’ Protective Committee, which was denied as indicated. This appeal followed.</p>

Futhermore the decree of insolvency and dissolution <em>was based entirely upon a consent decree. </em>The court was not required' <em>to find facts </em>on which to base its decree, because of such consent of the officers of the corporation, <em>who thereupon resigned. </em>We agree with the learned court below that an intervenor should not be allowed to become a party to the suit merely to review what the court has done and to require demonstration of the legality and propriety of its action. But <em>arguendo, </em>if <em>an </em>intervenor sought <em>to </em>establish that a group of insurance companies had contributed a fund to pay all debts and costs of an insolvent insurance company, ought such intervention be denied? Under such circumstances why should the decree of dissolution not be vacated and the company rehabilitated? In the absence of good reason to the contrary we think not. If it were shown that the company was and is <em>solvent </em>and the decree was entered because of fraud, accident or mistake, intervention should not be denied. Such proofs would not be in derogation of the decree filed. As this was a <em>consent decree </em>it might be shown that the decree was improvidently made and upon erroneous information. We agree that an inter-venor cannot question supported findings of facts made prior to the intervention. But neither the court below nor an appellate court should pass upon the propriety of the proposed rehabilitation <em>prior to intervention. </em>If the corporation is insolvent, it may well be that no rehabilitation is possible under the Insurance Statute, supra.</p>

Nor is the action of the court below in such regard to be adjudged unsound simply because we might, have acted otherwise had the application for leave to intervene been addressed to us in the first instance and been within our competence. Our jurisdiction being appellate, the scope of our review is, perforce, limited to determining whether the court below was guilty of an abuse of discretion in respect of its disposition of the petition to intervene. Yet, the majority opinion does not advance a single pertinent reason for condemning the action of the court below, while, on the other hand, the lower court’s action in: the premises might well have been prompted by a commendable desire that further delay through the intervention of private and possibly litigious parties be not invited three years after the corporation was dissolved and liquidation has proceeded meanwhile. The status of the applicants as policyholders ceased with the entry of the ■ final decree of the corporation’s dissolution; and, their rights as possible <em>junior </em>creditors of the dissolved corporation is a matter for the statutory liquidator’s protection.
