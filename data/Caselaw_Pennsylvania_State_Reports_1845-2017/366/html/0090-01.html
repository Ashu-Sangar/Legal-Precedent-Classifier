Plaintiffs’ grantor was Milton E. Rosenberg, who in turn had purchased the same property by deed dated June 7, 1943, and recorded, from Alvin Lichtenstul and Claire Lichtenstul. The property in question had been assessed for tax purposes for 1943 in the name of Alvin Lichtensteel and the unpaid taxes for that year returned to the Commissioners and County Treasurer in that name. The amount of the delinquent taxes returned was $52.10. The taxes for the years of 1944 and 1945 were paid by Rosenberg and taxes for <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>the years 1946 and 1947 were paid by appellees (Hess).</p>

They were sent no notice either as owners nor as terre tenants. Nor was notice of the sale given to Lichtenstul the owner in whose name the taxes of 1943 were assessed. Notice by registered mail of the proposed sale was sent to Milton E. Rosenberg at an address in Pittsburgh where he had formerly lived and was receipted for by someone he did not know and who never forwarded the notice to him. Rosenberg at that time was neither owner nor terre tenant.</p>

The period of the right of redemption had not then expired and the appellant did not disclose to any of the occupants or employees the purpose of his visit but remained silent until after the two year redemption period had expired.</p>

The sale was fixed for August 12, 1946, but the record of the county treasurer shows the notice was not sent until August 8,1946, <em>four </em>days before the sale. (2) The act requires the notice be served upon the <em>owner of the land. </em>We need not stop to inquire in this case whether this meant the owner in whose name the delinquent tax was assessed or the actual record owner at the time of the sale, because it was served on neither. Rosenberg, to whom it was sent, was neither the owner at the time the taxes were assessed' and returned delinquent, for <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>that was Lichtenstul. Nor was Rosenberg the owner at the time of sale, that was the appellees. Consequently this requirement was not complied with. (3) Although the amendment of 1939 took out salutory provisions of the Act of 1931 which required posting of the premises and which has happily been restored by the Real Estate Tax Sale Law of 1947, P. L. 1368, Sec. 602, 72 PS 5860.602, the amendment of 1939 still required notice to the terre tenant if the whereabouts of the owner was unknown.Yet notwithstanding the treasurer apparently did not know the whereabouts of either Lichtenstuls or appellees, no notice was sent to the terre tenant.

We are of the opinion that this clause cannot be given the sweeping effect that its language seems to indicate for that would in effect strike out the very provisions for notice that the prior part of the section ordains.</p>

Without due process of law the right of private property cannot be said to exist. As said by Mr. Justice Pitney in <em>Ochoa v. Hernandezy </em>Morales, <a href="/us/230/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="230 U.S. 139" data-case-ids="3664131" data-case-paths="/us/230/0139-01">230 U. S. 139</a>, 161 (1912), “The principle, known to the common law before Magna Charta, was embodied in that charter (Coke, 2 Inst. 45, 50) and has been recognized since the Revolution as among the safest foundations of our constitutions. Whatever else may be un<a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>certain about the definition of the term ‘due process of law’ all authorities agree that it inhibits the taking of one man’s property and giving it to another, contrary to settled usages and modes of procedure, and <em>without notice </em>or an opportunity for a hearing.” And see recent case of <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover B. &amp; T. Co., </em><a href="/us/339/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="339 U.S. 306" data-case-ids="362818" data-case-paths="/us/339/0306-01">339 U.

    <p id="b135-3" data-blocks='[["BL_135.4",135,[149,789,1155,702]]]'>In recognition of this right to notice it has been the settled practice in this State extending back for over a century and a half to give the property owner some reasonable notice that his property ■ is to be sold by process of law whether it be by mortgage'foreclosure, execution or for tax defaults. Had the legislature provided for no notice at all there is little doubt the Act would have been invalid as offending these fundamental provisions of both state and federal constitutions. Can it then by indirection do what it cannot do directly? Can it direct notice in one breath so to speak and in the next breath practically say it need not be given? To state the proposition is to answer it.</p>
    <p id="b135-4" data-blocks='[["BL_135.5",135,[148,1513,1156,812]],["BL_136.1",136,[264,341,1150,101]]]'>The legislature seems itself to have recognized the absurdity of the proviso, for the Real Estate Tax Sale Law of 1947, P. L. 1368, (which expressly repeals the Act of 1931 and its amendments, in so far as they apply to taxing districts coming within the provisions of and operating under the 1947 Tax Sale Law)', modified this proviso so as to read: “No salé shall bé defeated and no title to property sold shall be invalidated because of proof that mail notice as hérein required was not <em>received </em>by the owner.” This is not objectionable. Someone must take the risk of mail miscarriage rare as that may be, and that risk may fairly be placed on the delinquent taxpayer who has the duty of protecting his title against such defaults. Moreover the new Act adds a posting provision, which in such éilcumstances is a <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>reasonable method of apprising the owner of the property.</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[263,452,1153,810]]]'>It may be well to say a word also as to the responsibility of the taxing authorities’ duty in the premises. The purpose of tax sales is not to strip the taxpayer of his property but to insure the collection of taxes. When therefore a property is to be sold, reasonable care requires the authorities to give adequate description and a reasonably definite location. Here an improved farm of 100 acres with barn and dwelling and tenant houses was described merely as “100 acres of land in Forward Township,” without even the location by adjoinders required by Sec. 1 of the Act of 1931, as amended, supra. Such description and such location is manifestly too indefinite for seated property. See opinion of present Chief Justice in <em>Hunter v. McKlveen, </em><a href="/pa/361/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="361 Pa. 479" data-case-ids="476368" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0479-01">361 Pa. 479</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="65 A.2d 366">65 A. 2d 366</a> (1949).</p>

Therefore quite properly the legislature has sought to prevent invalidation of sale for mere technical omissions, irregularities or errors. But this very fact places upon the taxing authorities a responsibility to see that the owner of the property is not punished by the taxing authorities’ neglect or worse, and deprived of an extremely valuable property because of the carelessness or oversight of a title searcher in failing to discover a comparatively trivial sum of taxes unpaid in one of the previous years. To permit it would be an outstanding reproach of our system of justice. As stated at the argument if someone had merely gone to the available records the change in ownership could have been easily discovered and a mere inspection of the farm would have disclosed the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>real owner and would have brought forth payment of the delinquent tax immediately, an assurance warranted by the fact taxes of all subsequent years had been consistently paid.</p>

So what the learned Judge (Reno) there said with respect to the invulnerability of the tax title after decree of confirmation based on Section 12 of the Act of 1931, as amended by the Act of 1939, 72 P.S. 5971 1, must be read in conjunction with the early statement in the opinion to the effect that the property owner there had full and timely knowledge of all steps taken prior to the sale and could not have been said to have been misled to his harm. To which may be added in view of the owner’s knowledge he was bound to act to protect his rights by timely objections or exceptions <em>before </em>confirmation. Where, however, the requisite notice of sale required by that Act has not been given to the owner in accordance with the act and he is without knowledge until after confirmation, the confirmation cannot cure the fundamental omission because of the “due process” clauses of our state and federal constitutions.</p>
