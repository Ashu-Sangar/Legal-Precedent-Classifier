    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[251,388,1156,1038]]]'>Frank Blum and Sara J. Blum, appellants, instituted this action in trespass against William Goldman, appellee, to recover damages for malicious inducement to, breach a contract for the sale of real estate. Two previous cases had been instituted by the present appellants against William Goldman Theatres, Inc., based upon the same transaction which gave rise to the present case, and in which William Goldman was named as president, principal stockholder and agent. The instant complaint pleaded the earlier litigation and incorporated the record thereof by reference. Goldman filed a responsive answer and under the heading of new matter pleaded the additional litigation and further alleged that by reason of such prior litigation the matter before the court was <em>res judicata. </em>Appellants, in their reply to new matter, denied that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>applied. Goldman’s motion for judgment on the pleadings was granted. This appeal followed.</p>

William Goldman. Theatres, Inc., </em><a href="/f-supp/69/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="69 F. Supp. 468" data-case-ids="611361" data-case-paths="/f-supp/69/0468-01">69 F.

    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[242,567,1151,535]]]'>Appellants contend that (1) William Goldman, individually, had not been made a party to any of the prior actions and that there is no privity between him and Goldman Theatres, Inc., and (2) the tortious act of Goldman as an individual is separate and distinct from his act as a representative of the corporation. Appellee contends, and the court below held, that the instant action was different in form only, and that the conclusiveness of the prior adjudications could not thus be avoided.</p>
    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[243,1131,1153,977]]]'>The pivotal issue before this Court is whether, in the circumstances, the prior determination that Goldman was agent for William Goldman Theatres, Inc., entry of judgment against the principal and satisfaction thereof of record precludes successful prosecution of an action against the agent. The alleged facts upon which the cause of action is based are identical with those in the prior actions, except with regard to the designation of the party defendant, and as regards the damages sought. With regard to the latter, appellants in the initial suit sought damages in amount of $100,000, and in the second suit in amount of $50,000. In the instant case, $50,000 is requested for punitive and $50,000 for compensatory damages. The first action in the Federal Court, unquestionably, was, as the District Court held in the second case, a joinder of equity and tort claims, permissible under the Federal Eules of Civil Procedure.</p>

    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[136,783,1151,267]]]'>The relationship of principal and agent has been conclusively determined in the prior litigation, both as a fact and as a conclusion of law.

    <p id="b569-5" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[137,1062,1158,1261]]]'>Appellants contend, however, that the relationship of principal and agent is of no moment. It is argued that the nature of the tort having as essential elements wilfulness and malice was such that Goldman and the corporation were separately liable. We are completely in accord with the statement that the liability was several and not joint. Pertinent is <em>Bausewine v. Norristown Herald, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/351/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="351 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="462729" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0634-01">351 Pa. 634</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="41 A.2d 736">41 A. 2d 736</a>, where Bausewine, in an action for libel, named one Strass-burger, president and substantial owner of Norristown Herald, Inc., and the corporation as defendant. Subsequent to the granting of a new trial, plaintiff discontinued his action against Strassburger. With regard to the relation of the parties, this Court said (p. 638) : “Here, Norristown Herald, Inc., was the master and Strassburger, its servant.” It was further held that because of the relationship the torts were several and could not be joint. It is immaterial that wilfulness and malice are necessary ingredients of the tort upon which the instant action is based. The relation of principal and agent remains and is controlling as regards the right to recover separate judgments and obtain satisfaction of each.</p>

In this suit counsel fees are sought from a defendant because of <em>his </em>tort . . . which tort necessitated tbe plaintiffs bringing suit against a <em>third </em>person.” This contention is subject to tbe same infirmity which defeats appellants’ principal contention, namely, that tbe act of tbe agent was tbe act of tbe principal. What appellants are seeking is to have tbe courts of Pennsylvania allow an item of damage which tbe Federal Court bas denied them, namely, counsel fees.</p>

It was there properly held that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>does not generally apply where a party appears in two proceedings in different capacities, first as trustee, and second in his own right. That case is wholly inapposite here where the cause of action is based upon the act of the agent. His act is also the act of the corporation.
