    <p id="b281-10" data-blocks='[["BL_281.14",281,[143,1250,1156,869]]]'>The material facts are as follows: Plaintiff, aged 66, was coming home from work at five minutes of five on June 21,1949. She was proceeding west on Diamond Street intending to cross Front Street. Defendant’s automobile was coming east on Diamond Street intending to turn left on Front Street. When plaintiff got to the northeast corner of Front and Diamond Streets, she noticed that the light was green, thus giving a right of way to pedestrians and automobilists on Diamond Street. While standing on the corner, she saw an automobile, the defendant’s, coming down Diamond Street in the opposite direction to which she was walking; it was then about 50 feet from the west curb line of Diamond Street. Plaintiff then stepped off the curb to cross Front Street a few steps in back of three or four people.</p>

When sbe stepped back, tbe automobile was less than two feet from ber. From tbe time sbe saw defendant’s automobile (when sbe was on tbe corner of Front and Diamond Streets, and it was approximately 50 feet west of tbe west curb line of Front Street) sbe did not see tbe automobile again “until it was right alongside of me”. Sbe testified that sbe did not bear any warning signal and that there was nothing to block her view of tbe automobile nor tbe driver’s view of ber. Twice a month for 21 years plaintiff bad crossed tbe street at this intersection and sbe testified that at tbe time of day it was a busy intersection.</p>
    <p id="b282-4" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[258,1099,1154,752]]]'>Front Street is thirty-four feet wide from curb to curb, with pavements thirteen feet wide. Diamond Street is twenty-six feet wide, curb to curb, with pavements twelve feet wide. Front Street has north and south bound street railway tracks, each five feet, two inches in width, with a “dummy” between, four feet, six inches in width. Tbe east and west cartways of Front Street are nine feet, seven inches wide. Diamond Street is a one-way street, east-bound, and has no car tracks. Diamond Street east-bound ends at Front Street; at tbe east side of Front Street, Coral Street, twenty-six feet wide, begins, running in a northeast direction.

Sbe testified that as sbe and ber mother stood on tbe corner of Front and Diamond Streets tbe light was green for traffic going east and west; that there were a few people in front of them; that a southbound trolley car on Front Street bad just drawn up to tbe northwest corner; that when sbe was at tbe curb on tbe northeast corner of Front and Diamond Streets sbe saw defendant’s automobile coming <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>down Diamond Street toward Front Street about 50 feet west of the west cnrb line of Front Street. She and her mother crossed the street, a few people being a few steps ahead of them, and as she reached the first trolley rail she saw defendant’s automobile had just reached the west curb line of Front Street; just as she left the second rail to get to the third rail, all of a sudden the automobile made a sharp turn onto Front Street, going north, and it came so close to her mother, her mother stepped back to avoid being hit. It was then about a foot or less than two feet from her mother. “The automobile was stopped when she fell, wasn’t it? A. Yes.” Plaintiff’s daughter further testified that she did not hear any warning signal.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[143,1109,1156,699]]]'>The testimony by and in behalf of the plaintiff clearly established — and it was admitted by her counsel at the trial of the case — that she did not see the automobile from the time she was at the east curb line of Front Street until she was between the second and third trolley rail, at which time it was within a foot or two of her. The trial judge gave binding instructions for the defendant on the ground that there was no evidence of negligence, and no sudden emergency was created by defendant’s negligent conduct; plaintiff’s sudden fright was due entirely to her own inattention to traffic conditions after she left the east pavement of Front Street.</p>

The only possible ground on which it might plausibly be argued that the defendant was negligent is deduced from the statement of plaintiff’s daughter as to the distance away of the defendant’s automobile as the daughter left the first or second trolley rail.</p>

When an automobile turns right or left at a street corner where a light is green for both automobile and pedestrian traffic, it would often be impracticable for an automobilist to wait at a busy crossing or at busy times of day in a large city until the pedestrian traffic had crossed the intérsection. If that were required, traffic would likely be paralyzed for 15 minutes or a couple of hours a day at busy intersections. Anyone who has crossed Chestnut or Walnut Streets at Fifteenth Street or Broad Street in Philadelphia knows that an automobile as a practical matter has to creep and ease its way gradually and very slowly through pedestrian traffic, otherwise it could never move, with the result that frequently an automobile comes within a couple of inches or a foot of many of the pedestrians. This near contact does not per se establish either negligence on the part of the driver or contributory negligence on the part of the pedestrian. There was therefore no proof that defendant was negligent or that any negligence on his part was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s accident.</p>
