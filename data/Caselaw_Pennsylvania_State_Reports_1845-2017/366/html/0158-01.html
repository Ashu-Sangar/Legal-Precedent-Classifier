On March 21, 1946, while the bailment endured, there was a fire of considerable magnitude in the warehouse. Thereafter, the plaintiff made demand for delivery of <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>tbe peanuts, but tbe defendant failed to deliver them. Upon trial of the case, tbe jury returned a verdict for tbe plaintiff in an amount representing tbe full value of tbe peanuts and some interest. Tbe defendant filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. Tbe court below in separate orders refused tbe motion for judgment but granted a new trial. Both parties have appealed, tbe plaintiff from the order granting a new trial and tbe defendant from tbe order refusing judgment n.o.v.</p>

Opposed to tbe defendant’s proofs, to which we have already referred, tbe plaintiff offered testimony tbat his peanuts, or a considerable portion of them, were seen in the warehouse after the fire, unharmed. If tbe jury chose to believe, as their verdict implies they did, that tbe plaintiff’s peanuts were unaffected by tbe fire, then, obviously, tbe defendant did not account satisfactorily to tbe jury for its failure to turn them over to tbe plaintiff when demanded.

For this reason, and others which need •not he discussed, a new trial is essential to a just determination of the' case.” In <em>Marko v.

That idea is, of course, in conflict with the host of eases to the effect that it is the duty of a trial court to pass upon the weight of the evidence and to grant or withhold á new trial accordingly. Necessarily, a jury’s verdict will eventually determine the facts. In the instant case there was quite a bit of evidence, offered by the defendant, that many, if not all, of the plaintiff’s bags of peanuts were destroyed in the fire or soaked with water during the fighting of the fire and thereby became unfit for food whei»eupon they <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>were condemned by local health authorities. There was also evidence that peanuts other than the plaintiff’s were stored in the building at. the -time of the fire so that whether the peanuts observed- by the plaintiff’s witness after the fire were actually the plaintiff’s depended upon the credibility of that testimony. True enough, the case for the plaintiff is sufficient to justify the verdict if his evidence ,is believed, and the defendant’s discarded. It is also true that the special finding of the jury that none of the plaintiff’s; peanuts were in the building at the time the health authorities condemned the remaining peanuts is: consistent with the verdict. But, the fact remains, that the' trial judge felt that the defendant’s evidence was entitled tó more consideration than what the jury had. apparently given it.</p>
