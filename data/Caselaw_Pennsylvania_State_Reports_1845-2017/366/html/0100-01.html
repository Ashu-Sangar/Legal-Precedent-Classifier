    <p id="b139-9" data-blocks='[["BL_139.11",139,[157,1247,1158,915]]]'>The appellant, Bernice Scott Ross, was the owner of a house and lot in Gray Township, stated at the argument to be fairly worth $3,500. It was sold July 11, 1949, for $50. at a tax sale for delinquent taxes due for years 1943 and 1944, amounting in all to $29.12. The appellant had acquired this property from the preceding owner, N. C. Park, by deed dated October 16, 1946, duly recorded. Through ignorance or neglect, a proper search for taxes was not made and the purchaser did not know of the tax delinquency for the years of 1943 and 1944, possibly assuming that because the taxes for 1945 and 1946 had , been paid there was no delinquency. However, it appears the assessment which had been in the name of N. C. Park was changed to the name of Bernice Scott Ross in 1947 and she paid the taxes for that year as well as the years of 1948 and 1949. -</p>

A notice of the delinquent tax was sent by registered mail to N. C. Park, the owner of the property at the time the taxes were assessed, at his address in Burton, West Virginia, June 15, 1948, and return receipt received. Also on June 22, 1949, notice of the proposed sale was sent by registered mail to the same party and receipt received from him. No notice however was sent to Bernice Scott Boss, the actual owner of record of the property who lived there from 1946, and who was the assessed owner since 1947. Nor was any notice delivered to the ter re tenant nor posted on the premises. Nor did she know anything about the sale or the proceedings until she filed exceptions.</p>

On February 18, 1950, Bernice Scott Ross filed exceptions to the confirmation and prayed the court to permit her to pay the delinquent taxes together with costs involved and set aside the sale.</p>

However, the doubt is cleared up by Sec. 102 of the Act which, defines “owner” to mean, “The person in whose name the property is last registered, if registered according to law, and in all other cases means any person in open, peaceable and notorious possession of the property, as apparent owner or owners thereof, or the- reputed owner, or owners thereof, in the neighborhood of such property.”</p>

Greene County is one of the counties to which existing deed registry laws do not apply,.so that the first clause of the section quoted could have no application to property in that County. However, the legislature evidently having in mind: that not all the counties were subject to the deed registry laws apparently meant to provide for such counties in.the last part -of the definition by the language- <em>“and in all -other </em>cases means any person in <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>open, peaceable and. notorious possession,” etc., thus following the time honored precedents of bringing notice home to an owner of real estate by serving the terre tenant, or occupant or by posting the premises, than which there probably is no surer way of bringing home notice to an owner of seated lands.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Since therefore the notice required by the Act was admittedly <em>not </em>given, the sale was basically invalid.

Frazier </em>case and in an opinion filed at tbis term, said, “. . . but an examination of that case shows tbe facts therein are wholly different from those of the instant case in that there the owner at the time of the sale was the same owner against whom the taxes were assessed and had due notice of the sale and was at the most complaining of minor irregularities that were not vital. So what the learned Judge (Reno) there said with respect to the invulnerability of the tax title after decree of confirmation based on Section 12 of the Act of 1931, as amended by the Act of 1939, 72 P.S. 5971 1, must be read in conjunction with the earlier statement in the opinion to the effect that the property owner there had full and timely knowledge of all steps taken prior to the sale and could not have been said to have been misled to his harm. To which may be added in view of the owner’s knowledge he. was bound to act to protect his rights by timely objections or exceptions <em>before </em>confirmation. Where, however, the requisite notice of sale required by that act has not been given to the owner in accordance with the act and he is without knowledge until after confirmation, the confirmation cannot cure the fundamental omission because of the ‘due process’ clauses of our state and federal constitutions.”</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[255,1814,1153,318]]]'>In the <em>Westerwiek </em>case we took occasion also to remind the tax collection authorities that “the purpose of tax sales is not to strip the taxpayer of his property but to insure the collection of taxes,” and that the very power given by the Act carries with it the responsibility of seeing its conditions are complied with.</p>
    <p id="b144-6" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[256,2142,1152,208]],["BL_145.1",145,[150,328,1155,1092]]]'>It seems difficult to understand why tax collecting agencies seem so prone to ignore ordinary modern common sense business practices. Its own records would seem to disclose whether any returns for delinquent <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>taxes due for years subsequent to 1944 had been made. Therefore the absence of returns for subsequent taxes should have indicated to the tax claim Bureau that all taxes for the five years subsequent to 1944 had been paid. This then ought to have suggested a delinquency not deliberate but due to some oversight or error. In such circumstances a letter or a telephone call of inquiry to the local collector would speedily have brought forth the important information that the property had changed owners. Then a mere demand on the new owner would no doubt have quickly brought the payment of the $29.12 taxes without resort to court proceedings, or a sale or further expense to the county or taxpayer. Nor do we understand why the local tax collectors after making a return of delinquent taxes for the purpose of lien, calmly forget all about the delinquent taxes and do not follow the sensible practice of reminding the taxpayer, when they send out bills for the current year, of the delinquent taxes still due for the previous year or years.</p>
    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[152,1434,1155,704]]]'>That the law imposes no such duties on the tax officials is beside the point. Common courtesy demands some recognition of the fact that those who hold public office in this land at least, are still the servants of the people, not their masters. The strict provisions of the Keal Estate Tax Sale Law were never meant to punish taxpayers who omitted through oversight or error (from which the best of us are never exempt) to pay their taxes. Tax acts were rather meant to protect the local government against wilful, persistent, long standing delinquents for whom we hold no brief, and to whom the appellate court decisions have consistently given short shrift.</p>
