    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[261,554,1153,319]]]'>The question raised by this appeal is whether a surviving spouse, by an election under Sec. 11 of the Estates Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, 20 PS 301.11, may secure an intestate share of her deceased husband’s revocable inter vivos trust which was erected prior to the passage of this Act.</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.9",232,[259,883,1154,757]]]'>On March 14, 1947 settlor, Thomas McKean, executed the deed of trust in. question. While for the present purpose all of its terms need not be recited, it transferred certain income to this appellant. Settlor reserved certain portions of the income to himself. He also reserved the right to alter, revoke or change the trust, but which right he never exercised. On the same day as the date of the deed, March 14, 1947, he executed his will, wherein he made no provision for appellant. He died July 30, 1949. The will was probated August 3, 1949. Appellant, the widow, elected to take against the will under See. 8 of the Wills Act of April 24, 1947 P. L. 89,20 PS 180.8, supplemented by her election under Sec. 11 of the Estates Act of 1947, supra.</p>
    <p id="b232-7" data-blocks='[["BL_232.10",232,[257,1650,1152,594]]]'>Sec. 11 of the Estates Act of 1947, supra, reads as follows: “A conveyance of assets by a person who retains a power of appointment by will, or a power of revocation or consumption over the principal thereof, shall at the election of his surviving spouse, be treated as a testamentary disposition so far as the surviving spouse is concerned to the extent to which the power has been reserved, but the right of the surviving spouse shall be subject to the rights of any income beneficiary whose interest in income becomes vested in enjoyment prior to the death of the conveyor.”</p>

Appellant earnestly maintains that the legislative intent of Sec. 11 of the Estates Act, supra, was to operate retrospectively. While in some circumstances an Act of Assembly may be applied retrospectively where such intent is plain, such a result, however, is never permitted where vested interests are destroyed or affected: <em>Willcox v.
