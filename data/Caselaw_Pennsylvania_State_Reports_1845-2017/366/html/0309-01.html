The ordinance, after describing the water district generally and by map made a part thereof, authorized the supervisors to enter into a contract with the Municipal Authority of the adjacent Borough of West View for the furnishing by the latter of a water supply for public and private use in the district.

The Township contends that (1) attack upon the ordinance must be made, if at all, by complaint to the court of quarter sessions within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance, pursuant to the provisions of Section 702-XLI, 53 PS §19093-702-XLI, (2) Section 802 of the Township Code, 53 PS §19093-802(d), specifically excepts from the public bid provision all contracts with municipal authorities and (3) matters relating to amortization of cost are relevant only in a rate proceeding, the jurisdiction of which is in the court of common pleas.

There is no restriction upon that power requiring ownership of the facilities by the Township. The language used clearly indicates a legislative intention to enable supervisors of second class townships not desirous of undertaking the responsibilities of constructing, operating and maintaining a public waterworks to nevertheless provide by contract for the furnishing of an adequate water supply for inhabitants and industry within the township. While the township supervisors have also been given power to accomplish the same end through ownership of the lines by the township (Section 1602, 53 PS §19093-1602) or ownership of the entire system (Section 1604, 53 PS §19093-1604), the Township under Section 1601 could properly provide for a supply of water for public and private use by contracting with the Municipal Authority of the Borough of West Yiew.</p>

Section 20 of Article III of the Constitution of this Commonwealth prohibiting delegation to a private corporation of “any power to make, supervise or interfere with any municipal improvement, money, property or effects, whether held in trust or otherwise, or to levy taxes or perform any municipal function whatever” was there held to prevent a township which owned a sewage system from issuing bonds which provided that if default occurred the private corporation could take over and operate township property.

It is contended that the contract in this regard is improvident for the further reason that consumers will not only be assessed a portion of the $12,744.49 paid by the Township to the Authority, but will also pay current rates to the Authority which are based upon an amortized cost of the distribution system. There is no averment that any rate has been fixed or charged by the Authority for the service rendered or to be rendered to appellants. In any event, the reasonableness of the rates may only be determined in a proper proceeding in a court of common pleas: Municipality Authorities Act of 1945, P.L. 382, Section 4, 53 PS §2900z-5; <em>Rankin v.
