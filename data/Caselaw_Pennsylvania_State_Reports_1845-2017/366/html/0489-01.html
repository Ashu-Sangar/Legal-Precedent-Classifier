L. 349, 72 PS §5566b. In each instance, the taxes were imposed by due resolution of the respective school district, acting under authority of the Act of June 25, 1947, No. 481, P. L. 1145 (53 PS § 2015.1-2015.8); and the plaintiff paid them knowingly.

All of the material facts appear by the <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>pleadings and are not disputed.

True, the plaintiff does allege that such was the attending situation with respect to the payments here in suit; but the allegation is a bald and unsupported conclusion in direct conflict with the material facts pleaded by the complaints. In each case, the plaintiff avers that the taxing resolutions were expressly adopted under the authority of Act No. 481 of 1947 and that, pursuant to such resolutions, the plaintiff paid into the respective treasury of the defendant districts the taxes which it now seeks to recover. There is not even the slightest intimation that the plaintiff did not knowingly and understandingly pay the precise amounts of the taxes imposed upon it by the duly enacted tax resolutions. This is further confirmed by the fact that, as also averred by the complaints, the plaintiff paid the taxes in question under protest in writing, — a clear indication that it knew <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>exactly wbat it was doing when it paid the taxes. That the resolutions later proved to be legally ineffectual did not serve to make the plaintiff’s intentional and deliberate payments erroneous or inadvertent.</p>

There was no error or mistake in the payment made by the plaintiff. It paid the very tax and the amount of tax that it intended to pay; nor was there any error in noting the payment or in issuing the receipt. In our view, the words 'erroneously paid’ were clearly intended to cover cases where payment was made under a misapprehension as to what was being paid. But a tax intentionally and understanding^ paid, although the assessment was made or the tax levied incorrectly, is not erroneously paid, and we do not think that section 6813 was designed to allow a refund of taxes in such a situation.” See, also, <em>Shea v.

    <p id="b531-3" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[134,786,1158,1100]]]'>There is still a further reason why the plaintiff cannot recover. Section 3 of Act No. 481 of 1947 specifically provides a right of appeal by taxpayers of a political or municipal subdivision, of certain number or amount, to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the County within thirty days of the passage of a taxing resolution enacted pursuant to the authority conferred by that Act. Thereby, the validity of such a resolution, as well as any question of the taxpayers’ liability for the tax so imposed, can at once be adjudicated. The procedure has been invoked a number of times<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and affords both an efficient and expeditious remedy in advance of the need for payment of the tax. The plaintiff neither avers nor contends that the remedy provided by Section 3 of Act No. 481 of 1947 was not available to it for a prompt determination as to its liability for the taxes in question. But, as already appears, it went ahead and paid the assessments. In that situation the common law action of assumpsit will not lie for the recovery of the taxes so paid.</p>

This court there said, — “A special tribunal is thus erected, with all necessary powers to bring before it the parties, witnesses, etc., determine the indebtedness by or to the officer, and enforce its collection. This, under the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>provisions of the Act of 1806, necessarily excludes every other remedy except the appeal provided for</p>

The contention that the plaintiff is actually endeavoring to assert a statutory <em>right </em>fails to recognize that the inhibition of the Act of 1806 is against the use of a common law <em>remedy </em>where a statutory <em>remedy </em>obtains. In other words, it is the remedy (e.g., assumpsit) as distinguished from the right of action under the Act of 1943 that is not available to the plaintiff in the circumstances.</p>
