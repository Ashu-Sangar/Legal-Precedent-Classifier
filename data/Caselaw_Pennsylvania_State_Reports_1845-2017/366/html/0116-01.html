Section 5 of the ordinance provides: “Any person or persons, hereafter applying for a permit for the establishment or maintenance of any camp shall file therewith a copy of the plan of the proposed camp drawn to scale and showing the extent of the area to be used for camp purposes. In said plan shall be set -forth the proposed roadways, driveways, sites for trailers, house-cars, cabins or cottages, the dimensions of the alloted space of each unit, the proposed sanitary provisions* laundry facilities, washroom provisions, methods for garbage disposal, rubbish and sewage disposal, water supply and lighting systems and toilet provisions.”-The remaining sections of the ordinance provide detailed regulations for camps.</p>

It does not deny that the ordinance in question is a regulatory measure in the interest of public health, safety, morals and welfare and a valid exercise of the police power. It contends, however, that as regards the initial issuance of a permit to it, sections 2 and 3 of the ordinance are solely applicable and that upon a showing of compliance therewith the borough officials are duty bound to issue the requested permits. Appellees contend, and the court below held, that (1) section 5 of the ordinance is applicable to appellant and it is required to submit detailed plans with its application; (2) the complaint fails to aver compliance with the ordinance; and (3) issuance of a permit requires exercise of discretion by borough officials and is not, in the circumstances, a purely ministerial act. The order sustaining preliminary objections and the entry of judgment for appellees will be affirmed.</p>

Of particular application to appellant are the words “hereafter applying for a permit for the establishment or maintenance of any camp”. The words used necessarily relate to the continued maintenance of an existing camp as well as to the establishment of a new camp. The owner of an existing camp is required to apply for a permit for the continued maintenance thereof. The use of the word “or” must be deemed an intentional and deliberate act. Council must be considered to have intended each word used to be effective and not superfluous: <em>Commonwealth v. Mack Bros. Motor Car Co., </em>

This is not a case where “and” and “or” may be'substituted one for the other. The legislative intent may be given effect, by application of the word “or”. No change in language is necessary.

Section 2. requires that the continued and lawful operation of a camp presently existing be dependent upon securing a permit for such purpose from the borough.

These sections necessarily require the filing of an application for a permit and it is in this regard that section 5 applies to appellant..</p>

A municipal ordinance is in reality a statute and rules of construction applicable to the latter are to be applied with equal force and effect: <em>Marple Township v.

    <p id="b160-4" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[275,1009,1156,1089]]]'>The ordinance being an exercise of the police power and a regulatory measure in the interest of public health, safety, morals and welfare, must be construed, if reasonably possible, to effectuate the salutary purpose of the ordinance. The ordinance was passed to remedy a public health hazard created by reason of inadequate sewage disposal facilities at trailer camps. See <em>Palumbo Appeal, </em>supra. The necessity for the ordinance is not denied. Nor is it now suggested that the regulations are not reasonably adapted to remedy the situation. To adopt the strict interpretation which appellant seeks would mean that enforcement of the ordinance with regard to it would be postponed until a permit was issued, whereupon the burgess, pursuant to section 15, would be required to suspend the permit. Appellant could, by appeal to council and perhaps the courts, delay indefinitely correction of the evil presently existing. This result was certainly never intended and this Court will not do violence to the ordinance in so holding.</p>

Section five (and the following sections) refers to applications for permits “for the <em>establishment or maintenance </em>of any camp.” Such provisions obviously refer, both in words and spirit, to <em>future </em>projects. In such applications for permit the ordinance requires applicant to present a copy of the plan of the <em>proposed </em>camp and show <em>proposed </em>roadways, drives, sites, etc. This provision cannot refer to a presently existing camp because, in already established camps, there are no <em>proposed </em>roadways, drives, sites, etc. <em>They already exist. </em>Sections 7 to 16 inclusive are detailed sanitary rules and regulations with penalties for violation.</p>
