    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[149,969,1157,926]]]'>Plaintiff was employed as a truck driver by an independent contractor to haul coal from a stripping pit on the property of the Buck Run Colliery Co. On March 29, 1944, at 7:30 o’clock a.m., he drove his loaded truck from the bottom of the pit to a road which extended on an ascending grade for a distance of approximately 300 feet. The road was 20 feet wide. Plaintiff drove a distance of only 4 feet along the road when his truck broke down. A coemployee placed a rock under the left rear wheel and the plaintiff placed another rock under the right rear wheel. Plaintiff then went to the shop for a mechanic. Panak, a coemployee, drove his loaded truck up the same grade, but while attempting to pass on the left of plaintiff’s truck, got mired in the mud. Both trucks were accordingly disabled, side by side, and of course blocked the pit road.</p>

Plaintiff lay on his back underneath his disabled truck in an attempt to repair it. While in this position plaintiff could not see either forward or backward. Plaintiff knew that a bulldozer was available, nearby, to aid, among its other duties, a disabled vehicle if and when requested to do so by the driver thereof. Shortly thereafter the bulldozer came along <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>this road and Panak waved the operator to come forward to push, not plaintiff’s, bnt his, truck. When Panak waved to Ferrebee the bulldozer was about 8 feet from the back of Panak’s truck but to the right of Panak’s truck. Panak then got inside his truck expecting to be pushed. Panak’s engine and the engine of plaintiff’s truck were still running. Plaintiff was on his back and he did not see or hear the bulldozer (nor did, the mechanic working with plaintiff); and the operator of the bulldozer did not see plaintiff or know of his presence underneath the truck. Ferrebee, evidently mistaking Panak’s aforesaid signal and without- looking to see. where the driver of plaintiff’s truck was or whether anyone was under plaintiff’s truck or in a position of danger, brought the bulldozer into contact with the rear of plaintiff’s truck, and pushed it about one foot; the rear wheels of plaintiff’s truck when pushed by Ferrebee, ran over and broke plaintiff’s legs.</p>

Furthermore, the criticized instruction was not specifically excepted to; but the attempt is now made to object to it under the general exception which appellant made to the court’s charge. It was an error which could easily have been corrected at the trial, and would have been if counsel had called attention to it or taken a specific exception. A proper administration of justice requires that new trials be not granted on errors which counsel had ample opportunity to correct. It is' only when errors are basic and fundamental and cannot be corrected at the trial that this Court will consider them under a general exception: Medvidovich v. Schultz, 309.Pa. 450; Whitton v. H.
