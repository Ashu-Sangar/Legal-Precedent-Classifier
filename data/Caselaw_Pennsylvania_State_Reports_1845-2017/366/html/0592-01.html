The chancellor found that the purchase price orally agreed upon was $11,200., and consequently refused specific performance. The narrow but very important question raised in this appeal is whether evidence of an oral, contemporaneous inducing agreement is admissible to vary and contradict (1) a comprehensive written agreement, and (2) the purportedly real consideration set forth therein.</p>

      <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>Defendants attempted to both vary and contradict the written contract by tbe aforesaid oral agreement wMcb they alleged induced the written contract. Defendant Rockey admitted that on Friday, <em>January </em>7, he had offered to sell his farm to Grubb for $10,000. On Monday, <em>January 10, </em>plaintiff, Grubb, and defendant, Rockey, met, without their wives, to conclude the sale. Defendant took Grubb to the office of defendants’ lawyer. Rockey testified that at that time he demanded $12,500. for the farm and after some haggling, agreed to accept $11,200. and the reservation to himself of the wheat crop which was to be harvested <em>after </em>March 1st; that Grubb agreed to this, but wanted to pay $1200. on the side so his family wouldn’t know he was paying more than $10,000., which was the price everyone had agreed upon. <em>Grubb denied this. </em>Mr. Taylor testified that after some haggling Rockey and Grubb agreed that the purchase price for the farm was to be $11,200. There were thus three different versions of what occurred prior to the written agreement, which provided, as above noted, for a purchase price of $10,000. and the reservation of the wheat to Rockey <em>only until March </em>1, 1949.</p>

S. Rockey farm”, and also $1200. cash for which he received a receipt “cash payment on farm”; and (2) that Grubb paid Rockey $10,000. for the purchase of said farm on or before March 1, 1949. Defendants claim and the chancellor found that said payment of $1200. cash was a payment on account of the oral agreement and not as the receipt shows “cash payment on farm”. If said $1200. cash payment for the farm was paid before the written agreement was dictated or signed; it was cer<a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>tainly advisable but not necessary to insert it in said written agreement, since <em>payments on account of the purchase price or consideration set forth in a written agreement may, ex necessitate, always be proved by parol.</em>

If, on March 4th, plaintiffs still owed defendants $1200., as defendants <em>now </em>claim, is it not difficult to understand why Mr. Rockey and Mr. Taylor would have failed to mention that fact and would have demanded the wheat crop instead of the $1200.?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a>
