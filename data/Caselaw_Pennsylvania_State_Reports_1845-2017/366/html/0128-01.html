Arnold, original defendant, to recover for damages sustained when Arnold collided with a school bus operated by Robert Ely and owned- by Russell McKee. Ely and McKee were joined as additional defendants. Arnold appeals from the orders of the court below awarding a new trial to additional defendants, asserting a manifest abuse of discretion.</p>

Arnold, appellant, between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m., on April 5, 1946, was operating a 1935 Ford V-8 panel truck on State highway route Nos. 18 and 21 near Crouse’s School House in Centre Township, Greene County. The day was clear and the concrete highways in excellent condition. Preceding him in the same direction was a school bus operated by Robert Ely and owned by Russell McKee, additional defendants. At a point in the highway where Rush Run Road intersects with the aforementioned highway, the highway curves to the right. The school is on the left. The highway at the point of collision is 18 feet wide.</p>

Willard Brownlee who was a passenger in Arnold’s truck, corroborated his testimony in detail.</p>

The court denied additional defendants’ motion for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>but granted a new trial, whereupon Arnold took these appeals.</p>

The latter stated that he continuously remained in the center of the road, steadily bearing to the left. Admittedly, Ely did not give a warning of his intention to turn. The precise manner in which the accident occurred was a question for the jury and it has found that Ely operated his bus in a negligent manner.</p>

He should have anticipated that they might attempt to pass on his left. Where as here, he had previously observed appellant to his rear, he was under a clear duty to observe whether anyone was following him.

    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[155,501,1154,868]]]'>The facts in the instant case have been found by the jury. It has determined not only that Ely was negligent, but also that his negligence jointly with the negligence of Arnold constituted the proximate cause of this accident. The court below recognized that determination of the questions of proximate cause and intervening agency were for the jury. See <em>Kline et al. v. Moyer and Albert, </em><a href="/pa/325/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="325 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="1172294" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0357-01">325 Pa. 357</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%2043" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="191 A. 43">191 A. 43</a>. In view of the verdict of the jury, the facts before us are not in dispute. We may, therefore, determine the question of proximate cause. The finding of the jury with regard to negligence of the additional defendants was not against the weight of the evidence, but wholly supported thereby. It cannot be said as a matter of law that there was not joint negligence, proximately resulting in injury to the plaintiffs.</p>

Kamerer, </em>supra, for the reason that the accident in that case occurred in a straight stretch of road, and not as here on a curve. There, the suit was between the operators of the two vehicles involved. It was held a jury could reasonably conclude that failure to give notice of an intention to turn to the left was negligence and the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was also for the jury. A new trial was sought because of after-discovered evidence, namely, testimony that the turn to the left was a “gradual process of turning”, rather than a sudden, sharp turn. This Court held that such testimony would be merely cumulative, and in view of the failure to signal his intention to turn, the failure to look and determine whether such turn could be made with safety, and the failure to give due consideration for the rights of others using the highway, <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>would be immaterial.
