Beam, aged 42, for about six months, when on December 5, 1946, at about seven o’clock in the evening, he met him by chance in an inn. After staying there together for about a half hour they left in an automobile owned by Beam. When Shook was asked at the trial: “How did it happen that you' left the Ro-Val Inn with Mr. Beam?” he replied: “Mr. Beam asked me to go with him.” Beam drove the car to the Union Bar where they stayed for another half hour; then they walked from there, a distance of about a half block, to the Moose Club and remained there also for about a half hour. From there they went in Beam’s car, Beam driving, about four blocks away, to Segreti’s Bar, when they remained for about two or three hours. These places were all in Sharpsburg. From Segreti’s Bar they started home in the car. Beam lived in the 5300 block of Keystone Street, Pittsburgh, and Shook in the 5200 block of .Butler Street, a block away. It was then between eleven and twelve o’clock. They came up the main street in Sharpsburg, over .the 62nd Street bridge, and turned off the bridge down Butler Street, <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>inbound toward 61st. Street. They were following an inbound trolley ear of the Pittsburgh Railways Company and were going at a rapid rate of speed; coming up toward the rear of that ear they swerved to the left of it and on to the outbound track. An outbound trolley car, running at a speed of from 40 to 45 miles an hour, was then from 100 to 150 feet distant; both it and the automobile continued on toward one another; there was testimony to the effect that the motorman did not apply his brakes until within 30 to 35 feet of the automobile. The two vehicles met in a head-on collision with a terrific crash. Beam was killed and Shook was badly injured. Beam’s widow, administratrix of his estate, brought suit to recover damages under the Survival and Wrongful Death Acts against Shook and Pittsburgh Railways Company on the theory that their concurrent negligence had caused the accident, and she obtained verdicts aggregating $25,000 against both of them. Pittsburgh Railways Company filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v., both of which were overruled and judgments were entered on the verdicts, from which judgments Pittsburgh Railways Company now appeals.</p>

Shook denied this; he insisted that Beam was driving the car just as he had driven it from the Ro-Val Inn to the Union Bar and from the Moose Club to Segreti’s Bar. Witnesses testified, however, that when they came to the automobile after the crash they found both Shook and Béam in the front seat, Shook unconscious, slumped over the steering wheel on the left, and Beam seated on the right with his head down on the' dashboard. Beam died almost immediately thereafter.</p>

That Shook <em>was </em>negligent is obvious, turning as he did, at high speed, into the outbound track and into the path of a rapidly approaching car. That the motorman of the Pittsburgh Railways Company was also negligent would seem equally obvious if we are to accept, as we must, the testimony most favorable to the plaintiff that the motorman had the oncoming automobile in full sight at a distance of 100 to 150 feet, but nevertheless made no attempt to put on his brakes and stop his car until within 30 to 35 feet. Since, however, the plaintiff claims, and the verdict establishes, that Shook was concurrently negligent, — that is to say, by his contributory negligence helped to bring about the accident and thereby to cause Beam’s death, the question arises whether that negligence on the part of Shook was legally imputable to Beam so as to bar the latter’s recovery from the Pittsburgh Railways Company. Where the owner of a car is seated therein by the side of a friend, who, at the owner’s invitation or by his permission, is driving the car, is the owner bound by the driver’s negligence so as to become liable to any person injured thereby, or, by the same token, so as to prevent himself, if injured, from recovering against a third person whose negligence was concurrent with that of the driver?</p>

There the defendant, riding in his own carriage, permitted his guest to drive; there was a collision with another carriage the occupant of which, being injured, sued the defendant and obtained a verdict and judgment against him. The judgment was affirmed. It was admitted that the defendant personally was not guilty of any negligence; there was no evidence that he expressly directed, or tacitly assented to, the manner in which the carriage was driven. The court held, however, that the relation between defendant and his companion, who was driving, was that of master and servant as distinguished from that of bailor and bailee, because the test was whether he had the <em>right to control </em>the manner of driving, that there was nothing to show that he had parted with that right, and that he could have retaken possession of the reins at any moment and the driver was bound to obey his directions or surrender the reins to him.</p>

The reason is that the master is in immediate control over the servant .... The defendant was riding in his automobile, which was driven by his servant.

The plaintiff, a resident of North Carolina, owned an automobile; her husband and brother-in-law wanted to go from North Carolina to New York for a business purpose and plaintiff said that her husband could take the car. As they were about to leave they suggested to her that she take the trip with them and she consented. Her brother-in-law drove the car to a town in Virginia where the husband left the party to pursue his own journey in a bus. The brother-in-law continued to drive, with the plaintiff beside him on the front seat, and negligently collided with a bus of the defendant company. Plaintiff was injured and brought suit against the defendant, but a verdict obtained by her was reversed although the negligence of the driver of the bus was assumed. The court held that plaintiff originally had bailed the car to her husband, but that the bailment ceased when he left the car in Virginia, and from that point on the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>situation was merely that of an owner of a car seated beside a person driving it with the owner’s permission.

The Court, reviewing the authorities, said: “Here, appellee [the plaintiff] had at all times the right to refuse her brother-in-law permission to continue driving her car and had the right to direct the manner in which he should drive and to so control his driving as to prevent injuries to herself or others .... ‘There is a <em>presump</em>tion, not here rebutted, that an owner present in his car has power to control it.’ ”</p>

Again, the owner may have loaned or hired out his car to another person by what amounts to a bailment, in which case the owner, even if riding in the car, may have relinquished his rights as owner; cf. <em>Von Cannon v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., </em>supra. Or, again, the owner may, by word or action, have expressly or impliedly transferred his right of control to the driver; where there is <em>evidence </em>of any such words, actions or conduct on the part of the owner, or any other circumstances bearing on the question as to whether he in fact surrendered his right of control, the question becomes, of course, a factual one for determination by the jury.</p>

All that it discloses is that the automobile belonged to Beam, that when Beam and Shook left the first tavern which they visited Beam asked Shook “to go with him”, and that, at the time of the accident, Shook, according to the finding of the jury, was driving. There is not a shred of evidence as to any conduct, words, actions, understandings or arrangements between the two of them to throw any light whatever on the circumstances under which Shook took the wheel. As already stated, Shook insists that Beam himself was driving the car when the accident occurred, but, accepting the jury’s finding that it was Shook who was driving, all we know is that Beam, the owner was seated on the front seat beside him. To that situation, therefore, there is directly applicable the second rule stated above, namely, that “There is a <em>presumption, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, </em>that an owner present in his ear has power to control it.” It would be flying in the face of all the authorities to hold that merely by allowing Shook to drive the car Beam made him a bailee of the automobile and completely abnegated his right of control over the operation of his own car. Plaintiff’s statement of claim alleged that Beam was a “guest passenger,” but there is not a word of testimony to indicate that Beam had relegated himself to the status of a “guest” in his own automobile and had actually bailed or turned over to Shook the car and the exclusive charge and control thereof.

Only if Beam had entirely relinquished his right of control as owner and deliberately made himself a “guest” in his own car would the principle of imputability of the driver’s negligence have become inapplicable.
