      <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>The Parking Authority Law of June 5, 1947 P. L. 458, sec. 5, 53 PS 10275, as amended, states that Parking Authorities hereafter created are <em>agencies </em>of the Commonwealth and are not to be deemed instrumen-talities of the city or' engaged in the performance of a municipal function.' Appellant: contends that it is a general rule of law that a statute enacted by the Legislature is not applicable to the Commonwéalth. Hence, it argues that, since <em>agencies </em>of the sovereign are in reality .the sovereign itself, the Act of 1913 does not apply to <em>petitionerJones v. Talham, </em><a href="/pa/20/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="972325" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0398-01">20 Pa. 398</a>; <em>Cul-ver v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/348/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="348 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="1220308" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0472-01">348 Pa. 472</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%2064" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="35 A.2d 64">35 A. 2d 64</a>. But this rule applies only when dealing, with possible derogation of the rights, prerogatives or- property of the Commonwealth. It is true that this rule applies where there is a conflict between the sovereign power of the Commonwealth and the private rights of individuals, or whether the sovereign intended to make itself liable for torts, of its servants, or whether the sovereign intended to pay interest on its obligations. But the present case does not fall within any of. those situations. In this case the Commonwealth’s rights, prerogatives or property are not in question. It is obvious that the Legislature by the Act of 1913 .was setting forth a declaration of public policy. To require separate bids on the various items hereinbefore set forth was in compliance with such declared public policy. In <em>Tragesser v. Cooper ,et. al., </em><a href="/pa/313/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="313 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="1152608" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0010-01">313 Pa. 10</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20376" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="169 A. 376">169 A. 376</a>, this Court stated that the Act is an expression by the Legislature of public policy.- We said in that case concerning a similar statute: “Being a public policy, it must be applied wherever it fits, and is not to be excluded unless the intention to exclucle it is clearly made to appear.” Such a statement applies with equal force to the Act of 1913. It is unrealistic to suppose that the Legislature would pass an act declaring a public policy but intend the Act not to apply to its own agencies. If such were <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the intent it would be required to be set forth clearly and unequivocally. In 59 C. J., Statutes, Sec. 653, p. 1104, it is stated: “. . . the state may have the benefit of general laws, and the general rule has been declared not to apply to statutes made for the public good, . . . and the prevention of injury and wrong.”</p>
    <p id="b52-4" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[239,653,1155,647]]]'>It was said in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Attorney General v.

It is true that the general rule in England is that the king is not bound by a statute if he be not named in it. But this rule has many exceptions. All statutes made to suppress wrong, to take away fraud, to prevent the decay of religion, to prevent tortious usurpations, or to secure to electors the right to make free election, are excepted out of this rule in England, and bind the king although he be not named: 5 Coke’s Bep. 14 <em>b; </em>Dwarris on Statutes, 27, 28.”</p>

Section 18 of the Act of 1947 provides that “All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.” Section 5(b) (10) of the Act provides that Parking Authorities are given all powers necessary or convenient for carrying out their purposes including the power “. . . To make contracts of <em>every name and, nature </em>. . . .” (emphasis supplied) Section 11 (e) provides: “Subject to the foregoing provisions any Authority may, but without intending by this provision to limit any powers of such Authority, enter into and carry out such contracts or establish or comply with such rules and regulations concerning labor and materials and other related matters in connection with any project or portion thereof as the Authority may deem desirable, or as may be requested by any Federal <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>agency that may assist in the financing of such project or any part thereof . . . .”</p>

L. 1019, Art. VII, sec. 91, 46 PS 591) reads: “In all other cases, a later law shall not be construed to repeal an earlier law unless the two laws be irreconcilable.” Cf. <em>Commonwealth v. Crowl, </em><a href="/pa/245/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="245 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="326059" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0554-01">245 Pa. 554</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20A.%20922" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="91 A. 922">91 A. 922</a>; <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Curry, <a href="/pa/285/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="285 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1095078" data-case-paths="/pa/285/0289-01">285 Pa. 289</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=132%20A.%20370" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="132 A. 370">132 A. 370</a>.

The provisions of the two Acts here in question are not repugnant to each other. The authority is not prohibited from entering into contracts <em>"of every name and nature” </em>with any of the four contractors named in the Act. Nor does the statutory provision that the Authority may enter into any contract that it “may deem desirable” mean that despite the terms of the Act of <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>1913, the Authority may, nevertheless, enter into a general contract for the entire work. The contracts are specifically limited by the Parking Authority Law to those entered into “upon proper terms.” To say that petitioner is granted the power to enter into <em>any </em>contract with any individual or person is to place undue importance upon the words “of every name and nature.” Such words must be read in the light of the Act of 1913 requiring separate bids. It is noted that the Parking Authority Law does not state that petitioner has authority to enter into any contract with <em>any </em>individual. The words “of every name and nature” define the type or kind of contract which can be entered into, whereas the Act of 1913 limits the category or type of bidder with whom the Authority can contract. The two Acts are not irreconcilable. Their terms considered in the light of the stated underlying public policy are consistent and harmonious. Statutes will not be presumed to make any changes in prior existing law beyond that which is necessary to carry out the purposes of the new legislation: <em>Heaney v. Mauch Chunk Borough, </em><a href="/pa/322/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="322 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="1167889" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0487-01">322 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20732" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="185 A. 732">185 A. 732</a>.</p>

Petitioner maintains that because any buildings constructed will be financed by private funds they cannot be public buildings. The Legislature has declared that the health, safety, and general welfare of the public require the free circulation of traffic and that therefore “such purposes are hereby declared to be public uses for which public money may be spent and private property may be acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.” Section 15 of the Act confers a general tax exemption upon any property acquired or used by petitioner because “. . . such Authorities will be performing essential governmental functions in effectuating such purposes. . . .” It was stated in <em>McSorley v. Fitzgerald et al., </em><a href="/pa/359/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="359 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="473082" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0264-01">359 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20142" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="59 A.2d 142">59 A. 2d 142</a>, <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>where the Court was considering the Parking Authority Law, p. 270: “It is no constitutional objection to the statute, nor does it derogate from the public character of its objective, that the Authority will to some extent conduct what may heretofore have been regarded as a private enterprise .... What the court holds, therefore, is that where, as here, the contemplated use of property is in aid of, and ancillary to, the exercise of the police power, the public nature of such use is conclusively determined, and therefore the State may, where the use of the highways is hampered by a local lack of parking facilities, authorize the municipal acquisition and operation of publicly owned and operated parking facilities reasonably calculated to alleviate that condition.”</p>
