    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.9",321,[166,778,1155,256]]]'>Relator, Henry Paylor, has petitioned this Court, as a matter of <em>original jurisdiction, </em>for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>seeking his release and discharge from the Western State Penitentiary. The reasons assigned may be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.10",321,[168,1062,1153,587]]]'>Relator was arrested May 5,1944. He was indicted; an attorney was appointed by the court to represent him; and after trial he was convicted and sentenced on June 13, 1944 upon the following charges: <em>Rape. </em>(sentence: fine 6%c; costs; 7% to 15 years from May 5, 1944); <em>Robbery, receiving stolen goods, </em>(fine 614c; costs; 5 to 10 years from expiration of sentence for rape); according to the petition, defendant was also sentenced to pay a fine of 6^40; pay costs; imprisonment 2)4 to 5 years, to begin and take effect at expiration of above sentence.</p>

    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[245,635,1156,536]]]'>The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is regarded as the greatest and most important remedy known to the law. It is the precious safeguard of personal liberty. There is no higher duty than to maintain it unimpaired. It is a civil remedy rather than a criminal proceeding regardless of whether the prisoner is detained under civil or criminal process. For a review of the origin and history of the writ and its issuance and use see cases cited in 39 C. J. S. p. 421 et seq.; 25 American Jurisprudence p. 139 et seq.</p>
