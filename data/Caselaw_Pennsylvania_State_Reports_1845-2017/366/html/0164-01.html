However, tbe unconsumed property was actually worth only $104,118.47 <em>as of the date of the life tenant’s death. </em>Tbe indicated loss in value, to wit, $60,435.01, was due entirely to depreciation in market value.

In the very nature of the testamentary problem, it cannot be said dogmatically that, in all instances, a bequest for life with power to consume automatically creates a debtor and creditor relation between a life tenant and the remaindermen. In <em>DuPuy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/346/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="346 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1216399" data-case-paths="/pa/346/0143-01">346 Pa. 143</a>, 150, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.2d%20689" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="29 A.2d 689">29 A. 2d 689</a>, where <em>Powell’s Estate, </em>supra, was advanced in support of the remaindermen’s contention that the consuming life tenant was chargeable with the depreciation in the value of the testator’s property while it was in her hands, our late brother, Mr. Justice Linn, <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>pointedly declared for tbis court that, “A testator may give a legal life estate and provide that the debtor-creditor rule shall not be applied but that the remain-dermen shall take the risk of depreciation in value.” And, it was there further recognized that a testator may so provide by implication as well as by direct expression. It is true that in <em>DuPuy’s Estate </em>the will there involved constituted the life tenant a trustee for the remaindermen while, here, the testator did not employ technical terms from which a trust could be inferred. But, that distinction does not make the cardinal rule of construction as to the conclusiveness of the testator’s indicated intent any less applicable.</p>

As the law stood in 1926 when he executed his will, a life tenant <em>with power to consume </em>had never been held to be a debtor of the remaindermen. Such a life tenant was then spoken of as a “quasi trustee” for herself and the remaindermen: <em>Watson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/241/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="241 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="976008" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0271-01">241 Pa. 271</a>, 280, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20433" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="88 A. 433">88 A. 433</a>; and, the remainderman was <em>not </em>a creditor of a life tenant having a right of consumption: see <em>Metz’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/323/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="323 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1169576" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0241-01">323 Pa. 241</a>, 242, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20740" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="185 A. 740">185 A. 740</a>. The rule of debtor-creditor relationship, which has pertained to an ordinary life tenancy,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> was not extended to a life tenancy <em>with power of consumption </em>until the decision in <em>Powell’s Estate </em>in 1941. The testator cannot, therefore, be presumed to have intended to impose a legal liability upon his wife, as life tenant, which extant rules of construction did not then impose on the character of life estate which he bequeathed. In <em>Hood v. Pennsylvania Society to Protect Children from </em>Cruelty, <a href="/pa/221/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="221 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="956190" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0474-01">221 Pa. 474</a>, 479-480, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.%20845" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="70 A. 845">70 A. 845</a>, this court pertinently said, — “It is quite true . . . that <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>when a judicial decision is rendered the law is not presumed to be changed by it, but to have'been the same before as after, although previous decisions may have been to a different effect. This is the general rule, but it is not to he applied in all cases without discrimination. On the subject of interpretation of wills it meets the cardinal and controlling principle that the intention of the testator must prevail ... In the present case, therefore, as in all others, the question is, what was the intention of the testator, and that is to be ascertained by what the testator understood to be the legal meaning of his language at the time he used it.”</p>

Lyman, to whom the testator repeatedly refers in his will as “my dear wife” (see paragraph IN, supra, and paragraphs II and III in footnote 1, ante), was clearly the primary object of his bounty as the learned auditing judge correctly found. The testator devised and bequeathed to his wife, absolutely and in fee simple, his residence property in Philadelphia; his recreation camp in the Adirondacks; all of the household goods, silverware and furnishings of every description contained in the two premises; and all of his jewelry, automobiles and equipment of every nature. He then gave his wife his residuary estate for life with power of consumption and constituted her the <em>sole </em>judge in determining what her necessary wants were. There is not the slightest indication in the will that the testator intended to make his widow a debtor of the remaindermen for the unconsumed residuary estate at its originally appraised valuation. In the light of the express terms of the will, the testator could not have thought that a debtor and creditor relationship between his wife and the remaindermen with respect to his residuary estate could arise during the lifetime of the widow. He deliberately postponed creation of the gift to the remaindermen until “from and immediately after the decease of my dear wife”; and what they <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>then took was an interest in what “may be left at the time of her decease.” Throughout, the will breathes a paramount solicitude for the comfort and economic welfare of the testator’s widow. If it be said that the same was true in <em>Powell’s Estate </em>and <em>Bays Estate} </em>supra, the answer is evident. It is a far .different thing to find, if the <em>intent of the testator </em>be given due and appropriate effect, that he intended the primary object of his bounty to have the capital gains on the corpus of a life estate, <em>which she has the power to consume, </em>than it is to conclude that he intended to impose upon such primary beneficiary liability for depreciation in the value of the corpus on the basis of a rule ■of construction that did not exist when he executed his will. The testamentary intent in the present instance is clear. The remaindermen were to take merely what was left of the testator’s residuary estate, in the ■form and at the value, as it existed upon Mrs. Lyman’s death. There is ho occasion for resort to rules of construction. As was said by Mr. Justice Linn in <em>Gordon Estate, </em><a href="/pa/360/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="360 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="475017" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0325-01">360 Pa. 325</a>, 330, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20849" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="61 A.2d 849">61 A. 2d 849</a>, — “. . . it. is elementary that such rules are never applied to defeat the expressed intention of a testator.” Manifestly, such intention cannot justly be ascertained by an ex post facto rule of construction.</p>

It is predicated chiefly <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>upon the testator’s grant of the right of the life tenant to consume, coupled with his expressions of affection for his wife, the life tenant. Such considerations, however, are not based upon testator’s <em>express </em>words, but upon what the majority <em>assume </em>he must have intended. It is a well established rule requiring no citation of authority that in the construction of a will it is not what testator may have meant but the meaning of the language used. The majority also state in the opinion: “As the law stood in 1926 when [testator] executed his will, a life tenant <em>with power to consume </em>had never been held to be a debtor of the remaindermen”, wherefore testator’s intention is to be determined as of the date of the execution of the will. But such doctrine cannot be applied in this case. This present will obviously is professionally drawn. It contains technical terms: “life estate”, “fee simple”, “residuary”, “remainder” and the like.
