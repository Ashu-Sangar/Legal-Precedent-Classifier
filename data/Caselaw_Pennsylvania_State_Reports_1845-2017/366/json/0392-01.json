To what Judge Gibson has so well said we merely add that the title to the stock in question had passed to a decedent and was in his possession at his death. His executor, who now holds possession, is under the control and supervision of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The title is being attacked as voidable because of material misrepresentations. The action to rescind is therefore exclusively in the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court and not in any court of general equity jurisdiction.\nDecree affirmed at the appellants\u2019 costs.",
