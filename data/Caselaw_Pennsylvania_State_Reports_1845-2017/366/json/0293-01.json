        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Chidsey,\nMichael P. Howlett, a resident of Philadelphia, died on February 21, 1921, leaving a will executed on July 11, 1907, in which he created a trust of his residuary estate for payment of the net income in equal shares to his seven children during their lives, the share of income of any child dying during the continuance of the trust to be paid to such child\u2019s \u201cissue\u201d, or in default of issue, to surviving children and the issue of deceased children.\nJohn J. Howlett, a son died on September 28, 1947, during the lifetime of the trust, leaving no issue of the body but an adopted daughter, Mary M. Moyer. The adoption occurred on November 27, 1897. John J. How-lett was a cotrustee and following his death an account was filed, upon the audit of which it was adjudicated that the income which he had been receiving as a life tenant was payable after his death to the five surviving children of the testator and the issue of a deceased child. From the dismissal by the court en bane of exceptions filed to the adjudication this appeal has been taken by Mary M. Moyer, her adult children and a trustee and guardian ad litem for her minor and unborn descendants, appointed in connection with the determination of the legal question involved.\nAppellants rely upon Section 16(b) of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS \u00a7228 which reads: \u201cWhenever in any will a bequest or devise shall be made to the child or children of any person other than the testator, without naming such child or children, such bequest or devise shall be construed to include any adopted child or children of such other person who were adopted before the date of the will, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u201d\nIt is earnestly urged that the adoption here having occurred prior to the execution of the will, this section of the Wills Act of 1917 which was effective prior to the testator\u2019s death is applicable and award of the John J. Howlett share of the income should have been made to his adopted daughter, Mary M. Moyer. Recognition of the principle that in effect and operation a will speaks as though executed immediately before death, would lend force to appellant\u2019s contention if testator had directed that upon the death of any of his children such deceased child\u2019s share of the income should be enjoyed by the latter\u2019s child or children, but he did not so provide. Paragraph Eighth of the testator\u2019s will which establishes the residuary trust (after providing annuities not here material) continues: \u201c. . . as follows:\u25a0 \u2014 -to my children in equal shares from time to time during their lives, and upon the death before or after my death of any child leaving issue him or her surviving the share of the income which such child had been receiving or would have received if living shall be paid to the issue of such child as they shall survive from time to time during the continuance of this trust; and upon the death of any of my four children, Catharine Wilson, John J. Howlett, Margaret A. Walsh or M. Frances Howlett, dying without leaving issue him or her surviving the share of the income which any of them was entitled to shall be divided in equal shares and paid from time to time to all the others of my then surviving children and the issue of any deceased child. . . . The said trust shall terminate upon the death of the survivor of the following named persons: [naming his seven children and others], and upon such termination, the. principal of my estate shall be converted into cash or otherwise divided by my Trustees into just and convenient portions, and paid or transferred and conveyed in equal shares unto my grandchildren then surviving and the issue of any grandchild then deceased, absolutely, the number of shares being that of the number of my children who shall have left issue then surviving, and so that each group of grandchildren, including the issue of deceased grandchildren, shall take the share which they represent through one of my children, my intention being that such distribution and division shall be per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\n\u201cIssue\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cchildren\u201d. \u201cIssue\u201d means issue of the body, offspring, progeny, natural children, physically born or begotten by the person named as parent: Ashhurst\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. Superior Ct. 526, 3 A. 2d 218; and see Coble\u2019s Estate, 58 D. & C. 632. An adopted child is issue of his natural parents and not of his adopted ones: Russell\u2019s Estate, 284 Pa. 164, 130 A. 319; Taylor Estate, 357 Pa. 120, 53 A. 2d 136.\nAt common law adopted children had no right of inheritance whatsoever from their adopting parents. All such rights are purely statutory. The Wills Act of 1947 has greatly expanded the rights of adopted children, but this is the culmination of legislative advance step by step in this direction, which the courts may not anticipate. See Russell\u2019s Estate, supra. The \u00a1effect and operation of the will here involved must be determined under the Wills Act of 1917, the statutory provision effective at the time of its probate.\nAppellants contend, however, that when the whole will is considered the testator must be found to have intended that Mary M. Moyer, the adopted daughter of testator\u2019s son, John J. Howlett, should succeed to his share of the income. It is pointed out that she was adopted ten years before the testator executed his will and that he made no provision for her unless she takes as an adopted child or grandchild. But as stated in Cave\u2019s Estate, 326 Pa. 358, 359, 192 A. 460, \u201cThe right of adopted children to inherit from kindred of their adoptive parents is dependent entirely upon statutory enactments, and because the 'call of the blood\u2019 is one of the most firmly rooted instincts of human nature, courts tend to a strict construction of such legislation. In tbe absence of a plain legislative mandate to tbe contrary a stranger to tbe adoption proceedings sbonld not bave bis property diverted from its natural course of descent to tbe beirs of bis blood;...\u201d.\nIt is a cardinal principle that in tbe interpretation of a will tbe intention of tbe testator must prevail and sucb intention ascertained from wbat the testator understood to be tbe legal meaning of tbe language be used in writing it: Hood v. Pennsylvania Society to Protect Children from Cruelty, 221 Pa. 474, 70 A. 845; Estate of Fannie C. Lyman, 366 Pa. 164, 76 A. 2d 633.\nTo tbe layman as well as to tbe lawyer \u201cissue\u201d has meant actual physical offspring as distinguished from \u201cchildren\u201d which may mean natural, adopted, foster or stepchildren.\nAppellants contend that tbe testator intended tbe word \u201cissue\u201d to be synonymous with \u201cchildren\u201d because in paragraph Eighth of the will, upon termination of tbe trust, tbe principal of tbe estate is to be paid unto \u201cmy grandchildren then surviving and tbe issue of any grandchildren then deceased, absolutely . . .\u201d. But tbe language continues, \u201ctbe number of shares being that of tbe number of my children who shall bave left issue then surviving, and so that each group of grandchildren, including tbe issue of deceased grandchildren, shall take tbe share which they represent through one of my children, my intention being that sucb distribution and division shall be per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d Use of the words \u201cgrandchild\u201d and \u201cgrandchildren\u201d in tbe disposition of tbe corpus of tbe trust does not indicate that tbe testator meant \u201cchildren\u201d when be used tbe word \u201cissue\u201d in disposing of tbe income of a child. Tbe testator\u2019s understanding of tbe word \u201cissue\u201d is made clear by the Eleventh paragraph of bis will which reads: \u201cI direct that tbe word issue whenever used in this will shall be construed to mean the lawful descendants of tbe person named or described, so that those of tlie same degree in descent shall take equally and those of a more remote degree shall take by representation' of a deceased ancestor, such taking to be either of principal at the period of distribution, or of income whenever from time to time a death may occur before my death or during the continuance of a trust estate, and so that the issue as thus defined shall always represent and take the share which the deceased ancestor would have taken if living.\u201d\n\u201cDescendants\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d are synonymous: Waln\u2019s Estate, 189 Pa. 631, 42 A. 299; Ashhurst\u2019s Estate, supra; Coble\u2019s Estate, supra.\nDecree affirmed; all costs to be paid out of the trust estate.",
