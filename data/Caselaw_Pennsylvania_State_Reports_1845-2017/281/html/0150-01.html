    <p id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.10",176,[286,999,1159,852]]]'>The plaintiff, Davis, entered into an agreement with Hillman, defendant, under the terms of which certain coal land in Washington County was to be acquired, and, in pursuance of the alleged understanding, bought it for the sum of $574,257.64, the necessary purchase money being advanced by the latter. It was claimed by the former that one-half of any profits which might accrue on a resale were to be paid to him. Hillman denied the existence of such an agreement, and suit was brought in 1921 to recover fifty per cent of the increase which it was averred could have been obtained by disposing of the property on a royalty- basis, the statement setting forth, that, had the proposed lease been consummated for the amount offered, large gains would have resulted, and to a share of this sum plaintiff insisted he was entitled.</p>
    <p id="b176-7" data-blocks='[["BL_176.11",176,[285,1872,1157,425]]]'>An affidavit of defense was filed, raising the legal question as to the effect of the statute of frauds, and the contention of the defendant that the alleged contract was unenforceable was upheld by the lower court, when it then ordered, “The judgment to be entered is tantamount to a judgment of compulsory nonsuit,” and thereafter directed an order in favor of the defendant, from which no appeal was taken.</p>

In 1924, his counsel caused a discontinuance of his suit to be filed in the court of common pleas. This was followed by a petition to strike the entry off, for the reason that it had been made without notice, and, if allowed to remain, the rights of the defendant would be jeopardized, since this action would make possible the institution of another suit for the same cause, — twice dismissed for legal reasons, as hereinbefore noted. The disputed question was heard, and the learned court below refused the relief asked, and it is from this order that the present appeal was taken by Hillman.</p>
    <p id="b177-5" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[201,1285,1151,538]]]'>It will be observed that the decree rendered in the original action was not brought up for review. The same legal defense was raised later in the second case, but in the order entered in 1923, though the legal contention of the defendant is sustained, no formal judgment in his favor appears. It is true that an appeal therefrom was taken, but the order was of such character as to make consideration by this court impossible at that time: Miller Paper Co. v. Keystone C. &amp; C. Co., <a href="/pa/275/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="275 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1075642" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0040-01">275 Pa. 40</a>, 44; Bonner v.

L. 483, when the claim filed is not sufficiently specific, the appropriate remedy is a rule for a more detailed narration of facts, to be followed by a motion for non-pros if the court makes the rule absolute and its order to file a supplemental statement is not complied with: Rhodes v. Terheyden, <a href="/pa/272/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="272 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1068333" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0397-01">272 Pa. 397</a>.

A like rule also applies where the legal objection, which it suggests, is not upheld; then the defendant must be given a chance to set up his defense on the merits. In either case, the matter is not finally disposed of until a formal judgment is entered by the court below. The requisite procedure was not followed here, and all that we have on the record is the direction that the statutory demurrer filed be sustained. Had the defendant seen fit, he could have entered a rule for final judgment, which doubtless would have been made absolute, after opportunity given the plaintiff to amend, if deemed necessary, but no such course was adopted.</p>

Ordinarily, consent to terminate an action should be preliminarily secured, but, where it is actually recorded, there is a presumption that it was approved. If, upon application, the court refuses to disregard it, it is further to be presumed that tribunal believed the action to be proper, and, in the absence of abuse of judicial discretion, its order will be upheld. This rule was early recognized in Pennsylvania (Schuylkill Bank v. Macalester, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 147" data-case-ids="480089" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0147-01">6 W. &amp; S. 147</a>), and has been followed in our later cases: Com. v.

This overlooks the fact that no formal judgment for the defendant was entered in the second suit, and no appeal was taken from the order in the first. Defendant had the right, under the Practice Act, to ask that this be done, and had such order been secured and remained unappealed from, the plain<a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>tiff; would in the future have been debarred from making the same claim against the defendant.
