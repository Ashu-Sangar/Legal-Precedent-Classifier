Sheaffer, distiller of liquors in the City of Lancaster, was assessed a revenue tax of $43,016.40 by the federal government; it was unpaid when the warehouse and whiskey was destroyed by fire. The government refused to abate the tax; Sheaffer’s effects were seized, and proceedings begun to enforce collection. About the same time executions were issued by others, and Sheaffer’s personal property was levied on. David B. Landis was the responsible surety on the bond for the payment of taxes, and the one to whom all parties looked for relief. An agreement was made between Sheaffer and Landis, consented to by the execution creditors, wherein it was recited that, as “all parties desire to prevent sacrifice of the property and sale of the same under seizure,” Sheaffer should turn over the real and personal property to Landis. Private sale thereof was to be made by or through Landis, who, after having “realized the entire amount of revenue tax paid by him, together with the interest and costs thereon, he shall reconvey, assign, transfer and set over unto Sheaffer” any balance. It was further stated in the agreement that, “if, at any time, the whole of the tax thus paid, or any part thereof, shall be rebated, repaid or remitted to Landis or Sheaf-fer, or both or either of them, by the act of the Internal Revenue Department, or by act of Congress, or by any authority of the United States government, Sheaffer is to receive due credit and allowance for the same, less interest and all costs and expenses, in the matter of accounting between him and Landis,” it being agreed the repayment was to be made to the latter. Landis paid to the government $45,167.22.</p>

Landis made various efforts to have the case reopened, but died in 1898, without accomplishing any<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>thing. His son, Clayton, as administrator, continued this work. Through his efforts, Congress, in 1908, referred the entire matter to the court of claims. (The act will be found in the report of this case.) Under it that court had jurisdiction to try, adjudicate and determine the claim and render judgment in claimant’s favor for such amount as may be found just and due by said court, without regard to the statute of limitations.</p>

Sheaffer’s administrator presented a cross-petition, setting forth there was due the Landis estate only the sum of $11,112.22, and to the Sheaffer estate $34,055. The answer to the cross-petition admitted these averments, and joined in asking the court to report to the United States Senate the sums thus set forth as being due and unpaid to the two estates. An order was accordingly so made and Congress directed the tax to be refunded, the last named sums being paid in 1923, eighteen years after payment by Landis.</p>

But, where a party secondarily liable pays taxes due the government, a claim for interest against the principal is a matter of right.

The proceeding was to determine whether the government unjustly collected a sum of money as revenue when the goods taxed were destroyed by fire. Having decided this payment to be wrong, that court recommended a return of the sum in the respective amounts named in the report. The only matter then before the court of claims was the ascertainment of the amount to be returned, if any. It in no way involved an accounting between the surety and principal. This phase of the matter was governed by the agreement and the decree of the orphans’ court of this State finding a sum due as interest to the Landis estate. The government was not interested in the conflicting claims of principal and surety. Suppose Sheaffer’s claim had been <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>controverted. The court of claims would hardly, under its limited power, determine the relative rights between the parties. Had the full amount of the claim been turned over to Landis’s estate as agreed upon, even with notice to Sheaffer, the former estate could not have retained the entire sum; an accounting was bound to take place through the same medium as Landis now compels it. Landis had, prior to 1899, been reimbursed from sales §34,000; the orphans’ court at that time so found, and it was a matter of record that there was only a balance of §11,000 due to Landis. The act allowing the procedure designated Landis’s estate to receive the money, if any was found to be due. The petition of the latter estate to the court of claims was sufficient to protect all parties, and when Sheaffer’s administrator filed the cross-petition it had a tendency to make federal relief more difficult; moreover, it related to events subsequent to the time of payment to the government.</p>
    <p id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[214,1362,1149,372]]]'>It is quite likely a more favorable consideration would be given to a surety’s claim for tax paid on property destroyed by fire than to a principal’s.

While it may be based on the fact that it arose because of the principal sum paid to and received back from the government, the ascertainment of the latter amount was entirely separate from the claim for interest, counsel fees and accounting between principal and surety. These matters were <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>not before the court of claims. This distinguishes the case from Myers v.
