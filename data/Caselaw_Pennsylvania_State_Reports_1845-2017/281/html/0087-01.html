    <p id="b113-9" data-blocks='[["BL_113.19",113,[181,1718,1149,368]]]'>Perry Township is a school district of the third class. Its directors levied a tax of 25 mills, based on the annual budget, and an additional 17 mills to pay teachers’ salaries. A taxpayer’s bill was filed to enjoin the collection of the latter tax, asserting its illegality. The court below refused to issue the restraining order, hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b113-10" data-blocks='[["BL_113.20",113,[179,2099,1150,317]],["BL_114.1",114,[302,352,1158,371]]]'>School districts are but agencies of the state to accomplish the educational purposes ordained by the legislature, and they act in that capacity with respect to the levy of “school taxes.” Fixing a millage within the maximum is in the nature of a legislative act, the Commonwealth speaking through its selected agents: Min<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>singer v.

The Commonwealth has fixed the tax, leaving to the agents the duty of collecting so much of it as they deem necessary. Section 537 of the School Code permits a levy not to “exceed 25 mills on the dollar.” Standing alone, this would seem to limit the levy. To exceed it the agent must point to an enabling statute permitting the increase.</p>
    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[303,736,1159,755]]]'>The Act of April 28, 1921, P. L. 328, changed this maximum for a given purpose only; this was brought about because of the amendment to the School Code of 1917, P. L. 1235, 1919, P. L. 910, making increases in teachers’ salaries and fixing minimum salaries. The Act of 1921, section 1210, paragraph 24, reads, “.....School directors of school districts of the.....third class..... are hereby authorized and directed to levy annually a tax on each dollar of the total assessment......to pay the minimum salaries and increments of the teaching and supervisory staff provided for herein. Said tax shall not be......affected by reason of the fact that it may increase the total annual school tax levy of any school district beyond the millage fixed or limited by law.”</p>
    <p id="b114-12" data-blocks='[["BL_114.6",114,[303,1501,1158,697]]]'>It is apparent this latter act specifically limits the purposes for which money raised above the general millage can be used. It must be applied to the payment of minimum salaries and increments of the teaching and supervisory staff. This is not disputed; the substantial difference between the parties is, What part of the sum necessary for this purpose may be procured through this tax from taxables of the district? It is appellee’s contention that the full amount necessary to pay the salaries should be included, while appellant takes the position it should be that amount less thirty-five per cent paid by the State, and 17 mills raises a sum in excess of that required.</p>
    <p id="b114-13" data-blocks='[["BL_114.7",114,[304,2211,1156,210]],["BL_115.1",115,[216,340,1154,1033]]]'>The confusion, if any, is based on paragraph 19 of the Act of April 28, 1921, P. L. 328, as amended. This act requires the Commonwealth to pay to third-class school districts for each member of the teaching and super<a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>visory staff 35% of the annual minimum salaries prescribed for the elementary teachers of such districts. The legislation was no doubt adopted in response to the insistent demand from school districts that the burden imposed by minimum salaries was too heavy for them to bear. There is not the slightest doubt the legislature intended to relieve the taxpayers of a part of this additional cost. Section 19 provides, “Of the salaries herein provided for teachers, supervisors, principals and all other members of the teaching and supervisory staff in the public schools,......the Commonwealth shall pay ......to such school [districts]......for each of said persons employed therein, as shown by the certificate ......filed with the Superintendent of Pubic Instruction in the November......preceding......as follows:..... In school districts of the second and third class for each member of the teaching and supervisory staff thirty-five per centum (35%) of the annual minimum salary prescribed herein for elementary teachers.”</p>

Paragraphs 21, 22 and 23 provide the time and manner in which payment should be made. This act is effective “during the two fiscal years beginning June 1,1923, ending May 31, 1925, and each biennium thereafter.” The basis of payment under the act for the first year is fixed by the certificate filed with the superintendent in the preceding November. While the initial payment may not be governed by the minimum salaries actually paid and provided in the act, the legislature has adopted what to it was the most available procedure and time for the act to begin. This does not in the least destroy the act’s effectiveness. If the initial payment does not meet in full the 35% of the minimum salaries to be paid by the state, it may be made up under the general provision for taxation. The state is required to pay during specified months of each year.</p>

If this is to be done, the school district cannot levy a tax to meet the entire minimum salaries, and, after receiving the State’s money paid on account of minimum salaries, place it in the general fund to be used indiscriminately for any purpose the school directors may see fit. If directors may compel taxables to pay the 35% in addition to the 65% they are required to pay, the purpose of the legislature will be wholly thwarted. This we should not permit.</p>
