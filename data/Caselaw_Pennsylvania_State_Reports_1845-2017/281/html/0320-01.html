Defendant acquired the entire property in which the storeroom was located and its agent negotiated with plaintiff for a further leasing of the room. A lease for three years was <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>signed. It contained a provision that the lessee should “use the premises only for the sale of fruit, candy, soda water,” etc., with the further stipulation that “it is expressly understood that the tenant is not allowed to sell tobacco in any form, under penalty of instant forfeiture of this lease.” The document was prepared following a discussion about renting the room between the parties and after an agreement to lease had been reached. It was signed after it had been left in plaintiff’s hands and admittedly had been read over to him by two persons, one of whom was his daughter.</p>
    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[294,957,1161,862]]]'>Plaintiff sets up that in the course of his dealings with defendant’s agent it was agreed that, in consideration of his promises not to sell tobacco and to pay an increased rent, and for entering into the agreement as a whole, he should have the exclusive right to sell soft drinks in the building. No such stipulation is contained in the written lease. Shortly after it was signed, defendant demised the adjoining room in the building to a drug company without restricting the latter’s right to sell soda water and soft drinks. Alleging thát this was in violation of the contract which defendant had made with him and that the sale of these beverages by the drug company had greatly reduced his receipts and profits, plaintiff brought this action for damages for breach of the alleged oral contract and was permitted to recover. Defendant has appealed.</p>

Plaintiff called one witness who said he heard defendant’s agent say to plaintiff, at a time admittedly several days before the execution of the lease, that he would have the exclusive right to sell soda water and soft drinks, to which the latter replied if that was the case he accepted the tenancy. Plaintiff produced no witness who was present when the contract was <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>executed to corroborate Ms statement as to what then occurred.
