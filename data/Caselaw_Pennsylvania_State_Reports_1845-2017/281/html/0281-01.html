    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.12",307,[206,1004,1155,912]]]'>Paul K. McCormick and W. D. Hunter were candidates for nomination on the Republican ticket for the office of representative in the General Assembly from the Third Legislative District of Westmoreland County, at a primary election held April 22, 1924. The returns showed a majority of votes for McCormick. He moved to quash the petition for contest: (1) because it failed to aver that the will of the qualified electors was not correctly expressed by the votes as returned; (2) because no prior appeal had been taken to the common pleas from the return of the computation board; and (3) because the record showed the petition had been presented to an additional law judge instead of to the president judge of the court below. These points were sustained and, in addition, the opinion of the learned president judge indicates the view that his tribunal has no jurisdiction of such a contest.</p>
    <p id="b307-8" data-blocks='[["BL_307.13",307,[211,1935,1150,255]]]'>While the petition does not contain the express averment first above referred to, all its allegations are to the effect that the will of the qualified electors is not correctly shown by the returns as made; and this is quite sufficient.</p>

L. 1125, 1129, provides that “Contests of primaries shall originate and be conducted as in cases of election.” This provision is sufficient to bring tbe laws regulating election contests into tbe primary system, in so far as sucb laws are adaptable: Greenfield Avenue Case, <a href="/pa/191/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="191 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="907017" data-case-paths="/pa/191/0290-01">191 Pa. 290</a>, 295, 297; James Smith W.

Then, section 11 of the Act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 211, plainly states that “Contested elections of......members of tbe House of Representatives shall be tried and determined by tbe court of common pleas;” and section 12 provides that, “Upon petition......complaining of an undue election or false return......tbe court, if in session, or tbe president judge thereof, if in vacation, shall immediately appoint a suitable time for tbe bearing in open court of sucb complaint; and if tbe court is not in session, tbe president judge to whom sucb complaint is made, shall direct tbe court to convene for that purpose.” Section 14 provides that “tbe court shall, without unnecessary delay, decide which of tbe candidates voted for received tbe greatest number of legal votes and is entitled to tbe certificate of election”; or, here, in a primary election contest, tbe certificate of nomination.</p>

Upon return day, it would be for the court as a whole (it not being in vacation) to discharge the rule or make it absolute; and, if the latter should be done, to fix the time for hearing, as provided in the statute.</p>
