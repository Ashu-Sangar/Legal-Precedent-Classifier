On March 17, 1924, defendant, pending dispositiofi by the court below of a rule to show cause why he should not be adjudged in contempt for failure to comply with the final decree, took exceptions for the first time as follows: “Defendant......excepts to the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law and to the decree of the court in the above entitled case.” These general exceptions, though permitted by the trial judge, do not comply with the equity rules and can have no effect: Harris v.

Rule 70 provides: “If no exceptions are filed, all objections <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>shall be deemed to have been waived, and the decree nisi shall be entered as the final decree, by the prothonotary, as of course.” This means, if no exceptions are filed in compliance with Rule 69. Rule 71 is as follows: “If exceptions are filed, they shall be placed upon the argument list......and heard by the court in banc, which shall sustain or dismiss them in whole or in part, and affirm, modify or change the decree nisi accordingly.” The so-called exceptions in this case were not placed on the argument list nor acted on by the court in banc, though the plain purpose of this rule is to afford the court below an opportunity to change or modify, not only its findings of fact and conclusions of law, but also the decree nisi, if such a course be deemed proper: Beatty v.
