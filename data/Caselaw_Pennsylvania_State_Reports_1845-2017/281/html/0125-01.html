Before receiving the one-half, however, defendant notified plaintiff of its refusal to receive the balance, and, as to that, repudiated the contract. On the other hand, plaintiff insisted on defendant receiving the remaining one thousand cases and finally placed same in a storage warehouse at Milwaukee and tendered defendant the receipt therefor, which the latter refused to accept. Thereupon plaintiff brought this suit and claimed the contract price of the commodity, on the contention that the title had vested in the purchaser.

The contract was executory; in other words, it was not a purchase of existing specific property, but an agreement to purchase unascertained and nonexistent goods, to be thereafter produced; the case therefore, falls within Rule 4, clause 1, of section 19, of the Sales Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. 543, 548, that: “Where there is a contract to sell unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.” Thereunder, <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>in the case of future goods, the title does not pass until they are ascertained and set aside by the act or consent of both parties. In Conard v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/214/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="214 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="946067" data-case-paths="/pa/214/0098-01">214 Pa. 98</a>, Mr. Justice Mestrezat, for the court, says (p. 102) : “In cases like the present, where personal property of a certain description is purchased but not identified or selected from a mass of the property of the vendor, the contract is executory and incomplete and the title to it remains in the vendor. As soon, however, as the purchaser makes a selection of a particular part of the property in pursuance of his contract and his act is approved by the vendor, the sale is complete and the title of the vendor is divested.” To pass the title, the seller’s appropriation of the goods must be assented to by the buyer: Uniform Laws Annotated, vol. 1, Sales Act, p. 102; Funt v.

In the instant case, defendant made no selection of the goods and refused those plaintiff claims to have set aside. In case of such refusal, sub-section 3, of sec. 64, of the Sales Act, P. L. 561, provides: “Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances showing proximate damage of a greater amount, the difference between the contract price and the market price or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the refusal to accept.” Sauerkraut is a well known article of food with a market value, as plaintiff’s own evidence shows, hence, sub-section 3 of sec. 63 of said act, P. L. 561, that “Although the property in the goods has not pased, if they cannot readily be resold for a rea<a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>sonable price, and, if the provisions of section sixty-four [four] are not applicable, the seller may offer to deliver the goods to the buyer, and, if the buyer refuses to receive them, may notify the buyer that the goods are thereafter held by the seller as bailee for the buyer. Thereafter the seller may treat the goods as the buyer’s, and may maintain an action for the price,” does not apply. The sub-section last quoted made no material change in the law, for where an article, without market value, has been made to order for a specific purpose, like a suit of clothes, or a special type of engine, it may be tendered to the buyer and the agreed price recovered from him: Ballentine et al. v. Robinson et al., <a href="/pa/46/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="46 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="420614" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0177-01">46 Pa. 177</a>.
