On the audit of the fourth account of the trustee of the Henry G. Freeman estate (after the death of his last surviving child), the auditing judge, affirmed by the orphans’ court, awarded the Robert O.

Both wills provide that those entitled to the income immediately before the death of Henry G. Freeman’s last surviving child shall share in the principal. Appellant’s contention is based on the use of the word “deceasing” in place of the more common word “deceased” in the James Black Freeman will, but we agree with the orphans’ court that such fact does not justify a different <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>construction. As to this branch of the case we adopt the language of the auditing judge as follows: “It is a rule of law that if a bequest be made to a person absolute in the first instance and it is provided in the event of death or death without issue another legatee or legatees shall be substitued for the share or legacy so given, it shall be construed to mean ‘death or death without issue before the testator.’ See Mickley’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>, and McAlpin’s Est., <a href="/pa/211/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="211 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="940081" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0026-01">211 Pa. 26</a>. In Neubert v. Col-well, <a href="/pa/219/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="219 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1002777" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0248-01">219 Pa. 248</a>, the rule is thus stated: ‘The general rule is that, after an absolute devise in fee, a provision that in case of the death of the devisee without issue or without issue living at the time of his death, or similar phrase, then over to another, is not a limitation or curtailment of the prior devise, but is alternative or substitutionary and could take effect only upon the death of the first devisee in the lifetime of the testator.’ The question is, does the use of the word ‘deceasing’ give rise to any different construction? In the Century Dictionary ‘deceasing’ is said to be a present participle. It refers to the present and not to the future, and since there is nothing in the will of James Black Freeman which makes it clear that the word, as stated in Scott’s Est. [No. 1], <a href="/pa-super/37/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="37 Pa. Super. 342" data-case-ids="875975" data-case-paths="/pa-super/37/0342-01">37 Pa. Superior Ct. 342</a>, ‘refers to some other date,’ it necessarily follows that it refers to the death of the testator, as of which date, in accordance with the general rule, the will speaks. The word ‘deceasing’ must be interpreted precisely as if the word ‘deceased’ had been used instead.” That in general the words “death without issue” mean such in the life of the testator, we add the following citations: Mitchell, Admr., v. Railway et al., <a href="/pa/165/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="165 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="862024" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0645-01">165 Pa. 645</a>, 11 R. C. L. 481, 40 R. C. L. 230, 231. It is also fundamental that the gift of an absolute estate will not be cut down by subsequent words of doubtful meaning: Keating et al. v. McAdoo, <a href="/pa/180/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="180 Pa. 5" data-case-ids="888343" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0005-01">180 Pa. 5</a>; Coles et al. v.

    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[276,737,1156,863]]]'>Tatnall bought the property of Robert C. Freeman as agent for the Real Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia, and acquired no individual interest therein; he was, however, at that time one of the directors of the Girard Trust Company, the trustee under the Henry G. Freeman will. This circumstance is urged as a reason for avoiding the Tatnall purchase. It is only, necessary to say that, as Robert C. Freeman lived nearly twelve years after making the assignment, and never sought to avoid it, laches without more is a complete answer thereto. See Hammond v.
