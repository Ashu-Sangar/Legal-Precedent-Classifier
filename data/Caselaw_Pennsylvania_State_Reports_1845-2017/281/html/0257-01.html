The rate-base thus adopted was therefore unlawful, and one not determined on a reasonable charge fixed for the intrastate service, as it was required to be, but on an illegal, disapproved tariff filed with the Public Service Commission, and which had been subsequently directed to be lowered.

An effort was made to protect the owners of railroads for the period of six months, and it was provided therein: “All rates, fares and charges, and all classifications, regulations and practices in any way changing, affecting, or determining any part, or the aggregate of rates, fares, or charges, or the value of the service rendered, which, on February 29,1920, are in effect on the lines of carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, shall continue in force and effect until thereafter changed by state or federal authority, respectively, or pursuant to authority of law; but, prior to September 1, 1920, no such rate, fare or charge shall be reduced and no such classification, regulation or practice shall be changed in such manner as to reduce any such rate, fare or charge, unless such reduction or change is approved by the commission.”</p>

This resulted in giving the appellants the right to charge $1.54, if the sum allowable by governmental permission prior to March 1, 1920, was to control, but otherwise, if the reasonable sum determined by the Public Service Commission of the State was used as a structural base, in which case the rate should have been one dollar, beginning March 1st, and rising to $1.40 on August 26th.</p>

This ruling was made on June 18, 1920, but it is insisted that after March 1st, of that year, in so far as intrastate rates were concerned, the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvonia had the right to determine the question. On the other hand, the appellants urge that no reduction could be permitted during the guarantee period without consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and therefore the appellees are precluded in their present claim, based on the order of reparation later made by the local regulatory body.</p>

This, in effect, sustained the rate base made by the same commission in 1917, as it passed through the successive increases permitted during federal control, making due allowance for those advances. From this decision no appeal was taken, though permissible and required under the Public Service Act, as it touched or affected all matters heard and considered. Section 31, of article YI, provides: “Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act, the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby, unless set aside, annulled or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act” (Act of July 26, 1913, P.

A failure to so proceed operates as a waiver of the right to review: N. Y. &amp; Pa. Co. v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., supra.

At the hearing then, the railroads denied to the former any power or authority whatsoever to hear and determine the case by way of a reduction, and claimed such order was “nugatory and of no avail.” The issue was there squarely joined as to whether the commission had power within itself to hear and determine the reason<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>ableness of a rate during the guarantee period, without the joinder of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

    <p id="b289-3" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[193,684,1149,363]]]'>The Public Service Commission, at that time, decided that, immediately upon the return of the railroads to prewar status, its authority to control followed, and they became “subject to the Public Service Company Law,’’ in so far as relates to intrastate rates, which class of cases was exclusively under the control of the state commission.</p>
    <p id="b289-4" data-blocks='[["BL_289.6",289,[189,1068,1152,1238]]]'>With the record in this condition, it is apparent the parties voluntarily submitted to a tribunal competent to hear their complaint and contention. It was imperative, if an adverse decision was rendered, that those feeling aggrieved should follow the mode pointed out by the act of assembly. If no appeal was taken, then section 31, of article VI, made all rulings between the parties conclusive. “Defendant attempted to re-raise the question decided in the first proceeding, but this it could not then or thereafter do, not because the facts and law there laid down were res adjudicata in the usual acceptation of that term, but because, by article VI, section 31, of the act, defendant’s failure to appeal made all those rulings ‘conclusive upon all parties affected thereby’ ”: N. Y. &amp; Pa. Co. v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., supra, p. 70. And, as further stated in L. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Com., <a href="/pa/277/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="277 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1079558" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0493-01">277 Pa. 493</a>, 499, this included the findings on which the order was based. It is elementary that where a party makes a defense before a tribunal competent to hear the cause, upon a question either of fact or law, and the conclusion is adverse, he must pursue the statutory remedy, otherwise he is bound by the decision rendered.</p>

But that the contrary was considered and decided in complaint No. 3206, and squarely passed upon by the commission, is evidenced not only from the record in that proceeding, but from the opinion in the reparation proceedings now before the court. It was only after our decision in L. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. v. Pub. Ser.

Considerable stress is laid on the so-called final order, and article VI, section 31, of the Public Service Act is quoted as the basis of appellants’ contention that the state commission’s order in the second complaint did not involve a consideration of the rates during the guarantee period. That this is obviously incorrect appears not only from the findings made, but also from the decision of our court in L. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Com., <a href="/pa/277/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="277 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1079558" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0493-01">277 Pa. 493</a>. “When the commission shall determine, after hearing ......upon complaint, that the rate......[is] unjust ......[it shall] determine and prescribe by specific order the......reasonable rate......to be thereafter established, demanded, exacted, charged or collected.” This is in the precise language of the act of assembly. The order could relate only to rates in the future. But as stated in the Lehigh Case (page 499) : “The appeal to the Superior Court opened all challenged findings relating to the contested rate; the final decree was not the only matter to consider......Questions on the findings are not to be taken up piecemeal, — that is, for the future under this appeal, and the reasonableness of the past rate on an appeal from a reparation award......The <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>Superior Court did not err in considering all questions presented to the commission or arising under the complaint.” Appellants’ counsel admit that, had the commission, in complaint No. 3206, being the second one, issued an order with respect to the rates during the guarantee period, the situation now under consideration would be different, for such order would have raised at once the question of its power to make and enforce it. The record shows that, after having debated the relative positions of the parties, as hereinabove indicated, and discussed the evidence, the commission made this finding and definitive order: “Upon all of the facts of record, we conclude that the just and reasonable through rate from the Munson District and the Hawk Run District on the New York Central Railroad to Lock Haven, Pa., on the Pennsylvania Railroad, for the period March 1, 1920, to August 25, 1920, both inclusive [this being the guarantee period], should be $1 per 2,240 pounds, and effective August 26,1920, the date of the 40 per cent increase following Ex Parte 74, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20I.C.C.%20220" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="58 I.C.C. 220">58 I. C. C. 220</a>-260, $1.40 per 2,240 pounds, Respondents will be directed, by appropriate order, to establish upon one day’s notice within thirty days of the service of the order the through rate of $1.40,” being the rate here complained of. This order was made without any qualification, and, as indicated, without any suggestion of being subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and is in no sense interlocutory. It was final, and the subject of appeal. At that time this appellant was notified by the commission that, upon the presentation of a petition, accompanied by supporting data, reparation would be awarded for freight charges paid in excess of the rates herein determined, further emphasizing the determination of the commission that the matter was exclusively within its own control.</p>
    <p id="b291-3" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[193,2233,1146,209]],["BL_292.1",292,[299,381,1155,426]]]'>In 1922, the Public Service Commission was asked to grant reparation to the appellees for the sums paid in excess of the dollar rate for the period from March 1, 1920, to August 26th of the same year, and $1.40 there<a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>after, and to award a sum which would equal the overcharges, and this resulted in an allowance to the petitioners. The sum claimed for the excess collection, during the so-called guarantee period mentioned, forms the foundation of the present suit. A statement of claim was filed, and an affidavit of defense interposed, which the learned court below held to be insufficient, with the result that judgment was entered for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b292-4" data-blocks='[["BL_292.5",292,[290,818,1163,1572]]]'>As noted, the defense rests on the proposition that the rate fixed as reasonable by the Public Service Commission of the State is ineffective, in that no approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission was secured to reduce rates during the guarantee period, and it is insisted such action was required under the terms of the Transportation Act. This overlooks the provision of the congressional legislation that no changes shall be made unless approved “by <em>state </em>or federal authority.” It is clear that the local rates were held in abeyance during the period of federal control, and, as far as interstate commerce is concerned, remained subject to the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission until September 1, 1920, but after March 1st of that year, in so far as intrastate rates were concerned, the control of the state commission again became effective: L. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Com., <a href="/pa/277/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="277 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="1079558" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0493-01">277 Pa. 493</a>; see, L. &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. v.

Superior Ct. 540</a>. As said by Judge Kephart in the decision first cited: “After the Act of 1920 the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission was (1) to establish a level of rates which would afford the compensation necessary to permit the maintenance of an adequate national railway system during the prescribed period; (2) remove discrimination against interstate commerce as a whole arising from the enforcement by state authorities of a different level of rates for a similar purpose; (3) to prevent discrimination against interstate traffic aimed at persons or localities by any intrastate rate or schedule.”</p>

During the war, the federal government controlled both classes, but, beginning with March 1, 1920, the federal rights were limited, and, as already noted, the determination of reasonableness of charges was either within the jurisdiction of the “state or federal authority,” depending on the character of the traffic, and other effective limitations of the Transportation Act.</p>
    <p id="b293-3" data-blocks='[["BL_293.5",293,[170,1336,1153,700]]]'>In the present instance, the state commission made no attempt to reduce any rates, but to correct a charge based on an admittedly illegal premise, and make it conform to one determined as reasonable prior to federal control. The decision enforces the order of reparation determined on that basis, making due allowance for increases which had from time to time been authorized by the director general. As we have stated, no appeal by any party who felt aggrieved was taken from the final order, as required by our acts of assembly. We are convinced that judgment for the plaintiff was properly entered by the court below, and, the assignments of error are overruled, without separate discussion.</p>
