Counsel for appellees was present and asked that we adjudge certain questions as to the meaning of a written stipulation, which, they contend, was entered into by counsel on both sides of the case at the suggestion of this court, when, on a former occasion, hearing of the present appeal was continued. Rule 80 of the Supreme Court provides: “When a case is called for argument, if appellant is not ready to pro<a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>ceed and has filed no brief, the appeal will be dismissed as of course.” No brief having been filed by appellant, this appeal must be dismissed; there is nothing before the court which would warrant us in construing the stipulation at the present time.</p>
