The returns from the local board showed Lewis, the Democratic and coalition candidate, to be credited with a total of 869 votes, while his Republican opponent was noted as having received 861. Later, under the provisions of the Act of May 22, 1923, P. L. 309, the proper officer made known the result of the count of the “absent voters,” which added three to the total of the first named, and twenty for the latter, thus apparently causing the election of Bare. To contest this decision, a petition was presented to the court of quarter sessions, in which the validity of the legislation referred to was attacked, its unconstitutionality being urged on many grounds, and it was asked that the additional ballots cast by mail be rejected in making the final computation. This contention was sustained below, and a certificate of election directed to be issued to Lewis. From the decision rendered, this appeal was taken.</p>

More than thirty of the states of the Union now have absentee voting laws of similar character, — usually limited in the grant of privilege to those in military service, — and, in most cases, authorized by special constitutional pro<a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>vision: <a href="/citations/?q=14%20A.L.R.%201256" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="14 A.L.R. 1256">14 A.

L. 519), and, by sections 43 to 50, directed that soldiers in actual service could have their votes recorded in the manner therein prescribed. The question of the right to exercise this special privilege was brought before this court in a contest from Luzerne County in 1861, and the adverse determination then made is controlling now, unless there has been some change in the fundamental law which makes necessary a different conclusion. »</p>

The right of the legislature to fix the status of electors was next the subject of review when Chief Justice Thompson discussed the validity of the so-called “Registry Act” of April 4, 1868, P. L. 30. “For the orderly exercise of the right resulting from these qualifications, it is admitted that the legislature must prescribe necessary regulations, as to the places, mode and manner, and whatever else may be required, to insure its full and free exercise. But this duty and right inherently imply that such regulations are to be subordinate to the enjoyment of the right, the exercise of which is regulated. The right must not be impaired by the regulation. It must be regulation purely, not destruction. If this were not an immutable principle, elements essential to the right itself might be <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>invaded, frittered away, or entirely exscinded under the name or pretence of regulation, and thus would the natural order of things be subverted by making the principle subordinate to the accessory. To state is to prove this position. As a corollary of this, no constitutional qualification of an elector can in the least be abridged, added to, or altered, by legislation or the pretence of legislation. Any such action would necessarily be absolutely void and of no effect. We hold, therefore, what indeed was not expressly denied, that no regulation can be valid which would have the effect to increase the district or state residence, prior to the time of an offer to exercise the right of an elector, or which would impose other or additional taxation or assessments than those provided in the Constitution”: Page v.

The latter has determined those who, absent from the district, may vote other than by personal presentation of the ballot, but those so permitted are specifically named in section 6 of article VIII. The old principle that the expression of an intent to include one class excludes another has full application here. White, in his work on the Constitution (p. 360), succinctly sums up the proposition controlling this case when he says: “The residence required by the Constitution must be within the election district where the elector attempts to vote, hence a law giving to voters the right to cast their ballots at some place other than the election district in which they reside [is] unconstitutional.”</p>
