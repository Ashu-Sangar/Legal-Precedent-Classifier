C. Baker, upon a so-called lease, providing for payment by monthly installments and for a return of the truck in case of default. On the same day the tractor company assigned the lease to the Commercial Investment Trust, herein called the plaintiff, a financing corporation of New York. After making a hand payment and two or three monthly payments, Baker defaulted and the truck was taken back by the tractor company and placed in its sales room, where it remained until that company delivered it to the defendant, A. C. Langford, upon another so-called lease of somewhat like import, executed in its name as lessor. For six months he made payments to the tractor company, as provided in his lease, with no knowledge that the Baker lease had been assigned to plaintiff or that it claimed any interest in the truck. Then, however, plaintiff took the truck from Langford by a writ of replevin, averring its right to do so by virtue of the Baker lease, of which it was assignee. An affidavit of defense was filed and, jury trial being waived, the case was heard by the trial court, who in due time entered judgment for defendant for the value of the truck and damages for its taking and <em>detention; </em>thereupon plaintiff brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[176,1716,1153,702]],["BL_172.1",172,[315,350,1159,1633]]]'>We find nothing in the record calling for a reversal. Plaintiff took no steps to secure possession of the truck upon its return to the tractor company by Baker, but on the contrary suffered it to remain in the sales room of that company to all appearances as its truck. Treating the contract with Baker as a bailment, the tractor company’s assignee thereof became prima facie owner of the truck, subject to the rights of the bailee, and during the continuance of the bailment was not required to take possession of the property in order to acquire title thereto even as against creditors: Linton v. Butz, <a href="/pa/7/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="957836" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0089-01">7 Pa. 89</a>. In fact, during such time the bailee’s possession could not be disturbed, but when the bailment was ended and <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>the property returned to the original bailor it became the duty of the latter’s assignee to take possession thereof, within a reasonable time, the same as the purchaser of any other personalty, but it failed to do so; hence, its title was invalid as against that of an innocent third party. Were the rule otherwise, a temporary bailment would enable the bailor to secretly transfer title of the property, then regain possession and hold the same as ostensible owner without subjecting it to the claims of the creditors or bona fide purchasers. This cannot be done, for the law abhors secret liens, however attempted to be established (Princhett v. Cook, <a href="/pa/62/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="1017269" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0193-01">62 Pa. 193</a>) and will allow no device to elude the principle which forbids a lien to be created on chattels as a security separate from the possession (Enterprise W. Paper Co. v. Rantoul Co., <a href="/pa/260/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="260 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1040310" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0540-01">260 Pa. 540</a>; Jenkins v. Echelberger, <a href="/watts/4/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts 121" data-case-ids="1842792" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0121-01">4 Watts 121</a>), and the same is true as to acquiring a secret title. Furthermore, plaintiff remained silent during all the time Langford was making payments on the truck to the tractor company; and, for nearly eight months after the first bailment was ended, did nothing indicating any interest whatever in the truck, and only acted when the tractor company had become insolvent and its manager a defaulter; meantime the rights of Langford as a bona fide purchaser or lessee had attached. The undisputed facts constitute such laches on behalf of plaintiff as to support the trial court’s finding that it was estopped from asserting a claim to the truck as against an innocent purchaser from the tractor company. See O’Connor, Adm’r, v. Clark, <a href="/pa/170/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="170 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="872147" data-case-paths="/pa/170/0318-01">170 Pa. 318</a>.</p>
