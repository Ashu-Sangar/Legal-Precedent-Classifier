Walters had an apparent majority- of sixty-three votes over Warren Worth Bailey. Counsel for the latter filed petitions with that court, sitting as a computing board, alleging, in general language, fraud and palpable mistakes in the returns from several of the election districts, and asking a recount of thq ballots therein. Walters’ counsel objected, but the court decided against them, and -the votes were recounted. Roth sides then filed similar petitions as to other election districts, and the votes were recounted in them also. The net result was that Bailey appeared to have a majority of fourteen votes. Counsel for Walters then applied to the court to rescind its previous rulings and to award the certificate of election to him, because, by the returns as originally filed, he appeared to have a majority of the votes cast. Their contention that the court should accept and abide by the original returns, was based on the provision of article I, section 5, of the Constitution of the United States declaring that “Each House [of Congress] shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members,” claiming that, under this, the court could only add up the returns as made by the election officers, and award a certificate accordingly. The court below sustained this contention and awarded the certificate to Walters, whereupon Bailey appealed, counsel <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>on both sides agreeing at bar that this court should consider all the evidence returned with the record, and decide the questions raised as the court below should have decided them.</p>

When it was brought into the court below, it appeared that its seal and tape were broken, and the tape retied, and also that there was an open space of some two and three-quarters inches between the lid and the rest of the box, thereby giving an opportunity to take out some of the ballots cast and to substitute others. All but one of the election officers testified that the ballots in the box were those which had been cast at the election, whereupon the court overruled all objections to considering these ballots and recounting the votes, altering the returns according to the totals thus ascertained. This resulted in an addition of thirty-nine votes to Bailey’s total; excluding them, his majority of fourteen is changed to a majority of twenty-five for Walters.</p>

This court being divided on the question of the legal right to count the votes involved, it follows that the order appealed from must stand as made and the certificate issue to Anderson H.
