Under <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>the agreement executed January 17,1920, compensation was paid to February 16,1920, when a final receipt ended the payments. Later in tbe same year a petition to review this receipt was filed, and, after hearing, it was set aside without prejudice to either party, the referee finding a daughter had signed her father’s name without his knowledge. In 1922, appellant, by petition, asked that payment cease as appellee’s present condition was not due to any physical injury, but to mental degeneration. The hearing developed claimant’s mental derangement, appellant insisting it was not due to being bumped or struck by a mine car on the side of his body. The referee declined to terminate the compensation, basing his conclusion on the evidence then submitted, as well as that taken on the petition to review the final receipt. The board and the court below sustained this action.</p>
