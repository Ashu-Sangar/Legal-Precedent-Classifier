Hensal bought nine separate tracts of coal land from different owners; included therein was the land of David Heinbaugh. In part payment of all the land, Hensal executed a mortgage on the nine tracts to John R. Scott as trustee for the former owners. The balance of the purchase money due to each was specifically set forth in the mortgage for the use of the former owner; a judgment for their benefit, in addition to the mortgage, was held by the trustee.</p>

The second grantee is in no sense a party to the first grantee’s mortgage contract, and, while he assumes the payment of the debt and becomes personally liable, that liability can be enforced through an independent action at law in the name of the grantor. The remedy, under the facts submitted in this record, is adequate to reach and hold the Pinkerton Coal Company for the entire debt. The trustee here may also proceed by scire facias on the Hensal mortgage, sell the land covered by it, and, if there is a deficit, proceed against his mortgagor or the second grantee for the difference.</p>

DuPont Land Co., <a href="/pa/254/0446-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="254 Pa. 446" data-case-ids="1025463" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0446-01">254 Pa. 446</a>, must be read in considering this liability. What is said by the court below in that case does not overrule the line of authorities mentioned in Gill’s Est., supra, and Willock’s Est., supra, nor the other authorities announcing the legal principle evolved from the assumption and agreement to pay a first mortgage. This court correctly limited the lower court’s opinion when, in a per curiam, we said, “What the Commonwealth would collect from the Dupont Land Company is a tax on mortgages and accompanying bonds given by the company’s grantor to various mortgagees. In each of the deeds to it for the lands so encumbered by him there is a stipulation that it ‘assumes and agrees to pay’ the principal and interest of the mortgage indebtedness. The learned president judge of the court below clearly demonstrates that this stipulation in the deeds accepted by the company did not make the mortgages, for which the respective properties were encumbered, indebtedness of the company within the contemplation of the Act of June 30, 1885, P. L. 193, and the judgment is affirmed on the opinion directing it to be entered.” While there is no doubt in this Commonwealth that, in an assumption and agreement to pay, the mortgagee has a direct action against the grantee; yet it is a chose in action, and, without more, it does not make the mortgagee a creditor within the meaning of the Acts of 1893 and 1877, so that equity <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>could have jurisdiction in cases of disputes between companies and creditors. See Blood v. Crew Levick Co., <a href="/pa/171/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="171 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="985624" data-case-paths="/pa/171/0342-01">171 Pa. 342</a>. The court below was clearly right in holding equity did not have jurisdiction, and there was an adequate remedy at law, as pointed out above.</p>
    <p id="b603-3" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[191,641,1154,864]]]'>Moreover, a chancellor has no authority to direct a trustee who holds a mortgage against a number of pieces of land, in trust for the creditors there mentioned as a unit or class, to segregate one piece and sell it for the benefit of one creditor to the exclusion of others of the same class whose rights are all equal (Western Pa. Hospital v. Mercantile Library Hall Co., <a href="/pa/189/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="189 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="903450" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0269-01">189 Pa. 269</a>), thereby causing the institution of a number of foreclosure proceedings, each with its own costs added. We have been referred to no authority permitting such chopping up of property, and the idea is in violation of the fundamental thought that a mortgage such as this is given for the protection and benefit of all beneficiaries interested <em>; </em>all must participate in the proceeds of sale alike. To hold otherwise would permit gross discrimination to be practiced.</p>
