The meeting was held the first <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Monday of January, at which time the solicitor was appointed and his salary fixed. Section 1, article I, chapter VII, of the General Borough Act, 1915, P. L. 312,390, provides, “The borough council shall organize..... .on the first Monday of January......by electing a president and secretary and such other officers as it may require.” Section 3: “The burgess shall preside over the organization meeting......but he shall not vote thereat, unless the vote of the council be equally divided.” Section 9, article VI (P. L. 402) : “The borough council on the first Monday of January......or as soon thereafter as practicable, may elect......one person, learned in the law, who shall be styled the borough solicitor.” The amendment of 1921, P. L. 1171, provides: “Appointed officers of the borough shall receive such compensation for their services as the council shall prescribe, and the compensation for......the solicitor......shall be fixed at the time of appointment.”</p>
    <p id="b31-13" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[180,1321,1157,535]]]'>It is contended that, as the statute provides for nothing but an organization meeting to be held on the first Monday, so that the borough may properly function, nothing is contemplated but ministerial acts, such as the appointment or election of officers and fixing salaries. As the act requires the burgess to preside at the meeting, his functioning as presiding officer is a substitute for the approval or veto power, precluding the idea that the legislature intended any further exercise of such authority over acts of council taken while he is presiding.</p>
    <p id="b31-14" data-blocks='[["BL_31.5",31,[178,1864,1156,534]],["BL_32.1",32,[311,344,1163,971]]]'>This is true as far as it appertains to all matters of a purely organization character. The borough council is the delegated authority to create the office of solicitor and to appoint a person to fill the position. The act requires the amount of compensation be fixed at the time of appointment. This act is not mandatory, but permissive <em>; </em>the office may never become a part of the borough government, and, should it become one, the solicitor, by virtue of his powers and duties, is not an essential part of the borough organization. The sections of the Bor<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>ough Code, 'with the amendments thereto, cannot be woven together so as to bring matters of salary within the things made obligatory at the organization of council, not requiring the burgess’ approval, as the election of its president, secretary, etc. Appointment is one thing, compensation quite another. Ordinarily the office does not exist without both, but the second is a purely legislative act. While the statute says the solicitor’s compensation shall be fixed at the time of Ms appointment, this does not necessarily mean that his salary must be fixed at that meeting. It may have been adopted by ordinance or resolution prior to Ms appointment, by a different council. If that were the case, the amount of Ms compensation would be fixed at the time of his appointment, as required by the act. Moreover, there is nothing in the code which limits the nature of business to be transacted at the organization meeting; it may combine both legislative and ministerial acts.</p>

As such he is vested with approval and veto power over ordinances and resolutions. To veto is to exercise a separate and distinct function of government. The code, section 7 of article I of chapter VII (P. L. 392), states: “Every ordinance and resolution, except as herein otherwise provided, passed by the council, shall be presented to the burgess for his approval.” This authority is not to be taken from the burgess except by express legislative enactment or as clearly inferred from a statute; certainly not through a doubtful construction of various parts of the code.</p>
