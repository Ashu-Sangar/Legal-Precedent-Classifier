This system of water facilities, maintained and used by the railroad company, comprises 131 miles of pipe lines, with ten reservoirs and four stand pipes.

In the year 1904, each of these eight companies adopted resolutions appropriating a fractional interest in the waters of Indian Creek at a point near its confluence with the Youghiogheny River and below the dam of the Mountain Company, the sum of the appropriations representing the entire flow of the stream. Following this, each of these companies filed a bill in equity against the Mountain Company seeking to restrain the latter from diverting the water. This litigation was settled by the execution of a contract between the parties to the several suits, which provided for the furnishing of water by the Mountain Company to the other companies. Subsequently the name of the Westmoreland Water Company of Ludwick Borough was changed to Westmoreland Water Company, and it purchased the property and franchises of the other companies which had been created contemporaneously with it.</p>

The chancellor further concluded that the several water companies had not appropriated the waters of Indian Creek for public use; that the Mountain Company did not possess the power of eminent domain, and that neither the Dunbar Company nor the Westmoreland Company had exercised that power; that as there had not been a fully completed exercise of it, there was no appropriation of the waters of the creek for public use, and that, as the waters had not been legally so appropriated, there was no public interest which warranted the intervention of the Commonwealth; invoking the rule of the Sanderson Case, he dismissed the bills.</p>

These cases do not lie within the narrow realm of legal formalities. This stream of pure water (one of the very few unpolluted ones in the section of the State where it is located) was impounded, primarily, for the purpose of furnishing uncontaminated water, to supply the motive power which is essential to the operation of one of the great railroad systems of the country. This primary purpose having been met, a large part of the surplus water, approximately 8,000,000 gallons per day, is being taken, by agreement between the Mountain Company and the Westmoreland Company, from the reservoir of the former and supplied by the latter to 75,000 people in thirteen municipal divisions of the Commonwealth for domestic uses. This being the fact, it is idle to say that the water is not being devoted to public use. It would never do to permit a screen of effete legal formalism to be raised to shut out the view of what actually exists in such a situation as here confronts us. It could not be averred, with wisdom and truth, that there is no public interest warranting the Commonwealth’s intervention, when the water supply of such a large number of persons is involved. Nor do we think it can properly be held that the use of the water by the railroad company is not a public one. The water is devoted by it to the furnishing of power to transport the public; without water uncontaminated by acid, the railroad could not be operated. If authority were needed for the proposition that the water furnished to the railroad company is for a public use, it can be found in Bland v. Tipton Water Co., <a href="/pa/222/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="222 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="959388" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0285-01">222 Pa. 285</a>, 289, where it is said: “In daily furnishing to the engines of the railroad company 350,000 gallons of water in that township, the water company is not exercising a mere right but performing a duty, for the railroad company, in the operation of its road in <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>said township, is to be regarded as a part of the public therein.”</p>

The reason given for the conclusion that the Westmoreland Company and the Dunbar Company had not exercised the power of eminent domain, which each of them possesses, was because the resolutions which they adopted “were not followed by entry upon the ground and because no compensation ever was made or secured to defendants or their predecessors in title.” In view of the agreement made by these two companies with the Mountain Company, which had the right, under the act authorizing its incorporation, to store and furnish the water, nothing further was required to be done by them. So far as the defendants are concerned, no compensation was due to them, because as upper riparian owners they were deprived of nothing by the appropriation of the water below them. The chancellor would also seem to have overlooked the rule, that settlement by an eminent domainer, with one whose property has been appropriated, is equivalent to the full and complete exercise of the power of eminent domain: Boalsburg Water Co. v.

One of plaintiff companies, the Westmoreland, and those affiliated with it, started proceedings to condemn the waters of the stream, their right to do so was challenged by the Mountain Company, whose interests in the creek were not only those acquired in pursuance of its charter, but those of a riparian owner as well. These proceedings culminated in a settlement and agreement for the taking of the water; this was the same as though they had been carried through to a finality. However a corporation possessing the power of <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>eminent domain acquires its rights, whether by purchase or condemnation, the rights acquired are the same; there is no magic in getting them under the power of eminent domain. Formal entry is not, as the court below seemed to think, requisite. The day for going through ceremonies in the law of property has passed; such symbolism as that involved in the handing over of a twig or clod of earth to indicate the passing of title is in the limbo of things well nigh forgotten. In the very recent case of Palmer Water Co. v. Lehighton Water Supply Co., <a href="/pa/280/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="280 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1084511" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0492-01">280 Pa. 492</a>, we determined that a water company actually located on a stream, and supplying water therefrom to the public, should be confirmed in its rights to so furnish it, as against the claim to the entire flow of the stream by another water company, subsequently created, even though the prior locating company had not strictly complied with the law in appropriating the water. The language of Mr. Justice Kephart in that case has strong pertinence to the ones in hand (p. 498) : “Here we have the Lehighton Company, occupying the upper stream from which it supplied the public for some years before the Palmer Water Company existed, thrown off the stream because its board of directors failed to go through a form to appropriate the stream, though every other act of the company was consistent with the proper performance of its duties and obligations resting on it as a public servant.” We there reiterated long-ago used language of our predecessors in saying “the domestic uses of water are its natural and primary ones.”</p>

As it has acquired all such interests, its right to take the water cannot be successfully challenged. The water which it has the right to take is devoted to public use in two aspects, in that it goes to the public through the Westmoreland Company for domestic consumption and to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for use by the latter in connection with the public service which it performs.</p>

If that case decided, under a state of facts at all comparable to those before us, what the chancellor conceived it to decide, it would not be followed by us now; but it does not determine that where a water company has acquired the right to the waters of a stream, by other than condemnation title, its only rights are those of a riparian proprietor and therefore private. That proceeding was a prosecution for committing a public nuisance in polluting a stream from which the York Water Company obtained water. There was no evidence that the water company had any right to divert the water or appropriate it for any purpose save as a riparian owner. It was held under this state of facts that the nuisance was not shown to be a public one, and hence a conviction could not be sustained. It was pointed out in the opinion that “If the public have <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>a right to receive pure water through the agency of a corporation legally authorized to take it from a stream, he who pollutes it offends against the public.” In the pending cases, the three water companies have the right to take the waters of the stream, to a greater degree than would ordinary riparian owners, and the only deficiency in their right which the trial court points out is the lack of the fully completed exercise of the power of eminent domain by the Westmoreland and Dunbar Companies (we are passing the question whether the Mountain Company possessed the power at all). If in Com. v. Yost, it had appeared that the water company acquired the right to divert the water by purchase from all the lower riparian owners, it certainly would not have been held that its use of the water was not a public use and the nuisance not a public one.</p>

As we have shown, the conclusion reached that there was no public use of the water was fallacious. We have, therefore, a situation where the waters of a stream are devoted to public use. Does the Sanderson Case apply under these circumstances? That litigation did not involve the rights of the public to the waters of streams in any sense. What was affected by the pollution of the stream was the private concern of that plaintiff. The case was determined on the balancing of the “necessities of a great public industry” <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>and a “mere personal inconvenience.” It was said: “The community does not complain on any grounds. The plaintiff’s grievance is for a mere personal inconvenience and we are of opinion that mere private personal inconvenience arising in this case and under such circumstances must yield to the necessities of a great public industry, which although in the hands of a private corporation subserves a great public interest. To encourage the development of a great natural resource of a country, <em>trifling inconvenience to particular persons </em>must give way to the necessities of a great community.” No language used in that opinion can be tortured into an implication that the waters of the Commonwealth can be polluted by its mines, where the public is affected as it is here. It has always been under our law a nuisance to pollute a stream from which the public gets its supply of water: Barclay v. Com., <a href="/pa/25/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="25 Pa. 503" data-case-ids="975789" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0503-01">25 Pa. 503</a>; McCallum v.

It is the use of the water by many people that makes its public use, in applying the nuisance doctrine, not the fact of how the water is taken from the stream for their use, whether in the mains of a water company or- by them in buckets.</p>

The Coal Company? ......Notwithstanding the name of the Commonwealth had been put on the record as a plaintiff at the instance of her attorney general, and notwithstanding the conclusive evidence of the destruction of the water supply for all domestic purposes, on which the Borough of Butler had been dependent for many years, the case was disposed of on the narrow ground covered by the rule in Sanderson’s Case. The error of the learned judge lies in this treatment of the case.” In Com. v. Emmers, <a href="/pa/221/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="221 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="956195" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0298-01">221 Pa. 298</a>, we lent our sanction to what was said by the Superior Court, “But whether this extreme exception [in the Sanderson Case] to the general rule that a riparian owner has no right to pollute the waters of a stream could prevail against the right of the public is an entirely different question.”</p>

To reach this determination, he gave to the Sanderson Case a much broader effect than it has ever before been given and overlooked how limited has been its application. It is somewhat difficult to understand why he badged the draining of the mine water into the stream as a “property right” in the defendants, of which they cannot be deprived except upon payment being made to them. Nothing said in the Sanderson opinion warrants such conclusion even from the standpoint of the private right involved and certainly not where public rights are at stake. No such term as a right of property was applied in that decision to the act of the mine owner in <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>polluting the stream. He was taken out of the rule that his act was one of nuisance, by the exceptional situation there existing, and it was expressly stated that the privilege accorded to him would not be sanctioned where the public is concerned. To say that there is no public concern in the use made of the waters of a stream which are supplied to 75,000 individual consumers shocks the common understanding. In Sanderson’s Case, the court was most careful to state, “We do not say that a case may not arise in which a stream from such pollution may not become a nuisance and that the public interests as involved in the general health and well-being of the community may not require the abatement of that nuisance. This is not such a case.” The ones in hand are. The most that could be said of what was accorded to the defendant in that much controverted case is, that it was a. privilege. There could not be such a thing in the law as a property-right to do a wrong, unless, it was founded in prescription, which presupposes a grant, and no prescription was set up in that case. Indeed, “It is generally recognized that no right can be acquired by prescription to maintain a public nuisance. So it has been decided that there can be no prescriptive right to maintain an obstruction in the highway, or to pollute a stream to the detriment of the public”: 2 Tiffany, Real Property (2d ed., 1920) 2031; Owens v. Lancaster, <a href="/pa/182/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="182 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="893301" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0257-01">182 Pa. 257</a>, 262 ; 2 Lewis, Eminent Domain (3d ed., 1909) 866 note; Com. v.

In that case, the City of Boston had appropriated the waters of a river as part of its water supply. A petition was filed by an upper riparian owner praying for an assessment of his damages upon the ground, among others, that the appropriation interfered With the petitioners’ use of the water in bleaching and dyeing clothes. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massa<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>chusetts, in disposing of the plaintiff’s contentions, said (p. 587, 589) : “The riparian proprietors higher up still retain all their common law rights in the river, so far as they are not inconsistent with the use defined in the statute. They certainly are not prohibited from drawing water from the river for domestic purposes, or from watering cattle in it or from cutting ice......Another claim, put forward by the petitioner, is that the use which it proposes to make of the water of the river in bleaching and dyeing woolen and cotton clothes must befoul the water and render it unfit for drinking purposes, and that the statute in question deprives it of that right. But it is agreed that the petitioner has acquired no such right by any grant or prescription, and it is well settled that, as a riparian proprietor merely it has no such right. An injury to the purity or quality of the water to the detriment of other riparian owners, constitutes in legal effect a wrong and invasion of private right, in like manner as a permanent obstruction or diversion of the water.” The title acquired by defendants, whether by grant or demise, gave them no property rights in the waters of the stream save those which pertained to riparian ownership; obviously this did not include the right to pollute the stream: Howell v. M’Coy, <a href="/rawle/3/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="3 Rawle 256" data-case-ids="1822540" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0256-01">3 Rawle 256</a>; Com. v.
