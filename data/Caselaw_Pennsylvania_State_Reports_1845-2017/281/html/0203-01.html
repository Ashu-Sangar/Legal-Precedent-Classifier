The testimony discloses nothing from which the jury could find the reasonable expectation of <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>life of plaintiff or the diminution, if any, of her earning power. [She] testified that her age was thirty years, but there is no testimony as to her condition of health at the time of the trial or before; nothing with respect to her habits, [and] no tables of mortality.” While, of course, the physical appearance of an adult plaintiff presents strong evidence in itself of her condition of health, from which conclusions may be drawn as to her expectancy of life, yet, where, as here, the trial judge, who saw plaintiff, thinks and says that the proofs are insufficient to sustain a definite finding on that point, or as to the diminution of her earning power caused by the injury suffered, and in effect states that for these reasons he deems it unnecessary to pass on other grounds assigned in support of a motion for a new trial, we will not, under our authorities, hold the sustaining of the motion to be error.
