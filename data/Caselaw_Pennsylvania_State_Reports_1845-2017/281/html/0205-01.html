A petition to open a ballot box and count thq votes will not be granted where petitioner fails to aver that the result of the election was in any way affected by the alleged errors of which she complains, and the averments of fact in the petition do not present an instance of “palpable fraud and mistake” within the meaning of section 13 of the Act of May 19, 1923, P. L. 267.</p>

Where the real point which the petitioner seeks to have reviewed is whether ballots marked in a prescribed manner, should have been counted “as a matter of law” for certain persons, and there are no sufficiently specific averments of fraud as to this, the petition presents a question for an election contest, and not one for consideration in a computation proceeding.</p>
