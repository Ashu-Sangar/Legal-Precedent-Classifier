It has been held, under the police power of the several states, that the right exists by legislation or (the recognized substitute) by a delegation of legislative power to a commission to fix the rates of public service companies to be charged for their service or commodity. The right to fix similar rates for those companies engaged in inter<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>state commerce has been held to exist under the federal Constitution.</p>

Milliken, <a href="/mass/242/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="242 Mass. 508" data-case-ids="3812598" data-case-paths="/mass/242/0508-01">242 Mass. 508</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=136%20N.E.%20419" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="136 N.E. 419">136 N. E. 419</a>, 433. The right was based on what has been generally termed implied “war power.” The exercise of this right or power has as its foundation the national security and defense; it is of such paramount importance alike to the country and its citizens, and of such drastic consequence, it seems imperative it must not be carried beyond what is generally comprehended by the term, or into conditions of life not justifying its existence. When lawfully brought into action by Congress, it must be kept within its own limitations. It should not exist after the circumstances are ended through which it was brought into life, namely, war or public insurrection actually existing. Until the Supreme Court of the United States determines otherwise, the act in question must be held ineffective, after the cessation of hostilities in its broadest sense, freed from technical construction by acts of Congress, having a tendency to continue on paper only hostile conditons into a time of peace. With no reason of national import to justify its exercise, and without constitutional authority to sustain it, courts will not uphold acts done either under an abortive power or one equally as bad, —a power once good but inert through its own limitation.</p>

Shortly after the armistice, our own army was disbanded, and when the restoration order was issued our economic life was on a peace basis, with the usual troubles incident thereto.

As stated by an eminent jurist, “It is clear that there is a broad distinction between the rights of liquor dealers and constitutional rights of the one dealing in coal, a necessary commodity, and a business which has nothing of that evil tendency of the manufacture and sale of liquor. Liquor dealers have constant notice that their business is subject to drastic regulation and restraint in legislative discretion, and that the incidental losses by reason thereof, however heavy, must be borne by those risking their capital in it. The distinction between the two kinds of business is clearly made in Mugler v. Kansas, <a href="/us/123/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="123 U.S. 623" data-case-ids="3523081" data-case-paths="/us/123/0623-01">123 U. S. 623</a>, and Stone v.

It follows that fixing prices for coal and regulating its distribution, if valid, is a field of policing in which much greater care must be exercised by the legislative power to see that it does not constitute a sacrifice of the property whose price is fixed or whose disposition is regulated, than in restricting the sale of liquor.”</p>
