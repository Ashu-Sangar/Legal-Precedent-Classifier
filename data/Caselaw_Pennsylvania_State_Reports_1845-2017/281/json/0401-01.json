The trial court entered judgment on a verdict in her favor, and the city has appealed, asking that the judgment be reversed and entered for it.\nThe court below properly decided that Justice & Co. v. Phila., 169 Pa. 503, ruled the present case. See also Iron City Auto Co. v. Pittsburgh, 253 Pa. 478, 488.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
