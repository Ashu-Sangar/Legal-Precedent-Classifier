The equity rules in force when this case was tried provided by Buie 64 that parties shall have ten days in which to file exceptions, \u201cwhich exceptions shall cover all objections to ......findings of fact and law.\u201d Here appellant was denied this right. In Lincoln v. Africa, 228 Pa. 546, 552, we said, \u201cWhere an equity case has been tried in violation of the equity rules......the Supreme Court will...... set aside the decree\u201d and remit the record with a procedendo; that course will be followed in the present instance.\nAnd now, October 15, 1924, the decree is set aside and the record is remitted to the court below to proceed in accordance with the requirements of the equity rules, costs to await final decree.",
