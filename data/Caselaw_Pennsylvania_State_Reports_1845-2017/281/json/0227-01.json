L. 7S6.\n1. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, is not unconstitutional as being in conflict with the treaty between the United States and the Kingdom of Italy as amended February 13, 1913.\n2. Such treaty guarantees equal rights and protection to the nationals of both countries with respect to cases of injury or death resulting from negligence or unlawful violence, no matter what may be the relation existing between the party injured and the one responsible for the injury.\n3. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act did not take from any person the right to recover damages for injuries or death resulting from negligence or unlawful violence.\n4. Under the system provided by the act, an employee may recover for an injury for which his own negligence was entirely responsible, unless it was self-inflicted.\n5. The employer and employee may contract under which system they shall be bound.\n6. If a covenant of such contract is that nonresident alien parents of the workman shall not be entitled to compensation, the parties are bound by it.\nArgued May 26, 1924.\nAppeal, No. 6, May T., 1924, by defendants, from judgment of Superior Court, March T., 1923, No. 30, affirming judgment of C. P. Dauphin Co., June T., 1922, No. 397, affirming decision of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board in case of Pasquale Liberato and Anna Liberato, his wife, by attorney in fact Giovanni DeSanto, v. S.
