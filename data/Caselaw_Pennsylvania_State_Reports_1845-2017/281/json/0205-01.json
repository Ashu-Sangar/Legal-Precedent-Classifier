L. 267; besides, petitioner fails to aver that the result of the election was in any way affected by the alleged errors of which she complains. Moreover, the real point which appellant desires reviewed, namely, whether ballots marked in a described manner should, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d have been counted for certain persons, presents a question for an election contest (Pfaff v. Bacon, 249 Pa. 297, 304), and the petition lacks sufficiently specific averments of fraud, connected with this question, to render it one proper for consideration in a computation proceeding. In Plains Township Election Returns, 280 Pa. 520, we recently examined the general subject here involved.\nUnder these circumstances, there is no necessity for discussing the jurisdiction of the court below or other points suggested by the record.\nThe appeal is dismissed.",

A petition to open a ballot box and count thq votes will not be granted where petitioner fails to aver that the result of the election was in any way affected by the alleged errors of which she complains, and the averments of fact in the petition do not present an instance of \u201cpalpable fraud and mistake\u201d within the meaning of section 13 of the Act of May 19, 1923, P.
