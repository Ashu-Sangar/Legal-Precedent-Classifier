      {
        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nTestator directed that his residuary estate should be \u00a1divided into four parts; one he gave to Ms brother in fee, if surviving, or, if not, then to the brother\u2019s issue, if any, and, in default thereof, to his (testator\u2019s) three sisters; the second and third shares he gave separately, each in trust for a sister for life, with remainder to her surviving child or children and the issue of any who might be deceased, and, in default of both, to testator\u2019s surviving brother and sisters in equal shares; finally, he directed his executors to hold the last fourth \u201cin trust for the use and benefit of my sister, Helen M. Foulke, [they] to collect, receive and recover the rents, issues, income, dividends and profits accruing and to accrue thereon, and after the payment of all taxes, water rents, repairs and other charges, to pay the net income thereon unto my sister, Helen M. Foulke, so long as she shall live, without any power of anticipation or assignment by her, and at and immediately upon the death of my said sister, Helen M. Foulke, to pay, transfer and set over the principal of said share, together with any accrued income, to such child or children as my said sister, Helen M. Foulke, may leave her surviving, and the issue of any child or children who may be deceased, in equal shares, per stirpes, in fee. But if my said sister, Helen M. Foulke, should die without leaving any child or children, or the issue of any deceased child or children her surviving, then and in that case to pay, transfer and set over the principal and any accrued income of said share to and among my nephew, George W. Foulke, and my nieces, Margaret G. and Anna P. Foulke, the survivors or survivor of them, in equal shares in fee.\u201d\nHelen, the life tenant, died without ever having had any children born to her; but leaving a girl, whom she, Helen, had adopted by a deed executed and recorded long before the date of testator\u2019s will. The testimony disclosed that the child lived with her adopting mother, was known to decedent, and spoken of by him, as the daughter of his sister Helen, and was so treated by him and the rest of the family. The evidence does not show, however, that testator ever said he had given or intended to give to the adopted daughter any interest in his estate, and the will does not refer to her in any way.\nUpon the death of the life tenant, the trustee filed his account. The auditing judge awarded the principal of the trust to the adopted daughter; but exceptions filed by the nephew and nieces were sustained by the court in banc, and the fund awarded to them. The adopted daughter thereupon took the second of the above appeals.\nAt the audit it also appeared that a corporation, some of whose stock belonged to the trust estate, had accumulated, during Helen\u2019s lifetime, a certain amount of income, nearly all of which had been distributed to the shareholders, including the trustee, before the date of her death; but the trustee had erroneously treated the fund as principal, and had not given it to her. A small part was paid to him after she died. It was admitted by both parties that the two sums should be treated alike, and by the nephew and nieces that ordinarily they would be payable to the estate of the life tenant. It was claimed by them, however, that, under the foregoing clause of the will, testator had ordered otherwise. This claim was overruled, and from the decree, which awarded the fund to the estate of the life tenant, the nephew prosecutes the first of the above appeals.\nConsidering this latter objection to the decree, we find that the nephew\u2019s contention is that, since the distribution to the remaindermen of \u201cprincipal and any accrued income,\u201d was to be made \u201cimmediately upon the death\u201d of the life tenant, the \u201caccrued income\u201d referred to could only mean that which had \u201caccrued\u201d before her death, but had not been distributed to her. This is ingenious but not sound. It makes the life tenant\u2019s right depend entirely on the action or inaction of others, or their mistakes or fraud. A testator could, of course, so provide; but he who asserts it has a heavy burden to carry. In the present instance it is not difficult to disprove the claim.\nBy the clause of the will under consideration, testator gave to his sister the \u201cprofits accruing and to accrue\u201d on, the share of the estate to be held in trust for her. He does not limit his gift to the profits which shall be paid to or distributed by the trustee. When, then, he gives the principal and \u201caccrued income\u201d to the remainder-men, after the death of the life tenant, it is so highly improbable he meant to revoke the gift already made, that we naturally conclude his purpose was to bequeath, as is usual, only that which constitutes the estate in remainder ; in a word, the remaindermen were to receive the estate as left by the testator, and no more, the profits earned by it during the life estate going to the life tenant: Waterman\u2019s Est., 279 Pa. 491, 495.\nIt is clear to us that the word \u201cimmediately,\u201d so much relied on by appellant, refers to the time of distribution, rather than to what shall pass at that time. The accounting of the trust was not to be delayed; the principal and \u201caccrued income,\u201d converted or unconverted, was to be paid to the remaindermen \u201cimmediately.\u201d We have neither the right nor the inclination to add to the language giving the income \u201caccruing and to accrue\u201d to the life tenant, the words, \u201cprovided it is actually received and paid over to her during her lifetime,\u201d or anything of like tenor. We could quite as well add a similar qualification to the gift to appellant, for if \u201caccrued,\u201d in one place, means both accrued and paid, no reason appears why it should not be given the same meaning when it is used for the second time; the law does not sanction such an addition in either event, however.\nTurning now to the first of the above disputes, we may assume, for the purposes of this case, that, as between the life tenant and her adopted child, the latter acquired all the rights she would have had had she been born to the life tenant. She was not an actual child of her adopted mother, however; and, since the estate now being distributed never belonged to that mother, our real question is: Where there is a gift by a third party to one for life, with remainder to her child or children, does the latter provision include an adopted child, in the absence of anything in the will to show testator so intended? Under the facts found, much might be said in favor of an affirmative answer, if the question was an open one; since it was settled to the contrary, however, section 16 (b) of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 409, was passed to provide that, as to decedent\u2019s dying o.n and after December 31,1917, an adopted child shall take, where, as here, it was adopted before the will was executed. In the present instance, testator died seven years before that date.\nIn Schafer v. Eneu, 54 Pa. 304, the gift, by will, was in trust for the sole and separate use of a married woman for life, with remainder to her children. It was held that an adopted child could not take. It is true, in that case the adoption took place after the death of testator, but the decision was placed squarely on the ground, \u2014 quoting and following Com. v. Nancrede, 32 Pa. 389, \u2014 that \u201cgiving an adopted son a right to inherit does not make him a son in fact, and he is so regarded in law, only to give the right to inherit\u201d from his adopting parents. The same conclusion was reached in Freeman\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 40 Pa. Superior Ct. 31, where the life tenant was given a power of appointment \u201cto such person or persons of kin\u201d as he might select, \u201cand in default of such appointment [the estate should go to his] child or children.\u201d It was held an adopted child could neither be appointed to take, nor allowed to do so under the clause last quoted. Edwards\u2019 App., 108 Pa. 283, 290, and Morgan v. Reel, 213 Pa. 81, 90, cite and approve the conclusion in Schafer v. Eneu, supra. To the same effect is Burnett\u2019s Est., 219 Pa. 599, where we held that an adopted child could, not inherit from the collateral kindred of the adopting parents.\nPuterbaugh\u2019s Est., 261 Pa. 235, greatly relied on by appellant, does not help her. True, it was there said that decedent, when he made his will, did not appear to have had any knowledge that his son might later adopt the child who was claiming under the will; but this was simply stating an additional reason against the claim of the adopted child, and cannot be considered the same as saying that, if testator had known of the fact, the adopted child would have taken under his will, because of the gift in remainder to \u201cchild or children.\u201d On the contrary, Schafer v. Eneu, supra, is cited and approved in its statement to the contrary; and, as correctly stated in the syllabus, we again held that the word \u201cchildren\u201d \u201cwhen it occurs in a will [should ordinarily be confined and limited] to its natural import, except where the testator has clearly shown by other words that he intended to use the term in a more extensive sense.\u201d Such other words do not appear here.\nOf course, it is the intention of the testator which is to be carried into effect, and where the will shows it was his purpose that an adopted child should share under a general gift to children, it must be so construed; but it must so appear from the will itself, and not extrinsically, where the will is silent on the subject and is not doubtful in meaning: Line\u2019s Est., 221 Pa. 374. It is also true, as appellant further claims, that we must put ourselves in testator\u2019s place in order to determine what he meant by his will (Sheaffer\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 15), but, when we have reached that coign of vantage, we must still declare the meaning of the language used, and not some other possible but undisclosed purpose: Ludwick\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 365. Were this not so, verbal wills might become quite common, despite the requirement of the Wills Act.\nAssuming that testator knew his sister was too old to have progeny, as appellant so strongly urges upon us, the contention that he must have meant the word \u201cchild\u201d to refer to appellant, is still without weight; for the gift is to \u201csuch child or children as my said sister, Helen M. Eoulke, may leave her surviving,\u201d etc., etc., and no satisfactory explanation can be given of his use of the word \u201cchildren\u201d in that connection, if, knowing his sister could bear none, he meant the word \u201cchild\u201d to refer to the one she had adopted. In truth, the language used was exactly the same as in the gift to his two other sisters, who had children, and the evident purpose was simply to put them all on the same plane.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed, and each appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellant.

Where a trust provides that the income from it shall be paid ' to one distributee for life, and the principal and remainder to another, ordinarily all the income that accrued during the life estate must be paid to the life tenant, or his personal representatives, even though not collected or distributed during his lifetime.\n2. A life tenant\u2019s right to such income, in the absence of very clear language to the contrary, cannot be made to depend on the action or inaction of the trustee.\nParent and child \u2014 Adoption\u2014Rights of adopted children \u2014 Not to take under gift by will to children of adopting parent \u2014 Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 1,03.\n3. Although as between an adopted child and the adopting parent, the child will be given, under our statutes, the same rights in the parent\u2019s estate as he would \"have had had he been born of the latter, this does not make him an actual child of the adopting parent, and, ordinarily, he will not be entitled to take, under the will of a third party (who died before December 31,1917), if it simply makes a gift to the child or children of such adopting parents.\n4. The fact that the adopted child was spoken of by testator as the child of the adopting mother, does not alter the conclusion stated, even thought the adopting mother, at the time the will was made, had no other children, and was of such an age as to render it probable there would never be any born to her.\n5. This rule has been changed by section 16 (b) of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 409, so far as relates to a testator dying on or after December 31, 1917, if the child was adopted before the will was made.\nWills \u2014 Construction\u2014Intention\u2014Undisclosed purpose.\n6. While the court must put itself in a testator\u2019s place, in order to correctly decide what he meant by the language used in his will, it must, from that standpoint, determine only what was his expressed intention, and not seek for some other possible but undisclosed purpose.\nArgued May 21, 1924.\nAppeals, Nos. 68 and 74, Jan. T., 1925, by Geo. W. Foulke and Effie R. Foulke, from decree of O. O. Phila. Co., Oct. T., 1901, No. 163, affirming and dismissing certain exceptions to adjudication, in estate of David G. Yates, deceased.\nBefore Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaffer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication of Thompson, J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nExceptions sustained as to award of principal, in opinion by Gest, J., and dismissed as to award of income.

Foulke. \u2014\nThe terms of the will giving the principal of the one-fourth share to the child or children of Helen M. Foulke would remain inoperative, and in fact be meaningless, unless the sense of the word \u201cchild\u201d were extended beyond its natural import: Hallowell v. Phipps, 2 Wharton 276; Dickinson v. Lee, 4 Watts 82; Eichelberger\u2019s Est., 5 Pa. 264; Hunt\u2019s Est, 133 Pa. 260.\nFor the purpose of ascertaining, not defeating, testator\u2019s intent, evidence is admissible to prove the circumstances and conditions surrounding him at the time he made his will, in order that the will may be properly expounded: Postlewaite\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 477; Follweiler\u2019s App., 102 Pa. 581; Webb v. Hitchins, 105 Pa. 91; Hermann\u2019s Est., 220 Pa. 52; Adams v. Johnson, 227 Pa. 454; Shaffer\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 15; Wood\u2019s Est., 267 Pa. 462; Brooklyn Tr. Co. v. Warrington, 277 Pa. 204.\nHelen M. Foulke had a vested interest for life in all income. She could have compelled payment to her by the trustees of all income collected by them. Her executrix can enforce her right: Sheets\u2019s Est., 52 Pa. 257.\nNeither the fact that the trustee has not paid over the income nor the fact that the trustee has not received the income, affects the life tenant\u2019s right to the net income \u201cso long as she shall live\u201d: Wengerd\u2019s Est., 143 Pa. 615; Mullen\u2019s Est., 19 W.

Partenheimer, 159 Pa. 556.\nNeither by the will nor testimony is it shown that the adopted child should share in testator\u2019s bounty: Puterbaugh\u2019s Est., 261 Pa. 235.\nJuly 8, 1924:"
