        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nThe plant of the Standard Steel Car Company, defendant, is located at Butler, and extending westerly therefrom it has a system of railroad tracks, which separates the plant of the Forged Steel Wheel Company (herein called the \u201cWheel Company\u201d) from the tracks of the Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Company. A public highway known as \u201cThe Township Road\u201d crosses this system of tracks, and about nine hundred feet to the west is a scale house. What is called \u201cthe scale track,\u201d part of defendant\u2019s system, extends from the above mentioned public road, passes the scale house and thence connects with the railroad. By agreement between the Wheel Company and the defendant, the freight cars serving the former pass in and out upon the scale track of the latter. The Wheel Company has a yard engine and crew by which out-going freight cars are moved easterly upon its track to near the public road and thence by means of a crossing switch are transferred to the scale track where they are picked up by defendant\u2019s yard engine and placed on the railroad tracks. On February 23, 1923, the Wheel Company\u2019s yard engine dreAV nine empty out-going coal cars from its yard and was placing them on the scale track in the usual manner when they so violently collided with cars of the defendant on the same track that the plaintiff, Ralph Kramer, a yard brakeman in the Wheel Company\u2019s employ, was thrown under a car wheel and permanently crippled.\nThe trial developed a sharp conflict in the evidence, but on this appeal by defendant, from judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiff, we must assume in the latter\u2019s favor every fact and inference properly deducible from the evidence. So doing, it appears that the Wheel Company\u2019s cars were being placed on the scale track in the customary manner and at the usual hour, of which the conductor on defendant\u2019s yard engine had actual notice; yet backed a train of cars east on this track at the speed of from ten to fifteen miles an hour, striking the Wheel Company\u2019s cars, while yet connected with their engine and moving slowly in the opposite direction, with sufficient force to stop the nine cars and engine and shove them back some eight or ten feet, and that no person was on the rear end of defendant\u2019s train and no warning was given of its approach.\nUnder such circumstances it could not be affirmed as matter of law that defendant was free from negligence. Where as here there is no fixed standard of care and its measure shifts according to the circumstances, the question of negligence is usually for the jury: Jester v. Phila., B. & W. R. R. Co., 267 Pa. 10; Thorne v. Phila. Rapid Transit Co., 237 Pa. 20; West Chester & Phila. R. R. Co. v. McElwee, 67 Pa. 311; Bickley v. So. Penna. Trac. Co., 56 Pa. Superior Ct. 113. \u201cWhere there is a doubt as to the inference to be drawn from the facts, or where the measure of duty is ordinary and reasonable care, and the degree of care required varies with the circumstances, the question of negligence is necessarily for the jury\u201d: Rusterholtz v. R. R. Co., 191 Pa. 390, 401; and see Cohen v. Phila. & Reading R. R. Co., 211 Pa. 227; McNeal v. Ry. Co., 131 Pa. 184. Defendant\u2019s train, which caused the collision, took out the nine cars immediately thereafter, which justifies the conclusion that it ran in there for that purpose; whether under the circumstances it was negligently operated was for the jury to determine.\nThe crew on the Wheel Company\u2019s engine consisted of a conductor, engineer, fireman and plaintiff, a brakeman ; but at the time of the accident the conductor was absent and had left the work of placing the cars on the scale track in charge of plaintiff, who while doing so looked along the track and saw it was clear. His engine was at the east end of the nine cars and facing west. He stepped off the engine when near the highway to be in position to throw the switch, which he did at the proper time, and when the cars came in on the scale track stepped on the foot board of the engine to ride some fifty feet, where he was to cut off the nine cars, but the collision happened before reaching that point. While the question of contributory negligence is strongly urged by appellant, there were no facts nor circumstances in the case to warrant the trial court in so declaring. As plaintiff had to uncouple the cars from the engine he could not be at the front end of his train and was not, as matter of law, negligent because the Wheel Company had failed to place a man there, nor because he was standing on the foot board of the engine; he was obeying the conductor as he had been instructed to do. It is claimed he was violating some of the rules of the Wheel Company; this was disputed, as was the question of his knowledge of the rules. Moreover, a servant\u2019s failure to comply with the master\u2019s rules would not be per se negligence as to a third party.\nEach of appellant\u2019s requests called for binding instructions which could not have been granted, as the case was for the jury. The excerpt from the charge, which is assigned as error, is so entirely accurate as to require no comment.\nComplaint is made that the verdict was excessive, but as no assignment of error raises that question, it need not be considered.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

The appellate court will not consider a complaint that a verdict was excessive, where no assignment of error raises such question.\nArgued October 6, 1924.\nAppeal, No. 134, Oct. T., 1924, by defendant, from judgment of O. P. Butler Co., Sept. T., 1924, No. 91, on verdict for plaintiff, in case of Ralph Kramer v. Standard Steel Car Company.\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaefer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Henninger, P. J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nThe court charged in part as follows: \u201cWere the cars that collided with the Forged Steel Wheel Company\u2019s train standing or were both trains moving when the accident occurred? If the defendant company\u2019s cars were not moving when the accident occurred we say as a matter of law then there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant and the verdict must be for the defendant, but if you find that both trains were moving at the time of the accident, then you must consider defendant\u2019s action and determine whether or not it was negligent in the operation of its train.\n\u201cThe law has defined negligence as being the want of ordinary care under the circumstances. It is the failure to do what an ordinary, prudent and careful person would have done, or not to do what an ordinary, prudent and careful person would have done under the same or like circumstances, and if you find that the crew in charge of the defendant company\u2019s train at the time of the accident was not using the care that a person of ordinary prudence and care would have used, then you will find the defendant negligent.\u201d (7)\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $20,000. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were various instructions, quoting record, and (7) portion of charge as above, quoting it.\nJohn H. Wilson, with him Samuel Walker, for appellant.\nJames E.
