Counsel for appellees was present and asked that we adjudge certain questions as to the meaning of a written stipulation, which, they contend, was entered into by counsel on both sides of the case at the suggestion of this court, when, on a former occasion, hearing of the present appeal was continued. Rule 80 of the Supreme Court provides: \u201cWhen a case is called for argument, if appellant is not ready to proceed and has filed no brief, the appeal will be dismissed as of course.\u201d No brief having been filed by appellant, this appeal must be dismissed; there is nothing before the court which would warrant us in construing the stipulation at the present time.\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed.",
