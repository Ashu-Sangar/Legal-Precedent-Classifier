He told me to throw it [the margin call] in the waste paper basket.” Subsequent margin calls were treated in the same way. After defendants notified her that they had sold the stocks in default of margin, she wrote them, November 18, 1929, in acknowledgment of their notice, that she did “not confirm the sale of said stock as I had previously notified your firm to sell these stocks at a much higher price and if my orders had been complied with you could have sold the stocks as per my orders ...” She then also called at defendants’ place of business and presented her claim for loss to one of the defendants, complaining that her instructions were not carried out; Rogers, who was present, denied that she gave the instructions to sell. The evidence was for the jury <em>(Nanty-Glo Borough v.

Her testimony is that in each instance she immediately telephoned Rogers, with whom alone she had dealt, that she had not ordered the purchase to be made, that it was without her authority, and that she declined to ratify it, and that he replied to her that “stocks would go up and I only had a paper loss” etc. What she did with the margin requests has already been stated above.</p>

If the provision be regarded as a promise<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> by plaintiff to do something rather than as a condition subsequent, defendants fail by the operation of the rule that any material default in performance by them discharges the other party to the contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Regarded as creating a condition subsequent, <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>as we think it should be, it would appear that the parties had provided that defendants should be advised, in the way agreed upon, whether their account with plaintiff was correct or not. It was agreed that the account should be taken as correct unless plaintiff gave written notice to the contrary. Now the record shows that before the notices were sent, defendants had already defaulted; their breach had put at large the relations of the parties; there was nothing, if plaintiff stood on the default, on which defendants could act to which the condition subsequent could apply; plaintiff had in every case immediately refused to ratify what had been done for her account without authority. In this view of the provision relied on, defendants are confronted with another rule, applying the same general principle, and likewise destroying the proposed defense. The rule appears in the <em>Restatement, Contracts, </em>section 306, as follows: “Where failure of a party to a contract to perform a condition or a promise is induced by a manifestation to him by the other party that he cannot or will not substantially perform his OAvn promise . . . the duty of such other party becomes independent of performance of the condition or promise.” Thus a disclaimer of liability by an insurer dispenses with the necessity of filing proof of loss: <em>Roe v.

Plaintiff requested defendants, through their agent who was authorized to receive the order, to sell her stocks; when it appeared that defendants would not execute the order, it was no longer incumbent upon her to follow the terms of the <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>agreement repudiated by them, and give a written notice which the parties had provided should be given while the contract remained in force. This conclusion of course is predicated upon the proposition that the order given to Rogers was an order to the defendants. As it is agreed that it was Rogers’s duty to receive plaintiff’s order to sell, the order to him was an order to defendants. They cannot be heard to say that they did not receive the order when the agent they designated to receive it for them did receive it, as the jury found. It is matter of no consequence that her instructions were to sell all the securities and that the effect would have been to close the account. Rogers had as much authority to receive instructions to sell all as to sell any one of them. The question raised as to his authority is not, as defendants suggest, like the question considered in <em>Bosak v. Parrish, </em><a href="/ny/252/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="252 N.Y. 212" data-case-ids="1989792" data-case-paths="/ny/252/0212-01">252 N.

All that defendants, through Rogers, were asked to do in this case, was to sell securities, and that, by their contract, they had agreed to do. Their argument that the purchases made after the breach, with the notices to her, kept the contract alive, falls with the verdict, which must be taken to establish that each time she promptly repudiated the purchases and refused to excuse the breach and have the contract reinstated.</p>

There is nothing in the record to take this ease out of the general rule that notice to the agent is notice to the principal, and to bring it within the cases holding that when an agent commits a fraud in his own and against the interest of his principal, he will not be presumed to have informed his principal.

It covered only part of the evidence on the subject and for that reason an affirmation would have been misleading; but more than that, the transaction of November 6th, referred to in the request, had to do with a loan of $100 made to the plaintiff by Rogers, personally, and his taking as security 80 Fiat Warrants out of the stocks in the account.
