Ap<a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>pellee, the Corn Exchange National Bank &amp; Trust Co., held mortgages on both properties, securing a debt of Mrs. Harris upon which the balance due is $109,379. Púrsuant tó an ordinance, the city in 1934 condemned the properties for use as an addition to the Parkway, located therein. Mrs. Harris employed the other appellant, Myron Jacoby, Esq., to represent her in the condemnation proceedings. She sent him a letter stating: “It is understood and agreed between us that your charges for all legal services in this connection will be ten per cent of the gross amount collected from the city for this condemnation.” The mortgagee bank had notice of the proceedings, and of the fact that Mrs. Harris, the owner, had retained Jacoby to represent her in the matter. It made no objection (of course, it could not do so successfully), nevertheless, it kept silent during the entire proceedings and permitted Attorney Jacoby to bear the entire professional burden during the condemnation proceedings. The success of his efforts clearly redounded to its gain. A board of view was appointed and held hearings, at which Jacoby appeared for Mrs. Harris and produced expert testimony as to the value of the properties. In due course, compensation was awarded the owner in the amount of $67,000 for both properties, which is less than the mortgage debt. The award became final, but before it was paid by the city the mortgagee intervened and filed petitions to have the whole award paid to it as lien creditor. The lower court granted the petitions and awarded the entire fund to the bank, permitting Jacoby to intervene and file exceptions to the dismissal of his claim to ten per cent of the award, as counsel fee, and his reasonable costs and expenses of conducting the litigation against the city. It now appears that Mrs. Harris is insolvent, so that no hope can be entertained that she will be able to reimburse Jacoby or pay his counsel fee. Appellee does not claim that ten per cent of the award, as agreed upon by Mrs. Harris and Jacoby, is more than the reasonable value of his <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>services.

It insists that its lien on the fund, by virtue of its mortgage, is superior to the claim of anyone through or under Mrs. Harris, the owner. It does not deny, however, that the owner of the property was the party entitled to claim compensation for its taking, and to initiate and conduct the proceedings before the jury of view.

Our decisions establish that in carrying on this type of litigation and securing a proper award the property owner sustains a trust relation as to creditors possessing liens on the property, sufficient to entitle the latter to equitable aid in enforcing such liens upon timely intervention in the proceedings. In <em>Knoll, Admr., v. N. Y., etc., Ry. Co., </em>supra, at pages 474 and 475, we said: “The right of action for . . . damages [in condemnation proceedings] is in the owner. ... If the owner should refuse to move, or should act fraudulently, the courts upon a proper application by lien creditors would no doubt treat him as a trustee and require him to do, or permit his creditors to do in his name, what might be necessary to an adjustment of the damages, and impound the money for those equitably entitled to receive it. . . . The claim asserted, however, would have been that of the owner, and the damages when settled would have been paid out under an order of the court. ... In these cases,, the courts seem to have regarded the owner as a trustee for his lien creditors, and a recovery in his name as one to be controlled for their benefit.” To similar effect is <em>Woods Run Avenue, </em>

If it thought its rights prejudiced, there was no reason why it could not intervene at the commencement of the condemnation proceedings, averring its claim as lien creditor, and demanding a right to be heard. Upon a proper application it would have had the right to appear by counsel and present evidence as to the value of the property taken, since it had the primary interest in the property. It is with poor grace that it now presses its claim to the full amount of the award, having held aloof when its interest was imperiled and was being protected by another party in interest seeking (but unsuccessfully) to salvage her equity in the property. If a principle in law or equity can be found to sustain an award of reasonable counsel fee and costs to the owner’s attorney, who litigated the compensation dispute and whose services helped produce the fund, it ought to be applied.</p>

On the other hand, the right of an attorney to a <em>charging </em>lien upon a fund in court or otherwise applicable for distribution on equitable principles, which his services primarily aided in producing and to which, by agreement with his client, he is to look for compensation, has long been recognized by the authorities.

In that case this court said at page 620: “The fact is found by the auditor and the court that the appellee was to look to this fund for his compensation. Its existence is due in great measure to his professional services. To the extent of the value of those services, then, the fund belonged to him; that is to say, he was the equitable owner thereof to the amount of his fee. When, therefore, it was discovered that the appellant was endeavoring to take the fund out of court by the aid of other counsel, thus ignoring the appellee’s claim, the court below did right in laying its hand upon such a proceeding. It was acting as a court of equity; it was .administering a fund within its actual grasp, and it was entirely competent to dispose of every question connected with that fund. It had been in the hands of a receiver but the receiver had paid it into court.

In 1 Jones on Liens (3d ed.) 132, section 147, it is said: “An attorney may have a special lien upon a fund in court or in the hands of a receiver, recovered by him, and a court of equity, having such a fund in its possession, will protect the attorney in retaining out of it a reasonable compensation for his services.” And further, at page 206, section 201a: “An attorney has a lien upon a fund recovered by his aid paramount to the claims of persons interested in the fund of their creditors. The lien in such case exists without the aid of the statute”: 2 Thornton on Attorneys at Law states the principle as follows (Page 1022, section 624.) : “It is well settled that an attorney is entitled to compensation out of a fund which has been brought into a court of equity by his aid, and to which he looks for payment. Strictly speaking, perhaps, the fund is not actually charged with a lien; indeed, it is rather in the nature of an equitable allowance; but it has the effect of a lien, and is frequently spoken of as such.” (Page 975, section 578) : “The charging lien, originally, was defined to be the right of an attorney at law to recover compensation for his services from a fund recovered by his aid, and also the right to be protected by the court to the end that such recovery might be effected. Unlike the retaining lien, the charging lien does not depend upon possession, but upon the favor of the court in protecting attorneys, as its own officers, by taking care, <em>ex cequo et </em>bono, that a party should not run away with the fruits of the cause without satisfying the legal demands of the attorney by <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>whose industry those fruits were obtained. . . . Nor is the charging lien a merely passive one, but, on the contrary, it entitles the attorney to take active steps to secure its satisfaction.” (Page 978, section 580) : “The doctrine under which the charging lien became effective was established on general principles of justice, and it rests upon the theory that one should not be permitted to profit by the result of litigation without satisfying the demand of his attorney. It has been well described as ‘a mere arbitrary exercise of power by the courts; not arbitrary in the sense that it was unjust or improper, but in the sense that it was not based upon any right or principle recognized in other eases.’ The parties being in court, and a suit commenced and pending, the courts invented this practice, and assumed this extraordinary power, for the purpose of protecting attorneys in their compensation.”</p>

In <em>Wilson v. Pittsburgh B. &amp; I. Works, </em><a href="/pa-super/85/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="85 Pa.

Superior Ct. 537</a>, the employer claimed a right to the whole fund, but his claim was denied and the employee’s attorney was ordered paid. Speaking of the employee’s action for damages, Judge Keller said, at page 540: “It is well known that such an action does not prosecute itself ; that lawyers must be employed and paid; and the question naturally arises by whom are their fees and expenses to be paid. The only interest of the employee in the action is in case the verdict should exceed the compensation payable to him by the employer; it would seem unjust to make him pay the expenses of a successful suit out of his compensation, to the sole benefit of the employer, if the verdict did not exceed such compensation. The interest of the employer, on the other hand, is immediate reimbursement up to the amount of the compensation paid and relief from future payments, and unless the verdict is in excess of the compensation payable by him, he alone is benefited by the recovery; just as in this case, every dollar of the net recovery goes to the employer, none to the injured employee. . . . The employer stands in the place of the employee, as respects the fruits of the action against the wrongdoer, to the extent of the compensation paid and payable by him. But the attorney who prosecuted the action and secured the fund is entitled to retain out of the money paid to him in satisfaction of the verdict reasonable compensation for his services in the case and reimbursement of his ex<a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>penses in connection therewith. The injured employee, as plaintiff in the action, is only entitled to the balance remaining in the attorney’s hands after such payment, and subrogation gives to his employer no higher rights than the former possesses.

We will go farther and say that even where a lien creditor, such as the mortgagee in the case before us, has a claim upon the property superior to the owner’s, yet, if his interest in the fund created, which the owner is primarily entitled to collect, is substantially identical with that of the owner, and the fund is realized solely through the efforts of the owner’s attorney, who agrees to look to the fund for his compensation, the lien expeditor must yield his claim to the attorney’s reasonable claim for compensation and must yield his claim also to the payment of the legal costs.</p>

Of course, where the owner has merely assigned to third parties his interest in the award of damages, this cannot defeat the mortgagee’s claim to the whole of it on a valid debt. “It does not lie in the mouth of the owner or his assignees, with notice of the recorded mortgage, to contend that the first mortgagee should be satisfied with an impaired or lessened equity in the mortgaged property”: <em>Sarapin v. </em>Phila., <a href="/pa/306/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="306 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="1136844" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0388-01">306 Pa. 388</a>, 390, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%20866" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="159 A. 866">159 A. 866</a>.

He conducted the entire litigation which resulted in the award, without assistance from appellee, the party which, if the decree of the court below stands, will be the sole beneficiary of Jacoby’s efforts. It is not denied that his efforts were successful and that they resulted in augmenting the fund realized. The attorney agreed to accept his compensation out of the fund, his client being otherwise unable to reimburse him. The interest of the owner and the mortgagee was identical — to raise as large a fund as possible, so that, as the owner hoped, something would be left for her after paying the mortgagee, and, as the mortgagee hoped, its security interest would be realized in full. The attorney’s services were more than desirable; they were essential. If the owner had refused to employ counsel and participate in the condemnation proceedings, presumably the mortgagee would have done so. It would be manifestly unjust to permit the mortgagee to reap all the benefits of the attorney’s endeavors and to “get out from under” even the smallest share of the burden which produced the benefits.

W. 725</a>, the legal situation was similar to the one now before us. Plaintiff sustained a partial fire loss on its building and brought suit against its insurer, being represented by one McVey, who conducted the suit in all its stages and recovered a verdict for the owner. Intervening mortgagees claimed the entire proceeds of recovery, the insurance policy having contained a loss payable clause in their favor. The owner’s attorney was, however, awarded reasonable compensation out of the fund. The court said, at pages 735-737: “It is contended by the interveners that they severally had independent rights of action upon the insurance policy, employed independent counsel, and are in no manner responsible for <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>the services rendered by McVey. The plaintiff, also, while accepting the benefits of McVey’s services, repudiates his claim, and denies that he was employed to conduct the suit. . . . The record discloses not the slightest ground for the plantiff’s appeal from this order. Mr. McVey brought the suit and conducted the litigation in its behalf to the end, and, as against his client at least, had both legal and moral right to demand payment from the recovery secured by him. . . . Nor do we think the interveners can justly complain of the allowance of attorney’s fees. It may be true that they could have brought independent actions upon their several claims, but they did not. They waited several months after the loss occurred without moving to collect the insurance, until the plaintiff, acting as it had the right, if, indeed, it was not in duty bound to do, brought action in its own name, when they availed.themselves of the proceedings thus begun by intervening therein. They did not and could not thereby displace the plaintiff or its counsel. They could, if they saw fit, unite with plaintiff and assist in prosecuting the claim; but they could not make the verdict returned and the judgment entered thereon anything less than a recovery for the plaintiff. The court could and did, upon their demand, recognize their rights as lienholders, and ordered the sum so recovered, less the expenses of such recovery, applied to the payment of their liens in the order of their admitted priority. In effect, the suit was brought by the plaintiff for the benefit of the mortgagees, and it is well established that in actions lawfully prosecuted by one person for the benefit of another he may, for that purpose, employ counsel, whose reasonable compensation is a charge upon the proceeds of a recovery so obtained. . . . There was therefore no error in the order of distribution as entered by the trial court. Interveners have obtained the full proceeds of the insurance, subject only to the reasonable expense of its collection, and they suffer no wrong in the refusal of their demand for more.”</p>
