The personal representatives of the son claim the entire fund, while the executor of the widow’s estate, on behalf of her descendants by a former marriage, claims that he is entitled to one half. The solution of the controversy involves a construction of the terms of the testator’s will with a view to ascertaining the interest taken by the widow in the decedent’s realty. Did she take a one-third interest for life, as provided by article I, of section 1, of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> in force at the time the will was executed, or did she take, at the minimum, one half absolutely, under section 1 (a) of the Act of June 7, 1917, P.

    <p id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.4",75,[167,505,1164,1396]]]'>Paramount in the construction of any will is the actual intention of the testator, and the ascertainment of that intention is, in the last analysis, the province of the courts: <em>Byrne’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/320/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="320 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1163635" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0513-01">320 Pa. 513</a>. The intention is to be gathered from the entire will, read as a connected whole, rather than from the terms of a particular or isolated devise, which, regarded alone, might be inconsistent with the testator’s obvious testamentary scheme: <em>Bumm’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/306/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="306 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1136849" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0269-01">306 Pa. 269</a>; <em>Murray’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/313/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="313 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1152642" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0359-01">313 Pa. 359</a>; <em>Conner’s Estate (No. 2), </em><a href="/pa/318/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="318 Pa. 150" data-case-ids="1159610" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0150-01">318 Pa. 150</a>.

It must be read and its meaning interpreted in the light of the circumstances by which the testator was surrounded when he made it and by which he was very probably influenced, chief among which are the condition of his family, the .natural objects of his bounty, and the amount and character of his property: <em>Hermann's Estate, </em><a href="/pa/220/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="220 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1005872" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0052-01">220 Pa. 52</a>; <em>Frisbie’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/266/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="266 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1056050" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0574-01">266 Pa. 574</a>; <em>Brooklyn Trust Co. v.

An application of these principles cannot but lead to the conclusion that the will of the present decedent discloses a clear intention to restrict his wife’s share in his real estate to a one-third interest for life.</p>
    <p id="b75-6" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[176,1920,1162,482]],["BL_76.1",76,[271,340,1150,1446]]]'>Uppermost in the testator’s mind was his real estate, its preservation intact during the lives of his widow and. son, and its final sale, to be followed by a distribution of the proceeds among his own grandchildren, to the exclusion of his wife and her issue by a former marriage. It seems clear to us that it was merely by way of introduction that he first directed that his wife should receive such share of his realty as she might be entitled to under the intestate laws. It is apparent from the two para<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>graphs immediately following that the testator still had in mind the whole of his real estate. After making provision for the purchase of the Luzerne County mill property by his son, he proceeded to direct that “all the rest, residue and remainder of [the] real estate” be held intact during the lives of his wife and son, making provision for the distribution of the income during that time. At this point he specifically stated just what his wife’s share was to be, and that share was identical with the provision made by the intestate laws then in force. Under the circumstances the subsequent devise to the wife of a one-third interest for life was not cumulative but repetitious, and in explanation of the original devise. Such an interpretation is not only plainly evident, but it is also in accord with the constructional rule that “In the absence of internal evidence of intent, . . . where two legacies of quantity of equal amount are bequeathed to the same legatee in one and the same instrument, the second bequest is regarded as mere repetition and the beneficiary takes but one legacy”: <em>Kessler’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/288/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="288 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="1100773" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0091-01">288 Pa. 91</a>, at page 95; <em>Black’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/288/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="288 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1100843" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0525-01">288 Pa. 525</a>. Our comment in the latter case, at page 527, is equally applicable in the instant case; here, too, “The will before us contains no internal evidence which in any way weakens the applicability of this principle to the present case. What evidence there is . . . leads to the same conclusion that follows from the rule stated.”</p>

On the contrary, it is clear that his intention was to limit his wife to one third of the income for life, preserving the bulk of the estate and the income thereof for his son and the son’s children, the natural objects of his bounty and the objects of his most earnest solicitude. Speaking of a similar factual situation in <em>Scott’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/313/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="313 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1152699" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0155-01">313 Pa. 155</a>, we <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>said, at page 157: “When we come to consider testator’s circumstances and situation, as we should <em>(Brooklyn Trust Co. v.

It was the natural thing to protect his wife for her lifetime and to allow his estate to go to his children when she should die.”</p>

L. 403, providing that “Every will shall be construed, with reference to the real and personal estate comprised in it, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.” This section previously existed as section 1 of the Act of June 4, 1879, P. L. 88. Our cases have repeatedly held, under both acts, that those sections refer to the property that was devised, not to the estate in the property created by the will: <em>Fidelity Ins.

The object of the legislature was the avoidance of the common-law rule that after-acquired realty did not pass under the terms of a previously executed will. Section 9 of the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, has no reference to the construction of a decedent’s will with a view to ascertaining his intention.</p>

If that provision be deleted an entirely different complexion is thrown upon the will. It cannot be done, however, because so to do would violate the fundamental rule that we must put ourselves in the position of the testator at the time he executed his will and read the will accordingly.
