    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.7",342,[271,550,1150,794]]]'>The property sold in execution consists of about 32 acres of vacant farm and pasturage land in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Prior to her death in 1909, Sallie B. Dingee held a mortgage on it. By her will, containing intricate trust provisions, she devised her homestead and adjoining land to successive life tenants, among them appellee, the present occupant, with remainders over, and other land to plaintiff as trustee. Appellee was legatee of the residue, subject to a charge thereon for taxes and insurance on the homestead property, if not paid by the first life tenants. The mortgage on the 32-acre tract formed part of the residue and was awarded to plaintiff <em>as </em>trustee, He bought in the property at foreclosure in 1921, taking title as trustee, and carried it at a loss from that time to 1930.</p>

Taxes and insurance not having been paid, plaintiff, as trustee, petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Bucks County to sell the 32-acre tract, then presumed to be part of the trust estate, to raise a fund to pay these charges. The decree dismissing the petition was affirmed by the Superior Court on July 14, 1933, in <em>Dingee’s Est., </em><a href="/pa-super/109/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="109 Pa.

That court held that under the will these items remained a charge on the 32 acres, as part of the residuary estate, only during the period and for the benefit of the first life tenancy; that this having been released to appellee, she could renounce the charge and by her objection (as alienee of the first life tenants’ estate) to the sale had done so; and that notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff had taken title as trustee, appellee had a vested remainder in the tract, subject only to be di<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>vested if the charge had to be paid, and was the owner in fee simple free and clear of the charge.

She appealed from the municipal court to the Superior Court in January, 1934, but no bond being filed, there was no supersedeas, and while the appeal was pending, in March, 1934, plaintiff issued.a vend. ex. in Bucks County, on a transcript of the municipal court judgment, to sell the 32-acre plot above described. Appellee petitioned to stay the sale, but this was dismissed and the sale was had, August 10, 1934, on an alias writ.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[195,1325,1151,968]]]'>As the advertisement and conditions of sale show, the property was sold as that of Sallie D. Bailey, without mention of the former trust relationship. Charles L. Taylor, Esq., was attorney for plaintiff on the writ and he caused the sale to be advertised. When the property was put up for sale in the sheriff’s office at Doylestown, Henry A. James, Esq., attorney of record for appellee, appeared and announced to those present that Sallie D. Bailey had no title to the property and that any purchaser should beware of the title he would get if he bid the property in. The property was offered for sale, nevertheless, and was sold for costs, amounting to $59.33, to Charles L. Taylor, who in this instance acted as attorney for Miller, appellant herein and purchaser of the property. Charles L. Taylor signed the conditions of sale as attorney for Miller and hence represented both the plaintiff and the sheriff’s vendee in the purchase of the property.</p>

Taylor, the plaintiff trustee, and his attorney, Charles L. Taylor, with the result that there was no competitive bidding at the sale; that appellee was without funds with which to bid at the sale or make a deposit on a bid; that the property, although it sold for costs, was assessed at $2,800, and was worth $4,600, and hence was sold at a grossly inadequate price. Answers to the petition for the rule were filed by appellant, Miller, and by the sheriff.</p>
    <p id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.4",344,[282,934,1151,478]]]'>Depositions were subsequently taken, at which appellee showed the assessed valuation of the property and proved by a real estate expert that the fair value of the property was $100 an acre.

The real estate broker and his salesman who had charge for appellee, from 1929 on, of the sale of these premises, testified for appellant that they were unable to sell the property at any reasonable price; that they had received only one offer to purchase, at a ridiculously low figure; and that no other persons were interested.' It was also shown that appellee possessed real estate in the City of Philadelphia sufficient in value to satisfy the amount of the judgment. The trustee himself testified that the trust estate had sustained a loss in holding this property from 1922 to 1930; that he had been unable to rent it for enough to pay the taxes, and that it was such a severe burden on the estate he concluded not to buy it in at the sheriff’s sale. It appeared from other evidence that the 32 acres involved are unseated land, accessible only by an unim<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>proved county road, and undesirable either as farm land or pasturage.</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[173,444,1151,480]]]'>The court below held that the sale should be set aside because of the inadequate price, coupled with what it termed “suspicious circumstances surrounding the sale”; the fact that the property was advertised in a misleading manner as that of Sallie D. Bailey, whereas record title had been in plaintiff as trustee, who had given no deed to appellee; and the further fact that the trustee’s own attorney bid the property in for a third party.</p>

The property was advertised and sold as the property of Sallie D. Bailey, and not of her trustee, because it was her property, as the Superior Court had previously adjudicated. Appellee herself averred in her petition to set aside the sale that she was the owner in fee of the property.

This involved a misconception of fact and of the legal relationship of the parties. Plaintiff was not trustee of the tract sold. He had parted with his interest in it when his right to enforce a charge against it ceased to exist, as the Superior Court held in <em>Dingee’s Est., </em>supra. He owed no duty to appellee or to the trust estate as regards this property, and in levying execution he dealt with appellee at arm’s length. The same is true of appellant, who was interested in buying <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>at the sale. No fraud or collusion between the two was shown, nor any effort to discourage bidding by other interested parties, or to depress the price for which the land was sold, however inadequate it proved to be.

O’Brien, </em><a href="/pa-super/29/0208-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="29 Pa. Super. 208" data-case-ids="860108" data-case-paths="/pa-super/29/0208-01">29 Pa. Superior Ct. 208</a>, 211. Plaintiff, the party beneficiary interested, would be the only one entitled to object. The debtor would have no standing to complain, any more than a mortgagor can object to a mortgagee’s buying in property at a foreclosure sale. To that extent it has never been doubted that a judgment creditor is always entitled to protect his lien, so long as he uses no unfair means to injure his debtor’s interest.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[290,1742,1149,311]]]'>That appellee had property in Philadelphia, where the judgment was entered, which could have been subjected to the claim, is no reason for questioning a sale lawfully carried out in another county. Plaintiff was not bound to exhaust the debtor’s property in the county of his judgment.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[290,2065,1149,143]]]'>We hold that the order setting aside the sale was, for the reasons stated, not a proper exercise of discretion by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[290,2229,1150,143]]]'>The decree is reversed, with instructions to discharge the rule to set aside the sale; costs to be paid by appellee.</p>
