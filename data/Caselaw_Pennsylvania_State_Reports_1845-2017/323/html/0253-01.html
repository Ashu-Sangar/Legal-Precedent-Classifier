Hood died in 1921, leaving no issue. His wife, Josephine M. Hood, survives him and is sole beneficiary and executrix of his will. Mary Virginia Gigon died December 18,1931. She left no issue surviving her. She had two children, both of whom survived the decedent. They died in the lifetime of their mother, unmarried, intestate and without issue. She divorced her husband, Jules Gigon, on February 20, 1922. He is still living. She left her entire estate to her brother, James D. Hood, and appointed him executor.</p>

He turned the solu<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>tion of the problem largely on the words “as above provided” and if they were to be held controlling, the problem would be a difficult one. He thought that these words reverted back to the language in the previous part of the paragraph “in case any of my said children should be dead at the time of my decease, then the share or shares of such child or children shall vest in their issue in equal shares respectively, per stirpes, and in default of such issue, then in the survivors among my said children or in their issue as the case may be,” and held that the gift passed to those of the children of the testator who were living at his death as vested remainders, eliminating, however, Mary Virginia Gigon. As to her, he said: “I eliminate any consideration of the contention that James D. Hood is entitled to the whole of this share as executor and sole beneficiary under the will of his sister, Mary Virginia Gigon. This was not a vested remainder in her. Her one-fourth share given to her in fee, was cut down one-half. As to that half, which is the fund now before me, she was given but a life estate and nothing more. No citation of authority seems necessary in the face of the plain and unequivocal terms of the will.” We are in agreement with this conclusion so far as any interest in Mary Virginia Gigon is concerned for reasons which will hereafter be stated.</p>

See <em>Steinmetz’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/194/0611-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="194 Pa. 611" data-case-ids="912420" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0611-01">194 Pa. 611</a>. But there is added the words ‘as above provided.’ This must mean something; and when we look above for the other reference to surviving children we find it in the general gift of the residuary estate. This is a gift to the children of the testator equally (Mary’s separate use trust being excepted out of her share) and <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>‘in case any of my said children should be dead at the time of my decease, then the share or shares of such child or children shall vest in their issue in equal shares respectively, per stirpes, and in default of such issue then in the survivors among my said children or in their issue as the case may be.’ The testator here expressly directs that the surviving children are to be determined ‘at the time of my decease’ and this applies by his direction to the persons who are to take at the death of Mary. The children who survived the tesator were four — Mary, Emma, James and Frederick, and the awards should be to them or their personal representatives if they are dead. The auditing judge treated the word ‘survivors’ (which included a life tenant) as ‘others.’ Therefore, excluding Mary, he awarded in three parts to the others. Although Mary was the life tenant, she may nevertheless be one of the remaindermen: <em>Tatham’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/250/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="250 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1017024" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0269-01">250 Pa. 269</a>; <em>Nass’s Est. </em>[<a href="/pa/320/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="320 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1163662" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0380-01">320 Pa. 380</a>].”</p>

We think no such result could have been contemplated or intended by the testator, and what we are searching for is his intent. The entire paragraph indicates that it was his intent to pass his property to persons of his own blood. In our opinion, the words “as above provided” do not control in the construction of the entire paragraph of the will, they simply modify the words “per stirpes” and the direction “upon her death [Mary’s death] to pay over and transfer and assign the principal thereof to her issue and in default thereof to my surviving children and issue in equal shares per stirpes” means to pay it over to those who are living, therefore in being to receive it, at the death of the life tenant. These are James D. Hood, the surviving son, <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>who takes one-half, and the two grandchildren, Margery Baum Murdock and Helen Cramp, each of whom takes a fourth.</p>

He changed the time of vesting of this share and did not say that it should be distributed to the survivors among his children in the event of the death of a child leaving no issue before he died, but upon Mary’s death “to pay over” in default of issue to his surviving children and issue. There could be no payment over to those who were then dead. At the death of Mary, the life tenant, the only living descendants of the testator who survived the life tenant were the son, James D.

(No. 2), </em>supra, where the question was the same as here, “It would be more than difficult for the writer of this opinion to follow the finely spun threads of difference used in emphasizing the distiriguishing element of each [decided case].” There we said (page 19) : “Testator’s will seems to indicate an intention to create an estate to begin and take effect at the widow’s death, and it first appears as such from the direction to pay and divide the principal.” In the case in hand the same intent appears “upon her [Mary’s] death to pay over and transfer and assign the principal thereof.” If she had left issue, this <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>certainly would mean at her death and we think it so meant if she did not leave issue. As was said in that case (page 20), “Where the estate that follows is then [after the termination of the life estate] brought into being through a direction to pay and divide among surviving brothers and sisters, if living, the description of the event which determines the prior estate will be construed not only as determining the possession or enjoyment of the prior gift, but as being designed to postpone the vesting of the ulterior estates there granted.”</p>
