In the periods of industrial depression which have intermittently retarded our economic progress statutes were passed by various states to facilitate the liquidation of burdensome obligations, especially those arising from mortgages. Sometimes this legislation consisted of moratory laws, delaying proceedings for foreclosure or extending the period of redemption. Sometimes it aimed at the abolition or reduction of deficiency judgments, either by fixing a minimum price for the sale on execution or by providing that the “reasonable” or “fair” value of the property should be allowed as a credit on the debt irrespective of the amount realized. Sometimes courts of equity sought to give relief, in cases in which an adequate price had not been obtained, by refusing confirmation of the sale, or by granting it only on condition that a fair credit be given on the obligation secured by the mortgage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In the re<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>cent depression resort has been had to practically all of these measures, and acts similar to the one before us have been passed in several states.</p>

Accompanying the bond was a mortgage covering certain real estate in the Borough of Aliquippa, Beaver County. Because of a default plaintiff on December 27, 1933, caused judgment to be entered on the bond, the real debt being $14,099.93, and on the same day issued a writ of execution under which the mortgaged premises were sold to plaintiff at sheriff’s sale on February 5, 1934, for $962.94. Plaintiff failing to ask the court to determine the fair value of the property and to fix the amount of the deficiency judgment, defendants on December 12, 1934, petitioned that the judgment be marked satisfied in accordance with the provisions of the Act of January 17, 1934 (Spec. Sess.) P. L. 243, and the prothonotary thereupon entered satisfaction. On July 22, 1935, plaintiff filed a petition on which the court granted a rule on defendants to show cause why the satisfaction should not be stricken from the record. On October 11, 1935, the court dismissed this petition, from which order plaintiff appeals.</p>

Generally speaking, the trend of authority is one of judicial support of a statute the purpose of which is merely to delay redress or shorten periods of limitation in which legal action must be taken, — always provided that the stays granted and limitations imposed are reasonable and definite in duration and that the act safeguards the rights of the party affected during the period in which he is compelled to forego the pursuit of his remedies.

Chief Justice Hughes said, p. 439: “It cannot be maintained that the constitutional prohibition should be so construed as to prevent limited and temporary interpositions with respect to the enforcement of contracts if made necessary by a great public calamity ...” The Chief Justice (p. 445) emphasized the fact that: “As already noted, the integrity of the mortgage indebtedness is not impaired; interest continues to run; the validity of the sale and <em>the right of a mortgagee-purchaser </em>to title or <em>to obtain a deficiency judgment, </em>if the mortgagor fails to redeem within the extended period, <em>are maintained; </em>and the conditions of redemption, if redemption there be, stand as they were under the prior law.” (Italics supplied.)</p>

Whereas before its enactment the mortgagee after a sale on foreclosure had the important right to a judgment measured by the difference between the debt and the net proceeds realized from the sale, by the terms of the act this judgment is reduced by substituting the “fair value” of the property for the price obtained at the sale as the amount of the credit to be allowed. Incidentally it may be noted that in the use of the term “fair value” there is introduced an indefinite and to some extent meaningless standard. The amount of the credit can be measured only in terms of money into which the property may presumably be converted, and to fix a realizable money value, as distinguished from a use or rental value, is practically impossible unless the phrase “fair value” be held to be synonymous with fair <em>market </em>value. It was so construed in <em>Market Street National Bank v. Huff, </em><a href="/pa/319/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="319 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1162353" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0286-01">319 Pa. 286</a>, where it was said, pp. 287, 288: “Any other [value] would not be fair, but speculative.” But the act says that the “fair value” is to be determined as of “the time of the sale,” and yet the very raison d’etre of the act was the fact that the depression had caused the disappearance of a market for real estate and therefore of market values, for where there is no market there can be no market value. That this statement of the inherent weakness of the act is not merely academic or hypercritical is shown by the experience of the courts in hearings to establish deficiency judgments, where real estate experts, instead of testify<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>ing to their opinions of value based on recent market sales of neighboring properties, are obliged, in the absence of such sales and of any actual market standard, to make a theoretical and arbitrary appraisement of the property as representing the “fair” value.</p>

This argument, however, is not founded upon fact, because it was never true that the object of a sheriff’s sale was to fix a valuation of the property; its only purpose was to execute a writ of sale in order that the mortgagee might, through the agency of a public official, convert the collateral security held by him into cash and thus realize whole or partial payment of the debt.</p>

Even if, however, as a bidder at the foreclosure sale, a mortgagee obtains the property at a cheap price, he accomplishes this, as already stated, in an independent capacity and not as mortgagee; as a purchaser he obtains the same title as might have been acquired by any member of the general public in competitive bidding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Moreover, if the system of foreclosures in use does bring about undesirable results, it may be corrected by the parties originally contracting to adopt the appraisement method (assuming that an investor could be induced to loan money on the security of a mortgage with such a provision), or, as to future mortgages, by appropriate legislation.

It is claimed, therefore, that it is only of the latter that plaintiff can complain, but that such provision is merely equivalent to a statute of limitations and as such is constitutional.

So, under the present act, a mortgagee whose judgment is marked satisfied, or improperly reduced in amount, has no possibility of relief thereafter, and profits nothing by the shortness of time to which the act is limited.

Even if it were to be admitted that a stay of foreclosure sales for eighteen months (the period of duration of the act) without any qualifications or conditions imposed upon mortgagor or terre-tenant, would not be invalid, the act does not in terms provide for such a stay nor purport to delay action in any manner. There is no indication of an intention of the legislature to compel mortgagees to postpone or abstain from foreclosures or evictions. The act seeks only to control the amounts of deficiency judgments in personam. It would be unprecedented legal doctrine to hold that, although its provisions are unenforceable, the only recourse of a creditor is to wait until the objectionable act expires. Being un<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>constitutional in its requirement of the crediting of the “fair value” on the judgment, it cannot gain the attribute of validity by providing for its own limitation. There is an obvious difference between an act the purpose and express provision of which is the prescription of a reasonable and safeguarded stay, and one which attempts to accomplish an illegal deprivation of the substantive rights of a creditor, even if its invalid operation is only for a temporary period. To sanction a contrary view would be to permit the legislature to enact legislation by the device of a continuity of statutes which, if fused into one, would admittedly be prohibited by the constitution. In this very case a statute was enacted on July 1, 1935, P. L. 503, the date of expiration of the original act, which in substance renews the provisions of the Act of January 17, 1934, placing still greater restrictions upon recovery of the mortgage indebtedness, and effective until June 30, 1937; it provides in section 11 that “This act shall be deemed and shall be construed to be a continuation of the provisions of the act, approved the seventeenth day of January, 1934, . . . and all rights vested, or duties or obligations imposed, or rights forfeited under the provisions of said act, shall be deemed continued, so vested, imposed or forfeited under this act and enforceable under this act, notwithstanding the expiration of said act of January seventeenth, 1934, by its own limitation.”</p>

But there nevertheless remain boundaries which can be mapped with some degree of definiteness. To reduce the obligations of debtors on judgments in personam cannot be said to be an exercise of the police power. The Mortgage Deficiency Judgment Act does not prevent foreclosures or the taking of possession by mortgagees; it does not affect physical living conditions. It is not in any sense, therefore, analogous to the legislation involved in the rent cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> which <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>dealt with the housing shortage immediately following the world war.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Where large portions of the population are deprived of habitations the public health may well be endangered. But the Mortgage Deficiency Judgment Act does not fall into such a category. As a matter of fact instances are not likely to be numerous in which a debtor suffers mortgaged property to be bid in at a nominal price if he is financially responsible and the amount of a deficiency judgment against him is therefore a matter of practical concern. Indeed the bidding in of property at sheriff’s sales for a trifling sum is not a practice of recent origin. The real evil created by the depression has not been the actual or potential enforcement by mortgagees of deficiency judgments, but the increased number of foreclosures due to inability of mortgagors to meet the terms of their indebtedness.</p>

It is true that the Mortgage Deficiency Judgment Act was passed in relief of mortgage debtors and that it should not be set aside unless clearly violative of a constitutional provision. That the act does conflict with the fundamental law, however, is conclusively demonstrated in the majority opinion. Unless we are to subject all contracts to legislative control or supervision the act must fall. This result does not, in my judgment, prevent mortgage debtors from securing substantial relief in another form of procedure equally as beneficial as that provided by the act in question.

Upon such a petition the evidence would disclose the true value of the property and the court could order a resale, fixing, if necessary, an upset price.

It would require quite a stretch of the imagination to contend that $900, the proceeds of the sale of a property worth $14,000, was not grossly inadequate, and, because of stringent economic conditions, a fraud on the debtor’s right.

I would hold valid the legislation here in question. The majority opinion makes it appear that this legislation is an impairment of the obligation of contract in violation of the Federal Constitution, and that it contravenes provisions of the State Constitution. An analysis of the provisions of the Act leads me to the opposite conclusion. The Mortgage Deficiency Judgment Act of January 17, 1934, P. L. 243, here in question, does not impair any substantive contractual rights of the mortgagee. The mortgagor’s obligation to pay the full amount of the debt is in no way impaired, changed or altered. He remains fully liable therefor. In case of default, the mortgagee may foreclose and proceed to realize the principal sum, plus interest and costs, just as before the Act. The payment of the debt is not postponed one day. All that the Act does is to require the mortgagee to establish and give credit for the “fair value” of the mortgaged premises, before he can proceed against other property of the debtor. As this Court said, speaking of the legislative intent in the passage of this very Act, in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Provident Trust Company, </em><a href="/pa/319/0050-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="319 Pa. 50" data-case-ids="1162325" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0050-01">319 Pa. 50</a>, 52: “The purpose of the Act is to assure in the interest of a defendant mortgagor, a credit on the judgment according to the fair value of the property bought in by the mortgagee, regardless of the amount bid, very often, a nominal amount.” The mortgagee may still obtain a deficiency judgment for any amount by which the principal debt, plus interest and costs, exceeds this “fair value” of the property. The Act merely puts into effect, in times of great economic stress, equitable principles <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>which have long been recognized in the foreclosure of mortgages.</p>
    <p id="b578-4" data-blocks='[["BL_578.4",578,[288,446,1151,1234]]]'>Prior to the enactment of this statute the purpose of the sheriff’s sale was to realize by competitive bidding the fair value of the mortgaged premises. The amount so realized was always in relief of or deducted from the judgment. Due to the conditions of the present time there were no purchasers desiring to buy at sheriff’s sales and competitive bidding almost completely disappeared. Solely for the purpose of affording a remedy for this situation the Legislature passed this Act. When its provisions are examined closely it is to be seen that a procedural change only is brought about by the requirement that “the plaintiff . . . shall . . . petition the court out of which such writ of execution issued to fix the fair value of the property sold,” and to deduct the amount of such fair value from the amount of the judgment, interest and costs before a deficiency judgment may be entered for the balance. It is difficult to understand how it can be declared that this provision goes beyond a mere change in procedure upon the foreclosure of a mortgage. Certainly it cannot be held that the mortgagee has a substantive right, by virtue of the mortgage contract or otherwise, to buy in the property for a nominal or grossly inadequate sum.</p>

We have consistently held that a statute which affects remedial processes only does not impair contractual obligations: <em>West Arch B. &amp; L. A. v. Nichols, </em><a href="/pa/303/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="157" data-cite="303 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="1130030" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0434-01">303 Pa. 434</a>. The present Chief Justice in the case cited (where was involved the constitutionality of the Act of May 6, 1929, P. L. 1557, permitting the sale of real estate without inquisition) thus stated the principle, (p. 440) : “The Act does not violate the constitutional inhibition against impairing the obligations of contracts. It changes the mode of procedure or the remedy by eliminating a part of the requisites.” He said <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>(quoting from <em>King v.

It merely establishes, as a temporary expedient, during a period of great economic stress, a change in the method of procedure to collect a mortgage debt. The Act is designed to meet the necessities of a declared emergency to prevent the sacrifice of real property throughout the state at mortgage foreclosure sales. History supplies ample precedents in the laws of this state and the decisions of this Court for the enactment and validity of such remedial measures in times of urgent public need. For example, during the crisis and collapse of the credit system in 1842, the legislature passed an act which prohibited for a time sheriff’s sales of property for less than two-thirds of its appraised value. The Act (July 16, 1842, P. L. 407) provided that lands taken in execution should be valued and appraised by an inquest of twelve men summoned by the sheriff or coroner; that such valuation <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>or appraisement should be conclusive, and that when “the same cannot be sold at public vendue or outcry <em>for two-thirds or more of such valuation or appraisement, </em>that then, and in such case the sheriff or coroner shall not make sale of the premises, but shall make return of the same accordingly to the court from which the execution issued, and that thereupon all further proceedings for the sale of such lands, tenements, or hereditaments shall be stayed for one year from and after the return day.”</p>
    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.4",580,[277,881,1152,475]]]'>The constitutionality of this Act of 1842 came before this Court in the case of <em>Chadwick v.

Unfortunately this method as a means of determining fair value has completely broken down. Sheriff’s sales have been attended principally by the attorneys for the execution plaintiffs, and they have bid in the property for costs and taxes. In the case of <em>Market Street National Bank v. Huff, </em><a href="/pa/319/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="319 Pa. 286" data-case-ids="1162353" data-case-paths="/pa/319/0286-01">supra,</a> it appears from the opinion of the court below, as found in 21 D. &amp; C. 157, that the real estate in question was sold to the attorney on the writ for the sum of $50.00. The court found that the fair value of the premises was $28,727.00. The method of determining the value by a sheriff’s sale having temporarily proved inadequate due to the extraordinary economic situation, in its place the Act has substituted the deliberate judgment of the court as to the fair value of the property <em>to tide over the emergency.</em>
