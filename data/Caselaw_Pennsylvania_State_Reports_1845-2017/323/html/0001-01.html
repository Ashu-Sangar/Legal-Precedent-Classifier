L. 42, and by authority of that court it was organized in April, 1910, under the name of Sulzer &amp; Co., Inc. By the terms of the decree the entire stock of the company was issued to the executrix in consideration of the transfer from the estate of all the assets of the decedent invested in his business.</p>

Sulzer, who was the executrix and trustee, continued, with the assistance of the present trustees, the business until she died on March 27, 1930. An account was filed for her, as trustee, by her executors, showing her transactions as trustee of this estate up to the time of her death and by adjudication, dated April 22, 1932, the trust fund including all the capital stock of Sulzer &amp; Co., Inc., was awarded to Herman W. Sulzer and Herbert R. Sulzer, succeeding trustees under the will of decedent. They are the accountants in the present proceeding. Fred A. Sulzer, a son of decedent, and entitled to one-fifth of the income for his life, and who is also vice-president, sales manager and director of the company, filed a petition requiring the trustees to file an account. This petition was filed on behalf of Fred A. Sulzer, life tenant, and Raymond W. Sulzer and <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>Mildred L. Shrivers, remaindermen. The account was filed on April 3, 1934, and audited by Judge Allen M. Steaene. He decided that the trustees had exceeded their powers by loaning, from the principal of the trust estate to the company at various times during the depression, the cash necessary to continue the business. This cash amounted at the time of the audit to $9,422.47. He surcharged them with that amount and directed that the expenses of the accounting should be divided between principal and income, thus disallowing to this extent the credit claimed by the trustees for payments of all expenses out of principal. Exceptions were filed by the accountants to the surcharges. When the exceptions were called for argument, the accountants asked for a continuance to prepare paper books. A continuance was refused. The exceptions were dismissed “for want of prosecution” in an opinion by Judge Sinkler. Amended exceptions were later filed by leave of court and a re-argument had. The exceptions were afterwards dismissed by the court in banc. In the opinion filed by Judge Sinkler for the court in banc it was held that “the auditing judge construed item five as a whole and correctly held that the authority conferred upon the trustees to make advance for the operation of the business was limited to the income.” From the decree of distribution entered on February 7, 1936, as reconfirmed on March 27, 1936, this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[266,1817,1149,587]],["BL_67.1",67,[197,347,1150,370]]]'>The item to which Judge Sinkler refers reads as follows: “It shall be discretionary with my executrix or her successor as to whether my present business of the manufacture and sale of gas fixtures shall be continued, but should she, or her successor determine to continue the business, then the management and control of the same shall be under their entire supervision and management. Further, in such case such amount of income from my estate as she or her successor may deem advisable is to be reserved to be applied and appropriated.by her or her successor to the improvement of the said busi<a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>ness and the investment of additional capital by the purchase of new and additional machinery, materials, real estate, for repairs, etc., and to meet accruing liability therefor, and the net profits of the said business after making the above deductions shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of my will hereinbefore set forth as part of-the income of my estate.”</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[198,728,1152,694]]]'>Appellants contend that the above item imposes upon the trustees no limitation of the powers to use the principal when necessary to continue the business or to protect the estate from the loss of this asset but that an additional power is given to the trustees (which they otherwise would not have) to reserve and apply income “to the improvement of the said business and the investment of additional capital by the purchase of new and additional machinery, materials, real estate, for repairs, etc., and to meet accruing liability therefor,” and that in the absence of this clause the trustees would have no power to use income for improvements and additional capital.</p>
    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[199,1435,1151,967]]]'>Appellants refer to item five as being divided into two clauses, the second clause beginning with the word, “Further,” which begins the second sentence of the item. Appellee says: “Item five is not separated into two clauses, but is one continuous paragraph.” This difference of opinion goes to the matter of interpreting the form of item five, not its substance. Whether we treat the item as consisting of one “clause” or two, it is clear to us that the first complete sentence of item five gave the executrix or her successor the right to determine whether testator’s business should be continued or not, and in the event that she decided to continue it, then the executrix or her successor had the entire control and management of it. This part of item five is broad enough to confer on the executrix and her successors the power not only to. carry on testator’s business but also the power to subject the assets of the estate to debts contracted for that purpose.</p>

The general assets of an estate may be liable for debts incurred in the continuance of the partnership. . . . The executrix accepted the trust committed to her by the testator and exercised the power conferred upon her by the will. She took charge of and conducted the business in which her father was engaged at the time of his death. She paid the indebtedness of $60,000 incurred by the testator during his management of his affairs and for which all the assets of his estate were liable. In accomplishing this work, she contracted certain debts which the appellants, who are beneficiaries under the will, claim should not be paid out of the general assets of the estate. . . . The language . . . which confers upon the executrix authority to conduct his affairs is broad and comprehensive. She is given Tull power’ to carry on his business. Everything necessary for the purpose therefor she may command and use. This is necessarily implied. In no other way could she accomplish the object of the trust. ... It was necessary that the power of the executrix should be ample and unlimited. ... If the contention of the appellants be sustained, she was required to do this with the capital invested in the business. But her power is not thus qualified by the will, nor is she limited to any part of the assets of the estate in executing the trust imposed by the terms of the will.”</p>

It indicates the grant of more power than conferred by the sentence preceding it. Under that second sentence (or “clause” as appellants call it), if the executrix wishes money for the <em>improvement </em>of the business and for “additional capital,” she was, under the second half of item five, compelled to find it not in the corpus of the estate but in the estate’s income. In the absence of this grant of authority the trustees would have no power to use income for improvements and additional capital: <em>Weschler’s Est., </em>supra; <em>Parry’s Est., </em>supra; <em>Datesman’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/127/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="127 Pa. 348" data-case-ids="565743" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0348-01">127 Pa. 348</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.%201086" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="17 A. 1086">17 A. 1086</a>.
