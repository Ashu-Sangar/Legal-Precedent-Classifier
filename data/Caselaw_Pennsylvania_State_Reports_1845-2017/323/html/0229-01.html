      <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>The testator, Gardner, died on December 28, 1930, possessed of a large estate, inventoried at $887,581.77, consisting almost entirely of marketable common stocks. By the first article of his will he directed his executors, his widow and appellee herein, Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company, “to pay my just debts and funeral expenses as soon as conveniently can be done after my decease.” The bulk of his estate testator bequeathed to his executors as trustees, to invest the same and pay the income, one-half to his wife for life, and the balance to his three living children for life, and the children of his deceased daughter, with clauses of survivorship. Appellant was appointed guardian of the estates of the minor children of a son who died November 10, 1934, and for whom appellee is trustee during their minority. No other party in interest appealed or took exception to the account. The trustees were granted by the will “full power . . . to keep and retain any and all investments existing at the time of [testator’s] death so long as their judgment shall or may approve,” with the further right in their discretion to invest in nonlegal securities. The concluding paragraph of the will confers upon his executors as such all the powers given the trustees. Appellee has acted as sole, executor since the widow’s death on June 18, 1932.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[279,1691,1148,469]]]'>At his death testator owed large sums to two Pittsburgh banks, representing loans secured by collateral. One of these was upon a demand note for $134,000, secured by stock, pledged to the creditor bank, of the value of $163,900 at decedent’s death. The other consisted of his indebtedness in two stock pools, in which his liability was $59,650, also represented by notes held by a bank, upon which the collateral pledged was worth $91,346.67 at the time of his death.</p>

It now appears that if this had been done a saving of many thousands of dollars <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>would have been effected for the estate. Instead, however, a conference was held by appellee’s trust officers with members of the family, including testator’s widow and two sons, and it was concluded that for the then present, at least, the securities then in the estate should be held and not sold at prices currently believed to be less than their real value. Testator through his business connections had had a personal interest in some of the companies whose securities he held, and at his death was vice-president of United Engineering &amp; Foundry Company, in which he held a large block of stock. All the stocks were high grade industrials, and all were then paying dividends.</p>

Dating from February 5, 1931, less than a month after the grant of letters, the condition of the estate was reviewed at regular intervals by the trust committee of appellee’s board of directors, which consisted of men of high financial standing and sound judgment in the business world. The account was reviewed from week to week, and even oftener, by Holland and other trust officers and by appellee’s statistical experts. Reference was had to standard sources of information about the securities, and inquiry was made from time to time of officials of some of the corporations whose stocks were held. The adult beneficiaries were unanimous in agreeing that the stocks should be retained and the loan held open. The attorney for the estate had the same view. It is a matter of common knowledge that at that time and for a long time thereafter this entire country was in the throes of a financial and industrial catastrophe and this was reflected in the stock market. It was the judgment of those interested in this case that to hold stocks and not to sell them was the part of wisdom. The decision of the trust company to this effect was the result of attentiveness to the <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>interests of the beneficiaries and bespoke a conscientious effort to exercise its discretion in the interest of those it served.</p>
    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[283,494,1147,315]]]'>Two months after decedent’s death the bank which held the note for $134,000 demanded payment. To protect the collateral securing it, appellee paid the debt and purchased the note from the bank with the collateral attached, thereafter carried it as a loan in its banking department, and paid itself interest out of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[285,820,1149,1566]],["BL_297.1",297,[175,337,1149,262]]]'>The estate was thoroughly solvent and at no time were the rights of creditors imperiled. Nevertheless its condition was such that for the bank loans to be paid stock would have to be sold. The executor finally concluded that this ought to be done. Partial liquidation by sales of securities took place in December, 1931, realizing $65,-089.17, which was used to pay taxes and part of the bank loan on the stock pools. This figure was $61,183.50 less than the appraised value of the securities at the time when accountant received them. The balance of this loan and a part of the estate’s indebtedness to accountant on the note for $134,000 were paid by a transfer from income in May and June, 1932. From May to July, 1933, further sales were made, on some of which a small gain resulted, but this was more than offset by losses. The net loss to the estate on these sales, below inventory values, was $67,021.49. With the proceeds the bank loans were finally paid off. When the income deficit was made up by a transfer from principal, in February, 1935, a further loss was sustained of $1,638.25. There were also payments of interest made on the loans, which would have been unnecessary had they been promptly liquidated. This, however, was probably offset by receipt of income from the securities retained. The sales in February, 1935, resulted in a net loss of $12,563.17. Thus the total depreciation in the value of the estate occasioned by the delay in selling the securities amounted to approximately $142,000, if appraised values are to be accepted as those at which liquidation could have been <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>effected. It was shown that the average market values of the respective securities during the six months following the grant of letters, during which they could have been sold, were at least as high as the inventory figures, and in some cases higher.</p>
    <p id="b297-5" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[174,611,1151,914]]]'>The executor’s account was filed March 1,1935, largely at the insistance of appellant and the administrator of testator’s deceased son. It clearly shows a severe depreciation in the value of the estate, and that this was due to appellee’s earlier decision to refrain from selling. Appellant insists that the executor should be surcharged with the losses, pointing to the duty of the executor to file an account within six months after the grant of letters, as required by section 46 (a) of the Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, and to our numerous decisions stating that an executor’s or administrator’s primary duty is to liquidate his decedent’s assets and pay debts: <em>Johnston’s Est., </em><a href="/watts-serg/9/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 107" data-case-ids="12169045" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0107-01">9 W. &amp; S. 107</a>; <em>Merkel’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/131/0584-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="131 Pa. 584" data-case-ids="810314" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0584-01">131 Pa. 584</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20931" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="18 A. 931">18 A. 931</a>; <em>Constable’s </em>Est., <a href="/pa/299/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="299 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1122317" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0509-01">299 Pa. 509</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20743" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="149 A. 743">149 A. 743</a>; <em>Gilliford’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/281/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="281 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="1087055" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0582-01">281 Pa. 582</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20238" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="127 A. 238">127 A. 238</a>; <em>Stephen’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/320/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="320 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1163736" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0097-01">320 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=181%20A.%20559" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="181 A. 559">181 A. 559</a>; <em>Taylors Est., </em><a href="/pa/277/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="277 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="1079491" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0518-01">277 Pa. 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%20310" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="121 A. 310">121 A. 310</a>; <em>Riebel’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/321/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="321 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1165882" data-case-paths="/pa/321/0145-01">321 Pa. 145</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20A.%20118" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="184 A. 118">184 A. 118</a>.</p>

Another is the fact that all parties in interest who were <em>sui juris </em>agreed that delay in liquidation was desirable and joined in requesting it. Still a third is the broad power of retention, noted above, conferred on executors as well as trustees by decedent’s will. When to these are added the further consideration that the question arose at a time of economic chaos when no one could with any degree of confidence chart the future, it is clear that the situation was one for the exercise of a judgment which no one could reasonably expect to approach infallibility. We said in <em>Riebel’s Est., </em>supra, at page 147: “Even in the cases of executors and trustees, if common prudence and good faith are exercised, they will not be surcharged for retention of such securities.”</p>

Credit in the account is claimed for a total loss on this item by reason of the fact that in October, 1934, the right expired and had not previously been exercised. It apparently had value when received by accountant. The executor had the burden of showing that the loss was sustained without fault on its part, and there is certainly nothing in the evidence which it produced to justify any such conclusion.

Five per cent is claimed on income receipts of $105,-344.68, and the estate of testator’s widow was awarded one-half of one per cent on corpus, valued as stated above, as compensation for her services during the brief period of her incumbency as coexecutor.

There may be instances where the fiduciary’s management of the estate has been so exceptionally skillful, and the care and attention bestowed upon it reveal the exercise of such unusually good judgment, and results in augmenting the estate beyond reasonable expectation, that it would be proper to allow commissions on an increase in corpus: <em>Semple’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/189/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="189 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="903495" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0385-01">189 Pa. 385</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%2028" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="42 A. 28">42 A. 28</a>. Here, however, no such circumstances exist and appellant’s objection is well taken. The executor filed its account more than four years after receiving the assets, but during this time it did no more than it must have done had it promptly liquidated the loans, filed its account, and thereafter administered the same assets as testamentary trustee. During that period it did merely what it would have been under duty to do as trustee, so far as conserving the assets is concerned.</p>
