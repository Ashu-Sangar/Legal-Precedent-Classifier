L. 345, as amended, 12 PS section 1911 et seq., for a writ of mandamus to require the secretary of the commonwealth to receive an application<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for and to issue a certificate of authority to Keystone State Moving Picture Operators Association, a foreign corporation, pursuant to the nonprofit corporation law of May 5, 1933, P.

L. 289, on January 21, 1934. (c) The application for the certificate of authority contrary to the provisions of Section 4 of the Act sets forth a business for which a domestic nonprofit corporation cannot be formed under the laws of this Commonwealth, namely, a beneficial, benevolent or fraternal society and a business involving pecuniary profit to its members.” A stipulation of facts was made. The case was heard and the petition was dismissed for reasons stated in the opinion of the learned court below, reported in 40 Dauphin County Reporter 336, 22 D. &amp; C. 545. The statute required the secretary of the commonwealth, in the first instance, to determine whether the petition showed that an applicant was entitled to a certificate. He could have been compelled by mandamus to perform that duty. The complaint now is about the conclusion at which he arrived. “Where a person or body is clothed with judicial, deliberative or discretionary powers, and he or it has exercised such powers according to his or its discretion, mandamus will not lie to compel a revision or modification of the decision resulting from the exercise of such discretion, though, in fact, the decision may have been wrong”: <em>Runkle v.

We agree with that conclusion. After the petition wAs dismissed, the corporation itself asked leave to amend by becoming petitioner instead of Horowitz. The court disposed of this application, without considering it necessary to pass on the allowance of the amendment, by saying that, in view of the substantive objections to registration already announced, its conclusions would be the same if the amendment were allowed, and therefore discharged the rule to show cause: 41 Dauphin County Reporter 308.
