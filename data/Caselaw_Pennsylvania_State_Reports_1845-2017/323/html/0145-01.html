The suit is on a guardian’s bond in the sum of $60,000. The Citizens Trust Company of Allentown, hereafter referred to as the trust company, a corporation under the Corporation Act of 1874, P. L. 73, 15 PS section 1 et seq., became surety on the bond. In 1928 the trust company and the Merchants National Bank of Allentown, hereafter called the bank, united as the Merchants’ Citizens National Bank and Trust Company of Allentown, a name subsequently changed to the Merchants National Bank of Allentown, hereafter called the defendant. The guardian, Fred H. Lichtenwalner, was removed by the orphans’ court, and was surcharged in a large sum. To recover on the bond, the minor, hav<a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>ing become of age, brought this suit against defendant, alleging liability in virtue of the consolidation.

It was agreed that the bank’s capital stock be increased from $400,000 to $1,000,000; that 7,000 shares (par $100) be allotted to the “present shareholders” of the bank and 3,000 shares to the “present shareholders” of the trust company ; that the “assets contributed by each of said associations shall, upon the effective date of consolidation, be passed upon and be acceptable to a committee of six, three to be appointed by the Board of Directors of each association.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Shortly before the consolidation and apparently an element in the general transaction, a small part of the trust company’s assets was delivered to a trustee for distribution to its stockholders; with that distribution we are not now concerned. The remaining assets were transferred to the defendant and, united with the assets of the bank, became the property or stock of the defendant; this property was then owned by the shareholders, those formerly shareholders in the trust company and in the bank respectively; each then <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>had a shareholder’s interest in the combined stock or property instead of in that formerly owned by each constituent corporation; to evidence the shareholder’s respective fractional interests in the whole, certificates of capital stock were issued in the proportions agreed upon.

What was lacking to make the consolidation de jure, was authority from the Commonwealth, pursuant to whose law the trust company existed. The consolidation described did not, therefore, transfer to the bank the trust company’s franchise to be a corporation and work its dissolution. Though it divested itself of its property, by transfer to defendant, its franchise to be a corporation remained subject to the local law. With that, however,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the defendant is not concerned in this suit. Defendant thereafter continued its banking business as the consolidation of the trust company and the bank under the bank’s charter. Having federal consent to do what was done, defendant is here regarded as a lawfully existing national bank. But the obligation sought to be enforced was created by a Pennsylvania corporation, authorized to become surety; it was liable to be called on to perform in case of the guardian’s default; the obligation existed at the time of <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>the agreement of consolidation and was not discharged by what the parties did. The obligor could not have avoided performance by lawfully consolidating with another corporation because the consolidating statutes imposed liability as a condition of consolidation.

It is immaterial that, so far as it could, the federal government had consented to the acquisition by the bank of the trust company’s property. By the transaction, the bank’s assets were increased by those received from the trust company in exchange for the resulting stock interests in all the shareholders of the consolidated corporation.
