When asked on cross-examination if Mr. Craig had not told him there was a mechanic’s lien to be protected against and “that they intended to take over the assignment of these mortgages for the purpose of protecting the lien,” Mr. Corey testified that he “could not recall it.” He was then asked: “Would you say Mr. Craig did not call you about it.” He replied, “I couldn’t say that either.”</p>

The latter company then paid the Fidelity Trust Co., $6,230.90, and the Ohio Valley Trust Co., $13,280, and took assignments .of the two mortgages and the bonds accompanying them.

As is set forth in appellant’s “History of the Case,” “Irene G-. Ivory made written application to the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh for a first mortgage for $25,000 on said land and the building constructed for her by plaintiff partnership. The loan was accepted by the Union Trust Company.” As far as the latter com<a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>pany was concerned, the transaction was a straight loan of $25,000 to Mrs. Ivory upon a first mortgage on her property, which the Title Company insured to he a first mortgage. It is obvious that there was no suggestion made by the Union Trust Company that it or anyone in its behalf should take an assignment of the outstanding liens against this property. The clear implication was that when this $25,000 was loaned to the owner of the property, all encumbrances against it would be paid off so that the Trust Company’s loan would be secured by a first mortgage. As a matter of fact when the Title Company found that the property was subject to the liens of two mortgages for $13,000 and $6,000, respectively, and also subject to the mechanic’s lien claim, it used part of this sum of $25,000 to pay the debts secured by the two mortgages but instead of satisfying the liens of these mortgages, it took an assignment to itself of them, as some security for itself as the insurer of the title. The question then arises: What was the rights of the holder of the mechanic’s lien after the <em>debts </em>secured by the mortgages <em>were paid </em>but the mortgages themselves were not satisfied?</p>

The debt being everything, and the mortgage barely a security for the payment of it, it follows of necessity that whatever affects the debt will produce a corresponding effect upon the mortgage. If the debt be extinguished by any means, the mortgage will thereby become so likewise. A parol forgiving of the debt accompanied by a delivery of the securities to the debtor or mortgagor, will be sufficient to extinguish the mortgage: <em>Richards v. Syms, </em>2 Eq. Cas.

To state it briefly, it was an attempt to keep alive a mortgage which had been paid by the mortgagors, against a subsequent unpaid mortgage given by the same mortgagors upon the same premises. . . . It is doubtless true that the mortgagors did not intend to have this mortgage satisfied. They may and probably did intend to keep it alive for the benefit of themselves or their children. . . . Where creditors are not concerned, there is perhaps no legal reason why it may not be done. Though actual payment discharges a judgment or other encumbrance at law, it does not discharge it in equity if there are interests which require it to be kept alive for their protection. . . . This results from the right which every man has to do what he will with his own. The rule is different when he comes to deal with the property of other persons. The rights of the second mortgagees are concerned here. When the mortgagors procured the payment of the first mortgage with what was admittedly their own money, it extinguished that mortgage at law and in equity as between it and the second mortgage, and the latter took its place. We do not deny the right of the mortgagors to have procured some friend to have bought the mortgage and taken an assignment of it. Such a transaction would have been legal and would have kept it alive. But when they procured it to be done with their own money, the assignment of the mortgage is of no validity as against the younger mortgage. This principle is too familiar to need the citation of authority.” In <em>Fair and Square B. &amp; L. Assn. v. Presbyterian Board </em>

    <p id="b283-3" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[186,776,1153,1524]]]'>The business of the defendant company is that of insuring titles. In order to protect itself the defendant took the bond of the Standard Accident Insurance Company, indemnifying it against mechanics’ liens and it took assignments of two mortgages, prior to the new mortgage of $25,000, which two prior mortgages had <em>in fact been paid off </em>by the money loaned to Mrs. Ivory by the Trust Company. The Title Company did not buy these mortgages and take an assignment of them. Such a theory is pure fiction. When the debts secured by these two mortgages were in fact paid, these two mortgages became, as to the plaintiffs, mere “scraps of paper” which constituted no substantial legal barrier between those plaintiffs and the property against which their mechanic’s claim was a lien. The right of junior lien creditors to advance in legal status in respect to a property to which their lien is attached, when senior lien creditors have been paid, whether the encumbrances securing the latter’s debt have been formally marked satisfied or not, is firmly imbedded in our law. The hold which a lien to secure the payment of a debt has on a property must be released in favor of a junior lien holder when the debt secured by the former has been liquidated. It is the debt which gives the lien its life. The debts secured by the liens of the two mortgages having been paid, as the chancellor found' upon sufficient evidence, the debt due plaintiff and secured by their mechanic’s lien takes priority.</p>

This rule applies also to one who advances to the mortgagor the money necessary to pay the mortgage debt under an agreement that he shall have the benefit of the mortgage security for his own reimbursement.” The inapplicability of this quotation to the case at bar is too manifest to require comment. Defendant does not have the status of one who advanced to the mortgagors the money to pay the debts.

Harrisburg Bank, </em><a href="/watts/8/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="8 Watts 138" data-case-ids="1848502" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0138-01">8 Watts 138</a>; <em>Moats v. Thompson, </em><a href="/pa/283/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="283 Pa. 313" data-case-ids="1090522" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0313-01">283 Pa. 313</a>.”</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[188,1394,1153,871]]]'>The instant case presents no example of a merger by the purchase, by the owner of a fee, of an outstanding first mortgage. No one contends that the owner of the fee involved here bought and took an assignment of “the two mortgages.” She borrowed $25,000 on a pledge to give the lender a first mortgage for that sum. The debts secured by “the two mortgages” were paid with the money so loaned. When these debts were paid, “the two mortgages” which secured them ceased to exist as legal barriers between a junior encumbrance and that property. By no device recognized in the law can the company which for a consideration insured the title, resurrect those two mortgages to serve pro tanto as a security for the hazard it assumed. The Title Company in taking-these assignments acted on its own initiative and to serve its own purpose.</p>

These requests may be treated by him merely as suggestions; they shall be filed by him with his adjudication, but shall not be printed on appeal.

The rules of this court have all been carefully thought out; they are the fruits of the experience of a long line of Supreme Court Justices and they have met with such nearly universal respect from bench and bar that such a cavalier reference to them as the one above quoted is so uncommon as to invite the attention it has received.</p>
