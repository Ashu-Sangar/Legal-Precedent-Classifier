    <p id="b395-9" data-blocks='[["BL_395.12",395,[188,1050,1151,479]]]'>The purpose of the bill was to obtain an accounting of a partnership and a declaration of plaintiff’s rights in partnership assets on the theory of a constructive trust. The learned court below thought that jurisdiction was in the orphans’ court and for that reason dismissed the bill on preliminary objections under Equity Buies 48 and 49. In reviewing the record at this stage of the proceeding we must of course assume that the plaintiff will prove the facts alleged.</p>

Kreinson &amp; Brother. They became partners by written agreement executed in 1901 and so continued until Jacob’s death in 1916. While ordinarily it would then have been the duty of Louis, as surviving partner, to liquidate the partnership, the. parties had agreed otherwise by a provision in their articles that on the death of either, “the legal representatives of said partner shall continue said business with all the rights and interests of deceased partner to whose interests they shall succeed; and that the said parties will each of them on entering into this agreement, make and execute their respective wills, authorizing and empowering their executors to continue the said business as above provided, and that they will not thereafter revoke or change <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>such wills, so far as such power and authority is concerned. ...”</p>

He left a son, David, beneficiary of a $2,000 trust fund. He also left a daughter, born December 28, 1910; his will was made before that date and contained no provision for after-born children; by the intestate laws, therefore, this daughter was entitled to one-third of his estate. Apparently nothing was done about the minor’s interests in this property during her minority. Bella, the executrix, continued the business with Louis until January 17, 1920, when a new partnership agreement was made between Louis and Bella. It provided for the continuation of the partnership under the firm name formerly used for one year, and thereafter until either party should give three months’ notice of termination. It specified the capital contribution of Louis to be $79,711.80, and of Bella, $54,955.44, and that “said contribution is made by the parties hereto hereby selling or assigning to such copartnership all their respective right, title and interest in and to the assets of the business of J. Kreinson and Brother lately conducted by Louis J. Kreinson as the surviving partner, and the balance sheet hereto attached marked Exhibit A and made a part hereof, is a statement of the assets and liabilities of the new firm this day formed for the purpose of continuing under the firm name of J. Kreinson and Brother, the business heretofore conducted by the party of the first part as the surviving partner.” On the same date Louis and Bella also signed a paper in which they “certify that all matters growing out of the partnership between Jacob Kreinson and Louis J. Kreinson have been adjusted between Louis J. Kreinson as surviving partner and Bella Kreinson, as executrix of the last will and testament of Jacob Kreinson, deceased, on the basis shown in the balance sheet attached to a new partnership agreement of this date between Louis J. Kreinson as party of the first part, and Bella Kreinson <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>in lier own right and as executrix of the last will and testament of Jacob Kreinson, deceased, which shall be taken and considered as full accounting of all matters growing out of the partnership between Jacob Kreinson, now deceased, and Louis J. Kreinson, as surviving partner and that no further accounting of any kind or description need be made by the parties hereto.”</p>

The partnership continued until the death of Louis, January 3, 1934. He died testate appointing as his executrix, Bose Kreinson, who received letters testamentary. She is one of the two defendants. Twenty-four days later Bella died, testate; letters testamentary were issued to Commercial National Bank of Bradford. It is the other defendant. Bella had married a second time and by her will left one-third of her estate to her husband, E. L. Schwalb, one-third to her son, David, and one-third to the plaintiff.</p>

How much of that sum is payable to partnership creditors and others entitled does not appear.
