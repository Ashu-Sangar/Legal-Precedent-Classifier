L. 1021, as last amended by the Act of April 30, 1925, P. L. 388, subsequently repealed and superseded by The General County Assessment Law of May 22, 1933, P. L. 853. The Board of Revision of Taxes of the County of Philadelphia declined a total exemption of the property for the years 1928 and, thereafter, granted an <em>exemption as to three-fifths of the assessed valuation </em>of the property, and <em>assessed the remaining two-fifths for taxation.</em>

The city filed an answer, not denying the charitable nature of the association but averring that its operation of a lodging and rooming-house business, from which large revenues are derived, deprives it of the right to total exemption. This was the apparent basis for the order of the Board of Revision of Taxes, holding two-fifths of the property taxable.</p>

It received its charter in 1872 and for many years was located on Germantown Avenue. It undertook the construction of its new building in 1927, on Greene Street, and occupied the premises on August 1 of that year. The building has a <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>90-foot frontage and extends backward for 305 feet. It has a front and rear access. The premises, both land and buildings, represent an investment of nearly $700,000. About $460,000 was raised by public subscription; $240,-000 was borrowed and is secured by a mortgage. The first floor houses the offices of the association, social and locker rooms for its members, and a swimming pool. On a mezzanine below the first floor are handball courts, and below them a boiler room. On the second floor, in front, are class rooms for religious and educational meetings; behind these are kitchens for serving luncheons and dinners at functions held in the class rooms. Behind the kitchens are gymnasiums, a billiard room, and bowling alleys. Also on this floor is located a small lunch counter for the use of members engaged in athletic activities. The other three floors of the building, the third, fourth and fifth, are wholly given over to the dormitory rooms maintained by the association, 128 in number, for the benefit of members. At the rear of the building are tennis courts and a space for parking cars.</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[263,1426,1151,474]]]'>The purposes and activities of the countless Young Men’s Christian Associations throughout the country are well known. The object of the association, as expressed in its charter, is “the moral and intellectual improvement of the young men” in the vicinity in which it operates, and, as stated in its constitution and by-laws, adopted in 1885, the purpose for which it was formed is “the spiritual, mental, social and physical improvement of young men.”</p>

A. consists of about 2,100 boys and young men, of whom 1,000 are under 17 years of age. There is no religious qualification for membership. Control of the association is vested in a board of managers, who are elected by members with voting privileges, and serve without compensation. The officers of the board of managers select a general secretary, a full-time, paid employee, who has actual charge of all the activities of the association. <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>Under Mm are paid under-secretaries who supervise the various departments of its work. The association ministers to the physical, social, educational and religious needs of boys and young men, affords them physical training and offers them recreation in games and sports, conducts classes in public speaking, salesmanship, and sociology, and other high school courses, encourages social contacts between its members in the form of club meetings, lectures and small entertainments, and offers religious instruction in Bible classes and devotional meetings.</p>

They pointed out the effort which the association makes to reach and care for boys and young men who are strangers in the city, many of them in search of employment. The contention is that it is primarily for this purpose that the association maintains its dormitory and that in this way it is best able to care for young men who have no homes in Philadelphia. No person is admitted to the dormitories who is not a member of the association; but there is no limitation on admission to membership, and the applicant for lodging privileges is required to join the association. If personally unobjectionable, he is immediately accepted as a member. He is required to sign a membership application, to pay the annual membership dues, and to agree to abide by certain rules of the dormitory. He must give references, both personal and business, and supply other information helpful to the association in caring for his needs as an individual. An effort is made to place him in contact with a church of his religious preference. He is encouraged to join in the activities of the association of every sort. If possible, he is induced to open a savings account. If unemployed, an effort is made to get him a job through the association’s free employment bureau. The general secretary of the association testified that if a new member when enrolled <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>prefers not to live in the dormitory, the association will endeavor to procure lodging for him in some neighborhood boarding house, but dormitory residence is encouraged.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[254,559,1150,1062]]]'>The rates for rooms or beds in the dormitory are moderate. At the time of the hearing they varied from $1.50 to $6.50 a week. The average price was between $5 and $5.50 a week, but this was more than rates in boarding houses in the vicinity, which averaged $4.75 a week. Resident members, it is true, have the free use of gymnasium and swimming pool, for which a charge is made to nonresident members. For all other facilities an extra charge is made to all members. The scheduled rates, it was stated, are subject to exceptions, which are freely made in the case of those who, by reason of unemployment or diminished income, are unable to pay the full rate. At the time of the hearing, twelve of those living in the dormitory were unemployed and presumably paid nothing. The evidence showed that about half of the 94 lodgers were over thirty years of age, eighteen of them over forty and twelve of them had no employment; that five were making $15 per week, about half between $20 and $25 per week, and nine had salaries of $40 a week or more.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[253,1642,1150,629]]]'>Statements of profit and loss of the appellant’s operations for various years, from 1929 to 1933, were admitted in evidence. From these it is impossible to determine whether or not the operation of the dormitory resulted in a net profit. It is clear that room rentals received by the association supply a very substantial part of its operating income; in some years this amounted to nearly fifty per cent. However, in each year the association itself operated at a deficit of income under expenses, without any reserve for depreciation of plant and equipment. These annual deficits are made up by contributions.</p>

In all our decisions oh this subject there can be discerned as a prerequisite to the taxation exemption of an institution claiming to be benevolent or charitable that it, or the portion of its property, in respect to which exemption is claimed, must possess an eleemosynary characteristic not possessed by institutions or property devoted to private gain or profit. What is “given” must be more nearly gratuitous than for a price which impresses one as being proportionate to the services rendered.

This court said: “It may be safely said that whatever is gratuitously done or given in relief of the public burdens or for the advancement of the public good is a public charity. In every such case, as the public is the beneficiary, the charity is a public charity. . . .

It was held to be a purely public charity, and exempt mainly on the ground that it was free from any taint of corporate or private gain.

There is nothing showing that the expenditures in maintaining these lodgings exceeded the gross receipts from them. Even if such facts were shown, it would not follow that the dormitories of the plaintiff’s building were a public charity. In some of the earlier opinions of this court discussing tax exemption of alleged charitable institutions the latter are sometimes described in language which fails to furnish a practicable formula for determining in every instance whether an institution falls within the classification of one “of purely public charity.” A judicial desire to be liberal toward institutions which are doing praiseworthy public work has sometimes led the: courts to invest the word “charity,” as used in the above excerpt from the Constitution, with a meaning not warranted either lexicologically or by a consideration of the ideology of the constituional provision invoked. Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2d edition, defines a “charity” (in the institutional sense) as “an organization or institution engaged in the free assistance of the poor, incapacitated, distressed, etc.” Under this definition the characteristics of an organized charity are: First, whatever it does for others is done free of charge, or at least so <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>nearly free of charge as to make the charges nominal or negligible; second, that those to whom it renders help or services are those who are unable to provide themselves with what the institution provides for them, that is, they are legitimate subjects of charity. For example, if some liberally-disposed person would erect and maintain a dormitory to provide free lodging for well-to-do people, his lodging house could not properly be called a charitable institution. If a person built a lodging house to provide lodging for any personally unobjectionable individuals who might apply, whether they were self-supporting or impoverished, at a cost to those individuals which would yield no profit to the proprietor, such a lodging house would not be a charitable institution. Several years ago there was in New York City an hotel which offered lodging to all who were able to pay for it fifteen cents a day. It was not a charitable institution. If a person conducted a lodging house at a profit, but devoted all the profits to the amelioration of the condition of the admittedly poor, his lodging house would not be a charitable institution. The fact that all the net proceeds of a business are used for charitable purposes does not make that business a charitable institution. If any business is manifestly commercial in character, it is not relieved of that classification simply because its earnings are devoted to charity. A tax exemption based on such reasons would be administratively impracticable and lead both to injustice and fiscal confusion.</p>

A. is not offered free of charge nor only to those who would be classed as poor. The part of the Germantown Y. M. C. A. which contains lodging facilities is primarily commercial in character. It competes with lodging houses which are <em>avowedly </em>commercial in character. The fact that the environment is religious, and mentally and morally uplifting, does not alter the fact that the renting of its rooms is substantially like the renting of rooms in other lodging houses. Whether or not the plaintiff <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>association makes any profit on the rental of these rooms is wholly immaterial. Many lodging houses to-day may possibly be operating at a loss, but they do not become “institutions of purely public charity” the moment the final figures on their balance sheet have to be set out in red ink. Furthermore, a lodger who can pay from $1.50 to $6.50 a week (the average here being about $5.00 per week) for lodging cannot be classed as poor, or as being an object of charity, and such lodgers would doubtless resent being so characterized. About one-half of the lodgers in the Germantown Y. M. C. A., as above pointed out, have incomes of nearly $100.00 per month. Several have incomes of $40.00 per week. The fact that some of the lodgers had no employment at the time of the hearing in this case, and were being “carried along” by the institution does not give the lodging department of the association the character of a public charity. They were at least under the obligation to pay as soon as they might be able to. It is probable that in these times other lodging houses extend credit to unemployed guests.</p>

Every inhabitant and every parcel of property receives governmental protection. Such protection costs money. When any inhabitant fails to contribute his share of the costs of this protection, some other inhabitant must contribute more than his fair share of that cost. There are substantial reasons why an institution wholly devoted to public charity should be exempt from taxation, since one of the duties of the government is to provide food and shelter for the poor. Any institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of this burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a “quid pro quo” for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide. Just <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>as the exemption of the property of a municipality is founded on the fact that the municipality is a governmental agency of the State, vested by the State with a part of its sovereignty, and employed in aiding the State in matters of government and the execution of its laws, so likewise the exemption from taxation of institutions of public charity is founded on the fact that such a charity is assuming a share of the public burden. The measure of an institution’s gratuitous aid to those requiring it is the measure by which the government is relieved of its responsibilities. It is therefore just that an institution which assumes pro tanto the taxpayer’s burden should be relieved of its own tax burden.</p>

If it can successfully claim exemption on its dormitories, it could with equal plausibility claim exemption on a restaurant or cafeteria or barber shop which it might operate commercially in its building. Nor is the contention well supported that the maintenance and operation of these dormitories is <em>necessary </em>for the carrying on of the essential work of the association or for its “occupancy and enjoyment” of the remainder of its building. Counsel for appellant contend that the dormitories “were essential in the carrying out of the association’s charitable activities, that these dormitory rooms enabled the association to provide a comfortable, decent home, surrounded by proper influ<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>enees, to men coming to the city for employment or those having no homes in the city. Being away from home, these men are particularly in need of moral, spiritual and physical guidance and protection and by being able to provide a home for them in the building, the workers of the association are able to reach and minister to their needs and wants, and to establish contacts with them, in a way which would be impossible if these men were living in rooming houses, scattered throughout the vicinity.” Should this argument be accepted, it would lead to legally unacceptable conclusions. Not only could the plaintiff association build a lodging house large enough to take care for a reasonable but substantial rental of every single male in its vicinity and claim tax exemption on the ground that thereby it was the better able to minister to the moral, spiritual and physical wants of its lodgers, but every other institution of benevolence or charity in this Commonwealth could do likewise. Such institutions could maintain on a commercial basis restaurants, barber shops, golf links, baseball parks, billiard and pool rooms, and other establishments where young men like to congregate and.then claim exemption from all taxes on such establishments on the ground that through them the institution could maintain closer contacts with those young men whom it desired to uplift spiritually. Even the most praiseworthy institutions must expect to support the government by paying taxes when it engages in commercial activities no matter how it uses the net proceeds of such activities.</p>

As to that store, the Superior Court said: “No rent for the room is received by the college, the apartment occupied is a small one and we do not find sufficient reasons under the evidence for holding <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>that the room is leased or occupied by the college as claimed by the appellants.” An issue was also raised as to the taxation of four acres of land, leased for 99 years by the college from the Theological Seminary of the German Reformed Church. As to that the Superior Court said: “The charter of the Theological Seminary is not in evidence, but we may infer from all that appears in the case that the property was held for educational purposes and was transferred to the plaintiff to more effectually carry out the objects of its owner.” Another parcel as to which the question of taxation was raised was 75 acres of land used as a truck garden and farm. As to that the Superior Court, sustaining the court below, said: “That part used for agricultural purposes and for a truck garden is not exempt from taxation. Such use of the property is convenient and perhaps profitable but in no sense a necessary or usual adjunct of an educational institution.” The position we are taking in the case at bar is entirely consistent with the position of the Superior Court in the <em>Mercersburg College Case.</em>

Phila. et al., </em><a href="/pa/161/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="161 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="854202" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0307-01">161 Pa. 307</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20A.%2026" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="29 A. 26">29 A. 26</a>. In that case a bill was filed to restrain the collection of a tax. A master was appointed and he after a hearing found that the object of the organization was “to establish and maintain Sunday schools and to publish and circulate moral and religious publications.” It used all its capital and income for the promotion of the objects stated. The managers were compelled to place the publication operations of the society upon a self-supporting basis. It sold publications not issued by it in order to aid it in making its business self-supporting. The society employed over one hundred missionaries on salaries, whose duty it was to visit families, and get them interested in religion, and <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>persuade them to go to church. The master recommended a decree in favor of the plaintiff. The court below sustained exceptions to the master’s report and entered a decree dismissing the bill. This court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Dean, affirming the court below, said: “Conceding the fact that the society is an ‘institution of purely public charity,’ and as such exempt from taxation, it seems to us such an institution may, as an aid to the accomplishment of its primary object, carry on a business, or use part of its property for a business purpose, which renders such business or such part of its property taxable. . . . They established and maintained upon one of the most eligible and valuable sites of the city, a bookstore for profit. ... Nor does the fact that the profits gathered on the counter of the book-store are devoted to the primary object of the charity, which is purely public, in any degree affect the character of the trading or commercial enterprise. Every dollar the society expends is some charitable contributor’s gains or profits from some business not charitable; if such contributor devoted the whole of his profits from the sale of dry goods, groceries or books to promote this particular charity, that fact would not make the source of such profit a purely public charity. ... It is clear, from the evidence here, that the city did not tax any portion of the funds paid by pious and benevolent contributors; it sought only to collect a tax from that part of the business which was purely commercial. And there is no injustice in this, nor any harshness. . . . Why should not this business pay its fair proportion of the taxes necessary to the paving of streets, construction of sewers, furnishing of light and water, maintaining a fire department, supporting a police force, and other municipal objects? To exempt this book-store from taxation to the amount of $2,405 each year, is in effect a shifting of that much of an individual’s burden to the shoulders of the public. If the society does not pay it, the general public must; another individual dealer in the same business <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>must pay his full share of taxation, and then his share of what his rival ought to pay.” Mr. Justice Dean then points out that other institutions of a like character, have for years followed a system of taxation whereby the mercantile part of the business was taxed, and the “purely public charity” part exempted. He cited The Presbyterian Board of Publication being assessed at $260,000, whereof $60,000 was exempted, and the Young Men’s Christian Association assessed at $400,000, of which $210,000 was exempt. Mr. Justice Dean, after citing the section of the Constitution giving the General Assembly power to exempt from taxation ... institutions of purely public charity, said: “That by no judicial rule of construction can these words be made to mean that a commercial enterprise is exempt because the whole profit of it goes into the treasury of, and it is carried on by, a purely public charity. In so far as the institution is charitable, and its revenues are derived from the contributions of the charitable, it is protected by the constitution. But if such institution sees fit to engage in trade for the purpose of increasing its revenue, or making any part of its business ‘self-supporting’ the trade part of its business can be taxed, and ought to be.” The court said further in that case: “As to whether the proportions exempt and taxable have been correctly determined, that is a question which we, in this proceeding, have nothing to do. Any complaint on that score can only be heard on appeal from the decision of ‘the Board of Revision of Taxes.’ ”</p>

The lower <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>court found that the association was an institution of public charity, founded and endowed and maintained by private charity. It was operated at a loss, and the deficit each year was made up by the contributions of its friends. The Board of Revision of Taxes assessed the property for taxation for the year 1918 at forty thousand dollars, but found that sixteen thousand dollars in value was exempt. The association filed a bill in equity asking that it be declared to be entirely exempt from taxation. In that case the Superior Court, in an opinion by Judge Trexler, stated: “It is clear that to exempt the whole property it must be. in its entirety actually used and occupied for public and private charity. . . . Property which is not used directly for the purposes and in the operation of the charity, but for profit, is not exempt, and the devotion of the profit to the support of the charity will not alter the result of this class of cases.”</p>
