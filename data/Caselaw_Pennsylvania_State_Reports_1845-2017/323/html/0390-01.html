On July 23, 1935, appellee appeared in the Court of Quarter Sessions for Centre County, waived the finding of a true bill by the grand jury, entered a plea of not guilty, and elected to be tried before the judge without a jury, under the provisions of the Act of June 11, 1935, P.

One of the primary purposes of a system of general regulation of the subject-matter, as here by The Vehicle Code, is to insure the competency of the operators of motor vehicles. Such a general law is manifestly directed to the promotion of public safety and is well within the police power. Even if the license were a right of property, which it is not, it would be held in subordination to such reasonable regulations by the state as are clearly necessary to preserve the safety, health and morals of the people.

Suspension of the licensee’s operating privilege is authorized only when the Secretary finds upon sufficient evidence that the offenses enumerated have been committed. Section 616 allows an appeal to the court of common pleas wherein the licensee resides. The licensee is given an opportunity to be heard and to produce witnesses in his own defense. The whole machinery of the law is available in his behalf. Here, the Secretary of Eevenue fulfilled the statutory mandates by holding the hearing and by finding that the appellee had violated the motor vehicle laws of this Commonwealth.

    <p id="b461-4" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[200,948,1153,1291]]]'>The remaining questions are easily disposed of. In the proceedings in the court below, the question arose whether the hearing was de novo, or to review the record as it existed when the petition under section 616 of the act was filed in the common pleas court. The section in question affords the answer. It says . . . “thereupon to take testimony and examine into the facts of the case, and to determine whether the petitioner is subject to suspension of operator’s license or learner’s permit under the provisions of this act.” The language of the section clearly indicates that it is the duty of the court to hear de novo the witnesses of the Commonwealth and the witnesses of the licensee, and, from the testimony taken, to determine anew whether the operator’s license should be suspended. The court below was in error when it required the testimony taken before the Secretary of Revenue or his representative to be made a part of the record. If the proceedings before it were in the nature of a certiorari, or a review of the action of the Secretary of Revenue to determine whether he had abused his discretion, then such testimony properly would be a part of the record of this case. But the act otherwise provides, and it may be used only collaterally to impeach the credibility of a witness.</p>

It has been the established rule that a criminal prosecution does not bar a subsequent civil or administrative proceeding based upon the same set of facts, nor does a judgment rendered therein have any probative value in subsequent proceedings beyond the mere fact of its rendition: <em>Wilson v. Wilson, </em><a href="/pa-super/100/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="100 Pa. Super. 451" data-case-ids="691377" data-case-paths="/pa-super/100/0451-01">100 Pa. Superior Ct. 451</a>. This results from the nature of criminal proceedings and the type of proof required therein. In criminal proceedings the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil proceeding to revoke a license it is sufficient if the offense be established by a preponderance of the evidence; this distinction is pointed out by Mr. Justice Sadler in <em>Barach’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/279/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="279 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1083648" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0089-01">279 Pa. 89</a>; see also <em>Summers v.
