Girard left France permanently in 1773 and ultimately settled in Philadelphia in 1777 after several years as a trading sea captain; he became a citizen of Pennsylvania in 1778. During the American Revolution and the years after, he maintained and augmented his growing commercial fortune, becoming a ship owner and builder in 1789. In the following decades, Girard traded within what is now the United States, to ports including Charleston, South Carolina, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and all over the globe: the West Indies, Europe, the Mediterranean, the Baltic and Russia, South America, the East Indies, India, and China. His trading wares included grain, wine, fruit, hemp, iron, coffee, tea, and silk. Anticipating the War of 1812 with England and its likely effect on international maritime commerce, Girard shrewdly reduced his trading activity, liquidated his overseas holdings, collected outstanding foreign debts owed to him, and invested in the First Bank of the United States. Girard became the foremost banker in Philadelphia and the nation when he acquired the bank itself in 1812 after the federal government declined to renew the bank’s charter, which expired in 1811, twenty years after its <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>1791 inception at the behest of Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.</p>

Some of the Pennsylvania lands Girard acquired, in Columbia County and Schuylkill County (which includes the borough of Girardville, established in 1832), contained abundant coal; after Girard’s death, coal royalties produced hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, sustaining the Trust in the process.</p>

In 1830, the year before he died, he met with his counsel and created what became his last Will and testament, subject to two later codicils; the Will was reprinted and published in 1874. <em>See </em>Will and Codicil of the Late Stephen Girard, Esq. (James B.

The Girard Will left specific sums to relatives, including Girard’s brother and each of his brother’s six children and four other nieces, as well as bequests to friends, life incomes to his maid and to his farm housekeeper and her family, and bequests to persons indentured to him. The vast majority of his considerable fortune, however, was left to support charitable and public causes in and about Philadelphia. Thus, Girard left sums to Pennsylvania Hospital, asylums for orphans and the deaf and mute, a society for relief of impoverished shipmasters and their families, and amounts to be invested so as to provide housing fuel for the poor of Philadelphia. Girard also left specific bequests to establish a public school in Philadelphia, and a neighborhood school just outside the then-boundaries of the City, in Passyunk Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Girard Will, Clauses I-XVTII, at 3-14.</p>

The Will stated plainly: “I have sincerely at heart the welfare of the City of Philadelphia.” Girard Will, Clause XX, at 18. The directives Girard included in his Will corroborated this point. Thus, Girard left $500,000 to the “Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens” of Philadelphia to remove and to prohibit all buildings made of wood or other combustible materials in the city and to create Delaware Avenue in place of the former Water Street, where Girard had kept his riverfront offices, so as to improve the eastern half of the City. His specifications for these public improvements were set forth in minute detail. Girard explained that by all of these improvements, “it is my intention to place and maintain the section of the City, above referred to, in a condition which will correspond better with the general cleanliness and appearance of the whole City, and be more consistent with the safety, health, and comfort of the Citizens.” Girard Will, Clause XXII, ¶¶ 1-3, at 35-40.</p>

Notably, each of these civic bequests was conditioned upon the passage of the laws necessary to enable completion of the public projects Girard envisioned. Girard Will, Clause XXIII, at 40-41. The remainder of Girard’s fortune was left to the City in trust with instructions to establish, build, and maintain a residential school for “poor male white orphans” — Girard College — on a large lot Girard owned, with the cost of construction not to exceed $2 million. Girard Will, Clause XXI, at 20. However, the residuary portion of the estate was also to be used for other civic purposes, <em>i.e., </em>to provide a competent police force for the City and to improve the property and general appearance of the City. Girard noted that his intention in this regard <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>was “in effect to diminish the burden of taxation, now most oppressive especially on those, who are the least able to bear it.” Girard Will, Clause XXIV, at 41-42.</p>
    <p id="b634-4" data-blocks='[["BL_634.4",634,[285,480,1150,1065]]]'>Girard’s Will made clear that the civic endeavors to be funded from the residuary estate were subject to the “primary object” that the College be adequately provided for. He expressed this context for the residuary bequests as follows: “To all which objects, the prosperity of the City, and the health and comfort of its inhabitants, I devote the said fund as aforesaid, and direct the income thereof to be applied yearly and every year for ever — after providing for the College as hereinbefore directed, as my primary object.” Girard also provided for public-works contingencies if his designated trustee, the City, were to “knowingly and willfully violate” any conditions of the Will: in that instance, the remainder of the residue would be distributed to the Commonwealth for purposes of internal navigation — excepting that income from his Pennsylvania real estate was to be forever applied to maintenance of the College. If the Commonwealth, in turn, failed to abide by the contingent restrictions placed upon it, the Will further provided, that portion of the remainder of the Estate was left to the United States for purposes of internal navigation. Girard Will, Clause 24, ¶ 3, at 42-43.</p>

Girard noted, for example, that preference was to be given first to Philadelphia-born orphans, then to those born elsewhere in Pennsylvania, then to those born in New York City, and finally to those born in New Orleans.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The Will also addressed the design of the buildings, <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>food and clothing for the students, exercise and recreation, the subjects to be taught, <em>etc. </em>Girard Will, Clauses XX; XXI, including ¶¶ 6 &amp; 7, at 18-31.</p>

Thus, respecting the bequests to improve the City’s physical infrastructure, the Will stated that funds would be disbursed: “as soon as such laws shall have been enacted by the constituted authorities of the said Commonwealth as shall be necessary, and amply sufficient to carry into effect, or to enable the constituted authorities of the City of Philadelphia to carry into effect, the several improvements above specified[.]” Girard directed that the legislation was to be passed expediently, within one year, or the funds would be redirected. Girard Will, Clause XXIII, at 40-41. Both the City and the Commonwealth responded quickly; indeed, within three months of Girard’s death, the General Assembly adopted special legislation in the form of the Act of March 24, 1832, P.L. 176, which authorized and directed the City of Philadelphia to carry the Will into effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Less than two weeks later, by the Act of April 4, 1832, P.L. 275, the General Assembly authorized the select and common councils of the City to provide for the election or appointment of such officers as deemed essential to duly execute “the duties and trusts enjoined and created by” Girard’s Will.

The court then cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1957 finding in <em>Commonwealth v. [Board of City Trusts </em>] that “the Board which operates Girard College is an agency of the Commonwealth.” The court added that other courts have recognized the Board as a Commonwealth agency in various contexts. For example, the Commonwealth Court held in <em>Moore v. [Board of City Trusts </em>], <a href="/a2d/809/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="809 A.2d 420" data-case-ids="11424825" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/0420-01">809 A.2d 420</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), that the Board may claim sovereign immunity from negligence causes of action. Even more emphatic, according to the trial court, was the Third Circuit’s 1968 desegregation decision in <em>Brown, </em>which is discussed above. The trial court stressed that the <em>Brown </em>court found multiple ties and links between the Board and various Commonwealth agencies and entities, emphasized Commonwealth control through the statutory supervision and reporting requirements to which the Board of City Trusts is subject, and specified tax exemptions as one of the probable goals of the “special relationship” between the Board and the Commonwealth that Girard’s Will contemplated. The trial court also found it compelling that other counties had agreed or accepted that Board-administered property is immune or exempt from local real estate taxation. The trial court thus concluded that the Board is a Commonwealth agency and, as a matter of law, is immune (as well as exempt) from local real estate taxation. Trial Ct. Op., 7/28/10, at 7-10.</p>

The panel declined to hold that either the Girard Trust or the Board is a Commonwealth agency merely because the manner of selection of Board of City Trusts members was provided for by the General Assembly. The panel decided that it is the nature of a trust, and not the manner in which its trustees are installed, that determines proper classification. The panel also concluded that although the legislative scheme creating the Board <a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>ensured annual reporting to the General Assembly, the Board members otherwise have no duty to or ongoing functional relationship with the Commonwealth, and other than creating the Board, the General Assembly has no oversight or say in how the Board operates and conducts its affairs, carries out the intentions of Girard’s Will, and supports and sustains the Trust and College. <a href="/a3d/18/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="18 A.3d 421" data-case-ids="7280899" data-case-paths="/a3d/18/0421-01">18 A.3d at 426-27</a>.</p>

On immunity, the Board of City Trusts notes that, even before it came into existence, the General Assembly had recognized and intended that management of the Girard assets was to be a public and governmental endeavor powered by state legislation, beginning with General Assembly legislation enacted within months after Girard’s death that enabled the directives of his Will to take effect under City control. When the City’s initial approach to administering the Trust faltered and the College suffered, as we have detailed in Part I above, the General Assembly stepped in again and by the Act of June 30, 1869, created the Board of City Trusts and vested it with broad rights and powers to perform its work on behalf of the City, subject to annual reporting to both the General Assembly and the Philadelphia City Council.

The Board posits that it was acting within its capacity as a special government agency undertaking a statutorily authorized activity, as well as carrying out the terms of Girard’s Will, when it merely leased a City-owned property and managed the ensuing rental income for the benefit and continued endowment and maintenance of Girard College. The Board adds that transcripts of the General Assembly debate preceding adoption of the 1869 Act that created the Board reveal that the goal was to remove management of the Girard assets from City appointees, who had succumbed to political corruption and mismanagement, and place authority instead, including appointment power, in the hands of Commonwealth judicial officials. It was believed, the Board relates, that Commonwealth personnel would be less likely to allow the Girard entities to fall victim to local City influence peddling, to the detriment of the Trust assets. The Board remarks that its composition remains subject to Commonwealth control because the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County maintain statutory authority over appointment, approval, and removal of Board members, as set forth in 53 P.S. §§ 16365-16370.

Most notably, the Board quotes the High Court’s 1957 <em>per curiam </em>reversal of this Court’s initial desegregation decision. After noting that Girard’s Will named the City as trustee, the Board stresses that the pertinent provisions of the Will were, in fact, carried out by the City and the Commonwealth, that the Board had administered the Trust and College since 1869 by virtue of an Act of the General Assembly, and that the High Court held that: “the Board which operates Girard College is an agency of the State of Pennsylvania.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The Board notes that an estimated $110 million in tax-exempt bonds were issued in reliance upon the status of the Board as a governmental entity pursuant to the federal Internal Revenue Code. This agency status has also been accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). According to the Board, upholding the decision below could lead to mandatory redemption obligations, termination fees, and conversion to private activity bonds subject to taxation, all of which would undermine the financial capacity and capability of the Girard entities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a> The Board adds that its employees, as well as employees of Girard College and other associated entities have long been deemed to be public employees subject to Pennsylvania’s Public Employee Relations Act. If the Board is now held not to be a governmental agency, the labor relations and practices governing the Girard entities will be rendered unstable during a very difficult economic situation. And, if Board-managed property is deemed subject to local real estate taxation in Cumberland County, the Board expects that all similar property, wherever located in the Commonwealth, will almost surely be taxed as well, posing a danger to the Trust funds currently devoted solely to operating and sustaining the College in fulfillment of Stephen Girard’s testamentary wishes and instructions.

The Board heralds Girard’s bequest as providing that future needy individuals — eligible students not designated, named, or identified in the Will itself — would receive a quality education fully funded by scholarship, which continues to benefit the community and the public. The Board cites as support the Restatement (Third) of Trusts (2008), which distinguishes public and charitable trust purposes, in part, as those created for the benefit of the public at large or “indefinite members thereof,” whereas private trusts benefit “identified or identifiable beneficiaries.” According to the Board, the Girard Trust is clearly a public charity and continued immunity from local real estate taxation is therefore warranted.

PFM states that the Board currently maintains approximately $110 million in debt in the form of tax free bonds, which were issued at times when the IRS determined that the Board is exempt from taxation as a governmental entity and political subdivision of the Commonwealth. According to PFM, the IRS has consistently upheld the Board’s governmental status, dating at least back to 1942 and as recently as 2008. To maintain and grow the value of the Girard Trust assets, these bonds are sold, transferred, and acquired in the public market in reliance on their remaining tax free. PFM states that if the Commonwealth Court’s determination stands, the IRS could well revoke the entity’s tax exempt status, with the result that income received by those holding the bonds could become subject to taxation and those debt holders, in turn, could call for redemption of the bonds and seek penalties or other retributive action. PFM further notes that the uncertainty created by the current litigation has already stifled the ability of the Board to take advantage of improving market conditions in order to refinance its debt and secure longer-termed letters of credit.

The County echoes the Commonwealth Court’s analysis that the City, as trustee of the Girard Trust, may have legal title to the assets held in trust, but this is not the same as the City actually owning the assets; equitable title to the assets, as well as any beneficial interest therein, remains with its beneficiaries: the Girard Trust and Girard College. And, the County continues, when real estate taxation is at issue, immunity or exemption determinations depend upon the real owner. The County thus cites cases that focus on ownership and control versus title or registration in the context of local taxation, including <em>Appeal of Board of School Directors of Owen J. Roberts School District, </em><a href="/pa/500/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="500 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1781086" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0465-01">500 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="500 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1781086" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0465-01">457 A.2d 1264</a> <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>(1983) (mere registration of title in name of Commonwealth not always sufficient to establish ownership and exemption from local real estate taxation). Here, the County asserts, neither the Board of City Trusts nor the City, both of which are bound by the terms of Stephen Girard’s Will, has the level of ownership and control over the Girard Trust assets to satisfy the rule the County derives from the <em>Roberts School District </em>case: any power the Board and the City may exercise over the Property is circumscribed by the instructions and conditions in Girard’s Will limiting use and control of the Trust assets to the funding and operation of Girard College.

The County stresses a difference between a true Commonwealth agency and a local agency or other entity that is merely or partially “governmental in nature” and not immune. According to the County, although the Board was created by the General Assembly, and its members are appointed by the judiciary, the Board has nothing to do with either the executive or administrative government of Pennsylvania and is therefore not a Commonwealth agency. The County adds that the mere fact that the General Assembly provided the statutory method by which appointments to the Board are made does not make the Board itself a Commonwealth agency.

According to the County, the Board enjoys a greater degree of autonomy from legislative oversight than this Court described as characteristic in the <em>Penn State </em>case: the Commonwealth does not fund the Board and has no actual or direct representation on it, the Board members and directors are not public officers, and the property at issue is not functionally controlled by the Commonwealth.

The Property is used as an investment to generate rental income to support the private Girard charity, the County asserts, and is not being used for the sort of governmental purpose that immunizes it from local real estate taxation. The County distinguishes the “state agency” conclusions of the Third Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court in the desegregation cases, arguing that the constitutional question in that litigation is inapposite. The County also critiques the reliance of the Board on the tort/sovereign immunity case of <em>Moore. </em>The County asserts that even if a finding of immunity for one purpose (protection from tort liability) is deemed applicable to another purpose (relief from local property taxation), <em>Moore </em>was overruled by <em>Burcik v.

To the County, the fact that the tenant is the OAG does not turn the private investment and income-generation ownership use of the Property by the Board into a public purpose. Only if the tenant function is related to the owner’s function and rent is purely incidental, the County asserts, will the “public property for public purposes” exemption apply. Such “singularity of purpose with unity of consort” is not present here, the County avers, where the OAG is an outside party, of no relation to the Board, Girard Trust, or Girard College, and the rent is over $40,000 per month, which clearly is not incidental.

Instead, the County posits that the Board was established to operate more like the private boards of trustees that manage other charitable entities. Other than appointing directors of the Board, the County adds, the Commonwealth has never been involved; nor is the City so involved. The County also avers that the Property is not exempt from taxation as the property of a “purely public charity,” since it is not used solely by or in furtherance of the Girard Trust’s charitable purposes. Finally, the County dismisses the Board’s concerns with substantial adverse effects, arguing that it merely seeks to place the Girard Trust on equal footing with other private charitable entities. The County concludes by discounting the concerns of the Board and its <em>amicus </em>PFM that subjecting the Property to local real estate taxation will harm the Trust’s ability to support and fund the College; to the County, favoring the Trust and the College affects the ability of counties and localities to provide for publicly educated students.

Relying heavily on <em>Penn State I, </em>the <em>Penn State II </em>Court found that although the university remained “state-related,” and was once easily a Commonwealth agency, it had become so autonomous in so many regards that it could no longer be seen as part of or controlled by the Commonwealth. The Court stressed that for certain quasi-public entities, status as an agency or instrumentality could vary, and that Commonwealth funding alone (the university then received hundreds of millions of dollars in state funds each year) did not confer agency status. The Court noted that, like regular state agencies, the university’s employees were state employees who participate in the state pension plan, but unlike state agencies, the university was not subject to full compliance with the Right to Know Act. The Court reasoned that the “pivotal factor” should be “whether the institution’s real property is so thoroughly under the control of the Commonwealth that, effectively, the institution’s property functions as Commonwealth property.” The Court <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>then noted that the university’s real property was controlled by a board of thirty-two trustees, of which only ten represented “government” seats either held or appointed by the Commonwealth’s executive branch.

Nevertheless, to the extent that SEPTA was acting as a “commercial landlord” at its headquarters building in Philadelphia, the Court held that leasing real estate to commercial tenants who were not part of or associated with SEPTA, “solely to raise revenue,” was outside the scope of SEPTA’S immunity because the activity was not sufficiently connected to SEPTA’S stated purpose of providing a metropolitan public transportation system.

We did so in detail because the nature and history of the Trust and College provides essential background in properly identifying the Girard entities for purposes of local tax immunity and exemption. This Court’s most recent decisions concerning the Girard entities are now over half a century old, and involved Fourteenth Amendment-based desegregation challenges. The majority decisions in those cases went to great lengths — over strong dissents from Justice Musmanno — to describe the entities as purely private. The first decision was summarily reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which held, unequivocally, that the Board of City Trusts was an agency of the Commonwealth. In the second decision, the Court majority affirmed a remarkable substitution by the Orphans’ Court of “private” trustees in place of the ready, willing and able public trustees designated by Girard himself, and embodied, by virtue of a 1869 Act of the General Assembly, in the Board of City Trusts. The effect of that second decision, though not reviewed directly by the U.S. Supreme Court, was disapproved by the Third Circuit ten years later in <em>Brown, supra, </em>which held in essence that the Orphans’ Court’s substitution of private trustees, and this Court’s affirmance of that action as against a renewed equal protection challenge, was an effort to avoid compliance with the U.S. Supreme Court’s initial summary reversal. The practical effect of the Third Circuit’s decision, and responsive legislation by the General Assembly effectively readopting the Act of 1869, has been to restore the <em>status quo ante </em>with <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>respect to the Board; it is a Commonwealth agency, at least for Fourteenth Amendment purposes.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[169,429,1149,414]]]'>In light of the history we have outlined, it is safe to say that the Court’s majority decisions in the 1950s segregation challenges did not represent the Court’s finest hour. Moreover, given the U.S. Supreme Court’s summary reversal, and the eventual legislative restoration of the Board of City Trusts, we believe an assessment of the proper status of the Girard entities is not constrained by the analyses in the disapproved majority decisions in the desegregation cases.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.5",673,[169,868,1152,997]]]'>Bringing our own independent judgment to bear, we think that the nature of the Girard entities was more accurately grasped and described in Justice Musmanno’s dissenting opinions. By any measure, Stephen Girard’s Will represented a remarkable act of public largesse, providing for numerous civic projects to improve the City and the Commonwealth, including but by no means limited to establishing the College. Girard’s bequests helped to: develop the eastern half of the City, improve navigation, finance the police, remove buildings that were fire hazards, and establish support for the poor and infirm; all in an effort to defray some of the important costs of government. Girard’s bequests addressed core municipal functions. Furthermore, Girard made clear that he named the City as trustee precisely because the government was answerable to the citizenry: “from the nature of my bequests and the benefit to result from them, I trust that my fellow citizens of Philadelphia will observe and evince special care and anxiety in selecting members of their City Councils and other agents.” Girard Will, Clause XXI, ¶ 9.</p>

Acquiescing in those conditions did not just entail accepting the duties of trusteeship, but the conditions also required the passage of special state legislation and city ordinances to satisfy specific conditions of the Will, including legislation — unusual, to say <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>the least — that made the City the guardian of the orphans attending Girard College (so as to preclude relatives from interference), and authorized the City to bind the students out as apprentices until they reached majority. Moreover, as the <em>Fox </em>Court stressed in reviewing the constitutionality of the Act creating the Board of City Trusts — a point of precedent appreciated by Justice Musmanno, but overlooked by the Court majority in both desegregation decisions — municipal entities are not empowered to accept duties of trusteeship to administer private trusts. Rather, as <em>Fox </em>noted, municipal corporations may undertake such duties of administration, and the liabilities they incur, “only as it seems for public purposes, germane to its objects.” The <em>Fox </em>Court stressed that Girard’s Trust, like other trusts then also managed by the City and subject to the Board of City Trusts, were appropriate for municipal management precisely because they were “germane” to the objects of municipal government: “The widening and improvement of streets and avenues, planting them with ornamental and shade trees, the education of orphans, the building of school-houses, the assistance and encouragement of young mechanics, rewarding ingenuity in the useful arts, the establishment and support of hospitals, the distribution of soup, bread or fuel to the necessitous, are objects within the general scope and purposes of the municipality.” <a href="/citations/?q=1870%20WL%208678" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="1870 WL 8678">1870 WL 8678</a>, at *12.</p>

Given the intense legislative involvement of the General Assembly in providing for the operation of the Trust, culminating in its creation of the Board, we have little doubt that this is so; but that fact does not necessarily answer the question of whether the Board <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>was intended to be an agency of the Commonwealth for purposes of municipal tax immunity.</p>
    <p id="b675-4" data-blocks='[["BL_675.4",675,[175,427,1151,1270]]]'>The simple answer to that distinct question is that the legislation creating the Board of City Trusts was not addressing tax immunity, nor has any subsequent legislation specifically addressed the matter. Part of the difficulty in this appeal arises from the fact that it is argued to us, in large part, in the usual manner of common law advocacy: the parties invoke other cases and entities, and then quite ably reason by analogy and distinction. But, the terms of the Girard Will and Trust, the acceptance of those terms by the Commonwealth and the City, the legislation passed to satisfy the terms and conditions of Girard’s bequests, and the creation of the Board itself, all predate by many decades Pennsylvania decisional law respecting tax immunity for Commonwealth agencies. Indeed, the parties have cited no reported appellate cases, and our research has revealed none, involving sovereign immunity from local real estate taxation until the first half of the twentieth century. <em>See Commonwealth v. Dauphin County, </em><a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="6 A.2d 870">6 A.2d at 872</a> (Pa.1939) (“The legislators did not intend to upset the orderly processes of government by allowing the sovereign power to be burdened by being subjected to municipal taxes.”). There was no particular reason for the General Assembly in 1869 to directly address “agency” status for purposes of municipal taxation; such taxation was simply not an issue.</p>

It is enough, we believe, to recognize the quintessentially public nature of the bequests and the intimate, immediate, and ongoing Commonwealth governmental relationship with the Girard Entities, including the Board of City Trusts. Part <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>of this history also includes the facts, which are not disputed or rebutted by the County, that the Girard entities historically have not been subject to local real estate taxation, and that the Board has been deemed a Commonwealth agency for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. We recognize, of course, that the fact that a prior challenge has not been made to the <em>status quo </em>does not mean that a challenge, once made, must fail. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manuf.

    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[278,961,1149,1110]]]'>What is plainly apparent, however, is that any disruption in the status of the Girard entities, for purposes of local real estate taxation, is a matter posing questions of policy more properly assessed by the General Assembly. There is no denying that there are competing interests here. As the County notes, every dollar of property tax not paid by an entity such as Girard, which owns property within Cumberland County for the benefit of a charity operating in Philadelphia County, is a dollar that must be found elsewhere to educate the students within Cumberland County. But, this is true of all property deemed that of the Commonwealth sovereign and its agencies. Whether a Commonwealth agency such as the Board of City Trusts should properly continue to share in the immunity of the Commonwealth government is a matter that the General Assembly obviously can address and announce affirmatively. And, given the General Assembly’s historical interest in, and concern with the Girard Entities, we believe it better that that policy decision be considered and decisively rendered by that body, rather than by a Court attempting to apply new doctrines to old, and rather unique, relationships.</p>
