The Superior Court held that the claim at issue, which concerned the propriety of appellee’s conviction for the offense of aggravated assault, implicated the legality of appellee’s sentence; found that the claim was meritorious; vacated appellee’s aggravated assault conviction; and then directed that the principle of double jeopardy precluded appellee from being recharged in connection with the assault. Our review here is limited to the legal question of whether the claim is subject to waiver. For the reasons set forth below, we find that appellee’s claim concerning her underlying conviction for aggravated assault does not implicate the legality of the sentence for purposes of issue preservation. Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and we remand to that court for consideration of appellee’s remaining appellate claims, consistent with this Opinion.</p>

The father of Shamira’s unborn child was also the father of a child of appellee. After the funeral service ended, appellee and ten other women accosted Derrell, Shamira and Shadora. Appellee began screaming at Shamira that she was going to kill Shamira’s baby. The group of assailants attacked Derrell, Shamira and Shadora, macing the victims as well as punching and kicking them. Shamira was repeatedly kicked in the stomach during the assault.

Appellee’s claim was not that her house arrest sentence was illegal, but that she should never have been convicted of F2 aggravated assault at trial, an event which preceded sentencing. The Commonwealth adds that the remedy fashioned by the Superior Court corroborates the error in the panel’s finding that the sentence was illegal: in the Commonwealth’s view, the panel incoherently eliminated the conviction, rather than vacating the sentence.

In contrast, attacks on the defendant’s underlying conviction are often fact-driven, and they require input from the trial court to properly determine them. The Commonwealth contends that appellee’s claim is plainly fact-driven: there was no explicit statement at trial from the prosecutor that the Commonwealth was withdrawing or abandoning the F2 aggravated assault charge. The Superior Court came to a contrary conclusion by examining a cold record, without the benefit of the views of the trial <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>court, which rendered the verdict on the allegedly withdrawn charge, and by cobbling together various statements and silences to arrive at a controlling deduction that the Commonwealth withdrew the charge.

In a short brief, appellee states that she now agrees “that the Superior Court erred in reviewing as a question of legality of sentence the defendant’s claim that it was improper to convict the defendant of aggravated assault as [an F2] when the Commonwealth sought conviction for aggravated assault solely as [an FI].” Appellee’s Brief at 6.

However, appellee challenges the Commonwealth’s argument in the Superior Court that she waived the underlying issue by failing to object at trial.

In response to appellee’s claim that we should remand for the Superior Court to determine, in the first instance, whether appellee waived the claim at trial, the Commonwealth argues that the panel must have determined that the issue was waived because its discussion of sentencing legality otherwise was “pointless.” The Commonwealth also asserts that appellee is not entitled to a remand for determination of her sufficiency claim, arguing that she could have secured that review if she had not opposed the Commonwealth’s reargument request; and that she opposed the Commonwealth’s anticipatory request, in its allocatur petition, to accept review of the sufficiency claim because it could be an alternative ground for affirmance.

For example, <em>Foster </em>generated a unanimous mandate (affording sentencing relief on a claim not raised below), but no majority expression of view, and four separate, nuanced opinions addressing preferred approaches to the “illegal sentence” question. The difficulty in <em>Foster </em>arose from the fact that the claim was premised upon new decisional law: <em>Commonwealth v.

The defendant in <em>Foster </em>had not preserved a Dickson-style challenge to the mandatory sentence in the trial court. There was no question that the claim in <em>Foster </em>was a sentencing claim: the difficulty was whether that sentencing claim was reviewable, even though it was waived, and if so, why. The Court’s consideration of these issues implicated (in various of the expressions of the Court) questions of whether the claim implicated the “legality” of the sentence under prior decisional law; if so, under what theory or test; and the roles of retroactivity and this Court’s issue preservation doctrines.</p>

We do not view that question to be close. The claim sustained by the Superior Court involved appellee’s underlying conviction at trial, not the sentence the trial court imposed over four months later. Thus, the failure to forward a contemporaneous objection to the court’s verdict cannot be <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>excused by resort to an “illegal sentence” doctrine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Of course, every criminal defense claim on direct appeal, if successful, will result in some effect upon the “sentence,” since it is the judgment of sentence that is the appealable order.

To succeed, appellee needs to prove an error respecting the verdict, not the sentence Likewise, the Superi- or Court remedy here, as the Commonwealth notes, was not to order resentencing, as would happen where it is the sentence that is infirm, but to effectively arrest judgment, <em>i.e., </em>to undo the underlying conviction.</p>

The <em>Andrews </em>Court then determined that the claim presented was fact-driven as the inquiry required examination of what Andrews did, and what he intended to do.

This line of argument apparently is a response to appellee’s argument in her brief in opposition to the Petition for Allowance of Appeal.

Following the bench trial verdict of guilt, however, the trial court sentenced the appellant to six to twelve years of imprisonment, grading the crime as an FI, which is punishable by up to twenty years. In point of fact, attempted rape had been regraded by the General Assembly as an FI the year before the appellant’s trial, but the Commonwealth had inadvertently charged the crime as an F2.</p>

It appears that the question of legality was not contested by the Commonwealth perhaps because, as the <em>Kisner </em>panel noted, the mistake made by the trial court there (in the waiver colloquy) was traceable to the “understandable” error made by the Commonwealth in misgrading the crime as an F-2. In any event, the trial proceeded on the F2. In the present matter, the claim upon which the panel granted relief did not allege that the sentence imposed on appellee exceeded the legal maximum for the graded offense. <em>Kisner, </em>then, does not support the panel’s finding that the non-sentencing claim here implicated sentencing legality.</p>
