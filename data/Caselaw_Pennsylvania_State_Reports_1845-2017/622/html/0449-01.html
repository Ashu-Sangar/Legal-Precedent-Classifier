The victims were Alfred Mignogna, the owner of the club; Frederick Riekabaugh, the bouncer; and Stephen Heiss, a bystander/patron of the club. Shortly after the shootings, Appellant called 911 and told the operator that he thought he had hurt someone. Police found Appellant at the Shumaker residence and took him into custody approximately an hour after the shootings. Appellant was charged by information with three counts of criminal homicide; one count of aggravated assault, felony of the first degree; one count of aggravated assault, felony of the second degree; and one count each of recklessly endangering another person and illegal alien not to possess/use a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At trial, which was held in Blair County before a jury chosen from citizens of Cumberland County, defense counsel acknowledged that Appellant had shot the three men, but he attempted to introduce a defense of diminished capacity due to alcohol- and marijuana-induced intoxication.

The evidence that Appellant acted with malice and with specific intent to kill the victims was substantial. Harry Kamerow, M.D., a pathologist who performed autopsies on the three victims at the request of the Blair County Coroner’s Office, testified as follows regarding his findings. Mr. Mignogna suffered three separate gunshot wounds: one to the left side of the chest, one to the left flank, and one to the right thigh; his death was caused by the gunshot wound to his chest, which ruptured the left and right ventricles of his heart.

Then, Mr. Hott testified, Appellant walked away from the group to a car parked near the club, fumbled around in the passenger side of the car, walked back with something in his hand, approached Mr. Rickabaugh from the back, aimed, and fired three shots into Mr. Rickabaugh. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 156-57. Next, Mr. Hott testified, Appellant turned slightly to the left and fired more shots, hitting Mr. Mignogna, who was standing next to Mr. Hott. <em>Id. </em>at 149-50. At this point, Mr. Hott ran inside the club, but he continued to hear gunshots. <em>Id. </em>at 150.

Then, Mr. Bryant testified, Appellant came from the parking lot carrying a firearm, which he raised in front of him with both arms, pointed, and fired multiple times. <em>Id. </em>at 33-35, 45, 52. The gunfire prompted Mr. Bryant to run from the scene, around the back of the UVA club building, at which point he realized that Appellant was also running in that direction. <em>Id. </em>at 35-37.

The court explained that, prior to its receipt of Mexico’s October 12, 2005 motion, the court’s understanding was that the Mexican Consulate was exploring the possibility of representing Appellant. Although the trial court had been attempting to confirm Mexico’s intentions, it was only upon receipt of the October 12, 2005 motion that the trial court realized that the Government of Mexico would not be representing Appel<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>lant. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the trial court stated that it was aware, at the time it declined to appoint counsel, that Appellant was being represented in an involuntary termination matter by private counsel, specifically Thomas Dickey, Esq. This fact lent support, in the trial judge’s mind, to Appellant’s financial capacity to obtain his own counsel. Given this situation, the trail court concluded that it was “prudent [ ] to await [Appellant’s] and/or Mexico’s decision and defer proceedings for a time to see how these issues would resolve.” <em>Id. </em>at 5. However, upon receipt of Mexico’s October 12, 2005 motion, the trial court directed the Blair County Office of the Public Defender to represent Appellant even though the court acknowledged some remaining question as to Appellant’s financial capability. <em>Id. </em>at 3.

Furthermore, as we explain in Issue 2, <em>infra, </em>Appellant’s claim that his constitutional right to counsel was violated by the 47-day delay in appointment of counsel has no merit. Taken generally, Appellant’s contention that Mr. Speice was burdened by a conflict of interest would lead to an entirely untenable proposition, to wit, that the public defender would have a conflict with virtually any defendant whom the public defender initially considered ineligible for public-financed counsel, but who subsequently was found to qualify for same.

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court has made clear as recently as 2008 that, for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, “critical stages” are defined as “proceedings between an individual and agents of the State (whether formal or informal, in court or out,) that amount to trial-like confrontations____” <em>Rothgery, supra </em>at 212 n. 16, <a href="/us/554/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="554 U.S. 191" data-case-ids="3677266" data-case-paths="/us/554/0191-01">128 S.Ct. 2578</a> (internal quotations and citations omitted and emphasis added). To hold that an entire ten-day block of time is a “critical stage,” regardless of whether any actual “proceedings” or “trial-like confrontations” take place during that time, would extend the High Court’s Sixth Amendment jurisprudence beyond reason or recognition. Such an extension would also, in essence, mandate appointment of counsel for any and all yet-unrepresented defendants immediately after preliminary arraignment, regardless of whether the accused had requested appointment of counsel and regardless of his or her financial capacity or intent to obtain private counsel. We will not impose such an unreasonable and unworkable requirement.

Dr. Ragusea further opined that Appellant had not lost control over his behavior, although Dr. Ragusea believed the murders to be an impulsive act. Dr. Ragusea acknowledged that he did not know what Appellant was thinking or capable of thinking or what was going on in his head on the night of the murders. Importantly, despite thorough and lengthy questioning, neither Dr. Ragusea nor any other witness opined that Appellant’s use of drugs and alcohol on the night of the murders overwhelmed him to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities, thus rendering him unable to form the specific intent to kill. Dr. Ragusea’s testimony was much less precise, encompassing not just Appellant’s substance abuse, but also his perception of a threat, his history of panic attacks, his anger management problem, and his recent loss of a friend to suicide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a>

The three factors proffered by the Commonwealth and found by the jury were the following: killing committed while in the perpetration of a felony (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6)); knowingly created grave risk of death to another person (§ 9711(d)(7)); and convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the murder at issue (§ 9711(d)(ll)).</p>

Aggravating factor 9711(d)(7) (knowingly created grave risk of death to another person) arose from the guilt phase evidence concerning the manner in which Appellant carried out the murders, to wit, shooting into a group of people standing outside a bar and killing not just the two intended victims, but <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>also a bystander.

Most seriously, the trial court suggested that, if the court were to adopt these defense claims, it would “repudiate the jury system as it has traditionally existed.” <em>Id. </em>at 6.

Appellant murdered three men, and received three death sentences. The facts below demonstrate that Appellant, his friend Travis Shumaker, and Shumaker’s mother were denied admission to a private social club. During the course of an argument and altercation involving Shumaker and the club’s owner, Alfred Mignogna, and bouncer, Frederick Rickabaugh, appellant walked to Shumaker’s nearby car, retrieved a loaded handgun, returned, and fired repeatedly, killing Mr. Mignogna, Mr. Rickabaugh, and a bystander and patron of the club, Stephen Heiss. In doing so, appellant also risked the lives of other club attendees. The jury found three aggravating circumstances as to each murder, two of which are very powerful: multiple murder, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll), and knowingly creating a grave risk of death to other victims, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7), with the third aggravator being that appellant committed the murders in the course of a felony involving the illegal possession of firearms. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6). Appellant had no real defense against the first two aggravators, and his counsel insisted upon stipulating to the third for a very specific reason: so that the jury would not learn appellant’s status as an illegal alien. The jury also found three mitigating circumstances, two implicating the “catchall” mitigator of “any other” relevant mitigation (here, that appellant was a good father and made a positive adjustment to incarceration), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8), and a third relating more directly to the offenses, ie., that he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance when he committed the three murders. 42 Pa. C.S. § 9711(e)(2). Not surprisingly in a case involving three murders, the jury unanimously found that the aggravators outweighed the mitigators as to all three murders, and thus it returned three sentences of death, as required. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv).</p>

Section 6105 of the Act prohibits possession of a firearm by any person “who, being an alien, is illegally or unlawfully in the United States.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6105(a), (c).

The claim now before the Court was first raised some months after trial. Notwithstanding that the claim had been waived, the trial court, per the Honorable Hiram A.

In other words, it is not as if the jury was erroneously told that the adult victims here were children under the age of twelve. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(16). Rather, the defaulted issue involves the Commonwealth’s notice of aggravating circumstances, the notice’s relationship to the prior criminal information, and whether that relationship could have formed the basis for dismissal of the aggravator, a challenge appellant never raised. Judge Carpenter’s account of the actual defaulted issue is illuminating and explained: why the Section 6106 felony firearms provision was properly the basis for the aggravator; that proof of a violation would entail informing the jury that appellant was an illegal alien; that appellant’s counsel, as a strategic matter, wished to avoid disclosure of appellant’s illegal alien status, apparently at all costs; and that it was appellant who both secured severance of the formal firearms charge for trial and insisted upon a generic stipulation to the firearms penalty aggravator, precisely so the jury would not learn that he was an illegal alien:</p>

As early as the Omnibus Pretrial Motions, the Defense asked this Court to sever [the formal firearms charge under Section 6105] from the information claiming possible prejudice.

No objection was raised to the stipulation until months after the trial, at a point where nothing could be done about it.

It may be that the problem, if timely identified, could have been addressed, and the outcome would be no different (indeed, that is most likely the case here). Of course, the prosecution in a capital case bears responsibility for the aggravators it pursues. But, prosecutors make honest mistakes, no less than defense lawyers do. Furthermore, there can be complications, or confusion, or misunderstandings that do not even amount to a mistake, much less some nefarious plot by the prosecution. Many errors and pitfalls are possible in a case; ours is an adversarial trial system, with a neutral judge as arbiter, and the requirement of contemporaneous objection operates to avoid error, and to create a record to allow for meaningful appellate review.

The jury determined that the single aggravator outweighed the single mitigator, and thus returned a sentence of death. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). The appellant had moved to quash the aggravating circumstance pretrial, on grounds that the death eligibility circumstance had been secured only by the Commonwealth’s violation of a pre-trial court order staying his extradition to North Carolina for trial on the prior murder until the Pennsylvania murder trial had concluded. On appeal, the appellant argued that the Commonwealth had no authority to contravene the order; that its conduct in transferring him to North Carolina created the single aggravating circumstance that made him death penalty eligible; that the Commonwealth should not benefit from its violation of a court order; and that quashal of the aggravating circumstance and vacatur of the death sentence it produced were appropriate. In response, the Commonwealth did not dispute that its action led to the creation of the aggravating circumstance, but argued that it was not deliberately seeking to create that aggravating circumstance; that it acted in good faith; that the aggravator existed when the matter ultimately was ready for trial; and that absent a showing of “purposeful abuse” by prosecution authorities, the aggravator should not be set aside.

      <em>Williams </em>is problematic, setting forth a holding unsupported by constitutional or statutory authority, and doing so with not so much as a syllable of legal reasoning. The holding is both dubious and counter-intuitive. Imagine a mass murderer (one who murders more people than appellant did in this case) with, say, one additional relatively minor aggravator, such as the in-the-perpetration-of-a-felony aggravator here, and a single mitigator.

It would be a remarkable thing indeed if Congressionally-authorized financing of federal criminal defense services for the indigent also encompassed representation of the interests of non-indigent foreign sovereign nations, who in turn seek to advance the interests of their citizens illegally in this nation who have been convicted of capital murder in state courts.</p>

In this regard, I note that Attorney Dunham withdrew his appearance on behalf of Mexico by <em>praecipe </em>filed on October 12, 2011; that same day, Marc Bookman, Esquire, of the Atlantic Center for Capital Representation, entered his appearance, “substituting” for Attorney Dunham as counsel of <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>record for Mexico. The timing and substitution may be significant. On October 3, 2011, this Court entered an Order in <em>Commonwealth v.

That Verified Statement was filed with this Court on October 13, 2011, the day after Attorney Dunham withdrew his appearance in this appeal. Given the withdrawal, the FCDO’s Verified Statement does not list this case as one in which it was involved.</p>

Perhaps Attorney Dunham worked strictly on weekends from home or on vacation in preparing Mexico’s brief; did not avail himself of federally-financed FCDO support staff, computer equipment, or research resources; and used private or Mexican funds to print, bind, deliver and serve his work product on behalf of a foreign nation.

Justice Baer’s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion takes issue with the analysis of the trial court and the Commonwealth that I have outlined concerning the Section 6106 felony, arguing that the facts at trial — a trial where Section 6106 was not specifically at issue — do not prove the offense since it was not shown at that level that appellant carried the firearm either in the vehicle or concealed on his person. (Notably, appellant has not argued this in response to the Commonwealth and the trial judge, preferring instead his "pristine question of law”). At the same time, however, Justice Baer recognizes the obvious fact that, put to proving the felony — for example, by a timely objection or challenge to the aggravator — the Commonwealth may well have produced more specific evidence addressing the elements of that crime. Justice Baer <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>then states that "it is wholly improper to assume or infer the existence of the felony to justify the aggravating circumstance.” Concurring and Dissenting Opinion (Baer, J.), at 542, 80 A.3d at 1238. Respectfully, it is difficult to see how this argument weighs against deferral of the claim, which is my primary point. The fact remains that the aggravator was supported by stipulation; the stipulation was entered into upon insistence by the defense; no objection was raised to the aggravator or the stipulation; and a proper and accurate disposition of the waived claim, in my view, is better left to collateral attack.</p>
