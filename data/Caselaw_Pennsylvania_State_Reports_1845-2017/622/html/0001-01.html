Canty forced two of the female employees toward the vault at gunpoint, and Appellant remained near the front of the building with the bank manager, Loretta Johnson. While the employees were attempting to open the vault, Canty shouted “here comes the heat,” and Appellant responded “don’t worry, I’ll take care of <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>them.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Philadelphia Police Officer Lauretha Vaird, the first officer to respond to a report of a robbery in progress, then entered the bank via the front door, and Appellant fatally shot her in the abdomen. Appellant fled through the front door, heading toward a waiting green van driven by a third perpetrator, Warren McGlone. As Appellant was running to make his escape, he encountered Officer Donald Patterson, the second police officer to arrive on the scene. Officer Patterson fired his weapon at Appellant, but Appellant managed to enter the van and McGlone then sped away from the scene. Canty also escaped, fleeing from the bank building via a side door.</p>

At the crime scene, specifically on the sidewalks near the bank, police discovered two loaded firearms: a 9 millimeter handgun and a silver .380 caliber Lorcin revolver. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”) traced both firearms: the 9 millimeter handgun to one Richelle Parker, who had purchased the gun for McGlone, a friend of hers, and the Lorcin revolver to one Anthony Brown, a relative of Canty. Canty and McGlone both gave inculpatory statements to police admitting their involvement in the robbery.</p>

Hall not only was an initial suspect in the robbery/murder, but also eventually admitted that he had stolen and given to McGlone the get-away van in exchange for a percentage of the robbery proceeds. Around the time of the robbery/murder, Hall committed numerous <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>armed robberies of business establishments in the Philadelphia area, which were allegedly similar to the PNC Bank robbery, and thus, Appellant asserts, would have constituted admissible evidence at trial. Appellant and Hall share a certain physical resemblance in that each is tall, approximately 6'5". Furthermore, Mohammad Chuchtai, a witness who was standing across the street from the bank at the time of the robbery/murder, identified Hall as the individual he saw running from the bank when he was shown an array of five photographs by PCRA counsel. Importantly, this photo-identification took place more than eleven years after the robbery/murder. Finally, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth’s case was “far from insurmountable” as there was no physical evidence linking him to the crime and the eyewitness testimony was inconsistent, uncertain, and unreliable.

Therefore, from the jury’s perspective, for Ms. Medley’s statement to corroborate Canty’s statement, the former need only implicate Canty and some “other people” as participants in the crime. Of course, Ms. Medley’s statement did implicate Canty and some other people and thus did corroborate Canty’s statement. We can see absolutely no rationale for invoking <em>Bruton </em>merely because Ms. Medley asserted in her testimony that police sought to question her in order to corroborate Canty’s statement. The fact that Ms. Medley’s statement also implicated Appellant and McGlone does not bring her testimony under <em>Bruton’s </em>rule. Because Canty’s redacted statement as read to the jury did not mention Appellant and McGlone, Ms. Medley’s statement did not — and indeed could not— “corroborate” that Canty’s statement had implicated Appellant and McGlone. One cannot “corroborate” facts that are not set forth or even mentioned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_29" id="ref_footnote_1_29">29</a>

Furthermore, when defense counsel objected to the challenged statements, the trial court sustained the objection, and then, after Canty’s statement was read into the record at trial, the court gave a cautionary instruction, directing the jury to consider the statement only with respect to Canty as it was admissible only against Canty.

The testimony of record supports these conclusions, and we extend great deference to the PCRA court’s credibility determinations.

Although we decide this issue on the basis of waiver for failure to have presented the issue to the PCRA court, we are compelled to note the following. In a one-sentence claim, Appellant baldly asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, uncover, and request disclosure of information related to alleged alterations in the videotape and to the Commonwealth’s allegedly false and misleading evidence regarding the videotape. Appellant's Brief at 48. Appellant fails to mention — much less develop a reasoned argument based upon— the standard by which claims of ineffectiveness are evaluated. Furthermore, Appellant's bald claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness is entirely speculative because Appellant presents not a bit of evidence as to what counsel actually did or failed to do with respect to the videotape evidence.</p>

Appellant asserts that the videotape was sent to the FBI, "information that came to light during PCRA proceedings,” apparently when the Commonwealth provided a copy of the videotape to PCRA counsel. Appellant's Brief at 48-49. This does not constitute evidence that the FBI in any way enhanced, altered, or tampered with the videotape. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. As we have discussed in Issue 2, <em>see </em>text <em>supra, </em>federal prosecutors entered into a plea agreement with Travis Hall for his participation in, <em>inter alia, </em>the PNC Bank robbery/Vaird murder.</p>

Thus, by Appellant’s own admission, the videotape did not incriminate him as he was not identified as the shooter or even as one of the bank robbers from the videotape.

On the first day of trial, counsel for co-defendant Canty raised the matter during cross-examination of Officer Trenwith, who had participated in the investigation into the murder of Officer Vaird. Canty’s counsel asked Officer Trenwith if he had recovered any fingerprints in the PNC Bank. Officer Trenwith answered that he had recovered "one identifiable fingerprint in the vault room,” which was not "identified to any of the bank employees or any other suspects.” N.T., 10/15/96, at 138-39. On redirect, the prosecutor asked Officer Trenwith if he would expect to find fingerprints if the perpetrators had worn gloves, and, over defense counsel’s objection, the officer answered "no.” <em>Id. </em>at 195-96. On re-cross examination, defense counsel returned to the issue of fingerprints, questioning the officer as to why he had been unable to find more prints. <em>Id. </em>at 196-98. Officer Trenwith explained that collecting identifiable fingerprints was "pretty tough” although the investigators always tried to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 197-97. The issue of fingerprints arose again several days later when Evidence Specialist Mujica, who had participated in the investigation of the crime scene, testified that he had lifted six partial fingerprints from items found inside the stolen get-away van. N.T., 10/18/96, at 14. On cross-examination, Specialist Mujica testified that he had dusted approximately 60 items for fingerprints, including the van and its contents. <em>Id. </em>at 24.

In my Concurring Opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em>I detailed the tactics of the FCDO in that capital PCRA matter, including tactics of delay; I also described in great detail the abusive and improper brief that the FCDO had filed. The FCDO brief in <em>Spotz </em>was exactly 100 pages; that length was a result of this Court’s indulgence since, by the Rule in effect at that time, briefs were not to exceed 70 pages without leave of court. I noted in my concurrence that the FCDO had flouted that indulgence by dispensing with several of the required elements of a brief, such as a Statement of the Case, thus creating space for the FCDO to burden the Court with more claims. I described with specificity other abuses in the Brief:</p>
    <blockquote id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[221,1940,1107,419]]]'>The Brief pretends to raise “only” 20 issues, which would be burdensome enough. But, within those twenty claims are multitudes of additional claims or sub-claims. My conservative count of the total number of distinct “claims” presented in the Defender’s Brief, including both derivative and subsidiary allegations, exceeds 70. How does the Defender manage to “litigate” 70 claims in a 100-page brief? It employs a number of additional tricks.</blockquote>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>For example, in 100 pages of Brief, the Defender includes no less than 136 single-spaced footnotes, many of extreme length, and then routinely advances distinct substantive arguments in those footnotes. <em>See, e.g., </em>Initial Brief of Appellant, nn. 15, 18, 20-29, 32-33, 37-39, 43-51, 53, 59, 61-70, 72-77, 79-85, 94-95, 103, 107-18, 123-25, 127-34. The Defender also seizes more briefing space by single-spacing, and not indenting, its Statement of Questions Presented, making them virtually unreadable in the process. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 2 (containing 40 single-spaced lines of text running margin to margin). Another common Defender abuse, immediately recognizable to those of us charged with attempting to read their Briefs, is to list distinct claims or sub-claims by single-spaced bullet point in text, essentially doubling the number of points to be made. To make the abuse worse, these bullet points often simply declare the sub-claims without development or legal support; other times, the Defender will append footnotes, which may contain factual support or substantive argument, or may provide no meaningful development or explanation of the relevance of bald citations. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 29-30 <em>&amp; </em>nn. 27-29; 47-48 &amp; nn. 53-57; 53; 64-65 &amp; nn. 82-83; 66-67 &amp; nn. 86-92; 71-72 &amp; nn. 96-101; 75-76; 83; 95-98 &amp; nn. 125-34.

After a hearing, our special master reported his findings that such system, in effect at the time of Appellant’s trial, was “grossly inadequate,” “completely inconsistent with how competent trial attorneys work,” “punishes counsel for handling these cases correctly,” and “unacceptably increases the risk of ineffective assistance of counsel in individual cases.” Report and Recommendations in <em>Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, I believe the reviewing courts should be more circumspect concerning the extra-record assumption that counsel acted appropriately with regard to the other critical phase. <em>Cf.

I also have difficulty with the practice of requiring an affidavit or declaration of counsel in the post-conviction process.
