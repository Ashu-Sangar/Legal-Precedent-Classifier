The young men saw the 36-year-old victim walking alone in a subway concourse and decided to attack him. At the goading of his four friends, one of the young men struck the victim from behind. The others promptly joined the attack; they punched, kicked, and stomped on the victim’s head and chest. Two Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) police officers heard the commotion and responded. One officer heard Best say, “You bitch,” and saw him punch the victim in the head. <em>Id. </em>The other officer heard laughter from the group as they engaged in the attack.

      <em>Weimer </em>involved the same issue as the present case: whether conspiracy to commit third degree murder is a cognizable offense. However, this Court did not reach the issue because the defendant was charged with and convicted of conspiracy to commit homicide generally; there was no gradation of homicide, as in the instant case. Accordingly, we concluded the conspiracy to commit homicide conviction was valid. We further noted the Superior Court dealt with various cases involving conspiracy and third degree murder, most of which held conspiracy to commit third degree murder was a cognizable offense. <em>See <a href="/pa/602/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="977 A.2d 1103" data-case-ids="4195690,7297266" data-case-paths="/pa/602/0033-01,/a2d/977/1103-01">id.</a> </em>(collecting cases).

Accordingly, the court vacated appellees’ convictions for conspiracy to commit third degree murder. In Fisher and Best’s cases, the court held remand for resentencing was unnecessary because their conspiracy sentences ran concurrently with their third degree murder sentences, which were longer; therefore, the length of the aggregate sentences was unaffected. In Stanton’s case, the court concluded remand for resentencing was necessary because Stanton’s aggregate sentence was significantly reduced by vacation of the conspiracy conviction from 12/6 to 25 years to two and one-half to five years.</p>

According to the dissent, because “the essence of third[ ]degree murder is a homicide that occurs <em>in the absence of a specific intent to kill </em>[,] ... to be guilty of conspiracy to commit third[ jdegree murder, an individual would have to intend to commit an unintentional killing, a logical impossibility.” <em>Id., </em>at 1112. The Commonwealth contends this logic misses the <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>mark because lack of specific intent is not an element of third degree murder; the offense requires malice, which means the defendant recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally caused the victim’s death. <em>See </em>Commonwealth’s Brief, at 9-10 (citing 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(c) (homicide statute does not specify requisite mental state for third degree murder); <em>id., </em>§ 302(c) (where statute does not prescribe culpability sufficient to establish material element of offense, such element is established if defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly)). Therefore, the Commonwealth argues, as long as a defendant intended to facilitate a crime involving reckless or knowing behavior, he can be convicted of conspiracy to commit third degree murder.</p>

Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit third degree murder is appropriate, as specific intent was shown. The Commonwealth criticizes the <em>Weimer </em>dissent’s reliance on the American Law Institute’s commentary to the Model Penal Code for the view that there cannot be a conspiracy to commit a crime for which the minimum required <em>mens rea </em>is negligence or recklessness; the Commonwealth notes although § 903 of the Crimes Code is derived from the Model Penal Code, the General Assembly has never adopted the commentary thereon. <em>See id., </em>at 15 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellees and the Superior Court beg the question — in stating an element of the crime of third degree murder is an unintentional killing, and one cannot intend an unintentional act, they misstate the elements of third degree murder. True, the intent to kill is a defined element of first degree murder — this does not mean an element of third degree murder is the polar opposite of intent to kill, such that the Commonwealth must prove a lack of intent to kill to convict of third degree murder. The Commonwealth has no such obligation; evidence of intent to kill is simply irrelevant to third degree murder. The elements of third degree murder absolutely include an intentional <em>act, </em>but not an act defined by the statute as intentional murder. The act sufficient for third degree is still a purposeful one, committed with malice, which results in death — clearly, one can conspire to such an intentional act.</p>

The court’s reasoning and the crux of appellees’ position is that third degree murder is an unintentional killing, and one cannot intentionally conspire to commit an unintentional act. This logic is based on the reasoning in <em>Weimer’s </em>dissent, which noted Pennsylvania’s conspiracy statute is derived from § 5.03 of the Model Penal Code. <em>See Weimer, </em>at 1112 (Todd, J., dissenting) (citing 18 Pa.C.S. § 903, Official Comment — 1972). “Under the Model Penal Code, where the object crime of a conspiracy is defined in terms of a result of conduct, such as homicide, the actor’s purpose must be to promote or facilitate that result.” <em><a href="/pa/612/0642-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="32 A.3d 613" data-case-ids="4204894,7270316" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0642-01,/a3d/32/0613-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing Model Penal Code § 5.03 cmt. 2(c)(i) at 407 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1985)). Thus, appellees contend the language of Pennsylvania’s conspiracy statute focuses on the actor’s intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a “crime,” not an “act”; unless the actor intended to commit the underlying crime, he cannot be guilty of conspiracy for such crime.</p>

Although <em>Roebuck </em>dealt with accomplice liability, as opposed to conspiracy, it is instructive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> If a defendant acts with his co-conspirators in brutally attacking the victim with the intention of killing him, he conspires to commit first degree murder; if the defendant performs the same action but does not care whether the victim dies or not, he conspires to commit third degree murder. In the latter example, the defendant did not, as appellees argue, intend to aid an unintentional murder; rather, he intended to aid a malicious act resulting in a killing. Malice is not the absence of <em>any </em>intent, just the specific intent to kill. Where, as here, the defendant intends the underlying act (the beating) which results in death, the evidence supports the charge of conspiracy to commit third degree murder.</p>

Thus, one does not conspire to commit a denominated offense; one conspires to engage in certain conduct. The fact the actors do not mention which crime such conduct will constitute does not make conspiracy to commit the offense non-cognizable. The conspiracy is to commit the beating, which, being carried out with the mental state of malice, supports a charge of third degree murder.
