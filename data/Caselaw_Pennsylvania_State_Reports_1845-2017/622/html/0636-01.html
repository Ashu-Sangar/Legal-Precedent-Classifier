In September of 2010, Pennsylvania State Police arrested Ricky Lynn Hann for assaulting his then-girlfriend, Lisa Souders. Following an initial bail hearing, he was released on his own recognizance.

Accepting that Hann unquestionably violated the conditions of bail, the court proceeded to examine the case under the three <em>Ciotti/Mayfield </em>prongs to determine whether justice required enforcement of the forfeiture order. First, in the court’s view, there was little doubt that Hann willfully violated the conditions by driving to Souders’ house, taking her by force into the wooded area behind her house, and shooting her twice with a sawed-off shotgun. Second, the trial court disagreed with Appellee that the Commonwealth was required to exhibit a financial <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>cost associated with Hann’s violation of the terms of his bail bond.

The court noted that Appellee could have reviewed the criminal complaint and Hann’s violent history before posting bail on his behalf. Further, by signing a surety agreement, Appellee accepted responsibility not only for Hann appearing in court, but also for Hann complying with the remaining terms of the bail bond. Finally, the court noted that the forfeiture was not a means to punish Hann or his estate for Souders’ death. Accordingly, the court granted the Commonwealth’s petition.</p>

After reviewing the above-stated precedent, the Superior Court disagreed with the trial court regarding the irrelevance of a monetary cost to the Commonwealth in the analysis of the second <em>Ciotti/Mayfield </em>prong. The panel almost exclusively relied upon a comment in <em>Mayfield, </em>which in the court’s view, mandates that the Commonwealth prove a demonstrable, monetary loss to warrant forfeiture: “the defendant’s arrest [in <em>Mayfield </em>] did not require substantial investigative resources and did not require a delay in disposition of the underlying charges. In the absence of at least some demonstrated detriment ... we conclude, as a matter of law, that the record fails to establish a legally cognizable basis for the total forfeiture____” Super. Ct. Mem. Op. at 6 (quoting <em>Mayfield, </em><a href="/a2d/827/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="827 A.2d 462" data-case-ids="9108926" data-case-paths="/a2d/827/0462-01">827 A.2d at 468-69</a>).

Therefore, and without examining any other aspect of the <em>Mayfield/Ciotti </em>construct, because the Commonwealth did not prove that Hann’s willful breach of the bond conditions caused it to suffer “any legally cognizable financial prejudice,” the Superior Court held that the trial court committed an error of law in directing full forfeiture and reversed the forfeiture order. <em>Id. </em>The Commonwealth filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which this Court granted to examine two, interrelated issues:</p>

R.Crim.P. 536 and the <em>Ciotti/Mayfield </em>factors. First, the Commonwealth contends, the plain language of Rule 536, <em>see supra </em>p. 61, simply does not require the government to have suffered a financial loss associated with a defendant’s breach of a bail bond. The Commonwealth suggests that the several courts which have applied Rule 536 and the <em>Ciotti/Mayfield </em>factors, including the <em>Mayfield </em>Court itself, have recognized that a financial detriment is not required under the rule, as courts have applied the second prong of the forfeiture framework — “cost, inconvenience, and prejudice” — as factors the trial court must consider, not conjunctive elements the Commonwealth must prove.</p>

Accordingly, in the Commonwealth’s view, the plain language of Rule 536 supports an underlying policy that forfeiture is proper in cases such as this because the bail (and the concomitant threat of forfeiture) serves as a deterrent against the defendant absconding and his breaching other bond conditions, such as intimidating or retaliating against witnesses, <em>see </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 526(A)(4), as well as refraining from any other criminal activity. <em>See <a href="/a2d/827/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="827 A.2d 462" data-case-ids="9108926" data-case-paths="/a2d/827/0462-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/827/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="827 A.2d 462" data-case-ids="9108926" data-case-paths="/a2d/827/0462-01">526</a>(A)(5).</p>

Rather, the Commonwealth asserts, Appellee had multiple options before him other than immediately going to the Franklin County jail to bail out Hann, such as comprehending that this case involved a violent domestic kidnapping, investigating Hann’s background, and realizing that Hann and Souders had domestic incidents in the past. The Commonwealth maintains that after performing even a perfunctory investigation, Appellee could have made a calculated analysis as to whether to accept the request for a bail bond. Instead, the Commonwealth argues, Appellee knowingly made a business decision to sign the bond and surety agreements, bail Hann out of jail, and suffer the potential consequences of Hann’s breach of the bail bond conditions. Moreover, the potential <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>“chilling effect on the bail bonds industry” in the Commonwealth’s view is nugatory, because the identical provisions for forfeiture apply no matter whether the defendant himself, a family member, or a professional bondsman posts the requisite amount of bail.</p>

We further find significant that the rule is written in terms of a negative — "that justice does <em>not </em>require full enforcement of the order” — in determining that the burden in this regard be placed with the defendant or his surety. Fundamentally, the Commonwealth would not be the party advocating that justice does not require full enforcement; such party self-evidently would be the defendant or his surety.</p>

My only point of difference is that I believe cases like the present one can serve as a vehicle to guide trial-court discretion in the area, so that the high-threshold abuse-of-discretion standard does not serve to insulate vastly disparate treatment of similarly situated cases among our courts of common pleas. Here, I agree with the argument of Appellee and its <em>amicus </em>that, absent special circumstances not present here, justice does not require a $100,000 forfeiture by a bail bondsman for the deceased defendant’s post-bail criminal behavior. From my personal perspective, then, a penalty of such degree should not be the result of the decision on remand.</p>

Accordingly, I join the majority’s reversal of the Superior Court’s order on that basis, and its remand for further proceedings. However, I find the majority’s excursion into broader questions — its examination of the other factors a trial court should address in assessing whether justice requires forfeiture, and the burdens of proof in forfeiture proceed<a id="p663" href="#p663" data-label="663" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*663</a>ings — to be imprudent at this juncture. These issues are outside of our grant of allocatur, see Majority Opinion at 645-46, 81 A.3d at 63, and are not addressed by the parties. As a result, we lack the focused adversarial briefing we normally require before resolving issues on our discretionary docket. Rather, I would await a case directly raising these issues, or refer these broad questions to our Criminal Procedural Rules Committee so that we might benefit from the expertise, and the input from practitioners and other interested parties, that the rule-making process offers.</p>
