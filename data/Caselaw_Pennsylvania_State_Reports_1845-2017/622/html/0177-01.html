Smith of the Northampton County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant raises claims of trial court error regarding aspects of his penalty phase hearing, a constitutional challenge to the admissibility of victim impact testimony, and challenges to the jury’s weighing of statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction and judgment of sentence.</p>

Appellant was released on parole in 2007 and met Denise Merhi, an assistant in the medical office in which he was receiving a physical examination for employment. The two began dating and briefly lived together at Merhi’s residence in Northampton Borough, Pennsylvania. Merhi lived with her father, Dennis Marsh, her grandfather, Alvin Marsh, and her daughter and son (roughly 8 and 12 years old, respectively). Appellant was re-incarcerated for violating his parole and released again in April 2010. As a term of his release, appellant was required to live at the Allentown Community Corrections Center. He and Merhi resumed their relationship, though appellant came to believe that Merhi was dating other men.</p>

During their time away, appellant repeatedly called Merhi’s cell phone, but she ignored his calls. The group returned from the beach on June 25, 2010, and Hawkey lent Merhi her van because Merhi’s car was under repair. That evening appellant was still not receiving any response from Merhi. Appellant then phoned Merhi’s friend, Marilyn Rivera, to inquire as to Merhi’s whereabouts. Appellant appeared agitated, and asked Rivera if Merhi was romantically involved with other men. Rivera told appellant that Merhi was seeing another man named Peter Hoff. Appellant became upset and told Rivera that he loved Merhi so much that he could not let her go, that he felt anger like he had never felt before, and that he “did not know how to handle it.” N.T., 5/10/11, at 112.</p>

Just before noon, appellant left the center wearing a light blue shirt with a Superman emblem on the front and carrying a green canvas knapsack and a radio. Appellant visited two different pawn shops and unsuccessfully attempted to trade in his radio for credit toward the purchase of a knife. At the second location, appellant purchased a Muela Ruko knife. Appellant caught a city bus to Northampton Borough and, once there, entered a bar and ordered a drink. About twenty minutes later, neighbors observed appellant walk slowly up an alley near Merhi’s residence and peer around the corner of a garage in order to view Merhi’s home. Appellant proceeded to a liquor store, purchased a bottle of vodka, and called Merhi’s cell phone twice from a gas station payphone. During the phone calls, appellant confronted Merhi about Peter Hoff, and Merhi responded that Hoff was merely a friend.</p>

Failing to find her keys in Merhi’s mailbox, Hawkey entered the front door of the home, which was unlocked. Hawkey found her keys on the dining room table and laid her purse down. She could hear noises from the kitchen, and when Hawkey entered the kitchen to see if anyone was home, she found Merhi lying on the floor in a pool of blood and heard rustling noises coming from the rear of the house. Hawkey ran from the house and to the porch of Merhi’s nearby neighbors, Steven and Janet Zernhelt. After Hawkey told them what she had seen, Mr. Zernhelt ran into Merhi’s house while Hawkey and Janet called 911.</p>

Row-lands noticed that appellant was unconscious and covered in <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>blood. As appellant began to regain consciousness, Cpl. Row-lands asked appellant for his name and where he was coming from. Appellant replied, “I just killed everyone.” N.T., 5/9/11, at 175. Cpl. Rowlands, who at the time had no knowledge of the homicides that had occurred in Northampton Borough, asked appellant what he meant, and appellant responded, “Isn’t it obvious I just killed everyone.” <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>

Each area was “heavily saturated with blood,” and there were signs of an “extensive struggle.” <em>Id. </em>at 73. Each victim had suffered from “multiple sharp force injuries.” N.P., 4/20/11, at 19-20. Trooper Judge and Coroner Lysek later re-entered the home after becoming concerned that Merhi’s children might be somewhere in the house, at which point they found the body of Dennis Marsh, Merhi’s father, in the basement. Dennis likewise had been stabbed to death, suffering from multiple wounds. <em>Id. </em>The police located additional evidence in the basement, finding: (1) the words “Den<a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>ise is a Whore” written on the wall in what was later determined to be appellant’s own blood; (2) a light-blue t-shirt bearing the Superman logo; and (3) a green canvas duffle bag containing some of appellant’s personal belongings.

His plea followed upon a Commonwealth proffer that established that on June 26, 2010, appellant, agitated over hearing that Merhi was seeing another man, went to her house to confront her. On his way to Merhi’s residence, appellant purchased a knife and called Merhi several times in an attempt to confirm his suspicions.

For example, simply because a party’s witness asserts a fact does not mean that a party opponent cannot challenge, or rebut, or logically undermine the assertion. Thus, the fact that Dr. Johnson held the view that incidents of pre-trial misconduct while incarcerated are not indicative of how a defendant will act once sentenced does not establish that debatable proposition as a matter of law; the Commonwealth could logically rebut that assertion with appellant’s actual conduct while in prison. Thus, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s finding that appellant’s objections speak to the weight of the proffered testimony, and not to its admissibility. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The question of whether this testimony accurately predicts appellant’s future conduct any more accurately than Dr. Johnson’s testimony was a question properly left for the jury to decide.

First, appellant claims that the victim impact testimony presented by the Commonwealth in this case was so excessive and prejudicial that it violated his rights under both the U.S. Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> Appellant asserts that both the quantity and tenor of the victim impact testimony here “interjected an arbitrary outpouring of grief’ that deprived him of an impartial jury, and that the testimony was prejudicial because it focused the jury’s attention on the victims’ lives rather than on appellant’s crimes which ended those lives. Appellant also makes a broader argument: that victim impact testimony will always, by its nature, evoke a purely emotional reaction from the jury that deprives an accused of a fair trial. According to appellant, a sentencing hearing is held for the sole purpose of allowing a jury to determine the existence of, and to weigh, statutory aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Appellant argues that victim impact testimony is not essential to that purpose. Appellant concedes that our Court has found victim impact testimony to be constitutional under both federal and state law, but he nevertheless requests that we revisit those decisions in the interest of “fairness” and to discharge our statutory duty to review appellant’s death penalty for passion and prejudice. Finally, appellant claims that the statute allowing victim impact testimony, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a)(2), is unconstitutional because it lacks specific guidance to juries regarding how they must consider such testimony against the statutory <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>aggravating and mitigating circumstances testimony. According to appellant, the lack of guidance means either that victim impact testimony adds an arbitrary element into the jury’s determination, or worse, it becomes its own <em>de facto </em>aggravating factor, a result inconsistent with Section 9711(d), which provides an exclusive list of aggravating circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> In this way, appellant argues, Section 9711(a)(2) violates various federal decisional law.

With respect to appellant’s claim that the victim impact testimony at trial was excessive, the trial court found appellant’s argument waived, but further noted that even if appellant had preserved the claim, the testimony of the six victim impact witnesses was not excessive given that there were four murder victims. The court concluded that the testimony admitted here was not any different from victim impact testimony properly admitted in other cases: “all of the witnesses were family members, their testimony was relatively brief, and the testimony related to the victims and the impact the homicides had on the families.” Trial Ct. Op. at 78-79. The court also noted that, due to the nature of the crimes, some display of emotion in the courtroom is inevitable and any displays here did not warrant reversal.

      <em>Reyes </em>made clear that claims regarding weight of the evidence are not available to challenge a death sentence.

Second, appellant contends that listing the aggravating circumstances individually, without doing the same for the mitigating factors, violates due process because it “unnecessarily benefits the Commonwealth” by denying “an equal playing field.” Appellant’s Brief at 89-90. Lastly, appellant invokes Criminal Rule 807(a)(2) which states that, “the judge shall meet with counsel and determine those aggravating and mitigating circumstances of which there is some evidence. The judge shall then set forth those circumstances on the sentencing verdict slip using the language provided by law.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 807(a)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_33" id="ref_footnote_1_33">33</a> Appellant contends that “those circumstances” referred to in the Rule include both statutory and non-statutory mitigating circumstances.</p>
