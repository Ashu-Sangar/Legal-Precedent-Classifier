The troopers advised Appellant that they wanted to talk about the crime and advised him of his Miranda rights, and Appellant indicated that, while he wanted to talk about what had happened, he did not want to sign a waiver form because he distrusted police. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75. Appellant explained that, in his view, he had been wrongfully accused and convicted of various crimes in the past. <em>Id. </em>Trooper Biever responded that, in order for them to conduct the interview, he had to be advised of his rights. <em>Id. </em>at 75.

Appellant filed an omnibus pretrial motion seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) suppression of the evidence gleaned from the search of his apartment on the ground it was obtained via a warrant lacking probable cause and, in the alternative, on the ground it was obtained via a warrant executed in violation of the night-time search requirements of Pa.R.Crim.P. 203(E); and (2) suppression of the foregoing statements to Troopers Biever and Moyer on the ground they were obtained via an involuntary waiver of his Miranda rights. The trial court held a hearing on the motion and denied relief of both claims. Appellant also filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude or otherwise limit the introduction of 14 crime scene and autopsy photographs, arguing that their probative value was outweighed by their prejudicial effect.

Yatron of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. Relevant to the instant appeal, the principal dispute was whether Appellant or the alleged yellow-hooded man had committed the crime. Accordingly, the Commonwealth sought in various ways to discredit the notion of an alternate perpetrator. Most directly, the Commonwealth presented testimony that, after the crime, Appellant admitted to committing the murder. Justin Grube testified that, during their drug binge, Appellant hinted at hurting Leibig numerous times and indicated that he took her personal effects to make the crime look like a robbery.

N.T., 5/26/11-5/27/11, at 140-43, 158. Lid-dick explained that the murder weapons and Appellant’s knives had identical blade width, blade thickness, blade serrations, handle length, handle width, handle chemical composition, and handle pigment composition. <em>Id. </em>at 155-59. Liddick further indicated that the murder weapons’ blade length was identical to one of the Appellant’s knives, and roughly a centimeter shorter than the other. <em>Id. </em>On cross examination, Liddick agreed that he was unaware of the total number of similar knives in circulation, and that he was not absolutely certain that the knives were from the same manufacturer and set. <em>Id. </em>at 160-63.</p>

Lisa Shutfuski, a Commonwealth expert in DNA analysis, opined that the sweatshirt contained a mixture of two individuals’ blood and, by quite long odds, likely established Leibig and Appellant as the sources. N.T., 5/30/11-6/2/11 at 143^15. Specifically, Shutfuski indicated that the odds that the DNA profiles present on the sweatshirt would appear randomly in the population would be somewhere between 1 in 980 quadrillion to 1 in 600 quintillion for Leibig’s profile and between 1 in 42,000 and 1 in 120,000 for Appellant’s profile. <em>Id.</em>

Second, in an apparent attempt to explain the DNA mixture on his sweatshirt, Appellant testified that, consistent with his prior statement, he had hugged Leibig after the attack and bloodied his clothes, which he subsequently threw away. <em>Id. </em>at 253-62, 279.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Moreover, both Dr. Hoffman and Robert Bonczek, a blood spatter and serology expert, opined that the unique nature of the bloodstain on the grey sweatshirt precluded the possibility that it was caused by a hug, but rather concluded it directly spattered onto the sweatshirt, suggesting it was present during the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 116-17, 218-20.</p>

Dr. Hoffman testified that Leibig died as a result of exsanguination from some 30 stab wounds to her face, chin, head, neck, shoulder, and chest, some fatal and some nonfatal. <em>Id. </em>at 199-217. Dr. Hoffman noted in particular that one of the wounds, a c-shaped wound through Leibig’s jugular vein and carotid artery, would have been sufficient to cause her death. <em>Id. </em>He further indicated that <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>Leibig had sustained various defensive wounds, including wounds to her hands, and that she had sustained an abrasion on her face consistent with having her face pressed or rubbed against the vehicle’s console. <em>Id.</em>

The trial court held a hearing on the motion, primarily directed at the after-discovered evidence claim. At the hearing, Rittenhouse testified that, during their drug binge in May 2008, Grube and Appellant also went to her house. N.T., 10/13/2011, at 5. Rittenhouse further indicated that, afterward, Grube told her that he and Appellant attempted to rob Leibig, but the attempt failed, and that he helped Appellant get rid of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 6.

Appellant argues that the evidence at trial failed to conclusively establish his identity as the perpetrator. First, he suggests that Clyde Liddick’s comparison of the murder weapons to the knives recovered from his apartment held no evidentiary value. He suggests that, because Liddick had no knowledge of the number of similar knives in circulation, and because the second of Appellant’s knives had a slightly larger blade as compared to the murder weapon, his conclusion that the knives were of similar character and composition is invalid. Appellant contends that, on balance, Liddick’s testimony “proved only that a knife that may be a common household utensil was found in [Appellant’s] apartment” and that “it is far from reasonable that the murder weapons ... came from Appellant’s apartment.” Appellant’s Brief at 35.</p>

Moreover, the jury, as the arbiter of witness credibility, was entitled to credit Mr. Bonczek’s opinion over Appellant’s own testimony and discredit Appellant’s version of events. <em>See Cousar, supra. </em>Accordingly, we conclude the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain Appellant’s conviction for first-degree murder.</p>

As in <em>Montalvo, </em>and unlike in Spell, the Commonwealth presented significant evidence that Appellant sought to cause Leibig pain and suffering. Dr. Hoffman testified that, based on Leibig’s defensive wounds and her lack of heart, brain, or central nervous system injury, she was alive and conscious for the entirety of the 2 to 15 minute attack, during which Appellant inflicted nearly 30 fatal and nonfatal wounds to her face, neck, head, shoulder, and chest, as she bled out in the backseat of her car. Moreover, both Dr. Hoffman and Robert Bonczek testified that, based on blood patterns in the car, Leibig at one point tried to escape her assailant, only to have her face pressed against the vehicle’s console. While Appellant correctly notes that there was no evidence as to the exact duration of the attack or the order in which the wounds were inflicted, neither of those inquiries are dispositive, but rather are merely factors worthy of consideration in the general inquiry of whether the assailant had the intent to cause pain and suffering as well as death. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
