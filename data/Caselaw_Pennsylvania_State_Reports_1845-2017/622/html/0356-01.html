Dr. Zakireh reasoned appellant portrayed characteristics receptive to treatment, but minimized his actions and underreported his level of sexual attraction to the victim in planning his behavior. During his initial 12-week orientation period in the program, appellant continued to deny sexual motivation for his conduct, which prevented him from successfully advancing in his treatment. Therefore, a therapeutic polygraph was administered to confront appellant with his disingenuous behavior and attempt to steer him back to proper treatment, which required he admit the sexual nature of his actions as established by the trial court’s conclusions of fact, reflected in his conviction. During a one and one-half-hour examination, appellant was asked ten questions, three of which were “relevant questions” designed to probe his sexual motivation for his offense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Each of the questions was reviewed word-for-word with appellant before the polygraph was administered, and each was asked in <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>different ways three times to assure accuracy.

It was determined appellant was engaged in cognitive distortions for the purpose of reasoning away his behavior and, thus, not making progress in his treatment. As a result, appellant was discharged from the program. Concluding appellant’s discharge from the program was a violation of his probation conditions, appellant’s probation officer filed a petition with the trial court. The trial court conducted a violation of probation (VOP) hearing, where it received the evidence outlined above, including the results of the therapeutic polygraph examination. Based on this evidence, the trial court found appellant violated his probation requirements, and it revoked his probation. Appellant was sentenced to another probationary term of three years and ordered to complete the sex offender program, including polygraph examinations administered to monitor his compliance.</p>

The court further noted concerns regarding potential violations of appellant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination were not present because the polygraph was used to underscore the fact appellant was not yet fully amenable to treatment — a requirement of his probationary sentence — due to his persistent denials of the sexual gratification component of his criminal activity. <em>Id.; cf.

While appellant recognizes his obligation to take the therapeutic polygraph, he asserts the results should only be used as part of therapy and treatment. Thus, he argues the trial court erred by admitting the polygraph results into evidence and basing its determination he violated his probation on the same. The Commonwealth responds appellant’s therapeutic polygraph results were not accorded weight for any improper purpose as the results “were not ... offered for their accuracy or as substantive evidence of disputed facts, but to help explain the actions of the parties, and the treatment procedures.” Appellee’s Brief, at 39. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues, “excluding any reference to the therapeutic polygraph, there was more than sufficient evidence in the record to support [the court’s] finding that [appellant] was in violation of probation.” <em><a href="/pa/616/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="50 A.3d 122" data-case-ids="4208532,4209907,7311996,7312003" data-case-paths="/pa/616/0469-01,/pa/616/0468-02,/a3d/50/0122-01,/a3d/50/0122-02">Id.</a> </em>Concerning the Superior Court’s enumerated conditions of admissibility, the Commonwealth argues the second and third conditions are irrelevant given that appellant has not alleged a Fifth Amendment violation, and constitute an incorrect statement of law. As for the first condition, the Commonwealth suggests therapeutic polygraph examination results should be offered only to help explain “the actions of the parties, the treatment procedures that are conditions of the defendant’s parole or probation, and the recommendations of the treating and supervising professionals[,]” not “as an independent basis for finding or not finding a violation of parole or probation.” <em>Id., </em>at 46.</p>

Moreover, in <em>Gee, </em>this Court considered whether the trial court erred in excluding the defendant’s polygraph results from evidence <em>at trial </em>and concluded the case was not an appropriate vehicle to reconsider our established precedent regarding the insufficient reliability of polygraph examination results as evidence in criminal cases. <em>Gee, </em>at 883-84. Thus, the language cited by the dissent and appellant is limited by <em>Gee’s </em>facts to the admissibility of polygraphs at trial and is not controlling precedent for this case. While the general rule has been polygraph results are inadmissible, the cases from which this general rule stems are factually distinguishable, and this Court has never decided the issue at <em>hand </em>— ie., whether the results of polygraph tests may be introduced at VOP hearings. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The record supports the Commonwealth’s contention that appellant’s polygraph results were offered, not for the truth of whether appellant received sexual gratification from his act, but to help explain the program’s actions and treatment procedures. That appellant’s refusal to admit his sexual motivation for making the videotapes reflected a lack of candor was established at trial when the court discredited appellant’s testimony and found him guilty of the offense charged. The polygraph evidence was simply offered by the Commonwealth to assist the court in <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>attaining a full picture of why appellant was dismissed from treatment. <em>See </em>N.T. Violation of Probation Hearing, 1/5/09, at 4-5 (reflecting counsel’s statement appellant did not violate probation based on failed polygraph but “because he refused to admit that the acts here were done for sexual gratification[,]” followed by court’s response, “Exactly”). This information helped establish the somewhat collateral point that those administering the program had tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to keep appellant in the rehabilitative regime. Thus, this case does not implicate the general reservations and concerns expressed concerning the admissibility of polygraph evidence into evidence, as appellant’s results were proffered not for their accuracy, but to help explain the actions of others involved.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

We do not reach the Superior Court’s conclusion that therapeutic polygraph examination results cannot serve as the sole basis for probation revocation. The value to be accorded to evidence is a matter for the fact-finder with a well-settled appellate standard of review. Appellant’s probation violation was supported by testimony from several treatment specialists involved in his therapy in addition to the results of his therapeutic polygraph, and we decline to require specific types of evidence in every case. In addition, we state no opinion regarding the Superior Court’s Fifth Amendment analysis, <em>see A.R., </em>at 7 (citations omitted); such is unnecessary as appellant has not alleged a Fifth Amendment violation.</p>

It is worth noting in this respect that this Court has previously applied the prohibition within the civil context, where the same preponderance standard obtains as in the violation-of-probation setting. <em>See, e.g., DeVito v.

Perhaps the technology has improved in recent years, but it is impossible for this Court to discern the existence of any such developments on the record before us. More generally, to the extent a proponent of polygraph evidence might seek its admission by claiming that newer technology is more trustworthy, such a claim would be subject to vetting according to recognized standards pertaining to novel scientific evidence, most notably, the standard articulated in <em>Frye v.
