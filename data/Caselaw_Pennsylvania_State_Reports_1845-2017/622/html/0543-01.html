Because the appellant in this matter has not set an appropriate stage for either pillar of such review, the <em>Teague </em>line of analysis remains the appropriate default litmus governing the present appeal.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[173,604,1150,1362]]]'>Here, we find the application of this analysis to be fairly straightforward. Initially, we reject Appellant’s position that the <em>Miller </em>Court’s reversal of the state appellate court decision affirming the denial of post-conviction relief in the <em>Jackson </em>case compels the conclusion that <em>Miller </em>is retroactive. In the first instance, it is not clear that the issue was even placed before the Court, and, as the Commonwealth observes, the Supreme Court need not entertain questions of retroactive application where the government has not raised it. <em>See Goeke, </em><a href="/us/514/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="514 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="1340327" data-case-paths="/us/514/0115-01">514 U.S. at 117</a>, <a href="/us/514/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="514 U.S. 115" data-case-ids="1340327" data-case-paths="/us/514/0115-01">115 S.Ct. at 1276</a>; <em>cf.

Whether the matter was waived or, as the Commonwealth contends, remained available to be asserted on remand is of no moment here, since the United States Supreme Court has made clear enough that <em>Teague </em>determinations are not inherently implicit in all new constitutional rulings implemented by that Court. <em>But see Williams, </em><a href="/citations/?q=367%20Ill.%20Dec.%20503" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="367 Ill.

Any such Eighth Amendment extension of existing federal retroactivity law, in my view, should only come from the U.S. Supreme Court.

The PCRA’s eligibility provisions speak of convictions or sentences resulting from violations of existing law. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2). Thus, subsection (a)(2)(vi) speaks of “the imposition of a sentence greater than the lawful maximum.” When appellant’s sentence was imposed, it was lawful. Appellant’s collateral sentencing claim depends upon <em>Miller </em>being deemed globally retroactive. The only court that can render a definitive answer on that federal question is the U.S. Supreme Court. Until that Court holds that <em>Miller </em>has such an effect, appellant’s LWOP sentence cannot be deemed to be one greater than the lawful maximum.</p>

Thus, Section 9545(b) recognizes that new constitutional rights (state or federal) may come into existence after a sentence is final, and indeed, after a defendant’s right to PCRA review has been exhausted. The statute allows new constitutional rights to be vindicated, but only after the Court announcing the new right has also held that the right operates retroactively: “the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(iii). This safety valve for vindication of new and retroactive rights is logically limited to pronouncements from the two courts of last resort that can recognize new rights and makes clear that the court of last resort announcing the new right should also issue the holding on the retroactivity of the new right. There is nothing irrational in the statute’s accommodation of new constitutional rules in this manner. Under the construct, appellant’s federal constitutional claim is, at best, premature; and his assumption that this Court can substitute for the U.S. Supreme Court in rendering the retroactivity holding is erroneous, where this Court did not announce the “right” at issue.</p>

As the Majority notes, the High Court has recognized that state courts can go further — as a matter of state law — than is commanded by federal law in implementing new federal constitutional rules. <em>See, e.g., Danforth v. Minnesota, </em><a href="/us/552/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="169" data-cite="552 U.S. 264" data-case-ids="3675901" data-case-paths="/us/552/0264-01">552 U.S. 264</a>, 282, <a href="/us/552/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="170" data-cite="552 U.S. 264" data-case-ids="3675901" data-case-paths="/us/552/0264-01">128 S.Ct. 1029</a>, <a href="/us/552/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="171" data-cite="552 U.S. 264" data-case-ids="3675901" data-case-paths="/us/552/0264-01">169 L.Ed.2d 859</a> (2008).

No such developed argument for a broader Pennsylvania approach to retroactivity is forwarded and developed here; appellant’s position on retroactivity is premised solely upon federal law, and our Court remains properly reluctant to ignore the PCRA’s approach to new rights, and to go beyond the affirmative commands of the U.S. Supreme Court, in the absence of a legislative policy directive or some grounded basis in Pennsylvania law. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The restriction on parole opportunities in Pennsylvania is not a function of the Crimes Code, which establishes the appropriate term of a sentence, but rather is dictated by relevant provisions of the Commonwealth’s Prisons and Parole Code, specifically those which govern the authority of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 61 Pa.C.S. §§ 6101-6153, and which the General Assembly may certainly amend. <em>Cf.
