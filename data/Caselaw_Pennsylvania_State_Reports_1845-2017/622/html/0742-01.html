    <p id="b787-8" data-blocks='[["BL_787.8",787,[175,1250,1151,309]]]'>AND NOW, this 20th day of November, 2013, the order of the Commonwealth Court is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED to the Commonwealth Court for transfer to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, in accord with the provisions contained within 42 Pa.C.S. § 5103(a) and Pa. R.C.P. 213(f).</p>
    <p id="b787-9" data-blocks='[["BL_787.9",787,[173,1606,1150,473]]]'>In brief, Appellant filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court against the Department of Corrections (DOC), alleging that his confinement at the State Correctional Institution at Albion (SCI-Albion) was illegal due to an alleged failure of SCI-Albion to produce a written sentencing order related to the judgment of sentence entered against him on February 14, 2010, as allegedly required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9764(a)(8). This section of the Sentencing Code provides in relevant part:</p>

    <p id="b788-5" data-blocks='[["BL_788.5",788,[279,611,1153,470]]]'>When SCI-Albion failed to produce Appellant’s sentencing order, Appellant initially sought through the prison’s internal grievance process his outright release from SCI-Albion or, as an alternative, a return to Philadelphia County, and monetary damages. Upon his inmate grievances being denied, Appellant filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, seeking the same. In a <em>per curiam </em>order, the Commonwealth Court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the petition for review for want of jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b788-6" data-blocks='[["BL_788.6",788,[279,1108,1151,844]]]'>While we express no opinion regarding the merits of Appellant’s claims, he initially and principally is testing “the legality of [his] commitment and detention,” and therefore his petition for review sounded in <em>habeas corpus.

Hendrick, </em><a href="/pa/444/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="444 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1938564" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0083-01">444 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=280%20A.2d%20110" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="280 A.2d 110">280 A.2d 110</a>, 112 (1971); <em>see also Warren v.

To the extent the Commonwealth Court found that it did not possess jurisdiction over such a matter, it was correct. 42 Pa.C.S. § 761(a)(l)(i) (providing that the Commonwealth Court does not have original jurisdiction over matters sounding in <em>habeas corpus </em>unless ancillary to a pending appellate proceeding). Rather, matters sounding in <em>habeas corpus </em>lie in the jurisdiction and venue of the court of record from which the order of detention came. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6502.</p>

    <p id="b789-5" data-blocks='[["BL_789.5",789,[165,831,1151,797]]]'>As noted above, Appellant’s petition for review sounded in <em>habeas corpus, </em>and therefore it is properly addressed in the court of record from which his judgment of sentence originated, specifically, the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6502. Accordingly, given that a “proper tribunal of this Commonwealth” exists in which to consider Appellant’s claims, the Commonwealth Court should not have dismissed the petition for review, but rather transferred the matter to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5103(a). We therefore vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing Appellant’s petition, and remand this matter to the Commonwealth Court for transfer to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas in accord with the mandates of 42 Pa.C.S. § 5103(a) and Pa. R.C.P. 213(f).</p>
