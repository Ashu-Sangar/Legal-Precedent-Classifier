    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.5",444,[278,454,1151,420]]]'>The issue in this appeal is whether the sentencing court properly ordered a convicted defendant, as a condition of probation, to pay amounts representing child support to the children of the victim of the defendant’s crime (here, voluntary manslaughter). The Superior Court held that such a condition was not permitted as a matter of law, vacated the sentencing court’s order and remanded for resentencing. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm on different grounds.</p>
    <p id="b444-6" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[278,900,1149,623]]]'>In 2004, appellee Andre Hall was romantically involved with Tamisha Towson. The two had an infant son together, but Towson remained in contact with her former husband, Jonathan Williams, with whom Towson also had two children, who were then three and five years old. Williams apparently supported his children with Towson financially, but there was not a formal agreement in place. The relationship between Towson and Williams remained amicable, with Williams visiting his children at Towson’s residence on North 64th Street near Haverford Avenue in Philadelphia frequently, even daily. However, the relationship between Williams and appellee was strained.</p>

Towson initially said no, but after two more phone calls, Towson agreed to let Williams visit and appellee began getting dressed to leave. When appellee reached his car outside, a confrontation began with Williams, who was already in the neighborhood when he phoned Towson. During the encounter, Williams evidently walked up to appellee’s driver’s side window and reached behind his back which, appellee claimed, led him to believe that Williams might pull a firearm and shoot him. Appellee then shot Williams multiple times with a firearm for which he had a permit. Towson came out of the house, saw that Williams had been shot, and drove Williams to nearby Lankenau Hospital, where Williams was pronounced dead at 7:30 <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>a.m. from three gunshot wounds; the post-mortem medical examination determined that the fatal shot was fired from about two feet away and pierced Williams’s liver and the bottom of his heart. Later that day, appellee surrendered to the Philadelphia police and was charged with murder generally and possession of an instrument of crime.</p>
    <p id="b445-4" data-blocks='[["BL_445.4",445,[189,646,1152,406]]]'>Appellee testified at his jury trial and claimed that he shot Williams in self-defense. He was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2503(b) (unreasonable belief of self-defense), and was acquitted of possession of an instrument of crime. On September 20, 2005, the Honorable M. Teresa Sarmina sentenced appellee to five to ten years of imprisonment, to be followed by ten years of reporting probation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The court also stated:</p>

So, when you’re paroled and you’re working, part of what I’m ordering is that as long as you’re on my sentence that you will also be contributing for the support of the other two children.

The Superior Court determined that neither the record nor the trial court’s Rule 1925(a) opinion explained with sufficient clarity whether the court intended the sums to be paid by appellee to be part of his “sentence of restitution or as a condition of probation or both, or the legal basis for such an order.” In light of the ambiguity, the Superior Court remanded to the trial court with instructions to “clarify the record and address [appellee’s] sentencing claim.” Super.

    <p id="AOc" data-blocks='[["BL_447.2",447,[197,906,1153,1259]]]'>On remand, the trial court held new sentencing proceedings on August 6, 2007. Appellee argued that imposition of child support as restitution was improper because it was oriented to the future, and therefore was speculative, whereas monetary probation conditions such as restitution are intended to compensate for past harm. The Commonwealth responded that if the child support obligation was characterized as a condition of probation, then the imposition of “future” support for the victim’s children, based upon appellee’s ability to pay once he was released from incarceration, was not improper. After hearing both sides, the court stated that the child support obligation would stand as a condition of probation for rehabilitative purposes. N.T., 8/6/07, at 7-11, 22-23; Tr. Ct. Order, 8/6/07. The court further stated that the payments would be based on appellee’s “ability to pay” and that the amount would be “no less than $100 per child per month.” The court further stated: “And if you are not able to pay that, then that will be brought to my attention or to the attention of the probation department. Actually, that’s going to be supervised. The supervision is going to be under the county supervision.” N.T., 8/6/07, at 23. The court also added an order of restitution to the Victim Compensation Program in the amount of $3,583, which had been paid to the victim’s family for funeral expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

      <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>Upon appellee’s further appeal, the trial court filed a second opinion. Citing <em>Commonwealth v. Harner, </em><a href="/pa/533/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="533 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1837511" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0014-01">533 Pa. 14</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="533 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1837511" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0014-01">617 A.2d 702</a>, 707 (1992), the court explained that a sentencing court’s discretion to fashion conditions of probation, including financial obligations, is broad, particularly when a condition is designed to rehabilitate the defendant, provide the defendant with an understanding of the cruelty of his conduct, deter him from future criminal conduct, steer him towards a more responsible and law-abiding life, and provide some measure of redress to his victims. The court stated that imposition of child support was appropriate here “[d]ue to the unique intertwinement of the three children who would all be living in the same household” (Towson’s children with both appellee and Williams). Tr. Ct. Op., 5/12/08, at 4. The court found it “singularly unfair” that upon release, appellee would be able to provide for his own child with Towson without being similarly compelled to provide some support to Williams’s children, whom appellee had deprived of their father. The support payments, the court explained, were intended to “level the field [appellee] had disrupted when he killed the other children’s father.” The court also rejected appellee’s alternative argument that imposing child support was an abuse of discretion, and that the trial court had improperly failed to make findings about the victim’s history of supporting his children, and his future ability to continue doing so. Finally, the court rejected appellee’s argument that the child support order was invalid because it did not take into account his ability to pay upon release from prison. The court stated that its order was indeed based on appellee’s ability to pay, and a “hearing to determine the defendant’s financial ability to pay can be held after the defendant is released from prison.” Tr. Ct. Op., 5/12/08, at 3-6.</p>

The majority noted as well that sentencing courts have relatively broad discretion when, as here, restitution is imposed as a condition of probation rather than as part of a defendant’s direct sentence, and when it is intended to rehabilitate a defendant. However, the majority determined that, in this case “the true purpose behind the order was clearly to support the decedent’s children and not to rehabilitate [appellee].” <em>Id. </em>at 417, 80 A.3d at 1145 (emphasis in original).</p>

The court further noted that there had been no finding that Williams had been providing financial support for his children prior to his death, and the sentencing court also <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>did not explain how it had arrived at the amount of the award.

Judge Allen contrasted this discretionary power with the strict wording of 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106, which governs imposition of restitution as part of a defendant’s direct sentence: “Upon conviction for any crime ... wherein the victim suffered personal injury directly resulting from the crime, the offender shall be sentenced to make restitution in addition to the punishment prescribed therefor.” To Judge Allen, the Section 1106 mandate that restitution be made to the actual direct victim is not present in Section 9754(c)(8), and because the two statutes deal with a similar subject matter, the disparity suggests a different legislative intent — specifically that under Section 9754, “third persons,” such as a homicide victim’s dependent children, need not be excluded as potential recipients of probationary restitution. <a href="/a2d/994/1141-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="994 A.2d 1141" data-case-ids="7291073" data-case-paths="/a2d/994/1141-01">994 A.2d at </a>1146^18 (Allen, J., dissenting).</p>

The dissent noted that the Crime Victims Act broadly defines crime “victims” who may recover economically under the statute, as encompassing “[a] family member of a homicide victim, including stepbrothers or stepsisters, stepchildren, stepparents or a fiance____” 18 P.S. §§ 11.103, 11.701(a). The dissent reasoned that if a murder victim’s children are eligible for compensation of claims under the Crime Victims Act, there is no basis in law to deny them eligibility for restitution as a condition of probation in a case like this because the loss of parental support amounts to a “fruit” of the defendant’s killing the parent. Thus, the dissent <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>did not agree that in this case the requisite connection between defendant and ’victim had to be strictly direct (as in 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106) because the nexus between the crime and the loss sustained by the victim’s children was close enough that restitution in the form of a child support obligation was permissible. The dissent also accepted the sentencing court’s explanation that the child support condition served a rehabilitative purpose. <a href="/a2d/994/1141-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="994 A.2d 1141" data-case-ids="7291073" data-case-paths="/a2d/994/1141-01">994 A.2d at 1148-50</a>.</p>

Echoing Judge Allen’s dissent below, the Commonwealth compares Section 9754 with the more stringent language in 18 Pa.C.S. § 1106, which governs restitution as part of a direct sentence.

The Commonwealth argues that the mere fact that the sentencing court’s order intended to serve two purposes simultaneously— benefitting Williams’s children as victims of appellee’s crime and fostering appellee’s rehabilitation by imposing ongoing accountability upon his release — did not invalidate the order.

Appellee suggests that the sentencing court here intended to impose a punitive child support obligation upon him and then devised a <em>post hoe </em>rationale for doing so. Appellee further asserts that even if the court’s explanation that its order was intended to be a rehabilitative condition of probation is legitimate, the order itself was still unauthorized. To appellee, part of the problem is the speculative nature of the order, because no effort was made to determine whether $100 per child per month was equivalent to the support that Williams actually had provided for his children prior to his death, or would have provided into the future had he survived. Appellee adds that even under the “relaxed nexus analysis” used when financial restitution is imposed as a condition of probation, an order requiring child support for a homicide victim’s children is too indirect to be valid. Appellee notes that he has not contested the sentencing court’s order to pay the Crime Victims Compensation Fund for the expenses it incurred regarding Williams’s funeral because, in appellee’s estimation, “that is clearly proper restitution” aimed at compensating, to the extent possible, the actual victim of his crime.

As described in subsection (e)(8), monetary conditions of probation may be for the purpose of “restitution” or “to make reparations” for the loss or damage caused by the crime, but they must be limited to an amount the defendant “can afford to pay.” Obviously, Section 9754 does not expressly include the type of restitution imposed as a condition of probation here — future financial support to a homicide victim’s surviving minor children.

The legal definition of “restitution” is: “[c]ompensation of a loss; esp., full or partial compensation paid by a criminal to a victim, ... ordered as part of a criminal sentence or as a condition of probation.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1839 (8th ed. 2004).
