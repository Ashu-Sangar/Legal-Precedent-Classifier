The Commonwealth charged Appellant, a minor, with the delin<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>quent offenses of possession of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant filed a motion to suppress. At the suppression hearing, Officer William Hunter testified that at 7:00 p.m. on September 18, 2007, he was conducting a narcotics surveillance of Chris Glover. Glover engaged in a hand-to-hand transaction with one male who left the scene. Alex Turner and Appellant then approached Glover. All three engaged in conversation. Turner gave money to Glover, who then retrieved items from a baggie and handed them to Turner. Turner and Appellant then left the area. Officer Hunter then radioed for backup officers A.C. Frames and Anthony Jackson to stop Turner. Officer Hunter learned that the other officers recovered from Appellant’s purse a large ziplock baggie containing a large white chunky substance, which was later determined to contain 29 grams of crack cocaine. After a lengthy conversation among counsel and the court, it became clear that the officer who actually seized the items from Appellant and arrested her was not present for the suppression hearing. Officer Hunter did not witness the seizure of the contraband or Appellant’s arrest.</p>

Argument initially centered on the extent to which an arresting officer may rely for probable cause on the observations of an officer conducting surveillance. Appellant’s counsel also argued that the officers needed a warrant to search Appellant’s purse, and that Officer Hunter “does not know exactly where the items were recovered.” Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 12/24/07, at 25-26. Appellant’s counsel generally argued that the search of Appellant’s purse was conducted without a warrant, probable cause, or reasonable suspicion. After additional off-the-record argument, the court denied the motion, reasoning that Officer Hunter’s observations of Appellant, Turner, and Glover provided probable cause to search Appellant’s purse:</p>

Appellant did cross-examine Officer Hunter concerning the fact that Appellant’s consent to the search of the purse was not in “the police paperwork.” <em>Id. </em>at 33. Shortly thereafter, the court adjudicated Appellant delinquent of possession with intent to deliver, and not guilty of simple possession. Appellant was ordered to serve a term of probation.</p>

Appellant argues that a general rule limiting suppression issues to the suppression record is consistent with the rules of juvenile and criminal procedure, and necessary to the orderly administration of justice. Appellant urges that it was particularly unfair for reviewing courts to rely on Officer Jackson’s trial testimony in this case, where the trial court precluded Appellant from cross-examining Officer Jackson concerning Appellant’s alleged consent to search her purse, on the ground that the suppression phase of the case was over. Finally, Appellant maintains that if the juvenile court is to consider post-suppression evidence to support the suppression finding, then fundamental fairness requires that the court do so by formally opening the suppression record and allowing a full hearing thereon. Otherwise, Appellant asserts, a defendant could be “blindsided” when he learns, for the first time after the notice of appeal has been filed, that certain trial evidence was actually used to justify the suppres<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>sion decision.

Next, the Commonwealth argues that the <em>Chacho </em>rule “conforms to the well established principle that a case can be affirmed for any reason appearing <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>on the record.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 13. The Commonwealth further avers that the purpose of suppression is to deter police misconduct and to protect a defendant’s privacy-interests; if the record as a whole reflects that the police acted lawfully, then suppression would be unjustified. The Commonwealth urges that “practicalities” militate in favor of the <em>Chacko </em>rule: suppression motions are often vague, so suppression hearings do not always develop all of the available evidence; moreover, police officers are occasionally unavailable for suppression hearings, so those officers should be able to supplement the record with trial evidence tending to show that an item at issue was properly seized. The Commonwealth contends that the rules of criminal and juvenile procedure do not preclude the use of the <em>Chacho </em>rule, because those rules do not speak to an appellate court’s scope of review of a suppression ruling. Finally, the Commonwealth argues that Appellant’s claim of being blindsided by the use of trial evidence in support of the suppression ruling is “absurd,” because “the world has been on notice” since at least 1983 that the <em>Chacko </em>rule applies in Pennsylvania. Commonwealth’s Brief at 20. The Commonwealth also dismisses Appellant’s claim that she was precluded from cross-examining Officer Jackson on the consent issue.</p>

Those concerns are particularly serious in the instant case, where a Commonwealth witness testified for the first time at trial that Appellant consented to the search of her purse. While Appellant managed a small degree of cross-examination on this issue, the trial court largely cut off this line of inquiry because the suppression phase of the case was over. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/24/07, at 31-38. Moreover, the witness who would have been in the best position to rebut the Commonwealth’s new evidence on the issue of consent was Appellant herself, but testifying at trial would have required her to give up her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. As Appellant notes, she is protected from having to make this choice. <em>See Simmons, <a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">supra </a></em><a href="/us/390/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="390 U.S. 377" data-case-ids="6170914" data-case-paths="/us/390/0377-01">note 4</a>.</p>

Despite what we today hold was <em>dicta </em>in <em>Chacho, </em>we believe that our rules of procedure give defendants ample reasonable basis for concluding that once the suppression hearing is closed, the court’s suppression ruling (and, necessarily, the court’s assessment of the facts undergirding that ruling) is final, conclusive, and binding.

That ruling, <em>a fortiori, </em>is based not on trial testimony, but rather on findings of fact and conclusions of law as expressed at the time of the suppression hearing. In short, defendants should not be forced to speculate that any evidence being introduced at trial may also impact the suppression landscape.

Appellant’s broader point, however, is that <em>Simmons </em>recognized a defendant's right to testify in support of a suppression motion without giving up the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Our own Rules of Criminal Procedure make the point explicitly. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(H) ("the defendant may testify at [a suppression] hearing, and if the defendant does testify, the defendant does not thereby waive the right to remain silent at trial."). According to Appellant, defendants run the risk of being forced to give up that Fifth Amendment right if they feel compelled to testify at trial in order to counter new Commonwealth evidence that may be ultimately admitted for suppression purposes. As in this case, the only effective practical way for Appellant to confront Officer Jackson’s claim of consent would have been by testifying at trial, which she is constitutionally protected from having to do. Appellant proposes that if new trial evidence is to be introduced for suppression purposes, the court should pause the trial and formally re-open the suppression hearing, so that the defendant may testify freely there, without giving up her right against self-incrimination.

Moreover, going forward, if a party (or, indeed, both parties by consent) wishes to take the unusual step of augmenting the suppression record with trial evidence, it should do so explicitly, on the basis that the new trial evidence was previously unavailable. Such an explicit motion has several salutary purposes. First, it gives the trial court the opportunity to re-open the suppression hearing to consider the new evidence outside the presence of the jury. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(F) (suppression hearing "shall be held outside the presence of the jury.”) In this re-opened hearing, the trial court would have the opportunity to determine whether the trial evidence was truly unavailable, an issue which may well be ancillary to the issues raised in the trial on the merits. Second, it gives the defendant a meaningful opportunity to formulate and present a defense to the new evidence, whether by cross-examination or by direct testimony, without concern that such a defense would waive the defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>See supra </em>note 4; <em>see also </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(H) ("the defendant may testify at [a suppression] hearing, and if the defendant does testify, the defendant does not thereby waive the right to remain silent at trial.”). Third, it gives the trial court an opportunity to announce new specific findings of fact and conclusions of law as <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(1), all of which are critical to later appellate review.

As the prosecution had the obligation to present its case at the hearing, absent extraordinary circumstances, the trial court should not reopen the matter during trial — the general rule must be that the decision on the suppression motion must be reviewed based on the suppression record. However, the court must have the power to reopen the record to avoid manifest injustice. If the defendant or witnesses testified contrary to their suppression testimony, or adduced contrary evidence to the evidence that was suppressed, a court should, on motion, be permitted to reopen the record and reconsider its decision if the new evidence so warrants.</p>
    <p id="b198-7" data-blocks='[["BL_198.7",198,[299,1920,1149,259]]]'>(4) Finally, we have the present situation where suppression has been denied, and new evidence supporting denial is adduced. For the court to consider it, <em>sua sponte, </em>in post-trial review, the defense must have the opportunity to vet the new evidence in a manner consistent with the suppression hearing.</p>

Denying the defendant cross-examination was not the only problem. She could call witnesses to dispute Officer Jackson’s testimony. She could, at a suppression hearing, contest the factual basis without giving up her right against self-incrimination — at the hearing, she could testify she gave no such consent, and her testimony would not be used against her at trial.</p>

Remember, the defense challenged only probable cause, a matter which was solely within the ken of Officer Hunter. The failure to call Officer Jackson, while it could have made the issue of probable cause irrelevant, is therefore not a shortcoming at all. Rule 581(D) requires the suppression motion set forth the grounds for suppression “specifically and with particularity.” While perhaps honored in the breach, the allegation here was a lack of probable cause. The prosecution has the burden of proof, but the defense frames the question of what must be proven.</p>
    <p id="b199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_199.6",199,[179,1618,1150,744]]]'>Recall also that the prosecution had a favorable decision on the probable cause issue — whether Officer Jackson was available or not, there was no reason whatsoever to call him. To make consideration of his testimony dependent on his availability is illogical and of no constitutional value. Availability may be worth considering in a case where it is alleged the prosecution should have called him but did not, but here his testimony was not pertinent to the issue raised by the defense — there being no basis for calling him, his availability is irrelevant. Unavailability may be a justification for not calling him, but it is not the only justification, as the present case shows — as such, I see no reason in logic or constitutional protocol to make it a required precursor to consideration at this stage.</p>

Likewise, if proof adduced at trial establishes a lawful search or seizure, the evidence should not be excluded simply because the proof at the suppression hearing did not establish its legality. This is particularly true in light of the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule which is to deter police misconduct. <em>State v. Huddleston, </em><a href="/sw2d/924/0666-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="924 S.W.2d 666" data-case-ids="10022295" data-case-paths="/sw2d/924/0666-01">924 S.W.2d 666</a>, 676 (Tenn.1996). Suppressing evidence lawfully seized simply because the legality of the seizure was established by proof introduced at trial, rather than proof introduced at the suppression hearing, in no way furthers the purpose of the rule and could perhaps be inimical to prudent law enforcement practices.</blockquote>
