Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (“the PCRA court”) granted Elliott a new trial on the following grounds: (1) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to prepare for trial or interview Elliott in person prior to trial; and (2) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the medical examiner’s testimony regarding the estimated time of the victim’s death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The PCRA court denied Elliott <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>relief on his remaining claims.

To facilitate an understanding of the issues raised, we reiterate those facts necessary to disposition of the matter before us. On May 7, 1992, Elliott, who is African-American, and Frank Nardone socialized with Kimberly Griffith (“the victim”), who is Caucasian, at an after-hours nightclub in Philadelphia.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> At around 4:00 a.m., the victim left the club with Elliott and Nardone, and proceeded to Nardone’s house.

Elliott explained that he had consensual sex with the victim in the early hours of the morning, and had left Nardone’s home while the victim was alive. During the interview, police observed and photographed several scratch marks on Elliott’s arms and body and a discolored bruise in the pattern of a straight line on the back of his right hand, which suggested that an item may have been wrapped tightly around it. Elliott indicated that the victim made one of the scratch marks during sexual intercourse, and did not explain the others. It was not until more than a year later, after <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>Elliott was suspected of committing sexual assaults on other young white women, that he was arrested in connection with the instant murder.</p>

I do have the Defendant’s statement, which I reviewed thoroughly. He has reviewed it thoroughly. If there is anything he can add, he can tell me.

Further, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of the medical examiner who had performed an autopsy on the victim’s body. The medical examiner testified that the victim had been beaten and ultimately strangled by an electrical cord; that the victim had injuries to her vagina and anus, indicative of forced sexual penetration; and that the victim <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>had survived for thirty to sixty minutes after the attack.

At the time of the trial in this case, Elliott had been convicted of indecent assault in the Cardinal matter; had been charged with assaulting Berson, but trial had not yet occurred; and had not yet been criminally charged with assaulting Gogos. Approximately one month before this trial commenced, trial counsel had represented Elliott at the Cardinal assault trial, during which evidence of Elliott’s assaults on Gogos and Berson had been admitted over trial counsel’s objection. <em>Commonwealth v.

Significantly, the Commonwealth called the medical examiner to testify on rebuttal that, based on her investigator’s notes regarding lividity of the body, she estimated the time of death between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. On cross-examination, the medical examiner conceded that the victim could have died as late as 10:00 a.m. Elliott testified on redirect that he was unsure when he had left Nardone’s residence on the morning of the murder.</p>

The court relied on this Court’s decision in <em>Brooks, </em>and cited the trial court’s comments regarding counsel’s lack of preparedness in connection with the Commonwealth’s presentation of prior bad acts evidence. <em>See </em>PCRA Court Opinion, Oct. 13, 2010, at 6 n.3 (citing the following two comments by the trial court judge: (1) “In the event of a conviction here, the defendant might have a good argument about the preparation of this case ...

Regarding the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness standard, the PCRA court did not suggest what information a more thorough pre-trial interview would have revealed that would have altered trial counsel’s performance or affected the outcome of Elliott’s trial. Rather, the PCRA court concluded that Elliott was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to interview him prior to trial because “in order to prepare a defense to a charge of murder in the first degree, it is essential that at the very least, counsel meet with his client in person to, <em>inter alia, </em>gather information from the client, evaluate the client’s demeanor, and try to establish a working relationship.” <em><a href="/pa/576/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="839 A.2d 245" data-case-ids="16768,9057003" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0332-01,/a2d/839/0245-01">Id.</a> </em>(quoting <em>Brooks, </em>at 250).

Thus, the PCRA court concluded that it was error for the medical examiner to testify to a time of death that was not mentioned in her report and that was speculative because it was based on her investigator’s notes, which she did not possess while testifying. The court found it difficult to imag<a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>ine any reasonable basis for not objecting to inadmissible evidence placing Elliott at scene of the crime during the time the murder allegedly occurred. The PCRA court additionally held that Elliott was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to object because the case against him was purely circumstantial. It opined that if the jury believed Elliott’s testimony that he left at 10:00 a.m., the medical examiner’s testimony that the death occurred between 5:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. could have been a “crucial element in the jury’s decision-making.” <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>

It held that trial counsel was aware of the prior bad acts because he represented Elliott in the trials involving Iris Berson and Lynn Carlson, and received the statement of Barbara Gogos a week before she testified at Elliott’s murder trial. The court found that “[biased on the fact that defense counsel represented Elliott in two of the prior bad act witnesses’ trial, he had all of their statements, he thoroughly cross-examined each witness, and he called a separate witness to rebut Berson’s testimony, trial counsel thoroughly investigated Elliott’s prior bad acts.” <em>Id. </em>at 12.

The Commonwealth contends that, contrary to the PCRA court’s finding, the autopsy report did not designate the time of death as unknown. Rather, it asserts, the autopsy report noted “5/7/92 UNKNOWN” where the form inquired as to the “date of death” and “time of injury.” The report, in fact, made no reference to the victim’s time of death. It further submits that the section of the report in which the “unknown” notation was written described factual information of the victim, including name, address, age, and marital status, and did not set forth the examining doctor’s professional opinions. There is no inconsistency, the Commonwealth submits, between the medical examiner’s lack of factual knowledge of the specific hour the victim was injured, and the medical examiner’s ability, based on lividity of the victim’s body, to estimate a five-hour period during which the victim died. Having no factual basis for the claim, the Commonwealth concludes that no evidentiary hearing is required for us to conclude that the claim lacks arguable merit.</p>

It contends that the PCRA court’s reference to Pa.R.E. 705, which requires that “an expert must testify as to the facts or data on which the opinion or inference is based,” does not support a finding of counsel ineffectiveness. Not only was Pa.R.E. 705 adopted in 1998, after Elliott’s trial and direct appeal, the Commonwealth argues that the rule was clearly satisfied here because the medical examiner testified that the basis for her time-of-death estimation was her investigator’s lividity test. Further, the Commonwealth argues, treating the autopsy report as delineating the scope of permissible testimony misconstrues the nature of such report, which is not intended as a disclosure of expert testimony.

As noted, Nardone’s testimony established that Elliott was with the victim prior to the murder, Elliott’s sperm was found inside the victim after she had been brutally raped and beaten, and, significantly, Elliott had numerous scratches and bruises on his body, particularly a straight-line bruise on the back of his hand, which matched a similar bruise on the victim’s throat. According to the Commonwealth, such injury suggests that Elliott wrapped a cord around his hand and used the cord to strangle the victim. Moreover, considering Elliott’s recent history of violent sexual attacks on Lynn Cardinal, Barbara Gogos, and Iris Berson, the Commonwealth concludes there was overwhelming evidence that he committed the instant murder. Concluding that the claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness lacks merit, the Commonwealth contends that the PCRA court’s grant of a new trial based on the derivative claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness was clearly erroneous.</p>

      <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>The Commonwealth argues that the PCRA court properly-denied relief, although it appears to concede that the claim has not been previously litigated on direct appeal. Instead, the Commonwealth advocates that we deny relief on the basis that the claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness lacks arguable merit. The Commonwealth emphasizes that on direct appeal this Court held that: (1) the bad acts evidence was admitted properly to show a common scheme, plan or design, and to rebut Elliott’s suggestion that the victim’s injuries arose from “rough sex;” (2) the bad acts evidence was not unduly prejudicial; and, (3) the trial court had issued appropriate instructions explaining the limited use of the prior bad acts evidence. Considering these findings, the Commonwealth maintains, Elliott cannot now contend credibly that the admission of relevant evidence, which was more probative than prejudicial, was unfair, let alone so fundamentally unfair as to violate Elliott’s federal constitutional right to due process.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[284,1231,1151,734]]]'>The Commonwealth’s argument is sound.

Unlike the instant claim, Elliott’s challenges to the admission of prior bad acts evidence on direct appeal did not encompass a claim of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to challenge the evidence on federal due process grounds.

Hampering review of this claim is Elliott’s failure to distinguish between those assertions of prosecutorial misconduct to which trial counsel objected and/or appellate counsel pursued on direct appeal, and those assertions of prosecutorial misconduct to which no objection was lodged. Related thereto, Elliott fails to analyze independently the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard as it relates to each alleged deficiency in trial or appellate counsel’s performance. Such lack of development, in and of itself, could lead to rejection of the claim. <em>See Commonwealth v.

It explained that when the prosecutor said “good afternoon” to the victim’s family, along with the jury, judge, and defense counsel, such comment constituted a common courtesy and was not prejudicial to Elliott. The court also held that at no time did the prosecutor question Elliott’s belief regarding the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses or give the prosecutor’s personal opinion as to Elliott’s guilt or the credibility of his testimony. Regarding the particular comments that Elliott contended conveyed a lack of respect, the court ruled that such statements were “snarky” and “sarcastic,” <em>see </em>N.T., Oct. 27, 1994, at 94, 145, but did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct that is so prejudicial that the jury could not weigh the evidence objectively. As to Elliott’s contention that the prosecutor “testified” that Frank Nardone’s daughter was handicapped when he asserted such fact in a question posed to Elliott, the PCRA court found such comment to be irrelevant and not prejudicial. It further held that the questioning as to Elliott’s racial animus was not improper given the evidence that his prior attacks on the three prior bad act witnesses were racially motivated. <em>See </em>PCRA Opinion, Oct. 13, 2010, at 22 (“Elliott’s racial animus towards white women became part of the fabric of the case and the prosecutor’s questions regarding this prejudice were proper.”).</p>

But, the facts here show why <em>Brooks </em>should not be read in such an erroneous fashion. First, although counsel may not have met with appellee in person to discuss his upcoming trial for murder in this matter, counsel was well-acquainted with appellee. Counsel had just finished representing appellee in a rape trial one month prior to the trial here. Thus, he knew appellee, he had an opportunity to build a relationship with appellee, he knew appellee’s demeanor, and he was familiar with much of the “prior bad acts” evidence that the Commonwealth would use against appellee in the murder trial. Second, and relatedly, unlike the defendant in <em>Brooks, </em>appellee was not forced to represent himself because of a destruction in the attorney-client relationship arising from a failure of a lawyer to meet his client face-to-face prior to representing him. Counsel here had a reason not to meet with appellee, whom he knew from representing him in the very recent past. Notably, as explained by the Majority, appellee has not pointed to any action or inaction of counsel, arising from the failure to meet with him, or anything which would have changed the outcome of the proceedings.</p>

This case, and future failure-to-meet cases, may be properly analyzed under the long-standing framework announced in <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="146" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 975-76 (1987); therefore, it is unnecessary to afford capital defendants — based solely on their status as a capital defendant — the ability to bypass the requirement of demonstrating actual prejudice. <em>See Brooks, </em>at 255 (Eakin, J., concurring) (“[T]he constitution does not afford some lesser right to effective counsel on those charged with noncapital crimes. The right to counsel inures to the capital defendant, the felon, and the misdemeanant alike.”). Thus, I agree with the majority that appellee failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to meet with him face-to-face prior to trial. However, to the extent the majority would “save for another day the issue of whether, in a <em>post-Brooks </em>case, a new trial would be warranted [in a similar factual scenario,]” Majority Op. at 263 n.6, 80 A.3d at 431 n.6, I would analyze that case based solely on the defendant’s ability to demonstrate actual prejudice under <em>Pierce </em>and its progeny.</p>
