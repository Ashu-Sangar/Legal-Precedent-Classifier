Although suspicion immediately fell on Appellant, the police were initially unable to obtain sufficient evidence of Appellant’s guilt. In 1985, however, after Ex-wife separated from Appellant, she reported to the police that on the night of October 23,1978, Appellant had been driving the Buick the couple shared. She cleaned out the car on October 24,1978, as was her custom after Appellant drove the vehicle, and she made two important observations. First, she observed blood on the back of the front seat, on the interior of the roof, and on the back seat of the car. Second, she observed that the red and white quilt she kept in the car to cover the damaged back seat was missing. She was able to identify the quilt in which the victim’s body was found as the handmade quilt that was missing from the car. Appellant gave the car to a junkyard in the Spring of 1979 even though, according to Ex-wife’s subsequent testimony, nothing was apparently wrong with it.</p>

The Commonwealth again reviewed the circumstances surrounding the murder, and concluded that it still had insufficient evidence to prosecute Appellant successfully. Following this 1995 decision not to prosecute, prosecutors became aware of the statements from two jailhouse informants, Kermeth Wright and Samuel Tribuiani, who stated that Appellant confessed to them individually and at separate times that he killed the victim. Finally, with this new evidence, Appellant was arrested and charged with Victim’s murder on February 19,1997. The trial court appointed counsel to represent Appellant. Appointed counsel moved for the appointment of new counsel, asserting a conflict of interest premised on one of Appellant’s attorneys’ prior representation of one of the Commonwealth witnesses against Appellant, Kermeth Wright. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing.</p>

Ex-wife testified consistently with her prior statement to police that she and Appellant shared a car, that Appellant used the car the night the victim disappeared, and that the day after the disappearance, she observed “a lot” of blood in the car, specifically, on the back of the front seats, the back seat, and the interior roof. She testified that Appellant told her the blood came from a small abrasion on his knuckle.

Specifically, Victim’s Mother telephoned Appellant on October 25, 1978, looking for her daughter. Appellant explained that he left the tavern shortly after Victim left, and saw the victim hitchhiking with a young man. Appellant stated that he picked up the two hitchhikers, who indicated they were on their way to Saltsburg, Pennsylvania, and dropped them off in Clarksburg, Pennsylvania. Appellant added that Victim had <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>been running away from home. Unsatisfied with his response, Victim’s Mother drove to Appellant’s residence and confronted him.

Appellant repeated this explanation to police again in November and December, 1978, and January, 1979, explaining that after he dropped the hitchhikers off, he went straight home. Appellant did not mention attending the party at Mr. Hobart’s house.

The Commonwealth next offered the testimony of two witnesses who received correspondence from Appellant after he was arrested for the victim’s murder, and after he was aware that the Commonwealth had several witnesses who saw Appellant with Victim at Mr. Hobart’s house (thereby refuting his explanation that he dropped her off in Clarksburg and went home).</p>

Appellant explained that he believed his ex-wife asked her brothers to kill him because of a life insurance policy, and that the brothers attempted to comply while Appellant was driving Victim home after leaving Mr. Hobart’s party. He stated that as he was driving down a remote road, the Priest brothers, driving two separate cars, intercepted him, stopped his car, pulled him out of the vehicle, beat him until he was unconscious, left him to die, and when he awoke, the victim was gone. He believed they killed Victim because she witnessed the assault.

He admitted that his hitchhiker story was a lie. Instead, according to his trial testimony, after he left the tavern he saw two people hitchhiking, stopped to give them a ride, and recognized one of them as Victim. He testified that they asked for a ride to Clarksburg, but the victim changed her mind and asked instead for a ride to Mr. Hobart’s house. Appellant dropped off the male hitchhiker, and continued to Mr. Hobart’s house with Victim. Once there, according to Appellant, he decided to stay for a short while because he had something to discuss with Mr. Hobart. As he was leaving the party, Victim requested a ride home. Appellant complied, and, while Victim was a passenger in his car on a remote road, two vehicles, each driven by one of the Priest brothers, forced his car to stop; dragged him from his car; beat him with a club; left him unconscious in a ditch; and, when he regained consciousness, Victim was gone. Appellant maintained that the Priest brothers acted at the direction of Ex-wife, their sister. He further testified that when he awoke, he went to his mother’s house to tend to his injuries, thus attempting to explain the blood in the car. He stated that he did not reveal the truth before trial because the following morning, the brothers accosted him in the parking lot of a mall and told him that if he ever told anyone about the beating they would kill him and his family.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In the course of testifying, Appellant stated that he could never strike someone with a tire iron.</p>

We emphasize on remand that the question is not whether the jury would likely have reached a different verdict had the alleged impeachment evidence regarding Wright and Tribuiani’s credibility been disclosed, but whether, in the absence of the alleged impeachment evidence, [Appellant] got a fair trial worthy of confidence in the verdict. In its determination, the court must consider whether disclosure of the impeachment evidence to competent counsel would have made a different result reasonably probable. This will necessarily entail a review of all the evidence presented at trial, not for its sufficiency, but for the potential negative effect disclosure of the alleged impeachment evidence would have had thereon. For example, the impact of Sharon Pearson’s testimony regarding the quilt and her interactions with [Appellant] on the morning of October 24,1978, would undoubtedly have been completely unaffected by disclosure of the impeachment evidence casting doubt on the reliability of Wright and Tribuiani.

Moreover, the court considered Appellant’s recitation of the subsequent beating by the Priest brothers as absurd, because Appellant asked the jury to believe that as Appellant and the victim were driving down a remote road, their travel was impeded by two vehicles driven by Larry and Gary Priest, who had somehow become aware of Appellant’s unexpected detour down a remote road at that precise time, and who dragged Appellant from the car and beat him so severely that his head was “split open,” although Appellant could not explain why no one observed this head wound or any other injuries in the hours and days following this event.</p>

Instead, he continued to live with Ex-wife for several more years, allegedly because the morning after the beating the Priest <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>brothers somehow knew of his movements, accosted him in the parking lot of the mall, threatened to kill his entire family, including, apparently, their sister, Ex-wife, who had arranged the assault, if he revealed the beating to anyone, and thereby assured his silence until he was charged with Victim’s murder nineteen years later in 1997. Appellant made no attempt to resolve the incongruity of harboring concern for the safety of the woman whom he believed had instigated his attempted murder.

The appellant argued that he was guilty of theft, but not robbery, because he decided to steal from the victim after he killed her. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3701(a)(1) (defining robbery as, <em>inter alia, </em>infliction of injury or use of force “in the course of committing a theft”). The only evidence produced by the Commonwealth to support the robbery was from a single witness based on conversations he had with the appellant while the two were incarcerated together, which contradicted the appellant’s own testimony. When the appellant later raised a <em>Brady </em>claim that the prosecution withheld evidence that he could have used to impeach this witness, the Court of Appeals agreed with the appellant that where there was no other direct evidence about when the appellant formed <a id="p703" href="#p703" data-label="703" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*703</a>the intent to take the money, his own credibility and that of the testifying witness was crucial.

In a 1988 letter, Mr. Townsend’s Cameron County probation officer stated to the probation department that the consent decree was offered because of Mr. Townsend’s cooperation against <a id="p705" href="#p705" data-label="705" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*705</a>Appellant in 1987. Mr. Townsend subsequently testified for the Commonwealth in rebuttal at Appellant’s murder trial in 1997 that, shortly after he and Appellant had been charged together for the robbery and assault of Mr. Hoover in 1987, Appellant admitted that he had killed a girl. Mr. Townsend stated that he did not tell police about Appellant’s confession until the morning of his 1997 trial testimony, and testified that he did not receive a deal to testify against Appellant in the 1987 robbery and assault case.</p>

Second, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth withheld evidence contained in Mr. Townsend’s juvenile court records demonstrating that his 1987 testimony against Appellant was a factor in Mr. Townsend’s lenient probationary sentence, and that he testified falsely at Appellant’s murder trial in 1997 that he received no benefit for his cooperation against Appellant in 1987.</p>

These attorneys moved for the disqualification of all members of the Public Defender’s Office and for the appointment of new counsel, premised on the prior representation by Attorney Marsh of Commonwealth witness Mr. Wright. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing, and trial counsel did not appeal this denial on direct appeal. In response to Appellant’s PCRA petition, the first PCRA court to review the petition concluded that the trial court erred in denying the motion and that the Public Defender’s Office had an actual conflict of interest due to simultaneous representation of Appellant and Mr. Wright.

Fifty-five prospective jurors were questioned about their knowledge of the case and, of these, twenty-six had been exposed to no news accounts of the case and had absolutely no knowledge of the case. Of the thirteen people ultimately selected to serve on the jury, eight had heard nothing of the case, one person had read something about the case the day prior to voir dire, one had seen something in the newspaper within the prior few weeks, one had seen something in the newspaper within a few months, one had read something about the case at some point in the past, and finally, one juror had heard it spoken of nine years prior. All thirteen stated with clarity that they would be able to make their decision in the case based solely on the evidence produced in the courtroom. Based on this record, we conclude that pretrial publicity did not result in prejudice in empanelling the jury and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion of Weiss for a change of venue.</blockquote>

While this may have been counsel’s intent, by failing to make the trial court aware that the basis for the asserted conflict was not just Mr. Wright, but also the four other individuals, Appellant's counsel waived the issue of a conflict as to these four, and Appellant is left with only the derivative claim.

In arguing <em>Brady </em>materiality, appellant advocates for an expansion of <em>Brady </em>that would place his own trial testimony — inconsistent and implausible, and deemed “incredible” by the PCRA<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> court— off limits from analysis. He argues for this expansion of <em>Brady </em>because, he guesses that if he had been provided the impeachment evidence regarding Mr. Wright and Mr. Tribuiani, his trial counsel could have effectively used the evidence by persuading appellant not to take the stand and harm his cause through what amounted to perjury. According to appellant, <em>Brady </em>materiality must be evaluated by the speculative use <a id="p736" href="#p736" data-label="736" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*736</a>that the defense possibly may have made of undisclosed evidence, and if the defendant claims he would not have testified, then the court later assessing <em>Brady </em>materiality cannot look to his trial testimony when assessing the fairness of the proceeding.</p>

The Majority thus offers no view on the novel expansion appellant poses. I have no objection to dispositions premised upon an assumed point of law, if that is the more efficient manner of assessing a claim and the approach is unlikely to be mischaracterized and abused in future cases. But, in my view, the proper way to analyze appellant’s claim of <em>Brady </em>materiality is to squarely address his assertion that the current law dictated by the U.S. Supreme Court commands that a PCRA petitioner pursuing a <em>Brady </em>claim is entitled to shield himself from his own trial testimony. I think this is particularly the case where, as here, the <em>Brady </em>claim is premised upon a misrepresentation of governing decisional law of the U.S. Supreme Court.

The High Court has never held that courts, charged with assessing <em>Brady </em>materiality by re-examining the trial that occurred in light of previously suppressed evidence, are obliged to diminish the record at that trial. <a id="p738" href="#p738" data-label="738" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*738</a>Accordingly, appellant’s theory is a non-starter.

    <p id="b782-5" data-blocks='[["BL_782.4",782,[287,439,1152,1279]]]'>Second and relatedly, this is a PCRA appeal. An assessment of the fairness of appellant’s trial — whether he poses a <em>Brady </em>claim, a <em>Strickland </em>claim, or any other claim — is not measured by minority views in prior decisions or by hopeful predictions of where federal decisional law might someday go; it is measured by the existing law that governs. The only federal decisional law that governs in Pennsylvania is that commanded by the U.S. Supreme Court. Even assuming that the PCRA authorized present-day collateral relief premised upon predictions of developing federal doctrine — in fact, it does not — it would be unwise to undo final state convictions on such speculative grounds. The PCRA already specifically allows for relief premised upon new constitutional rulings from this Court or the U.S. Supreme Court, once a new rule has already been announced and held to have retroactive effect. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(iii). Given that construct, there is no reason — or authority — to indulge speculative predictions about the future course of the law. Errors in such predictions are subject to correction only by the U.S. Supreme Court, which accepts a handful of cases from state courts in any given term, and has no particular incentive to correct erroneous predictions in state collateral appeals. And, errors in such predictions favoring the defense run the risk of arbitrarily releasing murderers.</p>

Appellant would have to support his claim through his own testimony and that of his trial counsel, and the PCRA judge would have to make an assessment of whether appellant would not have testified, if only he had known of impeachment evidence. Given appellant’s headstrong, controlling performance at trial, it is not <a id="p739" href="#p739" data-label="739" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*739</a>particularly likely that his current counsel’s speculations have any basis in fact.</p>
    <p id="b783-4" data-blocks='[["BL_783.4",783,[176,423,1149,352]]]'>Finally, I believe it is extremely unlikely that the U.S. Supreme Court would adopt a <em>Brady </em>materiality extension, such as that posed by appellant, which would immunize a defendant against the effects of his own trial testimony, much less his own false trial testimony. To borrow from the <em>Strickland </em>jurisprudence from which <em>Brady </em>materiality derives:</p>
    <blockquote id="b783-5" data-blocks='[["BL_783.5",783,[218,800,1108,731]]]'>It is true that while the <em>Strickland </em>test provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, there are situations in which the overriding focus on fundamental fairness may affect the analysis. Thus, on the one hand, as <em>Strickland </em>itself explained, there are a few situations in which prejudice may be presumed ----And, on the other hand, there are also situations in which it would be unjust to characterize the likelihood of a different outcome as legitimate “prejudice.” Even if a defendant’s false testimony might have persuaded the jury to acquit him, it is not fundamentally unfair to conclude that he was not prejudiced by counsel’s interference with his intended perjury. <em>Nix v.
