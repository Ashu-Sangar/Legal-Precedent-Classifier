First, it asserts that there is no due process right to non-custodial collateral review. According to the Commonwealth, due process is not implicated in the absence of a protected liberty interest, and there is no protected liberty interest involved when one is no longer subject to the re<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>straints imposed by a sentence. Consistent with its position that a protected liberty interest is a prerequisite of due process protection, the Commonwealth argues that the PCRA draws a constitutional line between those whose liberty is constrained by a sentence and those whose liberty is no longer burdened because their sentences have concluded. Because Petitioner’s liberty interest is no longer implicated after she has completed her sentence, the Commonwealth argues that she no longer has a due process right to collateral review of her conviction. It is immaterial to the Commonwealth’s position that ineffectiveness claims are generally deferred to PCRA review. Even if Petitioner was barred from raising her ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, a proposition with which the Commonwealth disagrees as explained below, it argues she has no due process right to collateral review of her sentence because she is not subject to state-imposed restraint.</p>

Although the Commonwealth acknowledges this Court’s general rule deferring ineffectiveness claims to post-conviction review, <em>see Grant, </em>the Commonwealth argues that there was an exception to this general rule available to Petitioner. Specifically, in <em>Bomar, </em><a href="/pa/573/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="826 A.2d 831" data-case-ids="197189,9111753" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0426-01,/a2d/826/0831-01">826 A.2d 831</a>, we recognized a limited exception to <em>Grant </em>where ineffective assistance of counsel claims are presented to and decided by the trial court on direct appeal. <em>See Commonwealth v. Holmes, </em><a href="/pa/621/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="621 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="4080350" data-case-paths="/pa/621/0595-01">621 Pa. 595</a>, <a href="/pa/621/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="79 A.3d 562" data-case-ids="4080350,7302660" data-case-paths="/pa/621/0595-01,/a3d/79/0562-01">79 A.3d 562</a> (Pa.2013) (discussing <em>Grant </em>and the <em>“Bomar </em>exception”).

As support for this position, the Commonwealth observes that Petitioner was sentenced on January 14, 2008, yet waited almost a full year to file her PCRA petition on January 12, 2009, by which time her sentence was nearly half completed. Moreover, she waited until eleven days before she completed her sentence to file the supplement containing the claim on which the PCRA court ultimately granted relief. By waiting to bring her claim to the PCRA court’s attention, according to the Commonwealth, Petitioner substantially reduced the time available for the PCRA court to address it while she was still serving her sentence. The Commonwealth further observes that Petitioner could have, but did not, request expedited consideration of her petition. Consequently, according to the Commonwealth, Petitioner’s own actions made it impossible for the PCRA court to consider her claims until after she had completed her sentence. As further factual support for this assertion, the Commonwealth notes that by the time the PCRA court issued its order on July 15, 2011, granting a new trial, only fourteen months had passed since the PCRA court had received Petitioner’s final amended PCRA petition, suggesting that there would have been sufficient time -within the PCRA framework <em>(ie., </em>during her two-year sentence) to have her successful PCRA claim resolved if she had sought relief immediately after being sentenced.</p>

Here, Appellee did not obtain new counsel until she filed her PCRA petition. Therefore, to have invoked <em>Bomar </em>as the majority suggests, Appellee would have had to do all of the following within the 10-day period for filing post-sentence motions: First, as under our caselaw counsel is not obliged to raise his own ineffectiveness, Appellee, herself, would have had to identify trial counsel’s ineffectiveness. Second, Appellee would have had to seek to replace trial counsel. Third, Appellee would have had to instruct new counsel to file post-sentence motions raising the claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness she previously identified. All in 10 days. And who was obliged to have read this Court’s post-<em>Grant </em>pronouncements and discern that Appellee was required to take these steps lest she potentially lose her ability to challenge trial counsel’s effectiveness? Again, it would appear it was Appellee herself, as trial counsel’s own ineffectiveness was implicated. The majority has thus seemingly transformed <em>Bomar, </em>intended to provide an optional avenue <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>for relief under an unusual confluence of events, into a mandate that a counseled litigant act, for a time, <em>pro se. </em>The unreasonableness of such expectation should be obvious. That resort to <em>Bomar </em>is insufficient to satisfy due process in this case is equally so.</p>
