Whether the Commonwealth Court ignored a statute limiting the reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees to the condemnee for fees actually incurred, instead crafting a judicial remedy requiring the condemnor to pay fees not actually incurred by the condemnee?\n2. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s award of $179,000 of $187,000 requested in attorneys\u2019 fees for preparing a fee petition even though the trial court had disallowed over $500,000 of the $1,100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees requested in the petition?\nThe Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED in all other respects.",
