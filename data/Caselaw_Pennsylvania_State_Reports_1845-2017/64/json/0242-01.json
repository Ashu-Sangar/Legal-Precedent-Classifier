        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Agnew, J.\n\u2014 The memorandum signed by David Giltinan for the payment of the rent of the house in Strawberry street, related directly to the subject-matter of the action, and was not irrelevant. There being no special objection to its effect that became a matter of instruction of the court to the jury.\nUnder the evidence, we cannot say the writing was not sufficient to support the action. The first count in the declaration charges a direct promise of the defendant to pay the rent, and there was evidence to go to the jury in support of it. The agent of Mrs. Strong testified that the defendant asked him whether there was a tenant in the house, and said he wanted it for a friend. Both Giltinan, the defendant, and Maguire, were together when the memorandum was signed at Mrs Strong\u2019s. A few days afterwards Maguire went into possession, and Giltinan told the witness that he had put Maguire there; the evidence tended to show that the lease to Maguire was made at Giltinan\u2019s request. The language of the paper is not inconsistent with a primary liability on the part of Giltinan: \u201c I hereby become surety for the rent of house in Strawberry St., at $1200 per annum, payable monthly from this date.\u201d No person is named or referred to as the principal, nor is the rent stated to be that of another. The language 'can as well apply to a primary contract of Giltinan for a lease made at his request, as to a promise to pay the debt of another. Though the word surety is used, it is obvious from the absence of any other name or reference to the debt of any other person, that the writing is not necessarily a promise to pay the debt of another. It needs parol evidence to show that it is. The evidence of direct liability carried the writing properly to the jury. Arnold v. Stedman, 9 Wright 186, is sufficient authority for this; see also Paul v. Stackhouse, 2 Wright 305; Malone v. Keenan, 8 Id. 107. If parol evidence to prove consideration he needed, it can be adduced: Schively v. Black, 9 Id. 345.\nBut we think the court erred in holding that the record of the judgment against Maguire was competent evidence against Giltinan. If the liability is direct and primary, it is clear this is so, and if the writing is viewed as a mere undertaking of suretyship, still it was error; Giltinan was no party to that action, had no notice to defend it, and could not be brought into defence of it by the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s remedy against him could he only on his own promise. A surety may give notice to his principal who owes him this duty to defend him, but it would be a novelty if the principal could call in his surety who owes no such duty, to defend him. Giltinan was therefore in no sense either a party \u00a1or privy to that action. Under the term parties (says Mr. Greenleaf, in his Law of Evidence, \u00a7 524), \u201c the law includes all who were directly interested in the subject-matter, and had a right to make defence or to control the proceeding, and to appeal from the judgment. The right involves also the right to adduce testimony, and to cross-examine the witnesses adduced on the other side. Persons not having these rights are regarded as strangers to the cause.\u201d A surety in a separate and independent instrument is no party who could appear and control the separate action against his principal or appeal from the judgment. Nor is there a legal privity. Privity, says Mr. Greenleaf, \u00a7 189, denotes mutual or successive relationship to the same right of property. In none of the classes enumerated, as in estate, in blood, and in law, does the case of a surety fall in reference to a creditor\u2019s action. It is the right to represent, which creates privity in law as between ancestor and heir, decedent and administrator, &c., but clearly the principal, in an action against himself alone, cannot represent his surety. If he could, then he could bind his surety for an extinguished or paid debt by a confession or a default. The privity of the surety with his principal is in the contract alone and not in the action. For the acts or omissions of the principal to which the surety pledges himself in his contract, he is bound, and it is only in this respect the principal represents his surety. This is the criterion of the competency of the principal\u2019s declarations or admissions. Where these form a part of the acts or omissions of the principal for which the surety is bound, they constitute portions of the res gestee, and may be evidence against the surety. But beyond this line clearly the surety cannot be affected by the acts or admissions of his principal, for he is not represented by him: 1 Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., \u00a7 187. The acts or omissions, or admissions of the principal in an action at law against himself, clearly do not represent the surety in any wise. The liability of the surety is only for the unpaid rent in this case. Now clearly, the principal cannot, by any act, admission or omission in such action, increase the surety\u2019s liability beyond that extent. Nor are the interests of the principal and surety always identical. If the interest of the principal induce him to withdraw a payment made to the rent and apply it to another debt, the judgment against the principal would not represent the true balance against the surety. In the very case before us the payments proved would reduce the judgment against the principal more than one hundred dollars. If we analyze the judgment we discover that it cannot affect the surety. It speaks simply the voice of the evidence, and is but the determination of the tribunal of the result of the evidence. But clearly the principal does not rep*resent his surety in marshalling and controlling the evidence. His interest, we have seen, may be different from that of his surety, and induce him to withhold evidence to which the surety would be entitled.\nNo argument can be drawn from the cases founded on official bonds, bonds of indemnity, &c. They arise from the terms of the bond, or terms of the indemnity, whereby the surety submits himself to the acts of the principal and to the judgment, as itself a legal consequence, falling within the scope of the suretyship. Such are the cases of Masser v. Strickland, 17 S. & R. 354; Musselman v. Commonwealth, 7 Barr 240; Commonwealth v. Evans, 1 Watts 437; and others of similar character. The dissenting opinion of Gibson, J., in Masser v. Strickland, while ineffectual against the peculiar terms of a constable\u2019s bond, is conclusive as an argument against the competency of the judgment as evidence in an ordinary case of suretyship. If we look for decisions more germane to the present case we shall find them in Cannuke v. Commonwealth, 5 Binn. 184; Moore\u2019s Appeal, 10 Casey 411; see also 1 Greenleaf, \u00a7\u00a7 522, 523, 524.\nWe think the court erred, therefore, in admitting the judgment against Maguire as competent evidence against Giltinan, of the sum due upon the rent.\nJudgment reversed, and a venire de novo awarded.",

Thompson, C. J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the District Court of Philadelphia: No. 203, to July Term 1869.\nCatharine Strong brought an action of assumpsit in the District Court of Philadelphia, to December Term 1866, against David Giltinan. The first count of the declaration was, in consideration that the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s request, would let to George R. Maguire a house for one year, at $1200 per annum, the defendant in writing promised that he would pay the rent if Maguire did not; that the plaintiff rented to Maguire, who did not pay. Second count was, that if the plaintiff would let the house to Maguire, the defendant promised to pay the rent; also the common counts.\nOn the trial, before Hare, P. J., the plaintiff proved by one of her agents that the defendant said that he wanted the plaintiff\u2019s house, No. Ill Strawberry street, for a friend of his; that Maguire went into the possession of the plaintiff\u2019s house; the defendant told witness that he had put Maguire there:\nThe plaintiff then offered in evidence the following paper:\u2014\n\u201cApril 15th 1866. I hereby become surety for rent of house 111 Strawberry, at $1200 per annum, payable monthly from this date. \u201c David Giltinan.\u201d\nThe defendant objected to the offer; it was received, and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nAnother witness testified as to the signing of the paper, and that in two or three days afterwards Maguire moved into the house and continued in it until December 1866.\nThe defendant gave evidence by Maguire, that in July he had tendered to the plaintiff a surrender of the house, she said he would be satisfied with what he could pay, she would not hold him to $100 per month; the defendant then said he would no longer be responsible for the rent, and plaintiff said she would not look to him. In November witness said he would stay no longer; plaintiff said she was just as well pleased, and he sent her the key. He testified that he had paid plaintiff $420 up to September 26th 1866.\nThe plaintiff in rebuttal offered in evidence the record of a suit by her against Maguire for the same rent, in which there was judgment against him for $505.93; an execution issued, and return \u201c nulla bona.\u201d\nThe defendant objected to the offer; it was received and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nThe defendant\u2019s points were:\u2014\n1.

The evidence is not sufficient to maintain the action, and the verdict should be for the defendant.\n3. The record of the suit and judgment against Maguire is not evidence to establish the debt as against the defendant in this case.\nThe court declined to charge as requested in defendant\u2019s points.\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $443.10.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error the refusal of his points and the admission of the evidence objected to.\nIi.
