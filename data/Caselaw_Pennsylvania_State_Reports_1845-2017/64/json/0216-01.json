        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Agnew, J.\n\u2014 This is a bill in equity, praying for a conveyance of the estate in the defendants as trustees on the alleged expiration of the trust at the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband. A decree dismissing the bill pro forma was made at Nisi Prius, in order that the ease might reach the court in banc. But one question is involved, and that is, whether the trust created for Mrs. Megargee during coverture, by her father John Naglee, in his last will, has fallen by the death of her husband Samuel Megargee. It seems to us very clear that the active trust vested in the joint board of trustees of the sons and daughters for the improvement of the estate, and its partition, ceased after the term fixed for the performance of these duties had expired and the partition made. Thenceforth there was nothing to keep alive the trust for the daughters, except so far as the will created a special trust for them as married women to preserve their estates and protect them from their husbands and from the creditors of their husbands. The devise and bequest in the eighth clause in trust for the daughters are clearly of a fee in the realty, and an absolute estate in the personalty. A continuance of the special trust, after the death of the husband of any daughter, would be clearly at variance with the absolute estate thus vested in her. Being no longer necessary for the protection of the daughter, the trust falls, and she is entitled to receive the estate into her own hands as its owner, with all the incidents of ownership. In Bacon's Appeal the trust was for the daughter for life, and being an active one, the estate in her was merely equitable, so that it did not unite with the legal remainder to create a fee in her. But here the will gave Mrs. Megargee a fee and an absolute estate in the first instance. That in such a case the statute executes the use upon discoverture is sustained by abundant authority : Smith v. Starn, 3 Whart. 62; Hamersley v. Smith, 4 Id. 126; Harrison v. Brolaskey, 8 Harris 299; Steacy v. Rice, 3 Casey 75; Ralston v. Wain, 8 Wright 279; Nice\u2019s Appeal, 14 Id. 143; Freyvogle v. Hughes, 6 P. F. Smith 228; Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 7 Id. 352; Dodson v. Ball, 10 Id. 492.\nDecree reversed, bill restored, and a decree ordered to be drawn up for the plaintiff for the conveyance of the legal estate to her with costs, subject to the settlement of the account of the defendants as trustees for all proper charges and deductions to which they may be legally and equitably entitled, for and by reason of the trust estate in their hands.",

The will authorized the trustees to make necessary improvements and to make partition; this being done the active duties of the trust ceased, and the trust continued, only to protect the daughter\u2019s estate during coverture.\n3. The gift was a fee in the realty and an absolute estate in the personalty.\nMarch 4th 1870.\nBefore Read, Agnew and Sharswood, JJ. Thompson, C. J., at Nisi Prius.\nAppeal from the decree of the Supreme Court at Nisi Prius: Of January Term 1870, No. 9.\nThis was a bill filed by Margaret Megargee against Henry M. Naglee and others, trustees under the will of John Naglee, deceased. John .Naglee was the father of the plaintiff; he died in February 1852. By his will he gave one-half of the residue of his estate to Henry M. Naglee and others \u201c in trust for my three daughters; the one-third of the said one-half in trust for my daughter Margaret Megargee, the wife of Samuel Megargee and her heirs; * * and for the sole and separate use of each of my said daughters.\u201d\nHe then authorized the trustees, if they thought best, to set out '.each daughter\u2019s share in severalty; and proceeded: \u201c It is my will that the share of the personal estate to which my daughters shall be entitled, shall be invested by the said trustees in good and safe securities, and the net income thereof to be paid my said daughters for their sole and separate use. And the said trustees shall have the care and management of the real estate of my said daughters, shall receive the rents thereof, pay the taxes, and make all necessary repairs and improvements upon the same, and let any portions of the vacant lots upon ground-rent, and make and execute all necessary deeds and conveyances for that purpose, &c., and after deducting, &e., to pay over the residue of the rents and profits to each of my said daughters, to her sole and separate use, and her receipt shall be a sufficient discharge for the same, and after the death of either of my said daughters, her share to be for the \u00fase of her heirs and legal representatives; and I do hereby authorize my said daughters to dispose of any share or part of the said property hereby bequeathed and devised to her by her last will and testament, &e., as fully and effectually as if she was a feme sole and unmarried.\u201d\nMay 5th 1870,\nMrs. Megargee\u2019s share in the estate devised under the will was afterwards allotted to her. Her husband died June 29th 1865.\nThe bill set out these facts, and prayed for a conveyance and transfer of the property by the defendants to her in fee and absolutely.\nThe defendants filed an answer admitting the facts stated in the bill, and submitting themselves to the order of the court.\nOn the 18th of September 1869, the cause was heard on bill and answer by Mr. Justice Williams, who made a decree dismissing the bill pro forma.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the court in banc, and there assigned this decree for error.\nP. K. Price (with whom were P. H. Weil and J. Page), for appellants,\nreferred to Catherwood\u2019s Appeal, 2 P. F. Smith 154, and Keyser\u2019s Appeal, 7 Id. 236 decisions in the same estate. This trust is executed: Lewin on Trusts 246; Williams on Real Prop. 135; Dubs v. Dubs, 7 Casey 155; Physick\u2019s Appeal, 14 Wright 128; Kepple\u2019s Appeal, 3 P. F. Smith 212.
