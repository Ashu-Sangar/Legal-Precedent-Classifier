        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Thompson, C. J.\n\u2014 We see not wherein the books of Hahn & Frick were not evidence on the question of the partnership between the Fricks. Hahn testified to the books, and to facts and declarations tending to show that Ephraim and Amos were partners with Jacob and him. This testimony, whether very important or of little consequence in the minds of the jury, could not have been withheld from them, fo.r anything we can see. Indeed it may have been very important. There was no error in its admission.\nThere was nothing wrong in the pertinent inquiry of the judge, \u201cwhere are the receipts?\u201d The testimony had shown numerous payments by the Fricks to Barbour, Semmes & Co., on account, 'and the receipts would have been pertinent and powerful to show how they were drawn and regarded when these payments were made, and how the parties regarded themselves in taking receipts. It has been more than once said that the testimony in a case often consists in what is not proved as well as in what is proved. Where withholding testimony raises a violent presumption that a fact not clearly proved or disproved exists, it is not error to allude to the fact of withholding, as a circumstance strengthening the proof. That was all that was done here. There was no error in this part of the case.\nIt is denied that the record of the discharge of Jacob Frick, as a bankrupt, was in evidence at all in the case. The judge\u2019s notes have in them, \u201c discharge of bankrupt, Jacob Frick, March 4th 1848,\u201d but whether given in evidence does not appear. Certain it is, that it was not pleaded, nor any further notice taken of it on the trial, and no request to charge in regard to it, nor objection made as to the entry of judgment, nor motion in arrest of judgment as to Jacob, appears on the record. As he was not bound to plead his discharge, and did not do it, there was no error in the entry of judgment on the verdict against him as one of the partners. As there are no other assignments of error to be noticed, and no error in those we have noticed,\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Frick at al. versus Barbour et al.\n1. In a question as to E. being a partner, H. of the firm of H. & E. testified that J. was a partner and that E. asked for the books and said he had as much interest as J. Held, that the books of H. & F. were admissible.\n2. Testimony often consists in what is not proved as well as in what is proved.\n3. When withholding testimony raises a violent presumption that a fact not clearly proved or disproved exists, it is not error in the court to allude to the withholding, as a circumstance strengthening the proof.\nJanuary 17th 1870.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Sharswood and Williams, JJ. Agnew, J., at Nisi Prius.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery county: No. 97, to July Term 1868.\nThe action in the court below was assumpsit, by James L. Barbour and others, partners, &c., against Jacob Erick, Ephraim B. Erick and Amos Erick, partners, trading as Jacob Erick. It was commenced October 31st 1867. E. B. Erick filed an affidavit denying the partnership. The defendants pleaded non assumpsit with leave to give the special matters in evidence.\nThe ease was tried May 27th 1868, before Chapman, P. J.\nEor plaintiffs: J. L. Hahn testified, he was a partner with Jacob Erick from August 14th 1861 till September 1862, and always regarded Ephraim and Amos as partners. Ephraim called on witness for the books, and said he had as much interest in the concern as Jacob. The witness proved a book to be that of Erick & Hahn for 1862; in this book were charges to J. Frick & Co., and to \u201cAmos.\u201d The plaintiffs offered the book in evidence; they were objected to by the defendants, admitted and a bill of exceptions sealed.\nJ. Q. Adams, clerk of plaintiffs, testified: \u201c The account in plaintiffs\u2019ledger was opened as \u2018Erick.\u2019 Jacob would come in and we would mark it \u2018 Jacob;\u2019 Amos the same, and then we would carry it to account of Erick. I regarded them as partners.\u201d\nThe book of plaintiffs contained in the same account entries to \u201cE. B. Erick,\u201d to \u201cJacob Erick,\u201d to \u201cMr. Erick,\u201d to \u201cErick.\u201d The plaintiffs gave in evidence a bill-head, \u201cE. B. Erick, Norris-town, Cigar Store.\u201d Also, letter from Jacob Erick to plaintiffs, dated November 25th 1864. \u201c We have filled lot of segars,\u201d &c. Witness further testified that he had received money from E. B. Erick and Jacob Erick, who, in making payment, would ask the amount on the ledger. Defendants never objected to the charge being made to \u201c Erick.\u201d\nDefendants gave evidence for the purpose of disproving the partnership. They also gave in evidence the certificate of Jacob Erick\u2019s discharge as bankrupt.\nThe court charged:\u2014\nFebruary 7th 1870,\n\u201c Where are their receipts ? If these were produced they might throw light upon the subject. It is singular that these parties should have dealt so long together and have paid so much money and no receipts have passed between them. They would show, if produced, how the defendants dealt with the plaintiffs, whether as partners or as individuals. Now, where are the receipts ? To be sure, plaintiffs had a right to call upon defendants to produce them, and not having given them that notice, the defendants are entitled to whatever\"benefit may be derived from that omission.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the plaintiffs for $1410.15.\nThe defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error the admission of Frick and Hahn\u2019s book, the charge of court, and that judgment was entered against Jacob Frick, &c., he having been discharged as a bankrupt.\nGf. W. Gorson, for plaintiffs in error.\nH. K. Weand, for defendants in error, was stopped by the court."
