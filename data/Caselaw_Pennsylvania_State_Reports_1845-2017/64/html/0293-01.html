A decree was accordingly made, and Benjamin Chew, one of the trustees, he being also beneficially interested in the trust, was allowed to bid at the sale. The property was advertised and exposed to public sale on the 24th of June then-next, in two classes. The first class included or was designed to include all the lands intended to pass without the reservation of minerals: the second, those tracts “ out of which mining and mineral privileges have been reserved,” and also the mineral privileges which had been reserved out of lands previously sold. In the first class was included the 181 acre tract, sold to Heylman. This tract was sold to W. L. Marshall, Esq., attorney for Benjamin Chew, for $248.87. The order of sale was so returned, and on the 12th of July 1856 the sale was confirmed. On the 12th of November the trustees made a deed to Mr. Marshall, and he conveyed to Chew, April 1st 1857. The deeds to Marshall and Chew were both recorded in Lycoming county, October 2fith 1859. On the 3d of October 1863, Heylman paid to Judge Armstrong, of Williamsport, attorney for the trustees, $346.05, on account of the purchase-money, the receipt for which was endorsed on the agreement and signed by Judge Armstrong as attorney for the trustees: In November 1865 Heylman called on Faries, who continued to act as agent of the trustees, and paid him $642.49, the balance of the purchase-money of the 181 acres with interest and demanded a deed.

At the time defendant Heylman made his payments to the trustees there were two deeds on record in the county of Lycoming, which were a standing notice to him and to all the world, that the trustees had parted with the legal title, and had no right to receive any portion of the unpaid purchase-money.

But suppose it was proved, who was damaged by it ? Not the trustees, because they received Chew’s purchase-money, and executed a deed to him after they had full notice. It was the clerk of the trustees, who called Mr. Chew’s attention to the Heylman contract, as appears by his testimony. Consequently they delivered the deed to Chew and received his purchase-money with open eyes, and it does not lie in their mouths to ask the interposition of a court of equity to relieve them from the consequences; particularly as the act was one from which no evil consequences were likely to flow. The representatives of Chew have suffered no damage, because their <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>rights are unimpaired, and the conveyance having been accepted by Chew, and the purchase-money paid by him with full notice of Heylman’s equity in the land, he, or his representatives, would be in no position to ask for a rescission of their contract, if they were not cut out by lapse of time.

He treats the public sale of the 181 acres, part of tract No. 1758, in Lycoming county, as a sale to Colonel Benjamin Chew, of the entire legal title; and thence infers the duty of Heylman, the former purchaser of the trustees <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>at private sale, to pay to Chew the unpaid purchase-money. But it is impossible to close our eyes to the fact that the sale to Colonel Chew of the entire tract of 181 acres was founded in mistake, and was contrary to his duty as a trustee. He was one of the three trustees who had sold this tract to J. W. Heylman by articles dated May 25th 1854, at $5 per acre, amounting to $905; reserving all the minerals and mining privileges. On this contract Heylman had paid $300, June 6th 1854, and had entered into possession and made improvements. It is not material whether Colonel Chew participated actively in the sale to Heylman or not. As a trustee he knew or was bound to know of the sale, and payment on account of it. The petition for the sale of the trust lands in 1856, prayed expressly for a sale of all of the subjects of the trust <em>remaining unsold; </em>and the decree of the court was made accordingly, and Colonel Chew was one of the trustees ordered to make the sale. His being permitted, under the order of the court, to bid at the trustees’ sale, to protect his beneficial interest in the subject of the trust, did not diminish his duty as a trustee to make a fair sale, or eradicate the knowledge to be imputed to him of the former sale of the trustees to Heylman. A trustee, thus permitted to bid at his own sale, must act within the strictest line of his responsibility. His character as a bidder cannot be permitted to derogate from his duty as a trustee. The tract of land sold to Heylman did not fall within the purview of the petition and order of sale. As to it conversion had already-taken place, and the order was not intended to give an authority to resell it. To comprehend it within the unsold lands was an evident mistake, excepting as to the minerals and mining privileges. The claim on Heylman was for purchase-money, and the legal title was held in trust for him. The whole sum of $605 unpaid and interest were available to the trust. What sort of propriety would there be in permitting a trustee to bid in for himself the right to receive that sum belonging to his trust for the sum of $248.87 ? It was a breach of duty to sell the claim on Heylman, and still worse to pay for it less than half of its actual value. It is very evident that the permission to bid to protect his interest in the unsold lands, did not allow him to speculate thus on the trust confided to him. To avoid such' a conclusion against him, we are bound to believe the sale of the entire 181 acres was a mistake, as doubtless it was, by including the tract in the first class of lands wholly unsold, instead of the second class, consisting of the reserved mining rights.</p>
