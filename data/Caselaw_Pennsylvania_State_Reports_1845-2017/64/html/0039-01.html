The same words of conveyance which would make two other persons joint tenants will make the husband and wife tenants of the entirety. Joint tenants are each seised of an undivided moiety of the whole, but husband and wife are seised of the whole and not of undivided moieties. Of such an estate, as Montague, C. J., says, in Plowden 58, ‘ the husband has the entire use and the wife <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>has the entire use, for there are no moieties between husband and wife.’ The attainder of the husband does not affect the wife’s estate: 1 Inst. 187 a. Nor can the husband forfeit or alien so as to sever the tenancy, ‘ because,’ as Cruise says, ‘ the whole of it belongs to his wife as well as to him:’ tit. 18, ch. 1.

So that this estate remains as at common law, excepting in so far as it may have been affected by the Act of 11th April 1848, commonly called the Married Woman’s Act. It would seem to have followed, at common law, from the unity of husband and wife, and the subjection of the latter to the former, that the husband had the control of the estate during his life, and might convey or mortgage it during that period. This is conceded by Kennedy, J., in Fairchild <em>v. </em>Chastelleux, 1 Barr 181, and decided in Barber <em>v. </em>Harris, <a href="/wend/15/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Wend. 615" data-case-ids="2018851" data-case-paths="/wend/15/0615-01">15 Wend. 615</a>; Jackson <em>v. </em>McConnell, 19 Id. 175. If the husband might convey or mortgage it for the period of his own life, it would seem to follow necessarily that it might be taken in execution and sold by the sheriff for the same period, and that a purchaser of such an interest would be entitled to recover the possession during the life of the husband by an action of ejectment. But just here the Act of 11th April 1848 interposes its insuperable bar to such a result, declaring that ‘ every species and description of property, of whatever name or kind, which may accrue to any married woman during coverture, by will, descent, deed of conveyance or otherwise, shall be owned, used and enjoyed by such married woman as her own separate property, and shall not be subject to levy and execution for the debts or liabilities of her husband, nor shall such property be sold, conveyed, mortgaged or transferred, or in any manner encumbered by her husband without her written consent first had and obtained and duly acknowledged, &amp;c.’</p>

If a purchaser of the husband’s interest may be put into possession with her, what follows ? This: 1st. You have destroyed her estate, and turned her entirety into a joint tenancy or tenancy in common. 2d. You have deprived her altogether of the possession, because it is not in the nature of things that she can enjoy actual possession with a stranger as she did with her husband. 3d. You have taken away her property without her consent and destroyed her rights, which were protected by the Act of April 11th 1848. She was entitled to <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>possession of the whole with her husband. You propose to give possession of the whole with a stranger, a possession which she cannot, and which he probably would not enjoy. If it should be answered that the property may be rented, and a moiety of the rents and profits may be paid to her, that is only to say that you may deprive her of her estate and give her another of inferior value, a substitution which you have no right to propose. The words of the Act of 1848 are of so comprehensive a character, and its purpose to protect every possible interest of the wife is so plain, that we cannot, by any possible construction, consistent with the object of the legislature, and the language which they have used, except this interest from its protection.</p>

The point to be determined here did not arise in that case which was decided twelve years before the passage of the Married Woman’s Act. In that case the husband and wife did not hold by entireties. There was an absolute conveyance in fee simple to the husband, coupled with a contemporaneous agreement, the intent of which was to control the conveyance, and to give the estate jointly to the daughter of the donor and her husband in special tail, but it failed for want of apt words to accomplish that result, and it was held that the whole estate was in the husband for life, and that his freehold was a legitimate subject of execution.</p>
