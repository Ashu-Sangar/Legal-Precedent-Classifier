If so, the consequence would be inevitable, that the public] right to use and pass over the company’s canal, a public highway, would be subordinate to private interests of the mill-owner, and to others similarly situated. This will not do.</p>
    <p id="b393-8" data-blocks='[["BL_393.12",393,[187,1084,1164,343]]]'>The canal was built to accommodate the public as a public highway, and a remedy is provided in its acts of incorporation to compensate private parties for injuries received in its construction and use. It would never do to render its úse contingent; to allow parties by writs of injunction to deprive it of the necessary supply of water when most needed. To do so would destroy the highway altogether by rendering its navigation uncertain and eontingent.</p>

No contract is alleged as existing between the company and complainants, by which the former engaged to permit any water to flow over its dam to their mill, nor is there any law requiring it to do so. How, then, can the company be restrained from raising their dam for the temporary supply of their works when it needs it ? By the • original act of incorporation of 29th September 1791, the company was authorized to take all the water of the Tulpehocken for the use of its canal; by the Consolidation Act of 1811, it was provided that the company might use the waters of any creek or stream on the route of the intended canal. There is a provision in the latter act, as there was in the former, for compensating parties injured by taking creeks, tenements, mills, mill-ponds, water and watercourses by the company for the construction and use of its canal. We have innumerable decisions to the effect that in all such cases the remedy must be pursued. So, indeed, have we an Act of Assembly to that effect, the Act of 1806. If, therefore, the complainants here sustained or are sustaining injury required to be compensated by the act of incorporation or its supplements, they must resort to that. They cannot stop the works of the company to coerce payment. The notion <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>that consequential injuries are required by the Constitution to be prepaid is a mistake. • The Constitution only applies to <em>talcing </em>private property; that must be prepaid or secured to be paid before it can be taken. Not so consequential damages. If the act of incorporation requires such damages to be prepaid the law may be enforced, but if it ddes not, there is no authority to require their payment at all, or at any time other than that expressed when required to be compensated.</p>
