    <p class="summary" id="b59-8" data-blocks='[["BL_59.10",59,[210,682,1155,252]]]'>This appeal was from the decree of the Orphans’ Court distributing the estate of L. Coates Stockton, deceased, in the hands of his administrator, Anne F. Stockton. The only question controverted was the claim of George A. Twibill for the use and occupation by the decedent, of certain premises belonging to Twibill.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b59-9" data-blocks='[["BL_59.11",59,[212,940,1160,636]]]'>The decedent had been tenant of George W. Conrad, of a storehouse in Philadelphia. On the 5th of October 1863 the premises had been sold by the sheriff under an execution against Conrad, under a mortgage prior to the lease, and were purchased by Twibill. The sheriff’s deed to Twibill was acknowledged March 7th 1864. Shortly afterwards, Twibill notified the decedent to quit, but he continued in possession until June 6th 1864, which appeared to have been three months after he received the notice. The administratrix having filed her account, showing in her hands a balance of $6596.98, it was referred to William M. Bull, Esq., as auditor for distribution. Twibill’s claim was for the use and occupation of the premises from the day of the sheriff’s sale, being eight months, at $100 per month. He made no claim in virtue of the lease from Conrad, under which the decedent held prior to the sheriff’s sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b59-10" data-blocks='[["BL_59.12",59,[217,1584,1156,172]]]'>The auditor in his report said: * * * “ A. purchaser at sheriff’s sale notifying a tenant to quit, dissolves the relation of landlord and tenant, and, by so doing, forfeits the right to rent which he can only claim in quality of landlord.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b60-7" data-blocks='[["BL_60.5",60,[317,543,1164,858]]]'>“ Ordinarily it would seem to be strange that a man should be permitted to occupy land admitted to be the property of another without making the owner some compensation. It would also appear to be remarkable if the owner of the land could not — as can many other parties — waive the tort and sue in assumpsit. It must be conceded that Mr. Twibill could have maintained ejectment and recovered mesne profits. And if so, why should he not be permitted to abandon the fiction of force, and sue upon the implication to pay for what was taken, which would prevail against' him who spoiled the freehold of a load of coal or a bushel of apples? It is familiar law that the tort may be waived, and assumpsit brought for the value of goods obtained by fraud. * * * “ The difficulty of applying these principles to the action for use and occupation is, that this remedy seems to have been unknown to the common law. Assumpsit for use and occupation is the creature of the statute 2 Geo. 2, ch. 19, § 14, by which it is enacted that ‘ it shall and may be lawful to and for the landlord, where the <em>agreement </em>is not by deed, to recover a reasonable satisfaction for the lands * * * held * by the defendant in an action on the case for use and occupation.’</p>

      <em>“ </em>As to this implication of contract, Mr. Stephens further tells us that <em>‘ </em>the terms of the statute may seem in strictness only to include the cases in which the relation of landlord and tenant exists. But the courts have given a wide and liberal construction to it; and it now appears to be settled that wherever one party occupies by the permission of another, although <em>no agreement </em>for such occupation <em>was in contemplation </em>between the parties, the fact of the one having occupied by the sufferance of the other is suffi<a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>cient to raise <em>an implied assumpsit </em>by the other to pay for his occupation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[218,470,1153,251]]]'>“ In the case before us the sheriff’s vendee could have brought his ejectment the day after he received his deed. He permitted the tenant to occupy the premises for three months. This, in the language of the authority quoted, raised an implied assumpsit by the tenant to pay for the occupation; and the exception is therefore sustained. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-7" data-blocks='[["BL_61.7",61,[218,729,1163,516]]]'>“ It will thus be seen that no one of the cases relied on by the accountant is at all • conclusive against this claim. On the con-_ trary, they all support Mr. Stephens’s statement, that mere permission or sufferance raises the implied assumpsit. Indeed it is difficult to understand why there should be a distinction between this and many other kindred cases familiar to the student. The law presumes a promise to pay the man who saws wood or does any work for another upon simple command; or indeed by bare permission. The person who uses the goods of another is supposed to have promised to pay what they are reasonably worth. What distinction should there be between land and merchandise, the title and circumstances being all admitted?” * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-8" data-blocks='[["BL_61.8",61,[219,1244,1153,428]]]'>“We do not regard the provisions of the Act of June 16th 1836, Purd. 450, as. interfering with the claim, for the special remedy for the recovery of damages for detention of the premises can only be invoked where the ‘ person in possession * * * shall refuse * to comply with the notice to quit.’ Indeed, the complainant must swear that the person is in possession ‘ <em>at the time of the application’ </em>to the justice. That was impossible in this case, for the tenant had complied with the notice; and it is plain that the law referred to can never be invoked where the- occupier moves away the last day of the three months.</p>
