Hunter and Samuel DeHaven, subject to a mortgage to Hugh J. Steen for $8000. On the 6th of February 1866, DeHaven conveyed his undivided half to Sarah Ann Stearns for $23,500, subject to $1500, the one-half of the $3000 mortgage ; $6000 were paid in cash and a bond and mortgage for $17,500 of the same date given to DeHaven for the balance of the purchase-money. The mortgage was acknowledged February 6th 1866, and it so appeared by the magistrate’s certificate. It was recorded in the recorder’s office of Montgomery county on the same day, as is shown by the records, endorsed “ at 3J o’clock, p. M., recorded.” The mortgage was accurately entered in the index of the mortgage book. In the <em>record, </em>however, of the certificate of acknowledgment it is stated that it was acknowledged in “ January” instead of “ February.” On the 8th of March 1866, Mrs. Stearns executed a mortgage on her interest in the same premises to Mary Ann Brooke for $6000. This mortgage by its certificate <em>appears </em>to have been acknowledged February 8th 1866 — it was recorded March 13th 1866. The DeHaven mortgage was recorded before the Brooke mortgage. DeHaven entered judgment on the bond secured by the mortgage. The property was sold under the Steen mortgage, after the paying of which and of the costs, &amp;c., there remained for distribution the sum of $8413.75 as the proceeds of the interest of Mrs. Stearns.</p>

On the 6th February 1866, Samuel DeHaven and wife conveyed his undivided half of the said woollen factory building and lot of ground to Sarah Ann Stearns. P. M.

    <p id="b129-9" data-blocks='[["BL_129.9",129,[209,1224,1164,845]]]'>There is no such case in our reports. The case of Solms <em>v. </em>McCulloch, 5 Barr 473, was entirely different. It was a scire facias upon a mortgage, which, when offered in evidence, was found to be dated November 12th 1835, and acknowledged on the 9th October and recorded on the 23d November. The error was in the original mortgage. Judge Rogers says: “ This raises two questions. 1st. Was the mortgage defectively registered, or in other words, had the recorder authority to record the mortgage ?” The doubt here clearly arose from the defective acknowledgment on the original mortgage itself. The plaintiffs on the trial, after the rejection of the mortgage, then proved the execution of it. “The first,” says the learned judge, “raises an open and interesting question, which we are not at this time prepared to decide, in consequence of the necessary absence of one of the judges, and a difference of opinion among those who heard the argument.” •Now this' does not touch the first Stearns mortgage at all, for there is no doubt of the authority of the recorder to record it, but it does impinge upon the mortgage to Mrs. Brooke, which is identical in its circumstances with the rejected mortgage in 5 Barr.</p>
