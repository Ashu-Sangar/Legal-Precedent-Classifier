Johnson sold the land for $36,000. In a suit for commissions according to the above terms on the whole sum, it was competent for Barrett to show that he was bound to pay to another, one-fourth of the peach crop on the land and that it was understood between him and Johnson that this one-fourth was an item in the cost of the farm.</p>

The whole thing will stand me in $28,682.93. * * If I get this, I shall consider myself made whole — and that is all I now expect or ask. * * * If you can sell it for the above-named sum, I will allow you your commissions of two per cent.; and you shall have thirty per cent, of whatever you get above this. * * * I figure the thing thus:</p>

The plaintiff having closed, the defendant offered to prove by Eli Felt, “ that he, the defendant, had to pay one-fourth of the peach crop on the said farm to Mr. Taylor; also to prove the value of the one-fourth of the peach <em>crop; </em>and also that it was distinctly understood between the plaintiff and the defendant that one-fourth of the peach crop was an item in the cost of said farm.

If, as proposed to be proved, Johnson, the plaintiff, knew from Barrett, anterior to the sale of the farm in question, that the one-fourth of the peach crops for one or more years was to go to others, and was not the property of Barrett to sell, and to be deducted from the gross amount of sales proposed to be made by him, and that they did so go, and the amount of the purchase-money was in fact reduced by that amount, he was certainly not entitled to thirty per cent, commissions on that sum. Barrett never received it, and the offer was to prove that he knew he was not to receive it. With that knowledge he was no more entitled to commissions on the amount deducted than if he had sold subject to liens. We think the testimony should have been received and have gone to the jury as a means of determining the amount the plaintiff was entitled to, if anything, on the basis of his claim. On the hypothesis that the deduction of the one-fourth of the peaches was necessary to enter into the calculation of what would be requisite to make the defendant whole in the sale of his property, we predicate nothing, for we see no evidence that the plaintiff was only to receive thirty per cent, of the amount he should sell the property for over and above what would make the defendant whole. That is the aspect of the case now, but for the preceding reason we think the case should be reversed.</p>
