Tbe evidence concurred in showing that wherever tbe northern terminus of tbe road might be, it must leave the Chester Yalley at tbe point where Buck run passes from tbe valley, being about three-quarters of a mile south from the Pennsylvania Railroad. There was evidence that if tbe northern terminus were required to be at Parkesburg, tbe best mode of reaching that point would be to run tbe line from tbe exit of Buck run out of Chester Yalley towards Pomeroy, and westwardly parallel and near the Pennsylvania Railroad till Parkesburg should be reached, and that there was no point between Parkesburg and Pomeroy at which a connection could be made with that road.</p>

This was the construction of a railroad to develop the resources of the country lying along the Buck run and White Clay creek, and to form an additional outlet from the Pennsylvania Railroad, towards the seaboard. It was not to enhance the value of private property, but to promote the public interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[203,701,1155,817]]]'>“ It is further important in seeking the meaning of the legislature, to look at the country to be traversed by the road, and see what is its position in respect to Parkesburg and other points on the Pennsylvania road. In doing so, we find it to be such that the road <em>must </em>pass out of the valley where the waters of the Buck run leave it. This is conceded by the plaintiffs. From this point to the state line the propriety of the route selected is unquestioned. The controversy is therefore confined to the distance between the Pennsylvania road and the south side of the valley— <em>three-fourths of a mile. </em>The country here being already supplied with railroad facilities, the object of this part of the line can only be to form a connection with the Pennsylvania road. In view of these facts it would seem entirely reasonable that the point reached in that road by the most direct practicable route from the south side of the valley, where the defendants’ road must pass out, was within the contemplation of the legislature when it employed the language quoted. What motive can be discovered consistent with the object of the statute for requiring the connection to be made <em>nearer </em>Parkesburg ?</p>

The country thus traversed being, as we have seen, already supplied with a railroad, would derive no advantage from it, while the additional useless expenditure which would thus be required would tend in some degree to defeat the enterprise itself. If the purpose of the legislature had been the improvement of Parkesburg, the language employed would require a different interpretation. But it was not. * * *</p>

Its <em>selection </em>is entirely for the company. <em>Any </em>route adopted with a <em>proper view to this object </em>would, in our judgment, come within the limits prescribed by the statute; necessarily its connection with the Pennsylvania road could not be very far from Parkesburg.

If it has not, the court below did right in refusing to interfere. If we should differ from its conclusion, we must interfere.</p>
    <p id="b140-11" data-blocks='[["BL_140.17",140,[322,1239,1154,560]]]'>Neither the court below nor this court have any right to interfere with the location made by the company on the score of preference, if any he felt. Our only question is, whether it has or has not exceeded a discretion on the subject apparent on the face of the act of incorporation. The company was incorporated by an Act of Assembly of the 24th March 1868, “with power to construct a railroad from a point on the Pennsylvania Central Railroad at or near Parkesburg, in Chester county; thence by the most available route along Buck run and that branch of White Clay creek that runs west of Chatham to the state line.” The length of the line is about twenty-four miles, and is intended to be connected with a line from thence to Delaware City, which in the aggregate will make a line of some thirty-six miles.</p>
    <p id="b140-12" data-blocks='[["BL_140.18",140,[323,1798,1153,597]],["BL_141.1",141,[191,385,1161,773]]]'>There is no testimony in the ease to controvert the propriety of the location made near Pomeroy station on the Pennsylvania Central, a mile and a half east of Parkesburg, in an engineering point of view, or that it is not proper in view of the route indicated in the A.ct of Assembly, or that it is not for the best interests of the company. The facts found' by the master seem to establish all these in favor of the company. But it is thought the location should have been at Parkesburg. But this is not what the legislature said, nor are we able to discern any controlling policy in requiring it to go there. The object in incorporating the company to construct the road, was to furnish an outlet to the trade of the flourishing valleys through which it was to run, and give them a connection with the Pennsylvania Central, which will furnish an outlet east and west to that section of country. <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>The connection with that line of road was the great point; the place was subordinate, as the discretion given shows. As Buck run crosses that road east of Parkesburg some half a mile or more, and as the line of the road was to follow down its valley, the designation in the charter “ at or near Parkesburg,” was with reference to the route of the road from its intersection with the Pennsylvania road, rather than anything else. This was undoubtedly the reason of the indefinite terminus in the act, and the discretion allowed in fixing it. We think that a mile and a half was not transgressive of the discretion allowed <em>fer se, </em>and no fact has been proved to show any wilful abuse of the discretion exercised. As Parkesburg was not fixed as a point or terminus, it would require something very conclusive of impropriety, or mistake in the location to induce a court to control the company and compel it to extend its track a mile and a half, side by side, with the Pennsylvania road to Parkesburg, encountering heavy expenses in the construction as well as in procuring the right of way.</p>
    <p id="b141-6" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[196,1159,1159,300]]]'>We need not dwell on these considerations. The company had a discretion to locate the terminus of its road elsewhere than at Parkesburg, and while they did so geographically near that place, and there is nothing to show anything wrong in fact or law, we have no right to interfere. With their discretion exercised within the limits of their act of incorporation, no court has any control or right to interfere.</p>
