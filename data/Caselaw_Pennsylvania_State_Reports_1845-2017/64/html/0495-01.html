If the entry is lawful, the fact that the defendant exceeded his authority while upon the land would not make him a trespasser from the beginning. There is this distinction, however, which must be made under the facts of this case. The plaintiff, Thomas L. Foster, swears that he gave the defendant the privilege to cut two white-pine trees. But the defendant swears that <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>the plaintiff Foster gave him a license or privilege to go upon this tract of land and cut white-pine timber; that Foster gave him the right to cut whatever he wanted upon the land. Now, if the privilege was only to cut two white-pine trees, and the defendant after cutting them entered subsequently, and by repeated trespasses cut the other timber, we think the plaintiff can recover in this action for the timber taken at subsequent times to the cutting of the white-pine under the license from Foster. If, however, the whole timber was cut at the same time, the defendant had entered under the authority from Foster and while he was acting under the license from the owner, then the plaintiff cannot recover, for the reason that the exceeding of the authority to cut timber when the entry was lawful would not make the act a trespass.
