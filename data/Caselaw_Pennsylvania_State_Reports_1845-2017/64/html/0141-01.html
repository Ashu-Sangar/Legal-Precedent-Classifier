Whilst there he was informed by a constable that he held a warrant against him, issued by the defendant. The plaintiff then entered bail, before Justice Reed, for his appearance at court, and received a certificate thereof from Justice Reed. On his return from Justice Reed’s office he was arrested by the constable and taken before the defendant. He showed to defendant the certificate of Justice Reed that he had entered bail. The defendant required him to proceed to a hearing. The plaintiff offered to enter bail without hearing; this was refused by the justice. A hearing was had and plaintiff Avas committed for trial, the defendant refusing to take bail. As he was going to prison the defendant called the constable back, the prisoner was taken into the office, searched and a pistol taken from him. He was committed to prison; the constable was by his side, and the defendant walked behind him with a pistol in his hand. He asked for a drink of water; the defendant refused, and said he would shoot plaintiff if he turned to the right hand or the left.</p>

He was, therefore, not answerable in trespass, even if he was in error in holding the defendant, and committing him, for want of bail. If he maliciously or wantonly injured the plaintiff, by excess in any way, in the execution of his power as a magistrate, <em>case </em>was the remedy, not trespass. In Sommer <em>v. </em>Wilt, 4 S. &amp; R. 19, the doctrine of liability is thus stated: “ When the act is an immediate wrong against <em>all form of law, trespass vi et armis </em>is the proper action; but when the process is legal, but is used in an oppressive manner, <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>trespass on the case.” So in Barnett <em>v. </em>Reed, 1 P. F. Smith 190, in the opinion of the court by Strong, J., it is said: “If the judgment against Reed, the plaintiff below, and the execution thereon, sued out against him by the defendant, were not void, case, rather than trespass, was manifestly the remedy.” In Kramer <em>et al. v. </em>Lott <em>et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=14%20Wright%20495" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="14 Wright 495">14 Wright 495</a>, this distinction is maintained. The learned judge did not err, therefore, in holding that the action of trespass <em>vi et armis </em>did not, under the facts of the case, lie against the magistrate in this case. Nor did the evidence establish any act of trespass as magistrate, in which character he was sued, outside of the acts referred to above, and the charge of the court, that, “ upon the whole case, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover,” was entirely proper.</p>
