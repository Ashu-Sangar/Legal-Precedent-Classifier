        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThe question raised by this appeal is whether the amount awarded to a widow under the terms of an agreement for support constitutes a debt of the husband \u201ccontracted bona fide and for'an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d The learned court below ruled that it did. This appeal followed.\nSection one of the Act of June 24, 1939 P. L. 721, 72 PS 2302 et seq. (amending the Act of 1919, supra), as further amended, provided,, inter alia, for deductions for debts of a decedent in appraising and assessing Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax: \u201c. . . That the deductions herein allowed in the case of any indebtedness of the decedent shall, when founded upon a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d (Italics supplied)\nOn May 17,1946, James H. Mills and his wife, Anna Irene Mills, entered into a post-nuptial agreement, under seal, and which preceded a divorce. In the recital to the agreement it is stated: \u201cWhereas, both the Husband and Wife have accumulated estates and the Husband wishes to make proper provision for the support, maintenance and comfort of his Wife, whether they be divorced or their marital ties continue.\u201d The consideration named was: \u201c. . . the mutual undertakings of the parties hereto as hereinafter contained, and in settlement, adjustment and compromise of all property questions and rights and liability for support and maintenance and in order to end a family controversy and in consideration of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar, in hand paid by each of the parties hereto to the other. . . .\u201d (Italics supplied) In the agreement the husband \u201cadmits and recognizes his legal liability to his wife for support and maintenance.\u201d He agreed: to pay his wife $300 a month while he was employed, and after his retirement $150 per month; real estate held by them in entireties could be sold after divorce and the husband\u2019s retirement and. proceeds divided equally; if such real estate was not sold \u201cbefore his death the husband\u2019s interest, therein was.to go to the'Wife;'he'als'0 agreed to make a'will leaving \u201call his estate to the wife; policies of life insurance payable to wife were to be irrevocable. The wife agreed that real estate held by them in entireties could be sold after divorce and her husband\u2019s retirement and proceeds equally divided; in the event that the wife predeceased her husband before sale of the real estate, the husband was to receive a one third interest therein and the wife agreed to make a will leaving her husband one third of her estate. The wife by this agreement effectively surrendered all other right to support. The parties were subsequently divorced. The husband, until his death, complied with the agreement. His will was probated. The Commonwealth assessed a transfer inheritance tax on the amount payable to the widow. At the audit of the account of the executrix, the widow presented her claim as creditor, Avhich was allowed.\nIn Neller Estate, 356 Pa. 628, 53 A. 2d 122, it was decided by a majority of this Court, contra to the doctrine in the Federal jurisdiction, that a wife\u2019s waiver of her marital rights may constitute the consideration for a contractually created debt of the husband. The majority and minority views were expressed in etctenso in the majority and dissenting opinions. It would be unnecessarily repetitious again to repeat the legal principles. In Stadtfeld Estate, 359 Pa. 147, 58 A. 2d 478, we reaffirmed the doctrine of Neller Estate. Mr. Justice Horace Stern said, p. 151: \u201c. . . in Neller Estate, 356 Pa. 628, 53 A. 2d 122, which held that the share of a decedent\u2019s estate due to his widow under a separation agreement is not subject to the Pennsylvania transfer inheritance tax since the payment made to the widow out of the estate is not in the nature of a legacy but is merely the liquidation of a debt.\u201d\nIn the dissenting opinion in Stadtfeld Estate, supra, p. 155, it was said: \u201cIn Neller Estate, 356 Pa. 628, 53 A. 2d 122, we decided that a spouse was a creditor under a postnuptial settlement agreement.-What-a spouse gives up under such an agreement represents \u2018money or money\u2019s worth\u2019. It is true that under the Federal Estate Tax Act such a deduction is not allowable. Such an obligation is not regarded under Federal law as being based upon \u2018money or money\u2019s worth\u2019. See citation of authorities in dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Jones in the Neller case.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth in the present case challenges the ruling of the court below that the present agreement creates a debt due the widow which meets the statutory requirement that also it must be founded upon \u201can adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d\nThe late Chief Justice Maxey said in Neller Estate, supra, p. 636: \u201c. . . when this husband and wife decided to separate and the husband promised his wife in writing that he would support her by paying the sums stipulated, this promise gave rise to a debt. The amount of support due at his death was as much a debt as would have been any arrearages in the weekly sums he had agreed to pay her for her support.\u201d\nSince the decision in Neller Estate, supra, it is no longer an open question in Pennsylvania that a bona fide separation agreement between a husband and wife providing for a payment at the husband\u2019s death, constitutes a debt and is consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\nFurthermore, the Neller case was dated April 18, 1917, while the Legislature of 1917 was still in session. We said in Salvation Army Case, 319 Pa. 105,110, 36 A. 2d 179: \u201cIf our interpretation were not consonant with the legislative purpose, it was within the power of the legislature to amend the Act in order to effectuate that purpose.\u201d It is most significant that two sessions of the Legislature have passed since the Neller decision, but no amendment to the Act as construed by this Court has been enacted: Chester School District\u2019s Audit, 301 Pa. 203, 211, 151 A.. 801; Lower Nazareth Township Supervisors\u2019 Appeal, 341 Pa. 171, 175, 19 A. 2d 92.\nAs required by the statute, supra, in order to secure deduction for debts of a decedent in a transfer inheritance tax assessment, it is necessary to establish that the debts \"were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d In Neller Estate, the majority opinion states that the debt was so established. In the present case no question is raised as to the bona fides of the agreement. However, a more searching inquiry should have been made in the court below concerning the ages of the parties, the extent of their respective property, the prospects of financial advancement and the earning capacity of the husband and an analysis of that which the wife relinquished and what she was to receive. All of this to ascertain, as nearly as possible, whether what the husband agreed to do was \u201cfor an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth,\u201d or at least, what part of it was such. The late Chief Justice Maxey said, in Neller Estate (356 Pa. 628, p. 635):\n\u201cUndoubtedly, there are some marital rights that cannot be expressed in terms of money but a wife\u2019s right to support certainly can be so expressed.\u201d While the amount cannot always in every case be arithmetically calculated, the inquiry must satisfy the hearing judge not only that the separation agreement was bona fide but that the amount of the debt represented a substantially adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth, for only to that extent is it a deductible tax exemption.\nWe note that the appeal is from a definitive decree of distribution, following an audit of an account in the Orphans\u2019 Court. In essence, however, it is an appeal from an assessment of a transfer inheritance tax by the Register of Wills. While the proper practice has not been followed (Reynolds Estate, 359 Pa. 616, 620, 60 A. 2d 57; Borie\u2019s Estate, 13 D. & C. 355, 357), to prevent circuity of action we will dispose of the tax question as if on a tax appeal: Laura E. Tobey\u2019s Estate, 10 D. & C. 229 (Gest, J).\nThe record remitted for the purposes indicated in this opinion. Costs to abide the event.",
