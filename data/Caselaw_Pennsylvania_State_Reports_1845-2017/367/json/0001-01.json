        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice-Chidsey,\n\" Antonio Damiani, appellee,' filed this bill in equity against Anna Lobasco,. trustee under an inter vivos , deed of trust executed by- him, to compel her and Frank Lobasco, her husband, .appellants, to execute a deed of conveyance to Patrick and Lena Damiani, his wife, contending that the settlor had reserved unto himself a power to direct the trustee to convey to such person or persons as he should request and designate. An answer was filed which, in effect, denied that settlor possessed a power of revocation, but instead, asserted a right in the trustee to determine whether a conveyance should be executed. After hearing, the Chancellor filed his adjudication and granted the relief sought. This appeal is from the decree of the court en banc dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.\nThe Chancellor made the following findings of fact. Antonio Damiani is 80 years of age, a widower, and father of Anna Lobasco. He can neither read nor write the English language. On June 24, 1943, Antonio conveyed the premises situate at 1316 Moore Street, Philadelphia, to Anna Damiani, now Anna Lobasco, his daughter. The deed of conveyance establishing the trust, conferred upon Antonio the right to use the property, to occupy it, or to rent it, to receive the rents) issues and profits, and, in addition, Antonio was to pay all taxes, water rents, and other charges assessed against the property, during the full term of his natural life. Upon the death of Antonio, Anna was to hold the property for her own use in fee, subject to the payment of sums of money to her brothers and sisters, namely, $1,200 to Patrick Damiani,. $300 to Rose Damiani, $300 to Lucy Damianij $300 to Margaret Damiani, and $300 to Frank Damiani. The- deed contained the following provision: \u201c. . . that it shall and may be lawful for the said Anna Damiani, at the request and with the consent of the said Antonio Damiani (testified by his joining in and becoming a party to the deed therefor) at any time during the lifetime of the said Antonio Damiani, to grant, sell and convey the said premises, free, clear and discharged of the said trusts.\u201d\nNo. consideration was in fact paid, although a consideration of $3,600 was stated in the deed. Prior and subsequent to the conveyance, Antonio continued to reside in the premises. On September 1, 1943, Anna and her husband and their minor daughter moved into the property, pursuant to an oral agreement with Antonio, whereby, in consideration of their use and occupancy, they agreed to keep the premises in .good order and repair, pay all taxes and water bills and other charges assessed against the property, provide the father with one meal a day, and furnish facilities for him to cook other meals. The father reserved the use of one room.\nThe parties continued thus to live together until December 10, 1949. On November 8, 1949, Antonio entered into an agreement with Patrick Damiani and Lena, his wife, to sell the premises to them for the sum of $5,000 and requested Anna to execute, acknowledge, and deliver a deed, for the premises to them. This she refused to do. The Chancellor, on the basis of the foregoing facts, concluded that the deed of June 24, 1943, was testamentary in character and, therefore, revocable at will by the settlorthat the. said.deed; contained an express reservation to Antonio of the right to revoke; that the right of revocation had been duly and properly exercised; and, that Patrick, Rose, Margaret, Lucy, and Prank Damiani acquired no vested rights. by virtue of the deed of June 24, 1943. A decree nisi .was, entered, directing Anna and her husband to execute, acknowledge,.and:deliver a fee simple deed, joined in- by Antonio, conveying the-premises .to.-Patrick, and Lena Damiani, or to such other nominee \u00e1s Antonio might select. The Chancellor further entered judgment in favor of Anna and Prank against Antonio in the sum of $1,500 to . reimburse them\" .for permanent improvements made by them subsequent to the execution of the deed. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court en heme and a final decree entered. This appeal, followed.\nAppellants contend that (1): an interest in the real estate vested immediately in Anna Damiani and the instrument of conveyance was not testamentary, and (2) the deed contained'a power of revocation whieh could be exercised only .by the trustee consenting to join in a deed of conveyance with the settlor.\nAntonio Damiani, by virtue of the deed of trust executed by him, created an inter vivos trust vesting possession and full enjoyment thereof in his daughter, Anna, after his death. He reserved to himself a beneficial life estate and gave to his daughter, Anna, a vested right to the full, enjoyment of the property upon his death. The fact that actual. possession and enjoyment were deferred does not prohibit or prevent the vesting of the interest. Nor does the obligation to pay-certain sums of money to her sisters and brothers affect the vesting of her interest. Such provisions, it is clear,- do not make the trust testamentary: Shapley Trust, 353 Pa. 499, 500-501, 46 A. 2d 227 ; Murphey v. C. I. T. Corporation, 347 Pa. 591, 594, 33 A. 2d 16; Reese\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 473, 474, 177 A. 792; J. P. Lines v. W. E. Lines, 142 Pa. 149, 167, 21 A. 809; Dickerson\u2019s Appeal, 115 Pa. 198, 210, 8 A. 64; Lyon Trust, 164 Pa. Superior Ct. 140, 144, 63 A. 2d 415; Restatement, Tmsts, Sections 56 (f) and 57 (1).\nAppellee relies upon Frederick\u2019s Appeal, 52 Pa. 338, and cases following it, particularly Rick\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 528, 535, to establish his contention that a deed of trust made for the grantor\u2019s ow-n- personal convenience is revocable at pleasure. This Court has said, however,' in Rynd v. Baker, 193 Pa. 486, 491-492, that Frederick\u2019s Appeal, supra, is limited-to its- own' peculiar facts and is- not authority for the 'proposition that every voluntary, trust conveyance of property which reserves to the grantor a life interest with a direction to convey the principal of his estate at death to others is a testamentary instrument and, therefore, revocable at will. Further, Rich\u2019s Appeal, supra, is in-apposite in that in the instant case there is not even a suggestion that Antonio was deceived through false representations of the grantee, that the trust was improvident, or that it left him without sufficient means of support.\nAppellants\u2019 contention that the power of the settlor to revoke can be exercised only with the consent of the trustee must also be sustained. Where a settlor of a trust reserves a power to revoke in a given manner and under certain conditions revocation cannot be effected in another manner: Shapley Trust, supra, Reese\u2019s Estate supra, Restatement, Trusts, Section 330 (j).\nThe deed of trust executed by Antonio Damiani provided a means and method of revoking or terminating the trust.. Termination \u201cshall and may be lawful\u201d and effected by the trustee executing a deed of conveyance \u201cat the request and with the consent of the\u201d settlor. The words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d are often used together, in the sense that the word \u201cshall\u201d expresses futurity only and implies- no obligation. See Brown v. Southern Ry. Co., 187 Fed. 481, 39 Words and Phrases, p. 120. The conjunctive use of these words in the instant case gives the trustee power and discretion if requested to execute a deed of conveyance, to convey the premises, with the settlor\u2019s joinder, and thus terminate the trust and obtain her discharge from any obligations or duties thereund\u00e9r.\nWhile th\u00e9 intention of a settlor is the guide primarily to be followed in construing a deed of trust (Wotters Estate, 359 Pa. 520, 59 A. 2d 147) it is nevertheless the language used. which -controls: Thompson Trust, 348 Pa. 228, 35 A. 2d 261. Equally well established is the principle that \u201csince the settlor had it in his power to define exactly what was to be given and what reserved, he shall be held to have intended to give everything not expressly reserved and the writing will be construed most strongly against him, every inference of law being drawn in favor of his grantee:.. Wood v. Paul, 250 Pa. 508, 514, 95 A. 720. Clearly, settlor here did not reserve unto himself the exclusive power of revocation,, accomplishable by a few simple words. Instead, the reason for which we need not surmise, he provided a method of termination, an essential part of which was an exercise of discretion by the trustee. Where the exercise of a reserved power is made dependent upon the acquiescence of a trustee other than the settlor himself, the procurement of such acquiescence is necessary to enable the settlor to act: Shapley Trust, supra; Reese\u2019s Estate, supra. See Cleveland Trust Co. v. White, 134 Ohio 1, 15 N. E. (2d) 627, 118 A. L. R. 475; Restatement,. Trusts, Section 330 (1).\nWe conclude that the trustee had a- discretionary power and could not be compelled to terminate the trust. To the extent to which discretion is conferred upon the trustee, the exercise of the power granted is not subject to the control of the court, except to prevent an abuse by the trustee of her discretion: Brown\u2019s Appeal, 345 Pa. 373, 29 A. 2d 52; Restatement, Trusts, Section 330 (1).\nThe decree of the court below directing \u00e1 conveyance by appellants is reversed and the money judgment entered in their favor is set aside, the parties to pay their respective costs.",
