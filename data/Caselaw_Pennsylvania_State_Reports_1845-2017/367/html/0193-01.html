    <p id="b217-5" data-blocks='[["BL_217.7",217,[172,561,1151,764]]]'>Plaintiff, a contract carrier by motor vehicle, brought an action of assumpsit against defendant for the cost of operation plus a reasonable profit guaranteed him under a written contract dated August 30, <em>1987, </em>and recovered a verdict of $16,050.13. Defendant appealed from (the judgment on the verdict which was entered following) the lower court’s refusal to enter a judgment n.o.v. or to grant a new trial. What is the proper construction of the contract; was the contract legal; was plaintiff’s evidence sufficient to establish his case? — These are the most important questions involved in this appeal. From 1200 pages of testimony we shall briefly summarize the important facts.</p>
    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.8",217,[171,1356,1152,994]],["BL_218.1",218,[263,342,1152,1484]]]'>Plaintiff was employed by defendant as a truck driver commencing in 1933. In 1936 defendant persuaded plaintiff and' other truck drivers of defendant to purchase their own trucks and become contract carriers, orally promising plaintiff (and others) that if they did so they would be given steady work and would make a profit and that their earnings would be considerably increased over those they received as ordinary truck drivers. On August 30, 1937, plaintiff and defendant entered, into the aforesaid written contract which was prepared by counsel for defendant and was subsequently filed by counsel for defendant with the Public Utility Commission of Pennsylvania. A similar contract was prepared by defendant and executed by it and 31 other truck drivers of defendant at approximately the same time. The contract was for a period of one year, renewable automatically for a further term of one year and so on from year to year unless 15 days’ <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>written notice was given by either party of his or its intention to terminate the same. The agreement provided that the plaintiff (carrier) would furnish a truck suitable to defendant; that <em>he would be subject to call at any time; </em>that he would <em>personally drive </em>the truck (in the absence of sickness, etc.); that his truck would be available for loading and transporting defendant’s merchandise at such times and places as defendant should designate; that the transportation was to be within the State of Pennsylvania and the contract was to be subject to the laws, rules and regulations of the proper regulatory bodies. There then followed this very important provision with respect to compensation: “9. The parties mutually agree that the compensation for such service outlined above <em>shall not be </em>fixed<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> but shall vary with the tonnage, mileage, loading and unloading time, number of stops, road and weather conditions. The parties hereto shall from time to time make such adjustments of the compensation as shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties. <em>Company hereby guarantees to Carrier compensation at least equal to the full cost of operation of the typical or average operator of the same class as Carrier for similar service, plus a reasonable profit. The minimum </em>of such charges to be paid shall be subject to review, fixing and ascertainment by any regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof.”</p>
    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[266,1849,1147,432]]]'>It will be instantly noted that the <em>compensation was not fixed </em>but, because of the indefinite and uncertain services to be rendered by the carrier, the compensation was to vary with a number of varying factors and a cost-plus profit was guaranteed. The importance of this cost-plus clause in the construction of the contract and the Question of compensation will hereinafter more fully appear.</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>Based upon the aforesaid contract, plaintiff, through defendant’s counsel, filed an application with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission for a contract carrier’s permit, which the Commission granted on <em>November </em>16, <em>1937. </em>On September 30, 1940, defendant, on behalf of plaintiff, filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission a <em>schedule of minimum </em>rates effective November 16, 1937. <em>This schedule contained the rates based on weight and mileage on a zone basis for two types of commodities. </em>One of the obvious purposes was to provide plaintiff with some regular compensation for his work as it was performed.</p>

    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[176,1239,1152,882]]]'>The conduct of both plaintiff and defendant clearly indicates that the parties believed and intended the contract of <em>1937 </em>to be binding. Not only did the plaintiff so testify, but (a) in <em>1943 </em>defendant brought an action against plaintiff upon the aforesaid contract of <em>1937 </em>in which it <em>averred that said contract was still in full force and effect; </em>and (b) on February 1, <em>1944, </em>defendant and plaintiff entered into a supplemental written agreement amending (in immaterial matters) “the <em>present </em>contract entered into between the parties hereto dated the 30th day of August <em>1937" </em>and reaffirming and ratifying said contract of August 30, 1937. How then is it possible for defendant to <em>now </em>maintain that the parties <em>intended </em>to abrogate the contract of 1937 and supersede it by the rates filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission?</p>

No authority is cited, and we have found none,- to support defendant’s contention. On the contrary, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Law throughout, and especially in Section 802 (a), 66 P. S., Section 1302, Section 809 (a), 66 P.S., Section 1309; and Section 810, 66 P.S. Section 1310, all refer to <em>minimum </em>rates. For example, Section 802 (a) provides: “The commission shall have the power .... to regulate contract carriers by motor vehicle .... and to that end the commission <em>may prescribe minimum rates </em>which are just and reasonable......” Section 809 (a) provides.: “. . . . No such contract carrier shall engage in the transportation of passengers or property, unless the <em>minimum charges </em>for such transportation by such carrier have been filed with the commission, <em>or copies of all contracts </em>reduced to writing and filed with the commission. No <em>reduction shall be made in any charge </em>.... No such carrier shall .... charge, or collect a <em>less </em>compensation for such transportation than the charges filed in accordance with this section .... or by any other device whatsoever, to charge, accept or receive <em>less than the minimum </em>charge so filed . . . .” Section 810 empowers the Commission upon complaint or its own motion to <em>“prescribe minimum rates”. </em>No authority is conferred upon the Commission to fix maximum, or maximum and minimum rates of a contract carrier. It follows, therefore, that an agreement of a contract carrier which provides for minimum and maximum rates (cost plus reasonable profit) is not a violation of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Law, especially since in no event could the rates charged by the contract carrier fall below the schedule of minimum rates filed with the Commission.</p>

The contract also provided that the compensation for the transportation of such merchandise should be <em>2‡ per ton mile </em>and further provided that <em>“Nothing in this agreement shall prevent the Company from paying the Carrier reasonable additional compensation </em>based upon and varying with the type of service, the flow of tonnage and territory involved and served.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> Defendant contends that the agreement of <em>1939 </em>was intended to apply to all transportation <em>outside </em>of Pennsylvania and that the plaintiff could legally recover only <em>2‡ </em>per ton mile.

But the court also found, as did the jury under proper instructions, that the plaintiff and defendant intended the plaintiff to be compensated for both intra-state and inter-state transportation in accordance with the terms of the guarantee set forth in the aforesaid contract of <em>1937. </em>A written agreement may be modified, of course, by a subsequent oral agreement and this modification may be shown by words or conduct, or both. <em>Knight v.

In the first place, the plaintiff and his witnesses testified that it was the intention of the parties, and that they had agreed, that contract carriers would be compensated for both intra-state and inter-state. transportation as provided by the <em>1937 </em>agreement; in the second place the acts and conduct of the defendant corroborated this understanding. For example, the defendant <em>never </em>paid the plaintiff <em>2‡ </em>per ton mile as fixed by the said contract of <em>1939. </em>On the contrary, the uncontradicted evidence showed that all transportation <em>outside </em>of Pennsylvania was paid for by defendant under the zone rate schedules filed with the Public Utility Com<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>mission under the contract of <em>1937. </em>Furthermore, the 7%% overall increases and minimum load guarantees agreed upon by plaintiff and defendant in <em>1946 </em>were applied by both parties <em>equally to intrastate and interstate transportation. </em>Perhaps most convincing of all, defendant in the detailed record which it kept of plaintiff’s transportation services, expenses, etc., <em>did not segregate </em>the intra-state and the inter-state hauls or the expenses or payments due under each. It seems too clear for argument that if defendant believed plaintiff was entitled to a specific compensation for transportation services <em>within </em>Pennsylvania and to a <em>different </em>compensation for transportation services in <em>inter-state </em>commerce, it would have <em>Icept a separate record </em>of and paid plaintiff a different compensation for each of said services. It is also clear that the agreement of <em>1939 </em>was intended not only to provide for a minimum compensation but also for <em>additional compensation </em>for plaintiff. Moreover, as we have seen, defendant in <em>1943 </em>sued on the contract of <em>1937 </em>which it said was then still in effect and binding upon the parties; and in <em>1944 </em>defendant executed an amendment to the <em>1937 </em>contract. The jury found from adequate evidence and under proper instructions, that the parties intended that the plaintiff was entitled to the cost of operation plus a reasonable profit for both intra-state and interstate transportation.</p>

If a cost accountant had been employed by a truck driver to compute costs per ton mile or per zone ton, he would have had to qualify every figure he arrived at by explaining that this figure was a cost per ton mile for hauling certain commodities in certain loads over certain routes with the figures changing and varying with different commodities, loads, roads and weather' conditions. That would be ridiculous. On the other hand, taking as plaintiff did, the total costs of half a dozen typical carriers on a yearly or other basis and then averaging the cost would give a reasonable, practical and substantially accurate measure of the full cost of operation within the meaning and intent of paragraph 9 of the agreement of <em>1937.</em>

This theory is re<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>futed first by tbe facts, and secondly by tbe testimony. For example, only <em>one </em>of tbe eighteen contract carriers serving defendant under the original agreement operated a “U” truck, and only one a “V” truck, and only one a “ZZ” truck. Under defendant’s theory these carriers could recover no guaranteed cost and profit under the contract of 1937 because there could not be a typical or average operator in their class. Moreover there was testimony that the six witnesses for plaintiff all took about the same load as plaintiff, irrespective of the weight or size of their truck; and there was likewise sufficient evidence (giving plaintiff as we must on a motion for judgment n.o.v. the benefit of every fact and every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom and viewing the testimony in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> to enable the jury to find that these witnesses were typical or average contract carriers of the same class as plaintiff and that they rendered similar service.</p>

Proof of the costs of operation and a reasonable profit in an unusual case such as this would obviously be difficult, and the problem must necessarily be approached from a practical and reasonable consideration of the situation of the parties, the nature of the subject matter of the contract and all the surrounding circumstances, as well as the objects the parties had in view. Taking into consideration all of these factors and elements, the testimony of plaintiffs certified public accountant was both admissible and adequate.
