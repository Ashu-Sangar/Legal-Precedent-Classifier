That it was the former seems clear. The intent of a testator is to be gathered from the whole will, or as frequently said, from its four corners: <em>March Estate, </em><a href="/pa/357/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="357 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="472090" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0216-01">357 Pa. 216</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20606" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="53 A.2d 606">53 A. 2d 606</a>; <em>Mulert Estate, </em><a href="/pa/360/0356-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="360 Pa. 356" data-case-ids="475103" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0356-01">360 Pa. 356</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20A.2d%20841" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="61 A.2d 841">61 A. 2d 841</a>; <em>Butler Estate, </em><a href="/pa/364/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="364 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1223554" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0279-01">364 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20110" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="72 A.2d 110">72 A. 2d 110</a>. Because of the exclusion and <em>in terrorem </em>clauses testatrix clearly indicates an intent to limit her son and grandchildren to life estates. There is a clear indication that she did not intend to die intestate. Cf. <em>Siple et ux. v. Greumelli et al., </em><a href="/pa/357/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="357 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="472100" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0237-01">357 Pa. 237</a>, 241, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20607" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="53 A.2d 607">53 A. 2d 607</a>; <em>Carmany Estate, </em><a href="/pa/357/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="357 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="472086" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0296-01">357 Pa. 296</a>, 299, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20731" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="53 A.2d 731">53 A. 2d 731</a>; <em>Butler Estate, </em>supra.

      <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>When testatrix, in the third item of the will, refers to a “Charitable Institution”, .she was referring to a corporation or organization established and equipped for <em>charitable purposes. </em>The particular “institution” that testatrix intended to select she said Avas to be “hereinafter more particularly designated.” This she failed to do. This Court has held that an “institution” is an agency designated to implement a cause and carry it into effect: <em>Funk </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/353/0321-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="353 Pa. 321" data-case-ids="465827" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0321-01">353 Pa. 321</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=45%20A.2d%2067" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="45 A.2d 67">45 A., 2d 67</a>. In that case, which has peculiar application to the present one, the gift was “to .some worthy cause or institution”. Mr. Justice Horace Stern, said, p. 323: “Did testatrix use the word ‘worthy’ as synonymous Avith ‘charitable’? If so, the bequest would not fail for uncertainty merely because she did not specify the particular institution which was to receive the:benefit of her bounty, for in such event it would be the duty of the court to appoint a trustee and by its decrees, enforce her testamentary intent: (citing statutes, and cases).” Here, however, testatrix wrote: <em>“charitable” </em>institution.. This removes all possible doubt as to testamentary intent, viz.: that she was primarily interested in charity rather than the particular institution which she intended thereafter to name to administer the fund. Had there been no further designation of the nature of the charitable bequest than <em>“to charity” </em>it would still have been valid: <em>Jordan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="329 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1181383" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0427-01">329 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=197%20A.%20150" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="197 A. 150">197 A. 150</a>. Testatrix, however, went further. In the eighth.item of the will she gave the corpus <em>“unto the Charitable Institution for Crippled Children, heretofore referred to in this my last Will. . </em>. .” She finished the sentence with the words: <em>“and known as, and more .particularly designated as. . . </em>.” She neglected to <em>name </em>an institution.</p>
