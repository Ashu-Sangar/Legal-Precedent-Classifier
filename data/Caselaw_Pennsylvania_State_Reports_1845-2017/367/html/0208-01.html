From the fact findings of the court below and the undisputed evidence we gather the following material facts :.M. T.

In 1916 he incorporated his enterprise under the name of M. T. Garvin &amp; Company: see <em>Garvin’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/335/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="335 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1193079" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0542-01">335 Pa. 542</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20976" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 A.2d 976">6 A. 2d 976</a> (1939). In the fall of 1930 he incorporated the Coleman Realty Company with a capital of $300,000 divided into six thousand shares of $50.00 each for the purpose of separating the real estate ownership from the mercantile business. After organization of the Coleman Company the title to the real estate occupied by Garvin &amp; Company was. conveyed by that company to the Coleman Company in exchange for all of the (6,000)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> shares of stock of the latter company. At the organization meeting of the Coleman Company, by-laws were adopted by unanimous vote of the incorporators in which Article VIII, section 4, imposed, inter alia, the following restrictions on the transfer of stock, viz., “Section 4. No stock shall be sold or transferred by any stockholder to any person not already a stockholder until an offer has first been given to the corporation or the remaining stockholders in proportion to their interest in the corporation, to purchase said stock at its book value as appearing on the books of the company, except that stock may be transferred by any stockholder to an employee in recognition of his service and ability in behalf of the corporation.”</p>

Two days after the organization meeting, viz., January 2, 1931, M. T. Garvin &amp; <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>Company distributed 4,000 shares of its 5,998 shares to its shareholders who were also the employees of M. T. Garvin &amp; Company in the nature of a dividend on the Garvin stock made payable in Coleman stock. M. T. Garvin personally received by way of this stock dividend 3280 of the 4,000 shares and immediately purchased the remaining 720 shares from those who had received these shares so that thereafter M. T. Garvin owned individually 4,000 shares of the Coleman Company stock. Until his death Mr. Garvin remained the principal shareholder of both companies and was the president of both. Restrictions in similar language were also imposed upon stock of the Garvin Company: see <em>Garvin’s Estate, </em>335 Pa.'542, 6A. 2d 976 (1939).</p>

During Mr. Garvin’s lifetime, no questions or difficulty arose. He died in 1937 and, by his will, he provided for the acquisition of the Garvin Company stock by the employes of that company: See <em>Garvin’s </em>Estate, supra, but through some oversight or omission, he made no similar provision for the disposition of 4,000 shares which he held in the Coleman Company. Though these corporations were separate entities, it may be he thought of them as one company. Be that as it may, the executors felt obligated to sell the stock but carefully conformed to the restrictions by first offering it to Garvin &amp; Company (the principal holder apart from Garvin’s estate) and to all the other shareholders of the Coleman Company. They were, apparently, unable to purchase so large a block of stock and the <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>Garvin Estate executors then sold the same to Elizabeth Stauffer Ludgate, now the president of the Coleman Realty Company, and one of the defendants in the bill. The certificate issued to her was subject to and had indorsed thereon the same restriction as appeared on all other stock certificates.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[258,680,1149,605]]]'>On May 6, 1949, a meeting of the shareholders of Coleman Company was held and sections 3, 4 and 5 of Article VIII of the by-laws which restrict the transfer of shares were repealed by the vote of the 4,000 shares held by Mrs. Ludgate against 1903% shares held by other stockholders which protested the repeal and voted against it. The repeal resolution contained a provision requiring every one of the stockholders, within fifteen days after notice by the secretary, to surrender all share certificates held by them, whereupon this proceeding followed.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[257,1307,1149,604]]]'>The learned chancellor ruled (1) that the final article of the by-laws which provided that they (the by-laws) might be “amended, altered, modified or added to” by vote of a majority of the stock applied as much to the article imposing the restrictions on transfer of stock as to any other provisions and that no stockholder had any vested right in the restrictions repealed. (2) He further ruled that apart from that view the restrictive provisions of the by-law had not been .continually observed so that abrogation thereof must be implied.</p>
    <p id="b234-6" data-blocks='[["BL_234.6",234,[259,1933,1148,377]]]'>We think the court below erred in both rulings. Though, as observed by the learned chancellor, there are apparently no decisions in this State on the question of the right of a majority to repeal a by-law imposing transfer restrictions on stock, we have no difficulty coming to the opposite conclusion on general principles.</p>

      <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>Provisions in corporate by-laws may, generally speaking, be divided into two classes (a) those that are mere regulations governing the conduct of the internal affairs of the corporation. These may be repealed, altered and amended at the will of the majority unless a greater vote is required by the by-laws themselves or by statute, (b) Provisions in the nature of a contract which are evidently designed to vest property rights <em>inter se </em>among all stockholders. These cannot be repealed or changed without the consent of the other parties whose rights are affected.</p>
    <p id="b235-3" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[178,958,1152,830]]]'>The provision here sought to be repealed is clearly in class (b), for it is in effect a contract between the corporation and its stockholders and the stockholders with each other whereby each stockholder in consideration of his taking the stock subject to the restriction imposed, is given an option to have the stock any other stockholder wishes to sell, first offered to the company or to him in proportion to his interest in the company. The contract is evidenced by the provisions printed on the certificates which become binding on the acceptance of the certificate. So viewed it is idle to argue that stockholders are not being deprived of a substantial property right contrary to the law of the land which forbids the deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[179,1803,1149,489]]]'>Mrs. Ludgate herself accepted the certificate for the stock she bought subject to the restrictions which she now seeks to eliminate. Having so agreed to them she is bound by them and had she endeavored to resell all or any part of the stock so acquired without giving her fellow stockholders the option to first buy it, she could have been restrained. Is a court of equity so blind as to permit her to do by indirection what she may not do directly?</p>

The chancellor found that many shares issued by Coleman Company including shares issued to the plaintiffs, were issued without the restrictions having been observed and upon that ground held that the section in question must be regarded as suspended or abrogated because of this long continued disregard. In so ruling he relied on our recent case of <em>Elliott v.

Thus, at the completion of the plan, M. T. Garvin held 4,000 shares, Garvin Company 1,998 shares, Bechtold 1 share and A. A. Cauller 1 share.

The restrictions there had <em>never </em>been observed. The rationale of that decision of course is that since all parties entitled to the benefit of stock transfer restrictions are competent to agree expressly to abrogate them, they may do so just as effectually by implication. It having been found in that case that they had done so by their conduct, the conclusion there reached naturally followed.</p>

Certainly no such conclusion can be drawn from the way in which the original issue and transfers back to Garvin took place. Nor is it even clear that when shareholders and employees of Garvin &amp; Company acquired stock from each other they did not act under the reasonable assumption that the exemption of transfer to employees in the by-law referred to employees of the Garvin Company. Coleman Company was clearly not an operating company; it had <em>officers </em>but in all probability, being a mere holding company, had few, if any, <em>employees. </em>Under such circumstances a conclusion of intention to waive or abrogate the restrictions by conduct cannot reasonably be drawn.</p>
