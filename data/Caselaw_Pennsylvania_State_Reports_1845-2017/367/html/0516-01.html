Defendant Schneider was President and Manager of Associated Manufacturing Corporation, one of the defendants, and Secretary-Treasurer of Associated Products, Inc., another defendant. <em>Schneider failed to bring with him under subpoena the minute booh and charter of Associated Products, Inc. </em>The two corporate defendants had on hand approximately 800 units of the mechanical devices involved.

His counsel thereupon several times offered to produce the books and have them in court within one hour to an hour and fifteen minutes, but the court was enraged at Schneider’s failure to produce the books and refused to consider counsel’s offer. The court’s attitude and viewpoint appears clearly from the following excerpts in the record: <em>“Mr. Auld: </em>If the Court please, the subpoena which was served on Associated Products, Inc. was a little indefinite inasmuch as it read, ‘For all records as of July 1, 1950.’ We were a bit confused because Associated Products, Inc. was not in existence on July 1, 1950 and therefore we haven’t got the complete records as far as Associated Products is concerned. We have the record insofar as the dealings of Associated Manufacturing Corporation with Surco Products. We have those here. . . . Q. Why haven’t you produced it? A. Because Associated Products, Inc. was not in existence July 1, 1950. Q. Does it say that in the subpoena? A. Yes. <em>Mr. Brennan: </em>Your Honor, I ask that this man be held in contempt of Court. <em>The Court: </em>We will so hold him in contempt of Court. . . . <em>Mr. Auld: </em>We have the records and are very willing to produce them and <em>this will virtually put the defendants out of business</em>

Mr. Brennan: </em>Make no shipments, deliveries or manufacture. <em>Mr. Auld: You mean completely out of business, </em>cannot operate in their own territories that are not bound in this agreement? <em>The Court: Cannot do anything at all for two days.
