Mills and his wife, Anna Irene Mills, entered into a post-nuptial agreement, under seal, and which preceded a divorce. In the recital to the agreement it is stated: “Whereas, both the Husband and Wife have accumulated estates and the Husband wishes to make proper provision for the support, maintenance and comfort of his Wife, whether they be divorced or their marital ties continue.” The consideration named was: “. . . the mutual undertakings of the parties hereto as hereinafter contained, <em>and in settlement, adjustment and compromise of all property questions and rights and liability for support and maintenance and in order to end a family controversy and in consideration of the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar, </em>in hand paid by each of the parties hereto to the other. . . .” (Italics supplied) In the agreement the husband “admits and recognizes his legal liability to his wife for support and maintenance.” He agreed: to pay his wife $300 a month while he was employed, and after his retirement $150 per month; real estate held by them in entireties could be sold after divorce and the husband’s retirement and. proceeds divided equally; if such real estate was not sold “before his death the husband’s interest, therein was.to go to the'Wife;'he'als'0 agreed to make a'will leaving “all <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>his estate to the wife; policies of life insurance payable to wife were to be irrevocable. The <em>wife </em>agreed that real estate held by them in entireties could be sold after divorce and her husband’s retirement and proceeds equally divided; in the event that the wife predeceased her husband before sale of the real estate, the husband was to receive a one third interest therein and the wife agreed to make a will leaving her husband one third of her estate. The wife by this agreement effectively surrendered all other right to support. The parties were subsequently divorced. The husband, until his death, complied with the agreement. His will was probated. The Commonwealth assessed a transfer inheritance tax on the amount payable to the widow. At the audit of the account of the executrix, the widow presented her claim <em>as creditor, </em>Avhich was allowed.</p>

In the present case no question is raised as to the <em>bona fides </em>of the agreement. However, a more searching inquiry should have been made in the court below concerning the ages of the parties, the extent of their respective property, the prospects of financial advancement and the earning capacity of the husband and an analysis of that which the wife relinquished and what she was to receive. All of this to ascertain, as nearly as possible, whether what the husband agreed to do was “for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth,” or at least, what part of it was such.
