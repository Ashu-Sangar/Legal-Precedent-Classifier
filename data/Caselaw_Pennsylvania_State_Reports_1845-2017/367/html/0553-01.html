The court below, on November 16, 1949, entered an order refusing the prayer of the petition, thereby permitting the child to remain with the father and pater-, nal great-grandfather. The Superior Court reversed the <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>lower court.

The parents separated , in 1945. Anna was thereafter employed as a practical nurse. Because of that employment and her defective vision, the child was cared for from time to time and largely reared by his great-grandfather, with whom he lived while in Pennsylvania. Divorce proceedings were instituted in Ohio by the mother. A hearing was had on April 5, 1949, and on April 8, 1949, a decree was entered divorcing the parents and providing with respect to the child: “It is further ordered that the Plaintiff be and is hereby awarded the temporary custody of the said minor child but due to the present physical condition of the plaintiff, it is further ordered that the said child continue to be domiciled with the paternal grandfather.” (Inadvertently the order read “grandfather” rather than “great-grandfather”.) The child had returned to Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, with James' A... Cowher, the .great-grandfather, on April 1, 1949, four days before the hearing: and seven days prior to the decree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The Ohio court further ordered that the arrangement as regards domicile should continue for a year and a half, after which time the issue of custody and domicile might be relitigated.

The latter decree awarded exclusive custody of the child to the mother and ordered the child to be domiciled with the mother’s sister and her blind husband in Arizona. The child, the husband, and the great-grandfather were not present at the hearing in Ohio which resulted in the modifying order, although David Graham received a letter from his wife’s attorneys advising him of the pendency of the action.

The Superior Court was of opinion, President Judge Rhodes dissenting, that (1) full faith and credit must be given to the Ohio decree of October 26, 1949, and (2) irrespective of full faith and credit, the best interests of the child required an award of custody to the mother.</p>

We believe it was unduly impressed by the lack of modern bathroom facilities in the home of the great-grandfather, and by the thought that the care of the child was left principally to the 78 year old great-grandfather. Child welfare representatives, neighbors of James A. Cowher, the great-grandfather, and the minister of the church in Shawville, Pennsylvania, all testified concerning the neat condition of the great-grandfather’s home, the favorable environment, and his good reputation and standing in the community. While the fitness of the great-grandfather was stressed, it is <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>clear that .the child’s relationship with its father is normal. The father takes part in the care of the child, lives in the same home, and is employed and able to maintain the home. The father’s mother who lives nearby does the child’s laundry, often helps to prepare his meals, and sees him frequently. The child has a relatively .comfortable and clean home. There is ample yard space to play, and abundant playthings are provided. He receives spiritual guidance from his great-grandfather and attends Sunday school regularly.

After a habeas corpus by the father for the custody of their three year old daughter the Municipal Court of Philadelphia County, in accordance with an agreement of the parents, <em>awarded the custody to the father. Shortly thereafter the child was sent to a </em>brother and sister-in-law of the father in Gallup, <em>New Mexico. </em>On February 25, 1946, the mother petitioned the Municipal Court of Philadelphia County for an order on the father <em>to compel him to have the child returned to Philadelphia County. </em>She admitted the parents had agreed that the father’s brother and sister-in-law could adopt the minor child there involved. It subsequently appeared that they had adopted the minor child, although some doubt still existed on that point.

It will be noted, of course, that the child had been sent to New Mexico under its order and was still there, although the court had awarded the custody to the father. This is exactly the present case. The Court in its opinion said (p. 288, 289) :</p>

In February 1942 a father who was a resident of Maine, obtained a writ of habeas corpus for the custody of his ten year old child. The child was living with the mother and they both had resided in Philadelphia since 1938. In the latter part of January 1942, several weeks before the petition for habeas corpus was filed, the mother sent the child to New York State to live with relatives.

The Ohio court and the court of Clearfield County found that both the mother and the great-grandfather were qualified to care for the child. The majority opinion, in an attempt to bolster its reason for awarding the child to the <em>great-</em>grandfather, points out that the father lives in the same (three-room) house as his son. So far as the merits are concerned, this is unimportant, in view of the fact that no court has ever awarded the son to <em>this </em>father; and the court of Clearfield County found that the little boy showed no interest in, or affection for, his father. The fact that the mother is a practical nurse; and that the <em>great-grandfather </em>is on relief; and that the child is living in a house <em>without any of the modern necessities of life, </em>furnishes strong additional reasons, if reasons be needed, why this young child should be with <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>his mother. The decision of the learned trial judge seems to have been too strongly influenced by his natural pride in the great county of Clearfield and its fine citizens.</p>

Admittedly, the child spent part of his time in Pennsylvania, but was in the State of Ohio with his great-grandfather for several months prior to the hearing and decree in divorce between his parents.” The evidence shows that the child went to live with his great-grandfather in Pennsylvania on April 1, 1949, <em>four </em>days before the hearing and that the court’s decree was formally entered on April 8, 1949. This could not change, as will hereinafter be demonstrated, the child’s domicile which, under the law, was that of his father’s, nor oust the jurisdiction of the Ohio court.</p>
