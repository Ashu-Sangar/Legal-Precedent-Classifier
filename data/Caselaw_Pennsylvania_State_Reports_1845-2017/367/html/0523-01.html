    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.7",546,[251,566,1150,643]]]'>Plaintiff brought a bill in equity against his grantors and their real estate agent, who sold him the property, and the mortgagees who took a mortgage thereon, praying that the deed to him from the former owners be canceled, the purchase money be repaid, and his mortgage and accompanying bond be canceled, on the ground, not of fraud, but that <em>a warranty was omitted from the sales agreement by mutual mistake. </em>There was no evidence that the alleged warranty was omitted from the sales agreement by mutual mistake and the court beloAV properly, as we shall see, dismissed plaintiff’s bill at the conclusion of his testimony.</p>
    <p id="b546-6" data-blocks='[["BL_546.8",546,[249,1230,1151,1137]],["BL_547.1",547,[159,329,1149,99]]]'>The important facts may be briefly summarized as follows: Plaintiff read an advertisement' in a Pittsburgh newspaper “Crafton-Five beautifully furnished apartments with baths, gas heat, income $365. . . .”, which was inserted by the owners’ real estate broker. <em>Plaintiff thereafter made three inspections of the premises. </em>He found that <em>the house contained four apartments </em>with bathrooms and kitchens; as well as three other rooms which were occasionally occupied by the owners and contained one sink and a hot plate. Plaintiff produced evidence (although denied) that one of the owners told him it would be possible to add a bath and kitchen to their rooms and thus make the three rooms into an additional apartment which could be rented for $120. a month. Plaintiff also testified that one of the owners misstated the annual cost of gas. Plaintiff, prior to making an offer of purchase, personally examined the gas bills, the tax bills, and the rents, and personally interviewed the tenants and discovered from them that the total rental was $245. a month instead of $365. a month, as stated in the above-mentioned advertisement. <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>Plaintiff then made an offer of $23,500. for the property, which was accepted.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[158,438,1153,978]]]'>An agreement of sale was prepared by defendant’s attorney, materially changed by plaintiff’s attorney, and thereafter on August 19, 1947, was executed by the purchaser and sellers. <em>The agreement of sale contained no statement or ivarranty as to the number of apartments or the monthly income therefrom. </em>On October 7, 1947, settlement was made and a deed delivered by the owners to plaintiff (which was duly recorded) and the plaintiff entered into possession. Plaintiff subsequently discovered, when he attempted to add an additional apartment to the premises, that there was an existing ordinance which was <em>unknown to any of the parties, </em>which prohibited more than a <em>four family apartment house </em>in the area in question. On January 27, 1948, plaintiff filed this bill in equity for cancellation of the deed and mortgages and repayment to him of the purchase price. From a decree dismissing the bill of complaint, plaintiff has taken this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[156,1428,1153,638]]]'>Assuming that the owner told plaintiff that by remodeling certain rooms plaintiff could convert said premises into a <em>five family </em>dwelling and thus realize <em>a gross income of $865. </em>per month, it is very doubtful that this would amount to a misstatement of an existing fact or a warranty on which plaintiff had a right to rely, instead of a mere expression of opinion: Cf. <em>Klerlein v.
