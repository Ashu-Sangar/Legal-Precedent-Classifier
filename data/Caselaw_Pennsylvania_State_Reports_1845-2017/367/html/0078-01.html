January 1,1941. On .May 4, 19.42,. under., his <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>leadership and direction, the congregation adopted a constitution and by-laws (although they were then operating under a corporate charter) which provided, inter alia, that the congregation should be known as the Church of the Brethren and, in Section 2: ‘Though it shall be the purpose of this congregation to work in harmony with all other branches of our own faith and name, and also with all other churches insofar as our doctrine of faith will permit, it shall nevertheless be the object of this group to maintain at all, times a strictly independent sovereignty, exercising the right of free choice in all matters, which is in keeping with the historic position of our church, same being strictly congregational in its form of government.’ The immediate reason for the adoption of this statement of sovereignty does not appear, but its purpose may be found in the defendants’ contention that dissension between the Reverend Mr. Snider and the Elders of the Middle Pennsylvania District began on or shortly after the date when the Reverend Mr. Snider assumed his ministry to. the Lewistown congregation. Thereafter, under the leadership of the Reverend Mr. Snider, the hymnbooks used by the congregation were changed and a hymnbook not published by the Church of the Breth-. ren was adopted. Likewise, the Sunday School literature was changed from that prepared by the Church of the Brethren to that published by a non-denominational publishing house. Neither of these acts, of itself, would constitute a departure from the doctrines of the church but, when considered with the other acts of the defendants, they assume importance as showing the real intention of the defendants or, more particularly, of the Reverend Mr. Snider. About 1948 the Church Council officially resolved not to forward money to the General Board of the church at Elgin, although this resolution was not carried, out and pay<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>ments were thereafter made at the direction of the Finance Committee.</p>

He likewise preached and spoke publicly on the same subject. This teaching was contrary to the historic peace doctrine of the church and the statement in the Declaration of Faith that the church ‘opposes on scriptural grounds, war and the taking of human life.’ Although it is true, as contended by the defendants, that the church did permit freedom of choice by the individual as to whether he should assert his conscientious objections to war when called for service, and that 80% of those called were inducted into service, the General'Conference of the church has a Standing Committee known as the Peace Committee whose duty it is to promote in every way possible ‘a realization of the wickedness and folly of war, and thus to build up a public conscience which shall demand peaceful methods in settling civil and international differences.’</p>

He particularly took issue with the action of the Annual Conference in joining the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America. Not only did he oppose affiliation with the Federal Council, but in his writings and in his public utterances from the pulpit he attacked the leadership of the church as false, apostate, modernist, corrupt, and unworthy of the support and respect of the members of the congregation. He also delivered personal attacks upon the leaders of the Mid-<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>die District of Pennsylvania..

There is an important difference between ‘The Church of the Brethren’ and the.‘Brethren Church’ as is indicated in the case of Main Street, Brethren Church of Myersdale vs. . Polman, 14 Somerset 49. While the selection of this name may have been accidental it was, at least, unfortunate.

Instead of answering the charges or appearing at the hearing at which the truth or falsity of the charges could be established by the church judicatory, the Reverend Mr. Snider wrote a letter dated April 24, 1948, to the Ministerial Board of the Middle District of Pennsylvania resigning his ministry in the Church of the Brethren, stating that the present leadership of the church had indicated the test of loyalty to the church to be contingent on one’s willingnéssto preach pacifism and approve the merger with the modernistic Federal Council of Churches of Christ in <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>America; that he was not a pacifist and that he was a fundamentalist.

By his letter of resignation the Reverend Mr. Snider fully recognized that there was a general Church of the Brethren whose leadership he claimed was corrupt and apostate and from which he desired to sever his connections. After resigning as a minister of that church he did not consider himself as an ordained minister of the gospel and he had to be re-ordained by the local congregation which had become an independent church. In their letter to E. W. Strauser informing him that his office as Elder had been declared vacant the defendants clearly showed that they considered a new status had been created since they told him that his office as Elder would not carry over anyhow inasmuch as the Shaw Avenue congregation had declared itself independent ‘ from the Church of the Brethren and his Eldership was in the latter. This is a clear recognition that there was a general denomination of the Church of the Brethren of which the Shaw Avenue congregation had been a part, but from which it had declared itself independent, and as a result of that declaration of independence his authority as an Elder of the Church of the Brethren was invalid. This view is further strengthened by the action of the Church Council on April 26th, 1948, which, in addition to adopting the name of Calvary Independent Church of the Brethren, also set forth its doctrinal belief and then stated that it would practice the ‘distinctive Brethren doctrines and teachings as set forth in the statement of faith which is published <em>by the church entitled “The Church of the Brethren,” </em>insofar as they are formed in agreement with God’s Word.’ Here is a recognition in an official resolution of the defendant congregation that there was a church entitled ‘The Church of the Brethren’ but that the local congregation was nó longer a part thereof but was merely adopting its statement of faith-, <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>and then only insofar as the local congregation considered it in agreement with God’s Word.”</p>

This proposition cannot be sustained for at - least two reasons. First,' the Church of the Brethren is-not strictly a congregational church in the sense that each congregation is sovereignly independent in-all matters. -This thought is well summarized in the-BastoNs Manual:(1925)' at-page 32.:. .‘Speaking after the analogy-of- civil -life/ the <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>government is a combination of pure democracy and representative democracy. In the local church it is the former. In the District and General Conferences it is the latter. . . . <em>The highest human authority in our system of government is the General </em>Conference, since its action represents the combined will of all the churches. The character :and policy of the local churches determine the character and policy of the General Conference. The local church and the General Conference are mutually conditioning factors, acting and reacting upon each other, the two influences combining to determine the character and trend of the church life.’ It may well be that in its beginning the Church of the Brethren was a strictly congregational type church and that the Annual Conference was created for exchange of ideas and mutual assistance; The Annual Conference is, however, an essential part of the Church of the Brethren and, historically, has existed at least since 1742. The District Conference of the Middle District, of Pennsylvania has existed since 1862. By a gradual process of evolution the authority and discipline of the Annual and District Conference has been enlarged and extended. The defendants themselves recognized this as the Reverend Mr. Snider resigned his ministry to the Ministerial Board of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and in their reply brief, page 22, the defendants say with reference to this dispute: ‘The whole matter has been before the <em>highest authority of the church) </em>probably presented by Charles Cherry himself, and <em>the.highest authority </em>did not make any claims of this kind and has not issued any statements upon which the plaintiffs could base their claims.’</p>

The defendants concede on page 3 of their brief that the words contained in the charter of the corporation, supplemented by the Act of April 26, 1855, and its amendments, create the trust under which the property is held by the congregation and, ‘it is to be used in accordance with and subject to the rules and regulations, usages, canons and discipline of the religious body, denomination or organization to which it belongs, namely the Church of the Brethren.’ A part of that ‘usage and discipline’ is the connection of the local church with the Annual Conference by which they become ‘mutually conditioning factors acting and reacting upon each other, the two influences combining to determine the character and trend of the church life.’ Here, the local congregation declared itself independent of the Annual Conference so that the ‘conditioning factor’, previously, as a part of its usage and discipline, is eliminated. In. place thereof the defendants state that they will recognize <em>no, authority </em>outside the local congregation and that they would practice the distinctive Brethren doctrines and. teachings of the Church of the -Brethren only insofar as they are formed ip agreement with God’s Word, thereby reserving to themselves the right to reject those doctrines and teachings which were not in agreement with their interpretation of God’s Word. This is essentially different from the purpose of the corporation as set forth in the 19Í7 charter where; the discipline and usages of the Church of the Brethren of the United States of America was distinctly recognized and accepted. This would be as great a departure from the usages and discipline .of. the denomination as would be a teaching of contrary- religious doctrine, and would be .a violation of the trusts under .'which the..property <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>was held. True, the defendants have not joined any other denomination as was done in the Myersdale case, but they have accomplished the same thing by setting themselves up as a church separate and apart from the general denomination of the Church of the Brethren. Being independent they would be free to join with any other denomination of their choice or to serve as a nucleus for a new and rival denomination.</p>

There is no dispute about the rule as applied to one other than the pastor, but in this instance the congregation made the acts of the Reverend Mr. Snider the acts of the congregation and it was by congregational action that the steps necessary to effect the declaration of independence were taken.

The defendants contend there was no authority to bring the action in the name of the corporation and that the election of the trustees was invalid since there was no vacancy in the office at that time. The action was brought against the defendants individually and as members of the congregation or group known and designated as the Calvary Independent Church of the Brethren. Throughout the case the matter was considered as though there were two separate and distinct congregations. As we view the situation there never were two congregations; there were merely two factions of the same congregation. The defendant’s group or faction attempted to take the congregation out of the Church of the Brethren while the plaintiffs’ group or faction is attempting to retain the former status of the congregation.

When a church has been organized, and been endowed, whether by donation or subscription, as belonging to any particular sect or in subordination to any particular form of church government it cannot break off from that connection and government.’ In the present case the church was organized as belonging to the Church of the Brethren of the United States of America and even though the minister and a majority of the congregation may disagree with the leadership of that denomination they cannot break off from the connection and the church government taking with them the property consecrated to the worship of God according to the faith, doctrine, discipline and usages commonly accepted by that denomination.</p>
