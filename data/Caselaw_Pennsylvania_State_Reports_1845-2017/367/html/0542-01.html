His argument is based almost entirely on the fact that the will was signed by a mark, plus inferences, and conclusions from inconsequential testimony which he alleges casts doubts and suspicion upon the validity of the will. His petition for an issue was joined in by an escheator appointed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, though their ultimate interests were conflicting and irreconcilable.</p>

Hilvick, George E. Park, and a friend of Mr. Park, Mrs. Elvira Sack, met in Thompson’s Restaurant on Fourth Avenue, in Pittsburgh, about" 10:00 a.m. on December 29, 1945. This was a well known meeting place for Russian speaking people. Hilvick was a student of the Russian language and came there that morning at the invitation of Zakatoff and Park and Mrs. Sack came there at Park’s request, to witness a will. Zakatoff took from his inside coat pocket a writing which he asserted to be his will and requested Hilvick and Mrs. Sack to act as subscribing witnesses. The handwriting was in the <em>Russian language. </em>Zakatoff signed the paper in the presence of Hilvick and Mrs. Sack. Hilvick witnessed it but Mrs. Sack refused to witness it because she did not understand the Russian language and would not sign anything she did not understand. Her refusal seems to us both plausible and wise. Because of Mrs. Sack’s unwillingness to witness the Russian will, Hilvick was asked by Zakatoff to translate the writing into English (which he laboriously did) and to write it on another piece of paper.</p>

Hilvick thereupon added an explanatory paragraph to the will as follows: “I want to add, that unfortunately due to my lack of learning, although I <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>know some letters of the alphabet, it would be better if I signed my name to this will by making a cross, or my mark”.

Hilvick and Elvira Sack, both of whom saw Zakatoff sign and make his mark in their presence:</p>

In that case the testator’s <em>signature by mark was sustained as valid where he was able to write but stated he was too nervous. </em>The facts in favor of the contestant’s case were far, far stronger in <em>Rosdto’s Estate </em>than in the present case. The Court in its opinion said (pages 230, 231) : “ ‘Every will shall be in writing, and, unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence and by his express direction. ...

So the legalities of execution are (1) signing by the testator unless last sickness prevents, if so, then by another by direction; (2) if unable to sign for any reason other than last sickness, then by another by direction <em>accompanied by testator’s mark </em>if not unable to make it.

Contestant forgets that his two principal witnesses were even more interested witnesses and less entitled to be believed. The subscribing Avitness Hilvick was the son of a Avoman with whom Park had been living, but they were not living together at the time of the trial <em>nor had they been living together since </em>sometime <em>prior to </em>the execution of this will in 1945. Park had once advised Mrs. Sack about a divorce. On the other hand, contestant’s two principal witnesses were (1) Mrs. Cieslak, a mortician, and (2) an attorney who had been disbarred for a year and Avho got possession of a considerable number of testator’s assets a few days after his death in <em>September 1946, </em>and never notified the executor of <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>these assets until his possession thereof was brought out in the trial of this case in 1950. Moreover, he was <em>the informer </em>in this case and of course expected to receive an informer’s fee of 25% of the estate. Mrs. Cieslak, a mortician who charged $990. (in an estate of $15,000.) for funeral expenses, went with.another friend to decedent’s room the day after he died and removed his body, clothing, and such assets as she could find, over the protest of his landlady, Mrs. Miller. These assets she turned over to the aforesaid informer, who was her attorney. Her justification for removal of decedent’s assets was (a) that she went to decedent’s home with a friend of the decedent to find his will; and (b) that the decedent had told her he wished her to bury him and to spend $1000. on his casket. She sought to discredit Park, the residuary legatee (and thus to indicate that the will must have been a forgery) by testimony that on one occasion the decedent made very .derogatory remarks about Park. It is significant that none of the 14 other persons, who were present when these alleged remarks were made were called as witnesses to corroborate Mrs. Cieslak’s story. A reading of her testimony, which at times was evasive and unbelievable, .does not buttress contestant’s case.</p>

The testimony of Mrs. Miller, (aged 72, who all parties agree was an honest witness), does not, when read in its entirety, prove that Zakatoff could not have been away from her house on Saturday, <em>December 29, 19J/5 </em>— nearly five years prior to the time she testified. She said she remembered the week after Christmas of 1945 because she was sick in bed with a bad cold and that Zakatoff, during that time, took care of her. When asked what she meant by his taking care of her, she answered “He took care of the furnace and gone to the store for me, that’s all he had to do”. Her bedroom was in the back of the house; Zakatoff’s bedroom was in the front of <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>the house; <em>she saw Zakatoff at breakfast-time, </em>which was before 8 o’clock in the morning, <em>and the next time she saw him was around dinner-time when he got her her food; </em>but she is sure that Zakatoff wouldn’t have left the house unless he told her.
