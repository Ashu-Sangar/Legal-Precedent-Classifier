The premises extend northward along Front Street from Vaughn Street to the northern city line. There was no zoning ordinance or building restrictions prohibiting automobile courts. On August 10, 1950, a building permit was issued for the erection of the structure in question. The proposed structure is described by the chancellor as a: . . one-story construction ... to contain manager’s apartment, office, twenty-five bedrooms, bathrooms, heating plant, auxiliary rooms, and an open area in front for the parking of twenty-five automobiles.” Also: “[It] is a one story brick building with picture windows, and for a tourist court is of attractive design.

No buildings are erected between it and the river.' It is part of Pennsylvania Highway Eoute No. 22 and is heavily traveled with an official traffic count of approximately 13,600 vehicles per diem, many of which are heavy trucks. For a dis-’ tance of six tenths of a mile north and nine tenths of a mile south of Yaughn Street, on Front Street, with the exception of one tourist home and a Naval Training Center, the entire area consists of single family dwellings and vacant lots. In the adjoining Susquehanna Township to the north, there is vacant land for a dis-; tance of 1000 feet except for one dwelling. The encroachment of commercial properties along Front Street has changed its former character and appearance. But even in the residential section east of Front Street are found a drug store, funeral home, schools, churches, neighborhood store or two, and one or two small commercial establishments. Further away, but- in the general area, are found a cleaning establishment, gasoline station, plumber’s office, junk yard, etc., and “[further] up Front Street . . . hamburger joints, gasoline stations, clubs, motor equipment etc.”</p>

We think not. The purpose of the tourist court is to rent rooms by <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the night to transients. There will be a parking place for approximately 25 cars. Nearly that number are likely to be there almost every night of the year. Some guests will come in the late afternoon, leave again for dinner and come back. Some will arrive in the early evening, but some undoubtedly will arrive later. The lights to attract them will be on until 11:30. If there are vacancies in the court, motorists will be received later. Some of those who stop are bound to leave early in the morning, some later. Car doors will bang, not only to permit passengers to leave and enter the vehicle, but also to remove the luggage, and often again for the forgotten package. Trunks too will bang. And a certain amount of loud talk during the unloading — the ‘don’t forget’ variety of calls from the cabin door to the parked car — is inevitable.”</p>

Such suggested or predicted results are neither inevitable nor likely. Upon the contrary, it is to the obvious business interest of experienced operators of automobile courts or inns to provide and preserve quiet and order. Tourists who seek a night’s rest will avoid noisy and ill-conducted establishments. Should, however, such legal business be improperly conducted and became a nuisance <em>in fact} </em>its operation can be restrained.</p>

In consequence there have ■been erected and developed, in large numbers, along the highways, - automobile tourist courts, inns, camps or motels to accommodate such transient automobile travelers. No longer are motorists required to enter •a city in order to secure hotel accommodations. In many instances automobile courts, inns, camps and motels provide equal, if not superior, accommodations than are supplied by many first-class urban hotels.

No new residences have been erected on it in the area of the several blocks in question during the last twelve or fifteen years. A tourist home is located at 3109 North Front Street, and a naval training center, formerly the Harrisburg Academy, is located north of Division Street. Front Street <em>south </em>of Division is in a transitional stage, changing from primarily residential to business or commercial. These facts do not, however, compel the conclusion that the immediate locality Avitli Avhich this case is concerned is in a transitional stage. More must be shoAvn. <em>There must be evidence of inroads within the area immediately to be affected by the proposed use of the land. </em>There must be shown a breaking down of existing boundaries and absence of an existing line of demarcation which would divide commercial from residential and residential from predominately or strictly residential localities.</p>

It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that increased vehicular traffic over Front Street has effected any change in the character of the neighborhood. The advent of the automobile and change of use of highways together with change of streets from dirt and cobblestone to concrete and other smooth and durable surfaces, cannot now be asserted as a reason to deprive a district of its true residential character and owners and residents of their concomitant rights. Particularly is this true, wheie, as here, the evidence clearly establishes the locality to be strictly residential and not to have been invaded by business and commercial interests. Cf. <em>Burke v.

The development of the area as strictly residential about the Harrisburg Academy is strong and compelling evidence of this. Evidence that commercial interests have invaded the prior strictly residential area <em>south of Division Street </em>and effected a change of classification, cannot sustain a finding that the neighborhood to the north thereof has similarly changed. There is no occasion now to determine the limits of the strictly residential area. It is <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>sufficient that there is no evidence of a change in the portion thereof material to the issue presented.</p>

Exclusively residential districts are not to be denied the benefit of principles of law and equity appertaining thereto because bordered by or proximate to districts termed commercial.” Clearly, the locality has been and presently remains strictly residential in character. It is not in a period or state of transition. The majority opinion permits the erection of the tourist court in the very heart of this highly residential neighborhood.</p>

It is said that the findings of fact that the tourist court will be a one-story inn of modern and attractive design, that it will be operated as sleeping quarters only for transient guests, that neither gasoline, oil, soft drinks, food or accessories will be sold on or about the premises, that no trucks or truckers will be accommodated, that after 11:30 p.m. only safety-lighting will be maintained, such illumination to be designed to confine itself to the premises, and that there will be parking space for a maximum of 25 cars, compel a contrary conclusion. It is argued that the purpose of the tourist court is to provide sleep for transient guests and of necessity requires for its success.-, ful operation surroundings conducive to sleep and a minimization of possible annoyance and discomfort- to. guests, with the corresponding minimization of possible annoyance and discomfort to residents in homes adjacent thereto: It'is fúrthér'urged that noise’ emanating.'from -the- interspersed'’ arrival and departure ' of <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>guests cannot, in view of the already prevalent traffic noise, warrant a finding of a nuisance as a matter of law.</p>

There will be parking of cars in the evening and at night during the time residents of the area are entitled to the greatest degree of quiet and privacy. The principal business of a tourist court is not transacted during what are commonly known as “business hours” of the day. Guests will leave on errands and return. There will be the intermittent annoying glare of headlights with each arrival and departure. Bright lights necessary to attract transients will remain lighted until 11:30 p.m., and safety lighting will continue through the night. If vacancies exist, motorists will be received without regard to the particular hour. Departures will undoubtedly occur in the early hours of the morning. There will be the starting of motors and the banging of doors and trunks. There will be a certain amount of loud talking and calling among patrons of the tourist court. The majority opinion holds that these results “are neither inevitable nor likely.” These things, in my opinion, <em>are </em>inevitable and their disastrous effect upon the peace and quiet of an exclusively residential neighborhood should be readily recognized and fully evaluated. Common experience of mankind, of which this Court takes judicial notice, proves this to be the result. See <em>Ladner v. Siegel. </em><a href="/pa/293/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="293 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1111183" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0306-01">293 Pa. 306</a>, 311, <a href="/citations/?q=142%20A.%20272" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="142 A. 272">142 A. 272</a>. Particularly is this true where, as here, the tourist court is proposed to be erected, as stated, in the very heart of such neighborhood. Imposition of additional annoyances attendant upon operation of a tourist court as regards arrival and departure of guests certainly cannot be justified by assertion of a possible annoyance resulting from traffic <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>upon Front Street. Cf. <em>Boris v. Troth, </em>supra. Nor can same be justified, by suggesting a “tremendous convenience to automobile travelers.”</p>

The evidence amply sustains the finding of the chancellor that upon erection of the tourist court the present market value of residences in the immediate neighborhood would depreciate in value from fifteen to twenty <em>per eent. </em>The majority has failed to give any effect to this finding.</p>
