The complaint averred that, after various deposits made <em>by </em>the plaintiffs to the credit of the account and withdrawals therefrom from time to time, there should have been a net balance in the account to the plaintiffs’ credit in the month of October 1948 of $3153; that the plaintiffs made demand therefor; and that the defendant refused to pay the plaintiffs that sum or any portion thereof. The defendant answered, denying that anything was due the plaintiffs, and averred, under new matter, that the plaintiffs had received payment in full as shown by the bank’s ledger sheet of the account which began with an entry of October 23, 1947, crediting the plaintiffs with a balance brought forward of $3278. Subsequent entries of deposits and withdrawals appear on the ledger sheet until October 4, 1948, at which time the withdrawal shown reduced the balance in the account to $.00 There were, all told, in the period of time covered by the ledger sheet twenty-three withdrawals by checks purportedly drawn by one or the other or both of the plaintiffs.

The defendant offered no proof of the genuineness. of the signatures to the checks involved and no longer questions that they were forgeries. It so happened, however, that the last two of such checks were cashed by the bank after the plaintiffs had knowledge of the “irregularity” in their account and, because they did hot notify the bank accordingly when they first obtained such knowledge, the jury relieved the bank of liability for the payment of,;thqse checks and returned á verdict, for•,the. plain<a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>tiffs in the sum of $2770.

Globe Indemnity Company, </em>supra. The <em>McNeely </em>case, itself, had impliedly so recognized. In <em>Iron City Nat. Bank v. Fort Pitt Nat.

There, the admitted facts and undisputed documentary proofs conclusively showed such a negligent coursé of conduct on the part of the depositor with respect to its regularly returned checks over a period of six years that the depositor’s recovery for the bank’s payment of forged checks during that long time was precluded as a matter of law. No substantial question as to the promptness of any notice was involved. There was no room for doubt that the bank had not been promptly notified of the forgeries. The question which the plain<a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>tiff’s claim actually posed in the <em>McNeely </em>case was whether the bank was not liable for the payment of forged checks regardless of the lack of prompt notice of the forgeries. That question was ruled adversely to the plaintiff on a principle deduced from <em>United Security Life Insurance and Trust Company v. Central National </em>Bank, <a href="/pa/185/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="185 Pa. 586" data-case-ids="897972" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0586-01">185 Pa. 586</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.%2097" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="40 A. 97">40 A. 97</a>, that “The law assumes, and does not find it necessary to conduct an inquiry to verify the assumption, that had the notice been given promptly, the [bank] might have taken steps to protect itself as against [the forger]”: see the <em>McNeely </em>ease at p. 598.

From the bank’s separation of the cheeks, the jury could infer that it had already detected the spurious ones and had so segregated them. The bank’s denial of the testimony as to the two envelopes was merely general on the basis of custom and not specific to the issue. Then, too, the action of the forger in making good, at the teller’s request, a relatively large overdraft in the account occasioned by his last withdrawal on a forged cheek was so unusual as to cause a reasonably prudent person to question the regularity of the transaction and thus, perhaps, discover the forgeries.

Plaintiffs had gone south on a vacation trip on July 23 and Johnson testified that when they left on that day there was a balance in their joint checking account of $3,723; after their return they made deposits in August aggregating $135, so' that when, on September 20, Johnson visited the bank to get a statement of their account he knew that the balance to their credit should have been $3,858. The clerk told him, however, that the balance was then only $1,188 (Johnson so testified; the correct amount was actually $1,088). Thus faced with what must have been to him a staggering revelation, Johnson contented himself by merely remarking to the clerk: “I know I had more money than that”; he also claims to have said: “I say the money is misappropriated”. He apparently had immediate (but. unexpressed) suspicions as to the reason for the shortage because he then and there transferred $738 from the checking account into a savings account in his own name, — obviously to prevent future shrinkages, — :and immediately upon reaching home and examining the cancelled checks which he had received from the bank he sent for Jackson and opened conversation with him by the accusatory question: “What did you mean by doing a thing of that kind?” Jackson at once confessed to the forgeries and asked for three days time in which to see if he could restore the money and afterwards for additional time in order to consult relatives in Chicago to see if they could help him out. His efforts in that direction failing, Johnson and Jackson entered into a written agreement on September 28 in which Jackson agreed to pay $2,700, the then approximate amount of the forgeries, in instalments of $75 every two weeks. All that he was able to pay under this agreement, however, was $40, and finally, on November 16, Johnson had him arrested.; he was bound over by the Alderman for court; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced on Decern<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>ber 8 to a term in the penitentiary. Meanwhile Johnson visited the bank some time around the middle of October. Inquiring as to the balance then in the account he was told that there was no balance; (the $350 remaining on September 20 had been drawn out the first week of October on two additional forged checks). He thereupon went to the cashier and said to him: “Mr. Luce, there’s $3120 of my money gone, <em>for what reason I don’t know.” </em>This was a palpable falsehood, for, as already stated, Jackson had confessed the forgeries to him on September 20; he did not tell the cashier the truth, namely, that, as he knew, the money had been, obtained by his step-son on forged checks, that he had been trying to have him make restitution, and that he had actually entered into a written agreement with him for that purpose. Johnson’s final visit to the bank was in company with his wife and his attorney sometime after Jackson had been sentenced on December 8, when they made demand on the bank preparatory to beginning the present suit.</p>

As far as the law is concerned, there can be no question but that; by an overwhelming number of decisions both in this Court and the Superior Court, three principles have been firmly established. The first is that, when a depositor has knowledge that a bank has improperly paid out moneys in his account on forged checks, it is his duty — and the sine qua non of his right of recovery against the bank — to give the bank <em>prompt </em>notice of the forgeries. The majority opinion undertakes to say that the word “‘timely’ rather than ‘prompt’ more correctly defines the character of notice which a depositor is required to give.Ms bank of a forged check charged to his account”. Apart from the fact that the word. “timely” is wholly too--vague in connotation :.to be capable of legal, ap-. plication, the fact is that in-no single-adjudicated casé has thé;réqüiféd-'-nótiéé;béén held :to -bé one-t'hat-is mere<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>ly “timely”; on the contrary, <em>all </em>the cases explicitly hold that <em>prompt </em>notice must be given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> The second established principle is that, on fixed or conceded facts, the question as to whether notice of the forgeries measures up to the required standard of promptness is one for the determination, not of the jury, but of the court as a matter of law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> The third principle is <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>that it is not necessary for the bank to show that if the notice of the forgeries had been given promptly it might'have been, better able to protect itself by obtaining reimbursement from the forger or his relatives or friends; on the contrary, the failure of the depositor to give prompt notice absolves the bank of all liability irrespective of whether or not it has thereby suffered any disadvantage or loss.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

As previously stated, when Johnson learned of the balance in the checking account on September 20 he “told the lady” that “he knew he had more money than that”, — testimony which he afterwards amplified by adding that he said also: “the money is misappropriated.” Can it be seriously argued that these statements constituted a notice to the bank of the forgery of checks? Indeed what the law requires by way of notification is not. only that money has been paid out by the bank on forged checks but a specific pointing out to the bank of the check or checks as to which forgery is claimed, because the sole object of the notice is to enable the bank to take measures against the forger of such a check or checks in order to secure, if possible, the restoration of the funds. The law goes even further, for it requires that not only must such specific notice be given, but that the depositor, at the time of notifying the bank of the forgery, must, on demand, return the particular check or checks in question to the bank: <em>Roth v. </em>Crissy, <a href="/pa/30/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="30 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="415633" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0145-01">30 Pa. 145</a>; <em>Rick v. </em>Kelly, <a href="/pa/30/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="30 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="415632" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0527-01">30 Pa. 527</a>;. <em>Showers v.

I venture to say that there is not a single .case in the books — at least I have not been able to find any— which holds: that the requirement that..notice of for-. gery.be. given to 'the-bank'is satisfied-by any thing- shorf of a notice that specified or designated checks, re-<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>turned by tbe bank to tbe depositor as paid, were forged, thereby enabling the bank to proceed against the forger to whom the improper payment or payments had been made. The fact is, therefore, that, although Johnson admits that on September 20 Jackson confessed the forgeries, never from that time until demand and notice of suit nearly three months later did plaintiffs give the slightest intimation to the bank that any forgeries had been committed. On the contrary, Johnson, in October, told the bank that $3,120 of his money was gone, <em>for what reason he did not lenow. </em>Thus, instead of <em>notifying </em>the bank of the forgeries which his step-son had confessed to him on September 20 and of his efforts since then to recover reimbursement, he carefully <em>concealed </em>those facts from the bank, even to the extent of deliberate falsification. The reason for this conduct on his part is so obvious that he that runs may read. Jackson was plaintiffs’ wayward son, and they naturally did not want to expose him to prosecution by the bank if the matter could otherwise be adjusted,- — a result that they tried in vain to accomplish. While their tenderness toward him may be understood and even viewed with sympathy, certainly, having adopted that course, they cannot months afterwards come for redress upon the bank whose hands they had meanwhile kept tied, partly by means of concealment and partly by actual misrepresentation.</p>

The one is, as Johnson testified, that when the cancelled checks were returned to him by the bank on <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>September 20 they were handed to him in two envelopes, one containing 5 checks drawn by plaintiffs themselves prior to July 23, and the other containing the 15 checks subsequent to that date which Jackson had forged. Assuming this testimony to be true, in spite of its inherent improbability, the inference is attempted to be drawn therefrom that the bank thereby <em>showed that it knew </em>that the 15 checks were forged. In the first place, it may be asked how the bank could possibly have possessed such knOAvledge on September 20, when there is not the slightest suggestion in the record of anything which could have given it such knowledge, especially in vieAV of the fact that it had honored one of the forged checks only two days before. In the second place, it may also be asked what reason could there be for such action on the part of the bank? What purpose of its own, intelligent or otherwise, could it have served? And if, for some non-understandable reason, it Avished to call Johnson’s attention to the 15 checks as distinguished from the other 5 as having been forged, why should it have resorted to such pantomimic a method as handing him the checks in two envelopes instead of informing him directly of the fact? In the third place, — and this certainly should be conclusive, — if the bank knew on September 20 of the forgeries, would it have honored the two checks presented by Jackson two weeks later, — the one on October 1 and the other on October 4? Indeed the jury itself must have found that the bank had neither knowledge nor notice of the forgeries prior to its honoring the October checks for it did not allow plaintiffs a recovery for the bank’s payment of those checks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

      <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>The other incident referred to in the majority opinion is that, by the bank’s paying to Jackson the amount of the October 4 check of $180, plaintiffs’ account became overdrawn to the extent of $33, and that amount was refunded to the bank by Jackson. The majority opinion states that it was such an unusual transaction for Jackson to make good the overdraft instead of the bank calling on plaintiffs to do so, that this ought to have caused the bank to question the regularity of the transaction. The fact is, however, which the majority opinion neglects to state, that, after Jackson cashed the check of October 4, he came back to the bank <em>that very same day </em>and presented an additional check, whereupon the clerk, finding that the account had just been overdrawn, called Jackson’s attention to that fact, whereupon Jackson promptly paid the $33, and, of course, the additional check was not honored. Since it is plain, therefore, that the bank was <em>immediately </em>reimbursed and never had an opportunity, or any occasion, to notify plaintiffs of the overpayment, the incident loses all significance as one from which an inference could be drawn of any suspicious irregularity, much less that the bank knew, or should have known, that any of the checks had been forged.</p>

Furthermore, there is not a scintilla of evidence from which the jury could have been allowed to find that the bank had independent knowledge of the forgeries which excused the plaintiffs from giving it the notice otherwise required by law.
