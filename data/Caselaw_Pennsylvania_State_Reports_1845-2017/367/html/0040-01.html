In the present instance, the question involved goes to the jurisdiction of the cause of action (whereon the suit was instituted) which <em>‘. . . </em>relates “solely to the competency of the particular court to determine controversies of the general class to which the case then presented for its consideration belongs”: Skelton v. Lower Merion Twp., <a href="/pa/298/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="298 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="1120370" data-case-paths="/pa/298/0471-01">298 Pa. 471</a>, 473. See also Koontz v.

Corruption of water, when it affects the public use of a stream or menaces the public health, becomes a public nuisance which the commonwealth may suppress by criminal proceedings upon indictment for maintaining a public nuisance and upon conviction the court may in its sentence include an order requiring abatement of the nuisance: <em>see Barclay v.

That Act forbade in express terms the discharge of “sewage” into the Commonwealth’s waters except by permit issued by the Commissioner of Health whose duties were later by the Administration Code transferred to the Sanitary Water Board. That Act also provided that individuals, private corporations, etc. discharging at the time of passage of the Act, sewage as therein defined, might continue their discharge unless in the opinion of the Commissioner the discharge became injurious to. the <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>public health and then he. might order the discharge to cease. ' Upon such order, the discharge had to be abated within ten days thereafter. The Act provided an appeal from the order of the Commissioner to the common pleas court.

This is a far too narrow construction of the Act. Such a construction would be against the public interest, whereas, as Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Drew said in <em>Com. ex rel. v. Sunbury School District, </em><a href="/pa/335/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="335 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1193017" data-case-paths="/pa/335/0006-01">335 Pa. 6</a>, 12, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20279" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="6 A.2d 279">6 A. 2d 279</a> (1939), “All legislation must be construed as intending to <em>favor </em>the public interest.” (emphasis supplied) And in construing the legislative intent the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, sec. 52, 46 P.'S. 552(5), directs us to presume the intention of the legislature to be that it intends to favor the public as against any private interest. But apart from this \ve think the Act itself makes clear that it was never intended to strip from the courts their historic jurisdiction to determine what is a nuisance in fact, and confer that power exclusively upon an administrative agency. Nor can we agree with the proposition asserted by the court below that even in proceedings under the act the Board must first determine the pollution to be harmful or that it must otherwise be shown that the defendant acted contrary to the Board’s requirements before there can be recourse to the courts to enforce its provisions. While Sec. 302 makes it clear that the board can decree or order discontinuance of such an industrial waste discharge which it finds to be a nuisance, yet it cannot by a contrary decree make a discharge which is in fact a “nuisance,” not a “nuisance,” and thereby prevent the penalties of the Act. Nor can it accomplish the same purpose by failing to act at all. <em>Com. v. Sonneborn, </em><a href="/pa-super/164/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="164 Pa.

This amendment added to the definition of the 1937 Act the words, “The Sanitary Water Board shall determine when the discharge of any industrial waste, or the effluent therefrom, constitutes pollution, as herein defined, and shall establish standards whereby and wherefrom, so far as reasonably practicable and possible, it can be ascertained and determined whether any such discharge does or does not constitute pollution as herein defined.” This the learned court below thought indicated an intention to make such action by the Board an indispensable first step before any action could be taken either <em>under </em>the Act or <em>outside </em>of the Act. But it is enough to say that the clause relied on does not expressly say so. And so important a change of policy ought not rest on an implication of a mere amendment .to a “definition” of a single word. The very beginning of section 1 (the definition section) provides that all of the definitions must give way to the clearly expressed provisions in the body of the Act to the contrary.</p>

Such proceedings may be prosecuted in the court of common pleas of Dauphin County, or in the court of common pleas of the county where the nuisance has been or is being committed, or of any county through which dr along the borders of which flows the water into which such pollution has been discharged at any point above, and to that end jurisdiction is hereby conferred in law and equity upon such courts: Provided, however, That no action shall be brought by such district attorney or solicitor against any municipality discharging sewage under a permit of the board heretofore issued or hereafter issued under this act: And provided further, That except in cases of emergency where, in the opinion of the court, the exigencies of the cases require immediate abatement off said nuisances, the court may, in its decree, fix a reasonable time during which the person or municipality responsible for the nuisances may make provision for the abatement of the same.”</p>

When read in conjunction with sec. 701 the point becomes at once clear. (2) The other clause of the first sentence of sec. 601, viz., “. . . or maintained contrary to the provisions of this .act” applies' to 'actions which may be <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>brought for violation of the <em>Act. </em>The word “or” differentiates the two kinds, for the general, rule is that the word “or” when joining two clauses precludes carrying over into the first clause provisions found in the last clause: <em>Smith v. Farley, </em><a href="/nys/140/0990-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="140 N.Y.S. 990" data-case-ids="3384529" data-case-paths="/nys/140/0990-01">140 N.Y.S. 990</a>. That is to say the word “or” prevents the second clause from being construed as a limitation on the first.

The notice should have been given before the bill was filed, but in the circumstances here present this omission is not fatal.
