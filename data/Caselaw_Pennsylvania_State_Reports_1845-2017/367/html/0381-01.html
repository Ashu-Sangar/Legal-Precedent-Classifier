The farm for which ejectment was brought is known as the “home” farm and was owned by the plaintiff’s husband who died intestate May 5, 1944. On June 29, 1944, the children of the plaintiff conveyed their interests in the home farm to the plaintiff.

Tbe defendants, at tbe trial, contended that all the terms of tbe escrow agreement were set forth in the recited consideration of tbe prior deed from plaintiff to defendant wbicb we have herein-before quoted. But the plaintiff contended that there was an additional important term not set forth in tbe prior deed, but orally agreed to by tbe parties, viz., that defendant “Steve” was to farm the Guffey farm and to pay tbe taxes thereon and if be failed, or refused to do so, then tbe escrow deed was to be delivered to the plaintiff. The learned court below left to tbe jury upon adequate instructions tbe questions (1) Wbat were tbe terms of tbe escrow agreement. (2) Whether defendant complied with its terms. Tbe jury found on adequate evidence that tbe additional terms of tbe escrow agreement bad been orally agreed on and were breached by tbe defendants and tbe verdict for tbe plaintiff followed.</p>

But that deed is not tbe deed in issue. Tbe escrow deed from defendants to tbe plaintiff <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>is the one in issue. The escrow agreement existed entirely apart from that deed.'What the jury in effect found was that the complete escrow agreement embodied both the foregoing recited considerations of the first deed and the oral agreement as to the Guffey farm. The defendants themselves had to rely on oral evidence to connect the recited consideration of the first deed with the second or escrow deed. Though there is apparently no authority exactly in point in this jurisdiction, yet it is generally well settled elsewhere that the rule that a contract or instrument made in writing inter parties must be deemed to contain the entire writing or understanding has no application in the case of escrows: <em>Stanton v. Miller, </em><a href="/ny/58/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="58 N.Y. 192" data-case-ids="2158518" data-case-paths="/ny/58/0192-01">58 N. Y. 192</a>, 203 (1874); <em>Mecray v.

    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[260,1376,1150,853]]]'>However, even apart from this- reason it is to be noted .that the very provision, of the deed relied on by the defendants to exclude the oral evidence does not, on its face, purport to set forth the entire consideration. It is recited to be, <em>“As part of the consideration </em>for this deed,” etc. This, together with the fact that both deeds were dated and executed at the same time would seem amply to support the reason given by the learned court below for admitting the evidence which in his opinion he sets forth as follows: “Where two deeds ai*e executed at the same time and are part of a whole single transaction, parol evidence is admissible to show the terms of the entire transaction: <em>Thompson v. McClenachan, </em>17 S. &amp; R. 110.” The court below was correct in refusing to grant both the motion for judgment n.o.v. and a new trial for this reason.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[260,2249,1149,97]],["BL_409.1",409,[177,326,1158,1799]]]'>.- The learned' counsel for. the appellants also asks us tp.grant anewdriakfor'.several additional reasons which <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>we will briefly consider: (1) That it would be inequitable to allow what is a virtual, forfeiture of the part of the consideration which defendant Steve had paid during the two years of his occupation of the farm. It is argued that ejectment is an equitable action and therefore the verdict for plaintiff should have been conditioned on the restoration of the money paid. Under some circumstances the action of ejectment may be considered in the nature of an equitable action and as a substitute for a decree of specific performance. However, whatever claim the defendants may have had to such a conditional verdict should have been set forth in the pleadings, an issue thus raised and the trial judge asked to submit that question to the jury. Defendant did not do this. While he sets forth the amounts of what he paid to and for the plaintiff, he sets it forth only to prove performance on his part of the contract and not as a claim for reimbursement. Furthermore, this question was not raised in any reason filed for a new trial so that the court below had no opportunity to pass on that question. In the circumstances we rule that it is too late to raise that question on appeal: <em>McLaughlin et ux. v. </em>Monaghan, <a href="/pa/290/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="290 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1104443" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0074-01">290 Pa. 74</a>, 79, <a href="/citations/?q=138%20A.%2079" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="138 A. 79">138 A. 79</a> (1927); <em>Commonwealth v. Duitch) </em><a href="/pa-super/165/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="165 Pa. Super. 187" data-case-ids="467373" data-case-paths="/pa-super/165/0187-01">165 Pa. Superior Ct. 187</a>, 192, <a href="/citations/?q=67%20A.2d%20821" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="67 A.2d 821">67 A. 2d 821</a> (1949). We do so with less regret since the defendant has had possession of the farm and has no doubt received the crops and dairy products thereof since April 1, 1946. When to this is added what the plaintiff may have lost because of defendant’s failure to farm the Guffey farm and pay the taxes thereon defendant’s payments would probably amount to no more than a reasonable rental due by defendant for use and occupation.</p>
    <p id="b409-3" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[183,2138,1152,211]],["BL_410.1",410,[242,329,1153,363]]]'>(2) The appellants next argue that the deed by plaintiff to defendant did not reserve any right of forfeiture. Hence; what is in effect a forfeiture of defendant’s estate should not. be allowed. But the plaintiff <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>did not predicate her action upon any forfeiture in her deed to defendant. Her action is based on the escrow deed found by the jury to have been delivered properly, in accordance with the escrow agreement. As the parties chose to select that method of enforcing their respective rights, the absence of a forfeiture clause in the deed becomes immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[240,711,1155,1026]]]'>(3) The learned trial judge affirmed two of plaintiff’s points to the effect that if the defendant Steve did not live up to the conditions of the deed the verdict should be for the plaintiff and, if they believe that it-was part, of the entire agreement, that said defendant should farm the Guffey farm and pay taxes thereon, the verdict should be for plaintiff. Complaint is made that the affirmance of these points was tantamount to binding instructions for the plaintiff. However, taken in conjunction with the entire charge we do not think the jury, was misled by these points which were read at the very end. If the appellants’ counsel thought so he should have-directed the court’s attention to that possible misunderstanding by the jury. Instead he contented himself with the stereotyped exceptions to the court’s affirmance of the points. We rule that in the circumstances the trial judge’s affirmance of the points submitted, if error, was at the most harmless error and hot a ground for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[237,1750,1152,369]]]'>Finally, it is argued the escrow deed was in reality a mortgage to secure the performance of defendant Steve’s agreement and therefore plaintiff is not entitled to more than possession until her losses incurred by Steve’s failure to cultivate the Guffey farm and pay taxes have been made good. From which premise it is argued the verdict should have been so conditioned.</p>
