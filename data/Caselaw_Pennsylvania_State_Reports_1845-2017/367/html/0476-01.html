Musmanno, a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of that county.</p>

Petitioner refused to answer these questions, insisting that Judge Musmanno was without jurisdiction to make such inquiry; and then made motions that the Judge disqualify himself <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>as to the trial of the McGrath case, and also for the entry of a voluntary non-suit. Judge Musmanno would not rule on the first of these motions, but did refuse the second. When petitioner sought to leave the court room, the Judge had the court officers restrain him until he, the Judge, had concluded his remarks. He then said: “We have formally adjudged you unfit to try a case in this Court as of today, morally unfit. You do not possess an allegiance to the United States. There is sufficient evidence before the Congress of the United States that you made statements that you believe in overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence. Because of these sworn statements, which you do not see fit to reply to, we declare you morally unfit to try a case in this court room. Therefore, the case will be continued until you purge yourself of contempt or until your client is able to obtain another lawyer.”</p>

Shortly before this Court granted the rule, Judge Musmanno filed an order in the Court of Common Pleas notifying petitioner to appear on May 31, 1951, in connection with the so-called contempt proceeding heretofore referred to. The deputy sheriff who attempted to serve petitioner on the street with a certified copy of the order of Judge Musmanno, notified the Judge that petitioner glanced at the outside of the copy of the order, declared “I am not accepting any service today”, and threw the paper to the street and walked away. Judge Musmanno then issued a bench warrant for petitioner’s arrest. About the time the petitioner was brought before the Judge on the afternoon of May 29, 1951, a copy of our order granting a rule to shoAV cause and staying all proceed<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>ings in the matter was served upon Judge Musmanno. Nevertheless, the Judge proceeded with a so-called hearing, and, although petitioner stated that he did not know that the man who attempted to serve him was a deputy sheriff, that he did not look at the paper and that he did not throw it away, Judge Musmanno again adjudged petitioner in contempt of court.</p>

Under the facts and circumstances of this case, Judge Musmanno had no jurisdiction whatsoever to inquire as to whether or not petitioner, counsel for plaintiff in the case then before the court, was or was not a member of the Communist Party; he had no power to deprive petitioner of his right to practice his profession or to hold him in contempt when he refused to answer. What we said as recently as last year, in <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, ex rel. Roth v. Musmanno, </em><a href="/pa/364/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="364 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1223477" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0359-01">364 Pa. 359</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20263" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="72 A.2d 263">72 A. 2d 263</a>, is equally appropriate in the instant case. In that case, Judge Musmanno, without any legal justification, dismissed Alice Roth from service as a grand juror because he concluded she was a Communist. There we said (p. 360) : “The procedure pursued by the judge cannot be supported. It constituted an arrogation and exercise of a power beyond the jurisdiction of any judge under existing law. The- privilege of serving as a juror [or as here, of an attorney practicing his profession] is one of the valuable, rights. . . . Such rights may neither be extinguished, abated, nor ■ dismissed by any proceeding short of one which fully comports .with the historical and constitutional requisites • of due process; <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>It is necessary, therefore, for the guidance of the judges of the Commonwealth in the future that the error above noted be, and the same is, hereby condemned.”</p>
