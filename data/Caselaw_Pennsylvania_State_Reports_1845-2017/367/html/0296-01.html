The facts are not in dispute. The petitioner is a creditor and administrator of the estate of Joseph Lucas, deceased. During decedent’s lifetime a certain farm, situate in Washington County was deeded to “Francis Lucas, a single man, and Joseph Lucas and Matilda Lucas, his wife.” There is no pointed indication in the deed of what share was intended to pass ,to each of the grantees, the habendum clause providing, “To Have and To Hold the same unto and for the use of the said parties of the second part their heirs and assigns forever, . .</p>

Joseph having predeceased Matilda on September 8, 1949, the marriage then still subsisting, Matilda contends that by the above deed Francis took an undivided one-half interest in the farm as a tenant in common with Joseph and Matilda who took the remaining half as tenants by the entire-ties; that upon Joseph’s death she became the sole owner of the one-half interest formerly held by the entireties. The petitioner contends that each of the grantees took an undivided one-third interest in the farm; that the deed did not create a tenancy by the entireties and that at Joseph’s death his undivided one-third interest in the realty is subject to sale for payment of his debts.</p>

      <em>gether with third parties? </em>The real question is where we shall place the burden of construction when the intention is not sufficiently manifested by a perusal of the instrument creating the estate. In the situation where only the husband and wife are involved this Court has been content to allow the construction that, in the absence of an intention otherwise, the quality of the estate should be deemed one of entireties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> In neither the <em>Mauser </em>nor <em>Kleinschmidt </em>cases did we foreclose the question of presumption where the conveyance is to three or more parties, two of whom are husband and wife. An examination of both cases indicates that on their facts there was sufficient to disclose that a tenancy by the entireties was not intended. Considering the matter then as one of first impression, we hold that a conveyance to three parties two of whom are husband and wife but neither designated as such, shall, in the absence of any language in the conveyance disclosing a contrary intention, be deemed a conveyance of one-third shares. The presumption and even desirability of the qualitative holding arising out of the marital union is not so strong that it may be permitted to affect the quantitative holdings otherwise apparent on the face of the instrument. <em>Biot intention is the cardinal and controlling </em>element, and if intention that the husband and wife shall take as such (i. e. by entireties) sufficiently appears, it will be given effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Here the conveyance is to “Francis Lucas, a single man, <em>and </em>Joseph Lucas and Matilda Lucas, <em>his wife.” </em>The words “his wife” cannot be treated as mere surplusage: they occur in context in the classic form for the creation of a tenancy by entireties. The parties must be taken to have considered and given significance to the marital status of two of the grantees.</p>

Of course it is arguable that the mere use of the words ‘his wife’ of itself would imply an intent to create an entireties estate. And it is true that if such language without more were used to convey to grantees <em>who loere in fact husband and wife} </em>an estate by entireties would be created.

      <em>ried. . </em>.”. In the instant case the two grantees <em>are </em>in fact husband and wife and the designation “his wife” sufficiently imports an intention that they shall take as such. Further the conjunction “and”, first used, is unnecessary if the parties were intended to take undivided one-third parts; the use of the word “and” separated the grantees into two units (1) Francis and (2) Joseph and Matilda. The same construction was referred to in <em>Johnson v.
