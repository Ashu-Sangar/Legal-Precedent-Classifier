    <p id="b626-8" data-blocks='[["BL_626.10",626,[265,1088,1148,481]]]'>Plaintiff recovered a substantial verdict in a land damage case arising out of the relocation and widening (in 1947) of a State highway previously known as the New Holland Turnpike in Lancaster County. The real question involved is a narrow one — what was the width of the plaintiff’s property which was taken; and that in turn depends on whether a legal taking (for highway purposes) by the Commonwealth’s predecessor in title, over 100 years ago, was 33 feet or 50 feet.</p>

In 1810 the Lancaster and New Holland Turnpike Road Company, the Commonwealth’s predecessor in title, was authorized to lay out a road not exceeding 50 feet in width. So far as this record shows, it is impossible to tell from the deeds of the present owners or of their predecessors in title their exact boundaries or the exact land taken by the New Holland. Turnpike Road Company in 1810. All parties agreed that the hard surface (highway) ■ road which had been actually and continuously in use from 1798 to 1947 was 18-20 feet in width. <em>The public records of 'Lancaster County show no-deeds and no court </em>

    <p id="b627-3" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[152,449,1153,816]]]'>Plaintiff’s property extended along both sides of the highway — 510 feet on one side and 875 feet on the other side. Plaintiff, shortly after the purchase of this property in February <em>1927, </em>erected a residence as well as <em>trees, hedges, fences, </em>poles and stone walls <em>along what the plaintiff claims is the boundary line of her property, </em>viz. along the 33 foot wide (1798) highway. Moreover, immediately west of plaintiff’s property, the highway crossed a stream over <em>an old bridge which was 33 feet wide. </em>The Commonwealth in <em>1947 </em>took for highway purposes a strip of land 60 feet in width, which included the plaintiff’s property and extended 5.3 miles in length. 31.9% of this 5 mile property had monuments of one sort or another along the 33 foot wide highway boundary line.</p>
    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[154,1278,1151,1079]]]'>The Commonwealth presented some very slight evidence to show that the monuments along what we might loosely call the 1810 right of way were separated in width a distance 47 to 54 feet; but it relied mainly on the presumption of law that where a right of way is granted up to a specified maximum width, the presumption is that the grantee took the maximum width: <em>Arnovits, Exr. v.

Notwithstanding the fact that this presumption may be rebutted by any competent evidence, defendant contends that evidence as to the 1798 road was irrelevant and inadmissible since it did not prove the width of the 1810 (highway) taking. It could not, of itself, prove the width of the 1810 highway, but under all the evidence in this case it was a relevant and material fact to be considered in conjunction with all the other evidence in determining the plaintiff’s present boundaries.</p>

Of eourse this map did not disclose or purport to disclose how long the monuments or boundary lines had been in existence, or whether they marked the plaintiff’s boundaries or were encroachments on land which might have been taken in 1810 by the Commonwealth’s predecessor in title. However, the Commonwealth possessed or had access to the records of its predecessor in title (if such records are still in existence) and if 50 feet instead of 33 feet had been actually or legally taken for a highway in 1810, it has no one but itself to blame when it failed to produce or account for these records.</p>
