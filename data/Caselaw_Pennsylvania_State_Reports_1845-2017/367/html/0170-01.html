    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[243,1270,1150,485]]]'>Defendant operates a railroad as a common carrier of passengers and freight in six southern states, the northernmost of which is Virginia. It has never owned or operated any railroad line, station, terminal, yard, shop or other transportation facilities in Pennsylvania. Passenger and freight cars owned by it travel between New York City and Washington, D. C., through Philadelphia, in interstate commerce, as a part of trains operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>

At the time of institution of suit there were three employees in the passenger office, including a “Division Passenger Agent”, and four employees in the freight office, including a “General <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>Agent”. These employees are hired and subject to discharge only by the home office of defendant in Wilmington, North Carolina, on the recommendations of the Division Passenger Agent or the General Agent, respectively. Each office in Philadelphia is leased in the name of the defendant, the lease being executed in Wilmington. Defendant owns the office furniture in the local offices; its name appears on the doors of the two offices; it is listed in the local telephone directory, and its local address and telephone number appear on its letter-head. No contracts are made by the local office. Defendant maintains no local bank account and all expenses, including rent, salaries, etc., are paid by checks from the Home Office, drawn on Wilmington banks; supplies for both local offices are bought by and shipped from defendant’s Home Office.</p>
    <p id="b195-3" data-blocks='[["BL_195.4",195,[175,1219,1151,805]]]'>The local freight office solicits outbound and inbound freight business and gives such information to shippers as will induce them to patronize defendant’s lines. Employees of this office call on from 3700 to 4000 prospective customers in the territory per year and send monthly reports to the Home Office showing the total freight tonnage from this area destined to travel over defendant’s lines. In 1947 17,000 carloads of freight originated in this area. <em>It does not appear what percentage this was of the total freight carried by defendant, or hoio much of it originated in Philadelphia County. </em>The freight office handles no cash, way bills or bills of lading, but does trace several hundred lost or delayed shipments per year by telephone or wire inquiries to offices of defendant located in the South.</p>

Information pamphlets such as railroad maps and time tables are distributed at this office. If complaints are made by passengers residing in the territory, the Home Office notifies the Philadelphia Office, which in turn contacts the complaining parties and attempts to pacify them. No adjustments are handled through the local office.</p>

Tickets are obtained by the local office from the connecting line over which defendant’s cars are transported to Washington, D. 0. The passenger office gives defendant’s “street orders” (72 hour credit extension slips bearing the name of the prospective passengers and their destinations ) to the connecting line; and after cash has been received by the local office from the prospective passenger for the tickets, this cash is turned over to the connecting line, which returns the “street orders”. When requested, the passenger office also obtains reservations and tickets for return northbound trips.</p>

Defendant is paid rental for said cars by Pennsylvania Railroad on a mileage basis and while on its lines the latter company, at its expense, absorbs the cost of interior cleaning, icing, watering, and fueling of said cars. When passenger cars pass through Philadelphia County food and drink are often served while the trains are in that County. The employees who work-in these dining and tavern cars man the cars for the entire trip between Florida and New York and are paid by the defendant; but while on the lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad, that railroad has a right to control and to hire or fire them for cause.
