The relevant facts are not in dispute and are as follows: Defendants, Harry Sedelsky and Selma, his wife, purchased 7224 Rutland Street, Philadelphia, which is the real estate in question, paid the down money and took title in. the name of Sidney Pastner, who is Selma’s brother and a veteran soldier. This was done in order that a mortgage might be secured from the Veterans’ Administration. Such a mortgage in the sum of $6,800 was obtained which was executed by Sidney Pastner to whom the title was conveyed by the vendor, but all of the purchase price over and above the mortgage as well as the adjustments and expenses at settlement were paid by the Sedelskys, who entered into and remained in exclusive possession of the premises.</p>

On August 9, 1949, <em>after </em>the delivery of the deed by Pastner to the Sedelskys, but <em>before </em>it was recorded, Pastner executed a judgment note to plaintiff on which judgment was entered October 14, 1949.

However, the trust was completely executed by the delivery of the unrecorded deed by Pastner to defendants <em>before </em>the plaintiff had become a creditor of Pastner, therefore the Act of 1901 has no application. That has been definitely decided by this Court in <em>Beman Thomas Co. v. White, </em><a href="/pa/269/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="269 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="1063494" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0261-01">269 Pa. 261</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%2037" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="112 A. 37">112 A. 37</a> (1920), where the fáctual situation was exactly the same as here. There, as here, a resulting trust arose because title was taken in the name of Thomas but the purchase money was paid by the Thomas Corporation. Later but <em>before </em>a judgment was entered against Thomas, the title was conveyed but the deed not recorded until <em>after </em>the judgment was entered. The lower court there fell into the same error as the coiirt below did here and relying on the <em>Rochester Trust Co. v. White </em>case, supra,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> found for the judgment creditor. This Court, in reversing, pointed out that the resulting trust was extinguished by <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>the delivery of the unrecorded deed. Up until that delivery the trust would , have been void by reason of the Act of 1901 as to judgment creditors, etc., though good as against the trustee, but with the conveyance to the cestui que trust the trust ceased to exist and the Act of 1901 could thereafter afford no protection to creditors who acquired their rights <em>after </em>the trust ended.

    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[254,892,1151,1361]]]'>It is true that at the time <em>Beman Thomas v. White, </em><a href="/pa/269/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="269 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="1063494" data-case-paths="/pa/269/0261-01">269 Pa. 261</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%2037" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="112 A. 37">112 A. 37</a> (1920), was decided, judgment creditors had the protection- of the recording acts only in the case of resulting trusts under the Act of 1901 and were not generally regarded as within the protection given by the recording acts to purchasers or mortgagees. The reason being that a judgment creditor stood only in the shoes of his debtor, his rights rising no higher. Hence, if his debtor was a mere trustee, the holder of the beneficial interest or a grantee under a prior unrecorded deed took priority: <em>Cover v. Black, </em><a href="/pa/1/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="949872" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0493-01">1 Pa. 493</a> (1845); <em>Reed’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/13/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="13 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="964915" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0476-01">13 Pa. 476</a>; <em>Rosa v.

Though if the judgment creditor became a purchaser at the sheriff’s sale under his judgment, he was then entitled to the same protection of the recording acts as any other purchaser: <em>Hultz v. Ackley, </em><a href="/pa/63/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="63 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="1019072" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0142-01">63 Pa. 142</a>. But now by the Amending Act of June 12, 1931, P. L. 558, 21 P.S. 351, there is added to the persons protected against unrecorded deeds (i.e., subsequent purchasers or mortgagees) the “holder of any judgment, duly entered in the prothonotary’s office of the county in which the lands . . . are situate.” Judgment creditors since 1931 therefore have the same protection that subsequent purchasers and mortgagees have against a prior unrecorded deed, etc.</p>

But even if the plaintiff were viewed as a judgment creditor he would nevertheless in that capacity be still subject to the same duties as subsequent purchasers and mortgagees. The Act of 1931, supra, puts him in the <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>same class with them and accords him no greater rights. If then plaintiff had inquired of the defendants who were in exclusive possession by what authority they occupied the premises, he would have learned of their claim of ownership and that his judgment debtor had no title. Being bound by constructive notice therefore of the prior conveyance, his action must fail and the judgment must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[256,783,1153,1300]]]'>The learned court below suggested also as an additional reason for the judgment entered that by reason of the fraud perpetrated on the Government’s Veterans’ Administration and the Sedelskys’ acts Avhich enabled Pastner to represent himself as owner to the government agency, the equitable principle of estoppel prevents the Sedelskys from setting up their equitable title. We cannot follow this reasoning. The Sedelskys are relying on no equitable title but upon a <em>legal </em>title established by the delivery of a prior unrecorded deed. <em>Delivery </em>is all that is necessary to pass title, <em>recording </em>is only essential to protect by constructive notice any subsequent purchasers, mortgagees and new judgment creditors. Cf. <em>Cray’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/353/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="353 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="465831" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0025-01">353 Pa. 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20286" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="44 A.2d 286">44 A. 2d 286</a> (1945); <em>Mower v.

Before there can be an estoppel there must be a showing that the plaintiff was misled or induced to lend money to Pastner by something that defendants said or did. No such circumstances appear in the record. As correctly pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellants a beneficiary is not estopped from receiving the legal title due him by the mere fact that the trustee was clothed with the indicia of title: <em>Berenato v.

This section declares, “Every conveyance made. . . by a person who is or will be thereby rendered insolvent, is fraudulent as to creditors, without regard to his actual intent, if the conveyance is made or the obligation is incurred without a fair consideration.” This provision has application only to a debtor’s own property. It does not apply to the transfer to a beneficiary by a trustee of title to property he holds in trust for that beneficiary even though that trust be a resulting trust: <em>Burns v.
