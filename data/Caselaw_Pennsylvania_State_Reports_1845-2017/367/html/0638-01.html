He testified that when he came to the house line of Morris Street he looked to the left for a distance of 250 feet and saw no vehicle coming toward him; when he reached the center of the intersection he noticed for the first time a fire truck of the City of Philadelphia approaching about 100 feet away and traveling at a speed which he estimated at <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>55 to 65 miles an hour. He thereupon attempted to increase his own speed but when his automobile reached the north curb line of Morris Street the front of the truck hit the left center of his car. He said that the truck had not blown a siren nor given any other warning of its approach and he did not see any blinker lights on it until it was “coming into” him. The other occupants of the car testified, in general, that no siren had been blown and that they did not see the fire truck or its flashing red light until immediately before the collision.</p>

Four other firemen riding on the back of the truck also testified that as they traveled east on Morris Street the siren was blowing, the bell was ringing, and the rotary red light was flashing. A person asleep in his home a half block from the corner of Fifth and Morris Streets testified that he was awakened by the noise of the siren and the bell. Another person testified that he was in his house a half block from the intersection and he heard the siren and bell of the fire engine coming down the street. Another person testified that he was in his home about 75 feet from the corner and he heard the <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>siren “clanging . . . very loudly”. Still another person, standing on the northeast corner of the intersection, testified that he saw the fire truck approaching at about 20 miles an hour, that it started to slow down and at that time he saw the automobile “shoot out headed towards the north on Fifth Street”; his attention had been originally attracted by the siren and the bell.</p>

The court refused the City’s motions for judgment n.o.v. but granted its motions for a new trial. The plaintiffs, and Felix Bellettiere as additional defendant, appeal.</p>

In <em>Martin v.

The evidence so clearly supported the verdict that this action of the court was adjudged a manifest abuse of discretion. In <em>Stewart v. Ray, </em><a href="/pa/366/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="366 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="8845205" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0134-01">366 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20628" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="76 A.2d 628">76 A. 2d 628</a>, an order for a new trial was reversed because the trial court misconceived the true nature and effect of the testimony of one of the witnesses, and, in weighing that testimony, wholly ignored a settled principle of evidence. In all of those cases, however, the rule was again expressly asserted that an order awarding a new trial will not be reversed on appeal unless a palpable abuse of discretion on the part of the court below is <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>clearly shown, or unless an erroneous rule of law which in the circumstances necessarily controls the outcome of the case is certified by the court below as the sole reason for its action.</p>
    <p id="b666-4" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[259,559,1152,1409]]]'>In the present case the learned trial court did not, in so many words, express the opinion that the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence; such a conclusion, however, is clearly inferable from its observations concerning the testimony and its statement that “in the interests of justice a new trial should be granted.” The court was justified in the view it thus took of the evidence because the testimony of the firemen riding on the truck was corroborated by four entirely disinterested witnesses, whereas the story told by the plaintiff Felix Bellettiere that he did not see the fire truck until it was within 100 feet (although it had been coming along Morris Street from Eighth Street three blocks away) and that he then estimated its speed at from 55 to 65 miles an hour, can scarcely be regarded as convincing. While we would strongly impress upon trial courts the obvious desirability of stating in detail the exact reasons for which alone a new trial is granted instead of relying upon the mere generality that the “interests of justice” require it, we are, in the present case, of opinion that the court acted well within its discretion in awarding a new trial to the defendant both as against the plaintiffs and the additional defendant (who was himself one of the plaintiffs), in order that the issue involved may be finally determined with greater assurance of a just result.</p>

He <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>has wisely, it seems to me, impressed upon trial courts the desirability of stating in detail the exact reasons for which a new trial is granted. However, in this case a new trial was granted because “the interests of justice require it”; and I would affirm on that ground alone.</p>
    <p id="b667-3" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[176,620,1158,867]]]'>A trial court is a court of justice in whose conscience and sense of justice we should repose the utmost confidence and trust. A trial judge sometimes senses from the manner of testifying, or from little incidents that happen in a courtroom during the trial, things which an appellate court reading a cold bare record cannot possibly detect. He may believe or be convinced that (one or more) witnesses are lying, or exaggerate or distort to such an extent as to be unworthy of belief, or for some other reason their testimony is unreliable, or that a party’s case is fabricated out of the whole cloth— yet he does not wish to stigmatize the witness (or witnesses) and so he grants a new trial “because the interest of justice requires it.” Under such circumstances how is an appellate court in a position or qualified to say that the trial judge abused his discretion?</p>
    <p id="b667-4" data-blocks='[["BL_667.5",667,[172,1508,1155,535]]]'>I would, therefore, hold that where a trial judge who sees and hears the witnesses grants a new trial, not for an error of law or because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, but solely because of his conscientious conviction that the interest of justice requires it, an appellate court will not, in the absence of fraud or collusion, reverse such action. This view is supported, I believe, by both reason and authority: <em>Weinfeld v.
