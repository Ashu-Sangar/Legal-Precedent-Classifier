All three writings were presented to the Register of Wills for probate and were certified to the Orphans’ Court of Greene County under sec. 18 of the Register of Wills Act of June 7,1917 P. L. 415, 20 PS 1981. The case was heard by President Judge Matthews of the Orphans’ Court of Fayette County, specially presiding. The hearings consumed over seven days. The printed record consists of 744 pages. The learned hearing judge made an exhaustive analysis of the evidence, which relieves us from a detailed recital of the circumstances leading up to and bearing upon the present litigation. The issue resolves itself to the single question whether decedent’s signature to the paper of November 19,1949 (republishing the earlier will of July 2, 1947) was forged, Judge Matthews decreed that no substantial dispute upon a material matter of fact was shown to exist, and directed the probate of both papers as the last will and testament of decedent. These appeals followed.</p>

Pochron, but no issue. Her estate, consisting of real and personal property said to be valued at about $80,000, had been inherited from her former husband, Claude F. <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Southard, who died in 1936: On August 3, 1946,. testatrix married proponent. The record does not disclose her precise age but it was then estimated by her physician to be at least seventy at the date of remarriage. Proponent, then a lieutenant (junior grade) in the United States Navy, was twenty-three; They gave their ages ’at the Maryland Marriage License Bureau as twenty-three and forty-five.</p>

On July 2, 1947 decedent executed a professionally drawn witnessed will under which she directed the erection of a monument, devised and bequeathed the residue of thé estate to proponent absolutely, and named him sole executor. No question is raised regarding this document.</p>

It is this document which the surviving husband charged was obtained through undue influence. We agree with the hearing judge that the record is wholly devoid of evidence, sufficient in quality, to support the grant of an issue <em>devisavit vel non, </em>because of alleged undue influence, in connection <em>with the will of </em>October 26, 1948.

Decedent answered- that it was. The proponent’s brother Robert was in the. room. All three attesting witnesses testified that decedent then signed the paper in their presence and in the presence of each other. No question is raised concerning the testamentary capacity of decedent. This is conceded.</p>

They held safe deposit boxes jointly; she executed a letter of attorney giving him dominion over her securities; she executed to him a bill of sale of personal property. She also deeded real estate to proponent and presented him with a new. automobile. It is undenied that except for some periods when the husband attended college in another state he and she lived together as husband and wife from the time of their marriage until her death, over three years later.</p>

There is a great difference between factual and opinion testimony. In the one the witness testifies to the fact and certifies that what he says of it is true.
