The court below decided this question in favor of the 2% rate ou the entire bequest, — a conclusion which, in our opinion, is erroneous.</p>

But in considering, from a practical standpoint, the question as to the proper tax to be imposed under the 1919 Act, the stepson and his wife must be regarded as each having a one-half interest in the bequest, with the result that the tax on his half share will be at the rate of 2% and the tax on her half share at the rate of 10%.</p>
