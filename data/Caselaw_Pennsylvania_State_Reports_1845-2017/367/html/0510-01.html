During and prior to that time he sent money to defendant, Alyce Heiner, to keep for him. These remittances totaled $8937. On September 10, <em>1945, </em>plaintiff bought the Prospect Avenue property from his brother for <em>$2500. </em>The purchase price was, at plaintiff’s direction and on his behalf, paid by Alyce out of the $3937 he had sent her. The balance of approximately $1400 was paid to plaintiff by Alyce in April 1947. Plaintiff had demanded, received and kept an exact account of the amounts due him over the years from Alyce for money which plaintiff sent her, less the cost of medicine and other necessities which Alyce purchased for plaintiff. Plaintiff became ill and returned to his home in October 1946; and from that time until February 1948, Alyce took care of him (except for one month when he was a patient in Jefferson Hospital, in Philadelphia).</p>

Rafferty, on plaintiff’s behalf, filed an application for a loan with the Scranton Building &amp; Loan Association. <em>On February 12,1948, </em>Rafferty advised plaintiff it was doubtful whether the Building &amp; Loan Association would grant him a loan while he ivas in the hospital. Plaintiff then said that he might as well turn the property over to the Heiners and let them get the loan and pay the money to him, since the property would be the Heiners’ in any event. Rafferty, -in accordance with plaintiff’s instructions, drew á deed for the property to the defendants and next day, i.e. <em>February 18, 1948, </em>accompanied by his secretary, Mary McNamara, a. notary public, brought'the deed to plaintiff who was still in the hospital. Plaintiff read, signed and acknowledged the deed before his attorney and the notary public and the notary public signed and placed her seal thereon. <em>Plaintiffs doctor testified that at that time plaintiff was mentally competent and in full possession of his faculties. </em>Defendants first learned of the (deed or) transfer of this property to them when Mr. Rafferty phoned Mrs. Heiner and told her the deed had been executed and advised her of the. plan to mortgage the property in order to secure money to pay the bills incurred or likely to be incurred by plaintiff.</p>
