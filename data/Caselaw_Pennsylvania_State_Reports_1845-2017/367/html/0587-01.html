Tlie defendants alleged that the parties entered into a <em>joint business venture; </em>that the plaintiffs were to be paid $18,000. if the venture was a financial success; that unfortunately the venture resulted in a loss, and therefore no money was due the plaintiffs.

Defendants are two individuals trading as Abington Hills Farm, who operate a turkey farm at Dalton, Pa. On April 4, 1945, plaintiffs and defendants entered into a written agreement. The agreement recites that the defendants intend shortly to purchase turkey eggs in order to hatch and market turkeys, and have requested plaintiffs to enter into a joint venture with respect to <em>a portion </em>of such turkeys. The agreement then states that the <em>defendants </em>intended to borrow $24,000. to be secured by a chattel mortgage on all of the turkeys to be <em>owned by the defendants; </em>that the <em>defendants would purchase and pay for </em>a minimum of 30,000 turkey eggs, <em>grow </em>the turkeys therefrom, <em>sell </em>the turkeys and for such purpose <em>furnish </em>their farm, buildings, equipment, supplies, labor, machinery, technical knowledge, and all the necessary feed and foodstuffs, <em>at their own expense; </em>and a similar provision with respect to on additional 30,000 turkey eggs if they were <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>able — as they were — so to do. Plaintiffs agreed to forthwith contribute and pay to defendants $18,000. Defendants agreed to sell all the <em>60,000 turkeys </em>and “within thirty days after such sale or sales shall pay [to plaintiffs] a sum equivalent to one-half of the net profit or profits resulting from such sale or sales” of <em>6000 </em>turkeys; and “Upon the sale of all of the turkeys. . . <em>[defendants] shall forthwith </em>pay<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> [to. plaintiffs] <em>the aforesaid sum of Eighteen Thousand </em>($18,000.00) <em>Dollars” </em>There then followed a provision giving plaintiffs an option to purchase 6,000 of said turkeys at OPA or New York market prices; and a provision (a) that the defendants shall not incur any obligation whatsoever to bind ■ plaintiffs; and (b) that plaintiffs shall not be liable to pay any sum of money other than the said $18,000.</p>

The promise to pay $18,000. was clear, absolute, unconditional and unambiguous. Did other parts of the agreement create, as defendants contend, an ambiguity; and particularly, did the contract create a joint venture under the terms of which plaintiffs would be entitled to the aforesaid $18,000. only if the joint venture was financially successful? It will be noted that under the agreement the defendants had and retained sole title to the turkey eggs and to the turkeys and to the proceeds of sale; and that the <em>plaintiffs had no control or voice or management or supervision </em>with respect to the purchasing, mortgaging, raising or selling of the turkeys; <em>nor was there any agreement, express or implied, to share the losses.</em>
