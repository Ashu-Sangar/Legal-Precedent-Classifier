Such result, however, may be effective only when clear and unambiguous language is used: <em>Haydon’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/334/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="334 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1190718" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0403-01">334 Pa. 403</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20581" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 A.2d 581">6 A. 2d 581</a>; <em>Harris Estate, </em><a href="/pa/351/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="351 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="462747" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0368-01">351 Pa. 368</a>, 377, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20715" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="41 A.2d 715">41 A. 2d 715</a>; <em>Sarver Estate, </em><a href="/pa/353/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="353 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="465756" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0140-01">353 Pa. 140</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%20580" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="44 A.2d 580">44 A. 2d 580</a>. This is precisely what testator did do and in language crystal clear. In case the widow remarried he directed that she should no longer possess an absolute one third interest in the <em>business. </em>Her interest in the <em>business </em>was thereupon to cease and end. In lieu thereof the widow was given a <em>diminished </em>sum (because of the exclusion of the valuable good will of the business). This amount, at the widow’s election, was nevertheless to be paid to her in cash or left as a loan secured by notes. <em>This reduced share was payable to the widoio ABSOLUTELY and not merely for life. </em>It is plain that in clear and unequivocal language, in case of remarriage the interest of the widow irrespective of <em>quantum, </em>was an <em>absolute </em>one and not for a lesser estate.</p>
