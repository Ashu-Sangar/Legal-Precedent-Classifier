The lease contained several covenants to be performed by lessee in regard to the use of the premises and other matters, and it provided that in case of a violation of such covenants lessor should notify lessee, in writing, specifying the particulars of such breaches or defaults, and, if they were not remedied within 60 days after receipt of such notice, lessor might enforce forfeiture of the lease and retake possession of the leased premises. There was also a provision that if at any time the premises were deserted or closed lessor might enter and re-let the premises as agent of lessee for any unexpired portion of the term. On any breach of covenant on its part lessee empowered any attorney, in an amicable action of ejectment for the premises, to enter confession of judgment, with release of all errors.</p>

On January 28, 1950 an amicable action and confession of judgment in ejectment were entered; there was annexed thereto an affidavit by plaintiff’s attorney stating that “pursuant to the terms of the Lease Agreement, Exhibit ‘A’, attached hereto, notice was served upon the Shippingport Sand Company on the 7th day of November, 1949, advising it of its breach of covenants of said Lease Agreement, and also advising it that if it persisted in such breach for a period of sixty days that under the terms of said Lease Agreement such breach would operate as a forfeiture.

E. C. P. 1002 to make such affidavit, and that the judgment was entered subsequent to the date when plaintiff entered and took possession of the premises. Plaintiff thereupon petitioned for a rule to amend the amicable action and confession of judgment by filing an additional affidavit nunc pro tunc to which there would be attached and made a part thereof a copy of the notice served upon defendant on November 7, 1949. An answer to this petition having been filed, the court allowed the amendment and dismissed defendant’s motion to strike off the judgment, from which order defendant now appeals.</p>
