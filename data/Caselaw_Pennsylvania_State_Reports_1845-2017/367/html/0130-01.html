In substance the reason assigned for the writ is that the case was not well tried by relator’s counsel in that he did not have relator testify on his own behalf, and did not produce reputation testimony. Whether he should have had relator take the witness stand and have produced reputation testimony was obviously, as every trial lawyer knows, a matter of judgment to be decided in the light of the circumstances as measured by various considerations of trial policy. Relator was represented by a highly reputable attorney of his own choosing, eminently qualified from the standpoint of ability, experience and industry. Had there.been occasion for any just criticism of his conduct of the trial it would undoubtedly have been presented to this Court when, not only the trial lawyer himself, but two other able and leading members of the bar, argued the appeal on relator’s behalf. It is to be noted that there is no suggestion in the petition that trial counsel was dishonest nor is the averment justified that he failed to devote all necessary time and attention in the preparation and trial of his client’s case.</p>
