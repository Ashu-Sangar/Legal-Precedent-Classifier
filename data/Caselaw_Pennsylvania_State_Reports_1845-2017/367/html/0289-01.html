L. 424, supra, (relative to burial grounds) referred to in paragraph 17 of the complaint, does not affect the right of condemnation within the line of a State highway and that the Act of 1945, P.L. 1242, Section 412, 36 PS §670-412, (State Highway Law), referred to in paragraph 18 of the complaint, relates only to an action by the telephone company against the Commonwealth and has no application to the instant case.</p>

We do not have the entire record in the Lawrence County proceedings before us. However,, the opinion and order- of Judge Braham does contain what we consider to be findings of fact presumably made on the basis of matters of record before him.. This opinion reveals that on September 4, 1946 the highway of the Commonwealth which theretofore had been 50 feet in width was extended to a width of 60 feet, as a result of which 5 feet of appellant’s land was taken. A copy of said plan was filed in the Office of the County Commissioners for Lawrence County on February 7, 1947. The State Highway Department during the summer of that year proceeded with the necessary widening. By reason of such extension in width, appellee sought, and was given, permission by the Secretary of the State Highway Department • to. move its right-of-way closer to <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>the edge of the newly condemned portion, <em>but wholly within the land taken by the Commonwealth. </em>Corroboration of the foregoing appears in paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 11 of the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[201,571,1151,1249]]]'>Clearly on the record before us the section of the law applicable to the instant case is Section 33, Clause 1 of the Act of 1874, P.L. 73, 15 PS §2292 and not the Act of 1947, P.L. 424, Section 1, 15 PS §2297. The former relates to the construction of facilities within the lines of public highways; the latter confers upon telegraph and telephone companies the power of eminent domain with respect to private real property “outside the limits of public roads, streets, lanes, alleys or highways”, and contains, <em>inter alia, </em>the proviso upon which appellant relies relating to “property used as a burying ground”. Section 1 of the 1947 Act expressly provides that the powers thereby granted are “in addition to the rights and powers already granted to telegraph and telephone corporations under the laws of this Commonwealth, and without impairment or limitation of any of their present rights and powers”. Section 412 of the Act of June 1, 1945, P.L. 1242, 36 PS §670-412, has no application for the decisive reasons given in the opinion of Judge Braham. The complaint on its face shows that appellee is acting wholly within its power and for that reason alone should be dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[202,1850,1146,320]]]'>Concluding as we do that the complaint fails to state a valid cause of action, it is unnecessary to pass upon the issue raised with regard to the respective jurisdictions of the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County and of Lawrence County in the instant proceeding.</p>
