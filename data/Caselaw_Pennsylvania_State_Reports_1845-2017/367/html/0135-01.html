Late in the afternoon of November 8, 1948, Joseph Saturno, sixty-five, was found bloody and unconscious in his first-floor three-room apartment in South Philadelphia where he lived alone. His condition was the result of an extremely brutal beating which he had received, unwitnessed, save by the perpetrators. He was promptly removed to a hospital where he died several hours later without having regained consciousness. There •were evidences from the condition of. .the apartment and the victim’s clothing indicating that robbery was the motive of. the culprit or culprits. . Within an. hour or two of the discovery of the crime, the police arrested Chambers, Bryant’s co-indictee, who lived but a short distance from the victim’s apartment. Prom information received from Chambers, the police sought Bryant as a suspect but were unable to find him; a search of Chambers’ house, where Bryant had been living, failed to uncover him.</p>

The police of the latter city were at once notified of Bryant’s apprehension and two detectives from Philadelphia went to Newark the same day. There, in the presence of a local officer in the Newark detective headquarters, they interviewed Bryant after having informed him that he was wanted in Philadelphia for murder. Bryant related that he and Chambers, at the latter’s suggestion, had gone to Saturno’s apartment on the afternoon of November 8th for the purpose of robbing him of money which Chambers claimed to have seen Saturno exhibit earlier that day; that Chambers slugged Saturno into uncon<a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>sciousness and repeated the sordid performance (ultimately with a blackjack he had picked up in the apartment) each time the victim showed signs of reviving; that, in the meantime, the two of them had searched Saturno, removing his shoes, socks and outer clothes for the purpose, and had ransacked bureaus and drawers, turning things topsy-turvy, in their quest for hidden money; that he (Bryant) had not struck Saturno; that, at Chambers’ direction, he had left before the robbery was completed and had gone back to Chambers’ house; and that, when Chambers returned there, he told Bryant, upon the latter’s inquiry, that he had not gotten anything from Saturno or his apartment, — an assertion which Bryant did not accredit. After Bryant had made this oral statement to the Philadelphia detectives, they returned home the same day, leaving the prisoner in the custody of the Newark police.</p>

They took him to the central police station in City Hall where they obtained from him a statement in question-and-answer form which one of the detectives typed. The preliminary questions asked by the detective and answered by Bryant, as shown by the statement, were as follows : “Q. What is your name, age and address? A. My name is Edward J. Bryant; I am 25 years of age, and my home is 218 Bailey Street, Steelton, Pennsylvania. Q. Do you know why you have been placed under arrest? A. Yes; for murder. Q. Are you willing to tell us your part in this murder? A. Yes, sir. Q. Have you been threatened in any way? A. No, sir. Q. Have any promises been made to you, in order to give this statement? A. No, sir. Q. We warn you at this time that anything that you tell us in this <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>statement can and will be used as evidence against you at the time of your trial in court. Do you understand that? A. Yes, sir. Q. Will you go .on then in your own way and tell us all that happened?” Bryant then related in detail substantially what he had told the detectives on December 8th in Newark as above recited. When the statement was completed, the accused signed it on each of its two pages.</p>

He was indicted for murder on January 12, 1949, was arraigned on January 14, 1949, and pleaded “Not Guilty”, being then represented by the public defender. Through the latter, Bryant at once moved for a continuance of the trial which was granted. At the same time, he made an affidavit of destitute circumstances and requested the court to assign him counsel which the court did four days later (January 18, 1949), appointing to defend him the experienced counsel who since then have at all times ably represented him. The trial was begun May 4, 1949, and ended two days later with the jury’s verdict as already stated.</p>

L. 15, Sec. 2, 19 PS §1187, impels the firm conclusion that the ingredients of murder in the first degree were proven to exist. The homicide, having been committed in the perpetration of a felony, was murder at common law and, consequently, murder in Pennsylvania and, the felony being robbery, the murder was murder in the first degree under our statute: Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, Sec. 701, 18 PS §4701. But, as the statements made by the accused to the detectives were vital to the establishment of his guilt, we have, then, to consider whether the statements were properly admitted in evidence.</p>

Nor is the constitutional right to assistance of counsel to be confused with .the right of a destitute defendant, charged with murder, to counsel by court assignment at public expense. The latter provision obtains with us by virtue of legislative direction: Act of March 22, 1907, P.

L. 105, Sec. IY, to which the Act of 1907, supra, is supplementary), it was “. . . <em>upon all trials </em>of the said capital crimes” that the right to assigned counsel initially attached (Emphasis supplied).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Act of 1907 is not an implementation of the constitutional right to assistance of counsel under Article I, Section 9 of the State Constitution. That provision is applicable to “all criminal prosecutions”' whereas the assignment of counsel, authorized by the Act of 1907, is limited to cases of destitute persons charged with murder. The statutory provision stems not from the constitutional right to assistance of counsel but from an appropriate regard for an essential of due process where one in need of counsel is on trial for his life. And, with us, the statutory provision with respect to the time of the ap<a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>pointment of such counsel, i.e., when the accused is “under indictment”, has been deemed to constitute compliance with the constitutional requirement of due process so far as the time of assignment of counsel to an accused is concerned. Of course, if one under arrest for <em>any </em>criminal offense (murder, no less) should ash for counsel and be refused leave to obtain such representation, that would raise a different question of infraction of a constitutional right: see <em>Commonwealth v.

The admissibility of confessions has been adjudged in this State on their evidentiary trustworthiness according to the circumstances and conditions attending their rendition. Such is the rule generally: see Wigmore, Evidence, Yol. Ill (3rd Ed.), §822. If a confession is voluntary, it is admissible in evidence but not if it is coerced. In <em>Commonwealth v. Charles Mosler, </em><a href="/pa/4/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="401928" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0264-01">4 Pa. 264</a>, 265, Chief Justice Gibson of this court, along with Justices Coulter and Bell, sat, more than á century ago, in the Oyer and Terminer Court of Philadelphia County for the trial of a defendant on an indictment charging him with murder. It appears that, — “In' the course of the trial, the attorney-general proposed to ask a witness what the prisoner had said to him immediately after the witness had told- the prisoner that' he must consider himself- under- arrést. This -was' objected- to by the prisoner’s counsel, on the grbund-that the com <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>fessions of a prisoner while in custody are not admissible as evidence.” In a per curiam opinion, apparently written by the Chief Justice, the question was ruled as follows: “Cases on the statutes of Philip and Mary, or on the 7 Geo. 4, c. 64, which has supplanted them, are inapplicable to a confession made to an officer who has the prisoner in custody. . . . But in no case has it been ruled, that such a confession must be preceded by an admonition to put the prisoner on his guard. . . . Considerable experience in criminal trials, at one period of my life, enables me to say that thus the law has been held in Pennsylvania. The arrest of the prisoner without warrant was undoubtedly legal; but no advantage was taken of the predicament in which he stood. Indeed, he had voluntarily confessed the perpetration of the act before he was arrested; and the subsequent inquiry by the witness, who had him in charge, had regard only to the circumstances. Whatever he said in reply to the question thus put, may undoubtedly be given- in evidence to affect him.” On the other , hand, if a confession, is the result of coercion or inducement practiced upon the accused, it is without probative value and therefore inadmissible in evidence. Whether a particular confession is less than voluntary, in other words, is the product of a will dominated by fear or falsely inspired hope, usually depends on issues of fact which are for the jury to resolve. But, where the evidence as to the will-destroying or will-impairing influences exerted upon the confessor are undenied or are otherwise competently established, the inadmissibility of the confession presents a question of law for the. court’s summary disposition.</p>

Spardute, </em>supra, at p. 47 quoted from Underhill on Criminal Evidence, 2nd Ed., see. 129, p. 249, to the effect that “The mere fact that the defendant was under arrest, or was in the charge of armed police officers when he made his confession, will not make a confession involuntary.” <em>Commonwealth v. Jones, </em>supra, quoted similarly and stated further on the authority of the <em>Spardute </em>case, supra, —“Nor are the [accused’s] statements invalidated by reason of the fact that [he] was not represented by counsel, no request for such representation ever having been made.” In <em>Commonwealth v. James, </em><a href="/pa/294/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="294 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1113387" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0156-01">294 Pa. 156</a>, 161, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20910" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="143 A. 910">143 A. 910</a>, this court said with respect to the complaint there made of the admission in evidence of a confession,: — “The only basis [of complaint] is that when it was made defendant was confined in the barracks of the state police and that he had been questioned by the state officers for a considerable period of time. This could not invalidate the confession [citing cases]. No evidence of threats, compulsion or anything else indicating impropriety in obtaining it appeared. Defendant did not challenge it by his own testimony. The evidence of the officers showed that it was voluntarily made.” See also <em>Commonwealth v. Cavalier, </em><a href="/pa/284/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="284 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="1092017" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0311-01">284 Pa. 311</a>, 315, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="131 A. 229">131 A. 229</a>, where it was held that the confession was not invalidated because “it was uttered to policemen who were investigating the crime. . . .” The situation is well described in <em>Commonwealth v. Eagan, </em><a href="/pa/190/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="190 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="905128" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0010-01">190 Pa. 10</a>, 21, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20374" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="42 A. 374">42 A. 374</a>, where the following was aptly observed, — “It is the manner and circumstances under which a confession is procured, not the person to whom it is made, that determines its admissibility. The motive of the confession <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>is plain. ‘Conscience doth make cowards of us all.’ Two confederates, starting out to commit burglary end in doing murder, and being arrested, each in his cowardly haste to throw the burden of the actual killing on the other, makes a confession that incriminates himself.” The foregoing is peculiarly apposite here in the light of the conflict between Bryant and his confederate, Chambers, whose appeal from his conviction of first degree murder was argued before us at the same time.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[237,913,1156,1374]]]'>The privilege against self-incrimination is a restraint upon judicial interrogation of one charged with crime. So long as statements by a suspect or an accused, made extra judicially, are wholly voluntary, their admission in evidence against him later does not violate the constitutional- privilege of remaining mute to rélevant questions. Such a person has not been <em>compelled </em>to give evidence against himself. For an interesting discussion of the historical background and purpose of the privilege, see Wigmore, Evidence, Vol. VIII (3rd Ed.), §§2250, 2251 and 2252, p. 276 et seq. The rule was designed to curb the judicial bully of the Star Chamber and High Commission type whose evident aim, too often, was to confound the innocent to secure their predetermined convictions. But, no valid reason suggests itself why a suspect should not be bound by what he freely tells investigating officers concerning the commission of a crime. Yet, the appellant argues that, wholly apart from the specific privilege against self-incrimination, it is a violation of due process to allow a suspect to tell willingly to interrogating police what he knows of the crime, for which he is under arrest, <em>until </em>he has been provided with counsel or has intelligently waived counsel and has been advised of his right to remain silent.</p>

But out of our knowledge that innocent men are sometimes accused, and our conception of the dignity and self-respect which ought to characterize the conduct of the'government of a great people, even in the detection and punishment of crime, has been born the principle that one accused must not be <em>compelled </em>to help in bringing about his own conviction” (Emphasis supplied). While that was said in a non-capital case, the standard of fair play there expressed is of such caliber ais ¡to meet the most exacting requirements for an accused’s proper protection in a capital case.</p>

The crucial circumstances in <em>Watts v.

S. 49</a>, which rendered admission in evidence of the elicited confessions in that case a denial of due process was that they were the product of sustained pressure and persistent interrogation by the police. In <em>Turner v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/us/338/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="338 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="3937819" data-case-paths="/us/338/0062-01">338 U. S. 62</a>, the disqualifying conditions were the subjection of the accused to a long process of police questioning in patent violation of his right to a prompt preliminary hearing which had been designedly withheld until interrogation produced confession. The mention in the <em>Turner </em>case of non-access to the accused on the part of friends and relatives accentuated the incommunicado character of the restraint; and the materiality of the failure to advise him of his light to remain silent lay in the fact that the undue antecedent inquiry could not have been accomplished otherwise. In <em>Harris v. State of South Carolina, </em><a href="/us/338/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="338 U.S. 68" data-case-ids="3947311" data-case-paths="/us/338/0068-01">338 U. S. 68</a>, use of the confession as evidence against the accused was violative of due process because the confession had been wrung from him through long and exhausting hours of interrogation by panels of five to six police officers, working in relays to allow <em>them </em>respite from the stifling heat of <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>the cubicle in which the questioning was conducted; and the accused, who throughout the inquisition had denied his guilt of the killings charged to him, finally yielded in his worn-down state when the officers cunningly threatened to arrest his mother. The fact that the accused had not been informed of “his rights” was merely added aggravation of the otherwise unconstitutional character of the gruelling to which he had been subjected.</p>

In no instance was failure to inform the accused of his right to secure counsel and to remain silent any more than an additional, and not a solely controlling, incident. Thus, in <em>Haley v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/332/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="332 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="365086" data-case-paths="/us/332/0596-01">332 U.

It is when “confessions [are] extorted” that attendant circumstances, such as being “unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends .or counsel”, take on. significance: see <em>Ward v.

Tbe rule that tbe evidentiary criterion for adjudging the admissibility of an extra judicially obtained confession is its testimonial trustworthiness has been federally applied: see <em>Wilson v. United States, </em><a href="/us/162/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="162 U.S. 613" data-case-ids="6141160" data-case-paths="/us/162/0613-01">162 U.

At tbe same time, it is also to be recognized that tbe circumstances attending tbe making of a confession may be such as to impeach its integrity, as a matter of law, even though its contents be otherwise proven credible and that, in such instance, its use as evidence will be stricken down as a denial of federal due process: cf. <em>Lisenba v.

In the <em>McNabb </em>case a federal prosecution was involved, but, as that case plainly indicates, the Supreme Court standard of due process required of the States is, at least, no stricter than that required of subordinate federal courts.
