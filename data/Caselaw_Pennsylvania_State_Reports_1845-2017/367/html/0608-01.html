The case is not authority for such a principle. While an application for a variance may have been filed with the Board of Adjustment in that case without any appeal, the question of whether the application was proper without an appeal was not raised or considered in this Court. What that case decided is that the Board of Adjustment must, under the Act of Assembly, take jurisdiction of (and exercise a judicial discretion in granting or refusing) a petition for a variance where the “ 'conditions specified by the enabling Act and the ordinance, exist, namely; special conditions, unnecessary hardship and etc., and when these conditions do not exist, the only remedy of an applicant for a variance is through legislative action. . . .’ ”</p>
