The consideration recited in the deed was One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and valuable considerations.</p>
    <p id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[266,780,1150,264]]]'>The chancellor found that the deed was the free and clearly understood act of the plaintiff and that she received a fair settlement for all her property rights. From a decree dismissing the bill, plaintiff has taken this appeal.</p>

    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.6",200,[266,1181,1151,755]]]'>Plaintiff and defendant, prior to the above-mentioned deed (dated April 11, 1949), had a joint bank account amounting to $7,672.31. Plaintiff admitted she withdrew from this account $7,475.00 between June 23 and November 29, 1947, but alleged that she used $3,-975.00 of said amount with her husband’s knowledge and consent and that she put the balance of $3,500.00 in a joint bank account. The chancellor obviously did not believe the plaintiff for he found that plaintiff was guilty of considerable misconduct with another man and <em>surreptitiously withdrew large sums of money from their joint account </em>and took a large part of it with her on an escapade, which she refused to account for or to explain satisfactorily.</p>

Under the terms of this settlement, plaintiff agreed to convey her interest in the aforesaid real estate and to leave the premises, in return for $1,000.00 and a settlement and forgiveness of all withdrawals of money which she had <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>made. Plaintiff was, and is, possessed of business acumen above the average; she was represented by counsel during the entire proceedings, including the settlement negotiations, during which her counsel (who was also the family lawyer) prepared said deed at her instance and had it executed by her at his office, separate and apart from defendant; the settlement and the deed was as much the idea and wish of plaintiff as it was of defendant. The chancellor further found that the settlement made between plaintiff and defendant was fair and equitable; that the execution of said deed was a free and voluntary act on the part of the plaintiff, who knew the exact legal effect thereof; and that she was not at that or any other time under the domination of her husband.</p>
