    <p id="b627-4" data-blocks='[["BL_627.7",627,[150,481,1147,154]]]'>This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County dismissing relator’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.8",627,[150,648,1148,539]]]'>Relator was convicted of murder in the first degree with the penalty fixed by the jury at death. The crime was the killing of a police officer, whose death was caused by gun shot wounds while he and another police officer were pursuing relator from a burglary, in order to place him under arrest. There was ample circumstantial evidence of relator’s guilt which was confirmed by his written admissions. On appeal this Court affirmed the judgment and sentence, reported in <a href="/pa/368/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="368 Pa. 157" data-case-ids="1230382" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0157-01">368 Pa. 157</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%20240" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="82 A.2d 240">82 A. 2d 240</a>.</p>
    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.9",627,[150,1200,1148,704]]]'>By a petition filed in this Court on October 29, 1951, relator sought to invoke the extraordinary aid of the Act of April 22,1903, P. L. 245, sec. 1, 19 PS 861, which empowers us to “grant a rule for new trial, nunc pro tunc,” whenever we are convinced that <em>after discovered evidence </em>exists which “is ground for substantial doubt as to the guilt of any prisoner convicted of murder of the first degree”. On November 15, 1951, we entered a PER CURIAM order refusing the petition. The allegations of after discovered evidence were wholly insufficient, even if proven, to' constitute evidence of such quality and therefore could not raise substantial doubt as to guilt.</p>

The essence of each is the allegation that “petitioner has since discovered . . . that, the statement made by the ballistic expert was entirely untrue in that the kind of bullet described’ [the’fatal bullet]’ could have been fired, and most likely was fired, from a gun held in the hands of a policeman.’: ’.”-The statement that, the bullet “most likely .was fired” . from . . .the. policeman’s gun’ is obviously no. more than ’ a possible conclusion <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>from the evidence sought to be introduced. The sole evidence which relator now alleges that he will be able to produce if given a new trial is expert testimony to contradict the evidence of the Commonwealth’s witness that the fatal bullet could not have come from the policeman’s gun. Relator’s counsel, <em>at trial, </em>attempted by cross-examination to contradict the Commonwealth’s expert testimony that the two types of guns required different size cartridges. In addition to the vigorous cross-examination relator’s counsel went so far as to try to force the regulation cartridge into the special revolver offered in evidence. The evidence now belatedly sought to be adduced would be but the further attempt at contradiction.</p>

He seeks, however, to find an invasion of relator’s constitutional rights in the failure of <em>trial counsel </em>to establish the possibility that the fatal bullet came from the policeman’s gun. He somehow ascribes this failure to the fact that trial counsel never <em>personally </em>visited relator in prison, although his court-appointed associate did so on numerous occasions. He states in his brief: “Investigators and assistants, of course, furnish trial counsel with invaluable aid, but he alone, by frequent talks with the defendant, learns the defendant’s mannerisms, and much of the facts needed first hand to present the case at the Bar of the Court. <em>Anything less than this is a deprivation of due process </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>

It is true that the accused in a capital case is entitled to the assistance of counsel. In Pennsylvania this assistance is assured to the indigent by the Act of March 22, 1907, P. L. 31, amended by the Act of April 6, 1949, P. L. 406, 19 PS 784. Pursuant to that act, counsel who tried the instant case beginning on February 6, 1950, were appointed by the court on September 14, 1949. This right to counsel extends to all stages of the proceeding: <em>Powell v.

    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[263,758,1147,1302]]]'>Relator’s entire case rests on the proposition that he was deprived of due process of law because trial counsel assigned to an associate the task of visiting relator in prison and assembling the evidence necessary for the defense. We unhesitatingly reject this proposition. More extensive charges of dereliction of duty by counsel were rejected by the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania in <em>U. S. ex rel. Thompson v. </em>Dye, Civil Action No. 10,303. In an opinion filed March 14, 1952, Judge Marsh said: “As indicated above, with a life at stake, we thought that a hearing upon the averments of the petition was imperative. By so doing, however, <em>we are not to be understood as condoning the practice of permitting convicts to put their counsel on trial after adverse results of their own trials have been reached. </em>This particularly applies to assigned counsel in a capital case whose task is peculiarly onerous, thankless, and fraught with apprehension. A federal court can not be used to measure the diligence used in preparing such a case for trial in the state court by counsel of relator’s own choice; neither can it'be used to try his legal capacity or ability in the trial of such case nor to examine his conscience.”</p>

Since the issue is one of such moment — nothing less than life and death itself — it would be worth the time and trouble to see what defense counsel has in the way of evidence which could possibly upset the verdict of the jury which assessed the supreme penalty for the defendant.</p>

And on that subject the United States Circuit Court said: “Who killed Almeida was a relevant issue, as to penalty to be imposed by the jury at the trial, perhaps the most relevant one. Under the Act of June 24, 1939, the jury had the power of life or death over Almeida. . . There could be no avoidance of this issue and there was none. This is why the Commonwealth endeavored to prove that Almeida or one of his confederates shot Ingling and why Almeida’s counsel tried to show that Ingling came to his death by a bullet fired by a member of the police force.”</p>

The Circuit Court said in the <em>Almeida </em>case on that subject: “We cannot determine with absolute certainty the reason for the refusal of the writ. Our difficulty in determining why the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania refused the writ is enhanced because the Court took no testimony and made no findings.
