    <p id="b231-9" data-blocks='[["BL_231.14",231,[153,1322,1148,313]]]'>Bessie L. Young, appellant, presented an itemized claim against the estate of Andrew Smiley Sanders, the decedent, for room, board, laundry, nursing and other personal service. It amounted to $5,615.13 and was for the period from September 7, 1945 to December 29, 1949.</p>
    <p id="b231-10" data-blocks='[["BL_231.15",231,[154,1657,1155,709]],["BL_232.1",232,[243,362,1145,326]]]'>An auditor appointed by the orphans’ court dismissed the claim; his findings of fact and conclusions of law were approved by the court. In his well considered report he meticulously considered this tangled web of testimony. We will not, therefore, restate the facts. No contract was proven. The claim necessarily rests upon <em>quantum meruit. </em>Claimant, a widow, was a lay preacher in a religious denomination. She resided for a period in the church parsonage.. With permission of the church board, claimant took decedent into-her home as a lodger; decedent cultivated the - garden-, raised vegetables, mowed the lawn, did odd jobs about the parsonage and drove claimant about in his auto-<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>mobile when sbe visited parishioners; during part of this period decedent paid claimant $30 per month and also paid for the use of a garage; at other times decedent paid claimant $30 per week for nursing service. There was also testimony of alleged service of nursing, etc., at other places than in the parsonage.</p>
    <p id="b232-4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[243,705,1146,259]]]'>The auditor dismissed the claim upon the grounds: (1) that the testimony was too vague, indefinite and uncertain to support the claim (2) there is a presumption of payment (3) that there was payment for any service.</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[243,983,1145,430]]]'>In affirming the auditor’s report the court below also said: “The mere reading of the details of the itemized claim filed by Mrs. Bessie L. Young against the estate of decedent is sufficient in itself to shock the conscience of the Court. However, when we read the record through and analyze-it in all its detail, we find no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that it is made up out of the whole cloth; false in one, false in all.”</p>
