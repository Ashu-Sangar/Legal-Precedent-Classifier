    <p id="b362-6" data-blocks='[["BL_362.9",362,[246,749,1147,601]]]'>The accident giving rise to this suit in trespass occurred during the reconstruction of Route 422 in Butler County when Paul Lee Sankey, an employe of the construction company was struck and killed by a truck owned and operated by James Russell Young. John C. Sankey, administrator of Paul Sankey’s estate, brought this action against Young under the Wrongful Death Act and the Survival Act. At the trial the jury returned a verdict that both defendant and Sankey were guilty of negligence. A motion for new trial was dismissed and judgment was .entered for defendant.</p>
    <p id="b362-7" data-blocks='[["BL_362.10",362,[244,1363,1147,984]]]'>The new road known, as State Highway Route 422 was to be a three-lane concrete highway. On July 6, 1949, the date of the accident, one outside lane had been compléted and the center lane was being laid. To facilitate this process a “batch plant” was set up some distance from the place of operation and there the dry concrete was made according to formula. Some ten to twenty trucks, among them defendant’s, were employed to haul the dry concrete from the batch plant to the mixer where it was mixed and poured onto the road bed. To assure constant production the dry concrete had to be delivered to the mixer at a rate of one truck load every minute and a half. The mixer was set up in the third lane which had been rough graded but not finished. The trucks would drive up that lane, turn around and back-up to the mixer. Because-of the necessity for rapid delivery several trucks were usually in line awaiting their turn to deliver to the mixer.</p>

' A projection on the spreader extended twenty-six inches into the lane used by the trucks and on that projection was placed a can of water. At about 10:30 A.M., Sankey and several other workmen had gone to the water can for a drink. At that time, defendant’s truck was stopped with its motor running fifteen to twenty feet beyond the water can and in a position to back past it in going toward the mixer. Sankey stood to the rear of defendant’s truck and looking away from it. Someone called out that a truck was overturning near the mixer. Sankey took two steps toward the mixer when he was struck by defendant’s truck which had at the same time begun backing up. The injuries caused by the accident resulted in Sankey’s death a few minutes later.</p>

The jury properly found that in backing his truck without giving warning or ascertaining that no one was behind him, he failed to exercise reasonable care: <em>Potter Title and Trust Co. v.

His failure to do so was negligence, but negligence, however gross, :is not wantonness: <em>Turek v. Pennsylvania R. R.

There is no evidence that defendant kneAV Sankey was in a position of danger. KnoAvledge that a person is in fact in a position of peril or circumstances from which such knowledge can be inferred must be shown before wanton misconduct can be found to exist: <em>Engle v.

    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[239,1410,1145,591]]]'>Plaintiff also argues that since Sankey was a Avorkman he could not be held to the same degree of care as a pedestrian. That rule is, however, only applicable where the injured person is actively engaged in his work at the time of the accident. As Ave said in <em>Copertino v.

He was fully aware of the procedure followed in backing the trucks to the mixer. In fact, one of plaintiff’s witnesses testified that he was at the water can at the same time but stood inside the form <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>for tlie center lane as a precautionary measure. Under those circumstances the jury was fully justified in finding Sankey guilty of contributory negligence. This is true even though a truck overturned near the mixer. The trial judge instructed the jury that they were to find the facts by careful consideration of all of the evidence and from those facts determine whether Sankey exercised reasonable care under the circumstances. With those instructions in mind it is obvious that the jury believed that the overturning truck was not an occurrence of such a nature that a reasonably prudent man would have been diverted to such an extent that he would have disregarded his own safety.</p>

Apparently a youth of ambition and energy, he worked at various jobs during evening hours and vacation time while attending high school and college. Of a saving disposition, and seeking to lessen the financial burden of his parents, he obtained employment in the summer of 1949 on a state road construction job to help pay for his tuition at law school.</p>

An eight hour day’s work was to accomplish the paving of 2250 feet of such slabs, practically a mile. A fleet of some twenty trucks carried the dry concrete ingredients known as “batches” to the concrete mixer or paver, the paver mixed the batch with water, a boom carried the wet mix to the steel frames, a spreading machine known as a “spreader,” tamped and spread the compound evenly and then a finishing machine completed the operation.</p>

This watering place, as is true all over the world and in every type of vocation and occupation, became a spot where men gathered if only for the few moments absorbed in waiting for one’s turn, drawing the water and swallowing it. The water was <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>contained in a garbage can (presumably one never used for garbage) with a spigot attached, so that satisfying one’s thirst was not merely a matter of an unlingering instant.

About 20 feet away from the drinking place a truck was halted, in position to back to the mixer about 100 feet away. The men were standing between the watering place and the mixer. Paul Sankey had handed to one of his fellow-workmen a package of tobacco and had moved forward to draw himself a draught of water. While still holding the cup in his hand, the truck, without signal of any kind and without warning from the driver, suddenly started backwards, heading for the paver and for the men in its path.

Without more, this was insufficient. The jury could not determine whether the defendant was guilty of negligence without knowing the degree of care required of the defendant in keeping the bridge in repair. The absence of this care would constitute ■ the negligence for which the defendant would be responsible.
