The present bill in equity was filed October 4, 1951. According to the argument on appeal, it would appear <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>that the real question upon the merits is whether the permit granted related to a <em>commercial </em>project or was limited to a <em>residential </em>use.

These matters have no relevancy to a determination of the <em>forum </em>in which the propriety of such action shall be <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>adjudicated. Section 8 of the Zoning Act, supra, provides that “Appeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved ... by any decision of the administrative officer.” Whether or not the order of August 1, 1947, was a proper one under all the circumstances, nevertheless, it constituted a “decision of the administrative officer”. Indeed, two of the cases principally relied on by appellants in presenting the vested rights argument involved revocation of permits from which appeals were taken under the procedure provided by the Zoning Act. <em>Herskovits v. Irwin, </em><a href="/pa/299/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="299 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1122268" data-case-paths="/pa/299/0155-01">299 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.%20195" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="149 A. 195">149 A. 195</a>, is probably the leading case in this Commonwealth on the doctrine of vested rights accruing from improvements made pursuant to a zoning permit. There the property owner appealed to the board of adjustment objecting, <em>inter alia, </em>that “the building inspector, at the direction of the township commissioners, revoked the permit which he had previously issued.” The board of adjustment reversed the building inspector. On subsequent appeals provided by the Zoning Act, both the court below and this Court sustained the action of the board of adjustment. The present appellants have given the <em>board of adjustment </em>no opportunity to reverse the Bureau: See sec. 9, Zoning Act, supra, 53 PS sec. 3830. In <em>Ventresca v. Exley, </em><a href="/pa/358/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="358 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="8845076" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0098-01">358 Pa. 98</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20210" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="56 A.2d 210">56 A. 2d 210</a>, the Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment directed the revocation of permits issued in accordance with certificates of variance which it had granted. The aggrieved property owner obtained a writ of certiorari from the Court of Common Pleas, which sustained his appeal. The City of Philadelphia and some intervening neighbors then appealed to this Court, and the order of the board of adjustment was reinstated. All this procedure complied with that provided by the Zoning Act. Mr. Justice Horace Stern, in delivering the unanimous opinion of this Court, said. <a id="p636" href="#p636" data-label="636" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*636</a>(p. 102) : “If, then, the certificates of variance were improperly and illegally granted, it would seem self-evident that the Board of Adjustment had not only the right hut the duty to revoke them even if there were no express grant of power of revocation given to the Board by statute or ordinance. In fact, however, the City Ordinance of August 10, 1933, section 29(6) does expressly provide that the Board ‘may . . . cancel or revoke a. Board of Adjustment certificate for the violation ... of this ordinance/ and since the Board is thus given the power to revoke a certificate if there be any violation of the ordinance on the part of the grantee it would be absurd to contend that it could not similarly revoke a certificate by the issuance of which it had itself violated both the ordinance and the Act of Assembly.” See also <em>Vogt v.
