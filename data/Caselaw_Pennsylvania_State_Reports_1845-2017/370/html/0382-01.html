      <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>Appellants maintain with vigor that testatrix “otherwise directs in her will,” when she provides that her residuary estate be divided into <em>equal </em>shares and thus precludes tax proration under the act. An equal division of assets, however, does not necessarily mean an equal <em>taso </em>burden. For example: if a testator directed that his estate be divided into two equal shares, one of which he bequeathed to a child and the other to a collateral relative, could it be logically contended that the word “equal” also related to transfer inheritance tax? We think not. As none of the gifts to the charities contributed to the federal tax burden, it is just and equitable that such charitable gifts should be relieved from the payment of any part of such tax. Testatrix’s use of the word “equal” does not indicate contrary intent.</p>
