    <p id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.9",116,[244,870,1149,489]]]'>On <em>May 3, 194-9 </em>a stipulation settling a suit in replevin was entered into signed by then counsel for appellant and counsel for appellee and approved by President Judge Ervin of Delaware County. Appellant on <em>January 12, 1951 </em>filed a petition to set aside this stipulation and reopen the case and a rule was granted. On January 22, 1951 the rule which was previously granted was refused without an answer being filed or a hearing held. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b116-8" data-blocks='[["BL_116.10",116,[239,1373,1153,878]]]'>Prom the allegations in the petition and record papers the following facts appear. On October 1, 1948 an action in replevin was instituted by appellant against appellee for 12 looms which were in the possession of the latter. Separate counts for damages and for an accounting were also asked in the complaint. After a petition requesting the production of certain books and records of appellee was dismissed, the case came on for trial and after the trial had proceeded for a time, the above mentioned stipulation was executed. Under the terms of the stipulation the appellant Avas to receive $5,000 within one week and upon payment of $25,308 to the appellee within 90 days he was to receive the looms. If, however, he did not pay such amount within 90 days, the looms were to become the property of appelleé.</p>
    <p id="b116-9" data-blocks='[["BL_116.11",116,[241,2264,1148,92]],["BL_117.1",117,[144,357,1150,537]]]'>In his petition appellant alleges that his counsel told him that he Avas threatened with a nonsuit and- that <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>appellee offered to settle “for $5,000.00 and the machinery”; that upon recommendation of his counsel he agreed to such offer; that his counsel told him to go to a restaurant where they met; that at that time appellant for the first time “. . . saw the stipulation and on the same day voiced his objections to paying the sum required for the machinery <em>loithin 90 days”; </em>and that the $5,000 check was received by his counsel and cashed “'against [his] directions” and that $3,250 of such amount was turned over to him.</p>
    <p id="b117-3" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[144,916,1150,322]]]'>About two weeks after the trial petitioner wrote to the trial judge and requested a conference with regard to the settlement but did not include in such letter any objections to the stipulation or the authority of his counsel to execute it. He later withdrew his request for this conference.</p>
    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[141,1253,1152,603]]]'>The next action taken by appellant was on January 27, 1950, eight months later, when with new (present) counsel acting for him, he filed a petition to set aside the settlement and reopen the case on the grounds that the testimony given by an officer of the defendant (called for cross-examination) “approached perjury.” The lower court after answer denied this petition on March 8,1950, and nothing was done by appellant until January 12, 1951 when for the first time appellant alleged that his original counsel did not have authority to enter into the stipulation.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.6",117,[139,1869,1152,490]],["BL_118.1",118,[265,357,1149,656]]]'>Several significant conclusions appear from this summary of the facts. Appellant <em>hnew </em>the terms of the stipulation shortly after it was signed by his attorney and approved by the trial judge. At that time his only alleged objection was to “paying the sum required for the machinery <em>within 90 days”. </em>Despite this dissatisfaction, he elected to take the net proceeds of the $5,000 when his counsel gave them to . him. He waited for eight months before he filed any formal <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>objection, at which time he did not claim any lack of authority on the part of his attorney. He then delayed ten months more before he finally repudiated the stipulation. This was twenty months after admitted knowledge of its terms. There is no allegation that at any time before the filing of the petition here involved he communicated his disavowal of the agreement to the appellee. Under such circumstances the lower court was correct in refusing the rule and we agree with the opinion when it states, "... a careful consideration of the petition filed herein, as the basis for the rule, indicated that a rule was neither necessary nor desirable.”</p>

The appellant, in a sworn pe<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>tition, averred that at a conference between his lawyer and the defendant company’s lawyers, (held in a room adjoining the Court) the officers of the defendant corporation were apparently present but that the appellant was denied admittance. The appellant further averred in his petition that, during his absence, a stipulation was entered into and that this stipulation was not exhibited to him until later on in a restaurant and that on that very day he voiced objections to the stipulation, asserting it did not represent what he had agreed to. The petition also declared that the appellant was willing to return the $5,000 paid by the defendant, if the Court would set aside the stipulation and settlement.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.4",120,[240,1148,1150,824]]]'>So far as this action is concerned, the statements made by the appellant in his petition must be accepted as true since they were sworn to and were <em>not denied </em>by the defendant. In fact, the defendant did not even file an answer to the petition.

A hearing could have placed the prop of substantiation under the bough of his surmise, but without a hearing the surmise falls to the ground emptily.</p>
