Fifty-six years after such construction, in 1918, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania condemned for a state highway a fifty foot wide strip of land running approximately at right angles to the defendant railroad’s right of way on which it built a state highway; the state constructed a bridge with a span of eighty-seven feet over the cut; the cartway over the bridge was seventeen and eight-tenths feet wide; and a footwalk approximately six and one-half feet wide on the west side of the bridge was separated from the cartway by a low sturdy metal wall. Along the edge of the highway approaching the bridge, at the top of the railroad embankment, the highway department constructed a guard fence composed of two wire cables supported by wooden posts. Since only thirty of the fifty feet condemned by the state are actually paved or used for highway purposes, land owned by the state extends about fifteen feet beyond the guard fence onto the cutout constructed by the railroad company. The guard fence is thus well within the boundary of land owned and maintained by the highway department. The hole into which plaintiff stepped was located about fifteen or twenty feet from the northeast corner of the bridge, on the highway side of the guard fence. It was about two or three feet deep and was the upper extremity of a washout which extended all the way down the. bank of the . railroad cut. Plaintiff was injured <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>when she moved back from the traveled portion of the highway to avoid a passing automobile, stepped into the hole, slipped under the guard fence, and fell to the foot of the embankment. It is undisputed that the cause of the hole in the highway was the erosion of the surface by rainwaters washing down the embankment.</p>

He is under no duty affirmatively to <em>supply </em>lateral support. See Restatement, Torts, sec. 817 et seq. The force of this rule as it applies to highways is set forth in 3 Nichols on Eminent Domain (3rd ed.) sec. 9.221 [1], Limitation upon use of adjacent land: “. . . after the taking the owner cannot lawfully injure or destroy the public work erected thereon, even by a <em>use </em>of his own land that would be lawful as against an adjoining owner.. ..</p>

It is true that the defendant railroad company over ninety, years ago did <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>change the natural contour of its land when it dug this cut, but it did so at a time when it held title to all the land in question. When the state later condemned a portion of the defendant’s land for a highway, it only acquired the right to have Reading Company refrain from interfering with the lateral support for the highway provided by the land <em>as it then existed. </em>There is no evidence that the terms of the condemnation proceeding required the company to take any affirmative action to <em>provide </em>lateral support. For this reason, <em>Ligonier Valley Railroad Company v. Public Service Commission, </em><a href="/pa-super/83/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="83 Pa. Super. 502" data-case-ids="661292" data-case-paths="/pa-super/83/0502-01">83 Pa. Superior Ct. 502</a>, relied on by plaintiffs, is inapposite. There the Public Service Commission had, pursuant to proper statutory authority, imposed upon the railroad company the obligation of paying for the bridge over its right of way and <em>maintaining the same. </em>No such obligation is here involved. A fresh act of condemnation would be required to impose it. It has always been the rule that a sovereign acquires by condemnation only those rights for which it pays. Thus in <em>Pennsylvania Coal Company v. Mahon, </em><a href="/us/260/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="260 U.S. 393" data-case-ids="11926101" data-case-paths="/us/260/0393-01">260 U.

Ct. 158</a>, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional, as an improper exercise of the police power, a Pennsylvania statute forbidding mining in such a way as to cause subsidence when the right to mine without providing support had been expressly reserved in the deed to plaintiff. At page 415 Justice Holmes said for the court: “The rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support, we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much.”</p>

If this were true, then the jury might have been permitted to infer that the removal of this dirt froi|i the tracks was the chief cause for the erosion. But on cross-examination the witness admitted he only <em>surmised </em>that this was the way the erosion occurred. He said: “But when I saw it, the gully was there. ... It looks as though it formed at the bottom first because there was more dirt at the bottom than there was at the top.” With the witness’s testimony thus nullified by his own admission, there is nothing in the record to negative the conclusion from common experience that this erosion began on land owned by the State as rainwaters poured over the lip of the bank and carried loose dirt along. Such conclusion is supported by the fact, introduced into evidence without objection, that the defect was later cured by a stone wall erected by the highway department at its own expense at the <em>top </em>of the bank. Plaintiffs cannot escape the force of Reading Company’s argument that they produced no evidence to show that anything which happened at the <em>bottom </em>of the embankment on railroad property could have caused the erosion at the <em>top </em>of the state highway. Thus the plaintiffs have failed to sustain their burden of proving a causal connection be<a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>tween the hole in the highway and any activity of defendant.

    <p id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.10",76,[273,1994,1147,378]],["BL_77.1",77,[180,360,1147,209]]]'>Practically everyone connected with this case has referred to the irregularity into which Mrs. Beal fell as a <em>hole. </em>The photographs in evidence plainly show that it was not a hole. A hole has a certain configuration, and, no matter how lopsided or distorted, it must have a circumference. The outer edges of a hole, starting away from any given point must eventually meet <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>again. Otherwise, the depression involved is not a hole bnt a ditch, gully or ravine, depending on its size and the terrain involved, Generically it would be a declivity.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[179,584,1147,712]]]'>If the hollow space into which Mrs. Beal stepped was a hole, it is more difficult for her to establish a case against the defendant company than if it was something else. The responsibility for a hole could be charged to the State Highway Department for admittedly it had jurisdiction over the surface of the highway. The responsibility for a ditch or gully could more logically lead to the property of the defendant company. If there is a physical bond between the sunken area on Limekiln Pike and the property of the defendant railroad underneath the highway, a causal relationship is established upon which the charge of negligence may be founded. Photograph P-3 shows that bond.</p>

The most that can be said about the three quoted lines from Trunk’s testimony is that they present a conclusion of the witness. Trunk said the gully looked “as though it formed at the bottom first.” This does not contradict anything which he said before. He claimed through his entire testimony that the gully formed <em>at the bottom of the embankment: </em>“Q. I think I asked you something yesterday about the erosion in this bank. Where in the bank did you first notice the erosion start? A. At the bottom of the bank? Q. Yes. A. I would say approximately 30, 35 feet from the bridge east. Q. What was the course of this erosion? How did it progress? A. Well, it started <em>going up from the bottom of the </em>bank, <em>up until where this hole is. </em>It just kept on washing away <em>at the bottom of the bank.” </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>

      <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>Upon cross-examination lie maintained the same objective proposition from which he never deviated, namely, that the disintegration of the land first occurred on the defendant’s property: “Q. You do not want to tell this Court and jury that you went down onto the railroad’s property when this gully first formed and took a look to see where it started? A. Yes, sir. Q. You went down on the railroad property? A. Yes, sir.” Photograph P-3 shows an enormous cavity at the bottom of the slope next to the railroad tracks. From this point a ravine 2 to 4 feet deep led to the top of the embankment.</p>
    <p id="b78-4" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[222,958,1146,202]]]'>And from this ditch or cavity at the bottom of the embankment (on railroad property) the defendant carried away dirt in such quantities that it had to be moved in railroad cars.</p>
    <p id="b78-5" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[223,1187,1146,487]]]'>The witness Peter D’Angelo also testified to the same fact: “Q. I show you again Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 3 and ask you what is the formation of this section in here at the bottom of the slope? A. Well, that is more of rocks and dirt right there. It is a solid — mostly stone, rock there. Q. What is it down in this section (indicating) ? A. That is where your rock would come off the main or something. Q. Indicating the point at the end of the line? A. Yes.” [line marked on photograph]</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.6",78,[223,1695,1146,374]]]'>With the railroad company removing support at the bottom of the embankment it was inevitable that eventually the land would cave in somewhere at the top of the embankment. If one removes bricks from the bottom of a wall, a path of weakness will at once form to the summit, with the climaxing of a rupture or break at the top of the wall.</p>

You spoke of this ravine and you have marked it on this picture, (indicating Plaintiffs’ Exhibit 3). Do you know what happened to the dirt that was formerly in that ravine? A. I seen the railroad clean that ravine out, hauling the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>dirt away with their cars and putting it in their gondolas, I think they call them. Q. How long had you seen that? A. I seen it at least three or four times.”</p>
    <p id="b79-4" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[129,512,1148,710]]]'>Charged with the maintenance of the embankment, as it was, a duty devolved upon the railroad company to <em>fill </em>in the ravine, not dig it deeper. With each emptying of the ravine, a larger and deeper channel formed for the water and earth tumbling down the bank; and with 'this came a greater dislodgment of earth from the surface and the eventual breaking away of the lip of the road at the point where Mrs. Beal fell. The sequence of events which brought about the sloughing off of the roadway is chargeable to the defendant company as definitely as if it had used picks and shovels to cut away the pedestrian walk which Mrs. Beal and other wayfarers had the right to use.</p>
    <p id="b79-5" data-blocks='[["BL_79.5",79,[130,1235,1147,322]]]'>The responsibility of the railroad company for this accident is clear. The question of lateral support does not lie in any twilight zone of jurisprudence.

In holding the railroad company liable for damages incurred by a minor plaintiff who fell over the embankment caused by the railroad excavations, the Superior Court said: “As to the railroad the rule is well settled, and of general application, that a property owner who makes an excavation on his premises so near to an existing highway as to render the use of the road unsafe, will be liable to a traveler who, exercising due care for his safety, nevertheless falls into it and is injured.”</p>

When the railroad company made the excavation some twenty years before the accident, it had left a bank or shoulder 5 feet in width. Through the action of the elements this gradually disintegrated, causing the land to slide away until when the accident happened the protection had receded to a point too close to if not within the highway limits.</p>

In that case the plaintiff was injured when a bus in which he was riding was struck by rocks falling from a hillside overlooking the highway over which the bus was travelling. The highway had been constructed by the defendant Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company and the Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R. Co., and then, being dedicated to public use, was taken over by the State Highway Department for maintenance. The defendant Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company owned the hillside involved in the accident and had become aware that for four years prior to the accident numerous landslides and falls of rock had invaded the highway. As stated by the Court, the plaintiff claimed that: “. . . since the construction of the road changed the natural slope of the hillside which had theretofore been stable and in repose, there was thereby created a duty on the part of the Land Company and the Steel Corporation, which, in dedicating the 50 foot roadAvay, had retained ownership, possession, dominion and control over the slope, of subsequent watchful inspection and proper maintenance of their land abutting on the highway, and that, by their negligence in failing to conduct such inspections and to undertake the measures the necessity of which such inspections would undoubtedly have disclosed, they became liable for the injuries caused by the accident which resulted.”</p>

      <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>There, as here, the defendant company argued that no responsibility rested upon it since the highway on which the accident happened was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. But this Court, with all the force of precedent and reason, declared: “The duty of a municipality or of the Commonwealth itself to provide for the safety of the travelers on a public road is something wholly distinct from the duty of the adjacent landowners not to impair such safety by negligence in the maintenance of their own lands beyond the highway limits where such lands had been artificially changed from their natural state.”</p>
    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[229,1035,1149,430]]]'>Said the Court further: “It must once more be pointed out that the liability presently asserted by plaintiff is based upon negligence, not in the original location and construction of the highway, but in the failure of appellants as abutting landowners to perform their duty of properly inspecting and maintaining their property in such condition as not to be likely to cause danger to those traveling on the highway.”</p>
    <p id="b82-5" data-blocks='[["BL_82.5",82,[222,1485,1151,753]]]'>Exactly the same situation is true in the case at bar, namely, the failure of the Beading Company, abutting landowner to perform its duty of inspecting and maintaining its property in condition so that it would not likely cause danger to those traveling on the highway. The Beading Company’s own engineer testified to the danger caused by erosion when adjacent land is not protected: “Q. Of course as an engineer you are familiar with the nature of these banks and that they will from time to time erode and wash away, are you not? A. That is right. Q.

    <p id="b83-3" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[170,1194,1148,935]]]'>Could the railroad company have foreseen what occurred in this case? Only rejection of natural phenomena could answer that question in the negative. When the railroad company cut through the hillside it performed an operation which of itself affected the stratification of the surrounding terrain. As a ship cannot pass through water without temporarily disarranging ocean currents, levels and depths, so a steam shovel cannot eat its way through land without affecting the molecular order of what remains- — -particularly the facing of the earth which has just been sliced or gouged. Then, with the vibrations of heavy trains thundering through the artificial gorge, it is not unreasonable to foresee that the stratification of the earth will be further discomposed. It is because of this inevitable discomposition that sliced hillsides along highways are so often girded with heavy masonry.</p>

      <em>top </em>of the embankment. It was an effect caused by either the original excavation, the movement of the trains, natural erosion, weather conditions or from a combination of any number of these causes with possible other undisclosed causes. Regardless of origin, however, the undisputed fact remains that the slope at this point discharged so much dirt and rock that the railroad company had to carry it away on freight cars. Joseph Trunk, who is employed as a police officer and resided close to the scene of the accident for 20 or 25 years, and Peter D’Angelo, who also lived in the vicinity, both testified that they had seen the railroad company carry away dirt from this gash in the lower slope many times, and as recent as a month and a half before the accident.</p>
