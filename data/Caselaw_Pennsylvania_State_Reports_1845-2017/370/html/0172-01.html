This general principle is widely recognized. In Fletcher Cyclopedia of Corporations, Permanent Edition, Yol. 6-a, paragraph 2939, pages 667, 668, the law is thus stated: “It is the general rule that a gift of its property by a corporation not created for charitable purposes is in violation of the rights of its stockholders and is ultra vires, however worthy of encouragement or aid the object of the gift may be. It seems to be the rule that a private corporation has no power voluntarily to pay to a former officer or employee a sum of money for past services, which it is under no legal duty to pay, and which would not constitute a legal consideration for a promise to pay.” In <em>Rogers v. Hill, </em><a href="/us/289/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="289 U.S. 582" data-case-ids="3916592" data-case-paths="/us/289/0582-01">289 U.

Lohmeyer, </em><a href="/pa/364/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="364 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1223501" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0271-01">364 Pa. 271</a>, 275, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20294" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="72 A.2d 294">72 A. 2d 294</a>, where' this <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>Court after sustaining the payment of reasonable bonuses and pointing out that a court is not ordinarily warranted in substituting its own judgment as to the proper compensation of officers for the judgment of the directors, said: “. . . It is also true that directors may not vote to themselves or to the officers of the corporation compensation which is excessive, unreasonable and out of proportion to the value of the services rendered, and, if any such payments are made, the court, upon protest of a minority shareholder, may examine into their propriety and reduce them if found to be exorbitant. . . .”</p>

The lower court excluded the defendant’s offer of Regulation III of the United States Treasury Department, section 29.23(a)-9, which relates to and authorizes a corporation to deduct as a business expense the amount of the salary of an officer which is paid after his death to his widow. We have heretofore in this opinion taken judicial notice of this regulation, although Ave sustain the action of the court below in rejecting the offer of proof. The fact, if, as Ave assume, it is a fact, that this Avas one of the factors Avhich influenced the judgment or discretion of the directors, supports their good faith, but does not give legality to their act. The fact that a federal tax law may permit a deduction for tax purposes is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether a Corporation has the right and the power under the law of Pennsylvania <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>to give away its corporate assets.

In the light of these facts, it is difficult to believe that its effect could be altered or destroyed by any explanation or by any supplement. Appellants made no offer of proof with respect to any alteration of or supplement to the minutes or the resolution. However, it is evident from the. testimony and from .appellants’ contentions and arguments that they wished to prove additional reasons for the resolution — which stated that the payments to Mrs. Guerrisi were in recognition of the long and valued services-rendered to the corporation by her <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>husband — viz., that they voted unanimously for the resolution for the additional reasons that friction between two prospective or possible candidates for president would be eliminated, harmony would be continued, the business would be aided and their action would be for the best interests of the corporation.
