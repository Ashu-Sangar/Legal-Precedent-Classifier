      <em>mere fact that a grantor imposes restrictions on parts of a tract winch he sells does not raise any inference that he mecrns thereby to obligate himself to restrict the remainder of his property; in every such case there must appear [clear and] definite evidence of a purpose to bind the remaining land, </em>and that purpose must be clearly made known to the grantees: Cardozo, Ch. J. in <em>Bristol v. Woodward, </em><a href="/ny/251/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="251 N.Y. 275" data-case-ids="1988772" data-case-paths="/ny/251/0275-01">251 N.

In the successive sales of land by the Price Estate there was not apparent any such general scheme of development or uniform improvement, nor any such understanding with the several grantees, as would warrant the implication of a restrictive covenant with respect to the land retained by the Estate. No map or comprehensive plan was ever prepared or publicized; indeed the restrictive covenants in the various deeds, while similar to one another in some respects, were not uniform, and in many of them it was provided that the restrictions imposed could be released if the grantors, their heirs and assigns, consented; where such a provision appears the principles applicable to neighborhood schemes with mutual and reciprocal covenants have no pertinency: Gibney v.

      <em>Price v. Anderson </em>and <em>Ladner v. Siegel, </em>supra, are decisive of and rule the present case.
