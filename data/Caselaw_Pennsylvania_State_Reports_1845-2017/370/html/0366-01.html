    <p id="b389-10" data-blocks='[["BL_389.13",389,[159,1442,1149,544]]]'>In November, 1929, petitioner; while represented by two counsel, was arraigned and pleaded guilty to murder. The crime was determined to be murder in the first degree and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. In August, 1951, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging many reasons, all but two of which were abandoned. Only one contention merits discussion, viz.: that the record does not affirmatively show that he and his counsel were present at the time of the arraignment, plea and sentence.</p>
