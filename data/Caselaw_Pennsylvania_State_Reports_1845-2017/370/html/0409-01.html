The learned court below held in this case that notice was required promptly after the accident and directed a verdict for defendant, Indemnity Insurance Company of North America. Judgment was entered on that verdict and the insured, The Jeannette Glass Company, plaintiff, has appealed.</p>

      <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>On May 24, 1944, defendant issued to plaintiff a contract of insurance covering liability for personal injuries and property damage for a period of three years. That policy provided: “Upon the occurrence of an accident, written notice shall be given by or on behalf of the insured to the company or any of its authorized agents as soon as practicable after notice thereof has been received by its executive officers at the insured’s headquarters.” It is that clause out of which this dispute arises.</p>

On November 26, 1945, in the course of that construction work a steel beam fell and injured one Stucker, an employe of Eichleay. Carl T. Sloan, vice president of plaintiff, learned of the accident and arrived at the scene just as Stucker was being placed in an ambulance. He and two of plaintiff’s employes immediately conducted investigations which satisfied them that plaintiff was not liable. Two or three days later, Kirkland W. Todd, president of plaintiff, learned of the accident and after a summary investigation reached the same conclusion. Plaintiff did nothing to notify defendant of the accident until August 10, 1946, when a complaint in trespass, filed by Stucker, was served on it. Defendant denied liability on its policy because of plaintiff’s failure to give prompt notice. Stucker eventually recovered a verdict against plaintiff in the sum of $7000.00 which plaintiff settled in full by paying to Stucker $4000.00. To recover that sum plus the costs of defending that suit, plaintiff brought this action in assumpsit.</p>

It concludes that since it aqted Avith due diligence in making its investigation and reaching its conclusion there was no necessity for giving immediate notice to defendant. That argument ■ignores both the language and the purpose of the notice clause in the contract.</p>
    <p id="b434-5" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[240,1376,1148,655]]]'>That clause states: <em>“Upon the occurrence of an accident, </em>written notice shall be given . . .” (Italics added.) It is admitted that an accident occurred in which Stucker was seriously injured and that it was the type of accident covered by the policy. Also, plaintiff’s vice-president knew of the accident immediately after it occurred and the president not more than two or three days latér. Under those circumstances it was incumbent upon plaintiff to give notice as soon as possible after its executive officers learned of the accident. Thus, there can be no excuse for the delay of eight and one-half months in notifying defendant.</p>
    <p id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[239,2049,1146,320]],["BL_435.1",435,[147,362,1151,756]]]'>The fact that plaintiff investigated the accident and determined it was not liable does not justify this failure. Eather, in view of the verdict for Stucker, it emphasizes the reason this failure releases defendant from liability. As we said in <em>Bartels B. Co. v. Employers’ I. Co., </em>supra, at p. 66, the' notice clause is “de<a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>signed to enable the insurer to investigate the circumstances of the accident while the matter is yet fresh in the minds of all, and ,to make timely defense against any claim filed.” It might well be that had defendant been notified promptly its investigation by men trained in that work would have revealed a defense to that action. It is equally possible that defendant could have obtained a more favorable settlement had it learned of the accident immediately. It is for these reasons that the failure to give notice releases the insurer from the obligation of the contract: <em>Unverzagt v. Prestera, </em>supra. And this is true even though the insurer does not show that he was in fact prejudiced: <em>ibid.</em>

It is true that there it was left to the jury but we' said, at p. 214: “Ordinarily, in the absence of special circumstances,' the question whether an insured has failed to meet the requirements of the policy in regard to the time of giving. the notice stipulated therein is one for the court; at least the delay may be great enough to justify the court in so ruling as a matter of law . . . <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>[citing cases] Here, however, the question was submitted to the jury, which concluded that a delay of a year and two days was not ‘prompt’ notification. This finding was clearly proper, for notifying the wrong company was not a sufficient <em>legal </em>excuse for failure to comply with the terms of the policy on which recovery was sought.” (Italics added.)

There being no dispute as to the facts, the sufficiency of that excuse was purely a question of law which was properly decided by the learned court below.</p>

It sought, and believed it had apprehended, the truth. It carried liability insurance, so that it cannot be charged or even suspected that it was attempting to circumvent any obligation, financial or otherwise.

It means the accomplishing of something which is reasonable to accomplish, and it excludes the doing of what is unreasonable or unnecessary. If I order the baker to deliver a loaf of bread when practicable I certainly do not expect him to deliver it before it is baked. “The adjective ‘practicable’ imports difference according to circumstances. Assuming that the law requires action at the earliest practicable moment, it would still be a question of fact, at least generally, when that moment arrived, even if there was no dispute as to the circumstances. Some may point one way and some the other. No case is cited where it was held to be a matter of law for the court.” <em>(Norton v.

Mr. Justice Stern expressed it succinctly in the case of <em>Snader v. London &amp; Lancashire Indemnity Co., </em><a href="/pa/360/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="360 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="475046" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0548-01">360 Pa. 548</a>, 551, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.2d%20835" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="62 A.2d 835">62 A. 2d 835</a>, when he said: “It must, of course, be remembered that where the terms of a policy are susceptible of different interpretations the construction most favorable to the insured should be the one adopted . . . The reason for this is that the language of the policy is prepared by the insurer, presumably with the purpose in mind of protecting itself against future claims in regard to which it does not desire to accept liability.”</p>

The insurance company lost no <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>advantage in its ignorance of the accident at that time. The only interest the insurance company could have had in receiving notification of an accident was to investigate and prepare against a possible law suit. The -mere notification of itself added nothing to its coffers, nor did the absence of notice take a penny out of its treasury when the possibility of a claim against it was excluded.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[146,812,1149,265]]]'>The Indemnity Insurance Company of North America could not be concerned about the accident of November 25, 1945 until it became a potential lawsuit; and that did not occur until August 10, 1946, when of course the provisions of the policy were complied with.</p>
    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[146,1098,1148,652]]]'>The case of <em>Unverzagt v.

And extenuation is always a question of fact because it involves not only brute circumstances, physical realities and personal conduct but also the inferences which flow from that interplay of the human elements.</p>

And common sense, as I view it, says that the insurance company received adequate and sufficiently expeditious notice for it to protect its interests and prepare to meet its obligations. The record is devoid of one syllable showing that it suffered the slightest handicap by receiving the notice on August <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>10,1946, instead of November 25, 1945.
