Appellant’s argument is fortified by the following quotation from <em>First National Bank and Trust Co. v. Laubach, </em><a href="/pa/333/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="333 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="1187935" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0344-01">333 Pa. 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20139" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 A.2d 139">5 A. 2d 139</a>, where this Court said, page 349, “It is to be noted that this act [of April 16, 1840] is entitled ‘An Act Relating to Executions, . . .’ and it does not undertake to deal with a transferred judgment other than for purposes of realizing thereon. Such a transferred judgment is merely ‘a <em>quasi </em>judgment, and that too only for limited purposes’: Brandt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/16/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 Pa. 343" data-case-ids="410136" data-case-paths="/pa/16/0343-01">16 Pa. 343</a>, 346. It has been held time and again that the court of the county to which the judgment is transferred has no power over it except for purposes' of execution,1 and cannot'inquire into its merits. That can be done only by the' court in which it was originally obtained: King v.

Superior Ct. 458</a>, 461.” Appellant’s argument is both plausible and practical but it cannot prevail because we cannot disregard the plain language and the clear meaning of the governing act. The Act of 1840, supra, specifically requires that there be transferred and filed of record, <em>a certified copy not of the docket entries but of the whole record in the case, </em>and the Prothonotary of the receiving court, <em>“shall file the same, and forthwith transcribe the docket entry thereof into his own </em>docket. . .” It is manifest that the Act draws a distinction between the whole record and the docket entry thereof; and consequently this distinction and this language cannot be ignored.</p>
    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[161,1258,1150,1104]],["BL_388.1",388,[235,351,1146,710]]]'>Both appellant and appellee agree that there is only one appellate court case construing the Act of 1840, namely, <em>Updergraff v. Perry, </em><a href="/pa/4/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="401908" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0291-01">4 Pa. 291</a> (1846); but each contends the case supports his position. In that case the exemplification of record which the court held was insufficient, purported to be merely the docket entries in the appearance docket and did not include the judgment docket. Some of the broad language used by the Court must be considered in the light of those unusual facts. However, we quote with approval the following excerpts from that opinion (pages 294 et seq.): “This certificate, it is quite obvious, does not pursue the directions of the act of Assembly, which requires the whole record to be certified. It would be a large extension of liberality, ... to presume, from a mere certificate that the docket entry of a judgment was full and complete, that the whole record was therefore certified. The certificate does not, in fact, purport to authenticate an exemplification of the record. ... A copy of the docket entry, in legal or common parlance, <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>is not understood to mean a copy of the whole record, but rather the contrary. . . . The certificate of the officer ought to show in a satisfactory manner that the whole record is certified; that would comply with the provisions of the statute . . . The law guards the rights of the debtor as well as those of the creditor. It is the duty of the plaintiff to see that his proceedings are properly conducted.
