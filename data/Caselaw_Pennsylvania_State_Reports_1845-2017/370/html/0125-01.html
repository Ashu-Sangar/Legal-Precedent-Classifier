Johnson, an illiterate colored man, died on September 30, 1948 at the approximate age of 84. Ten of his twelve children were living at the time of his death. Johnson went alone to his attorney’s office and discussed with him in detail the proposed contents of his last will. The will was forthwith prepared by decedent’s attorney; it was executed by a mark on August 6, 1947; and proved by the attorney and the subscribing witnesses. In his will he left two houses and'their furniture to Edna Allison, who was an acquaintance and a white woman,' if she survived him'; otherwise they became a part of his residuary estate. <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>The residue of his estate, the value of which was undisclosed, was left to seven (of his ten) named children.
