In order to reach their destination they walked eastwardly sometimes along the tracks and sometimes along the side of the tracks (referred to as the defendant’s right of way). There were three tracks (6 rails) in the defendant’s right of way. While there is no tes<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>timony describing this right of way, the picture clearly shows on each side of the north and south tracks a few feet of shoulder with high sloping embankments. Jane and one of the children were walking on the south side of the tracks, while the decedent and the other child were walking on the north side of the tracks. As they walked, a freight train came along, likewise traveling east, on the center track. While the freight train was going by, a passenger train came along, traveling west, on the north track, and struck and killed the decedent. The view of decedent’s 13 year old sister, who whs the only witness who testified as to the accident, was completely obscured by the freight train. The tracks were straightaway for a quarter of a mile. <em>There is no evidence of whether the hoy was on the tracks or on the ties, or how or where he was struck, or when he was first seen hy the train crew, or how fast the tram was running. </em>The train stopped about a quarter of a mile from the point of the accident.</p>

Martin’s Crossing is a dirt road which runs from a public highway through a field owned by a man named Martin, across the defendant’s railroad tracks, ending in another field of Martin’s on the other side of the tracks. The road was used solely by Mr. Martin and his employes in connection with the operation of his farm. <em>There was no evidence that the hoy was struck or killed at or on Martin’s Grossing. </em>Moreover, if the boy was struck where he fell, or if his body was thrown through the air after the impact, it could have been thrown by the train traveling westward only in a westwardly direction, and in either event, since his body was found <em>east </em>of the crossing the accident could not have happened at the crossing.

The only evidence offered to establish a playground was that Mr. Davies and some children played a little touch football and a little baseball in two fields, one on each side of the railroad; that plaintiffs’ daughter went to one of the fields to play and pick berries; and that one of the fields was used by children of the plaintiffs and of two other families as a playground. <em>There was absolutely no evidence that the playground </em>(if there was one) <em>included the right of way of the defendant’s railroad; </em>indeed, the picture of the tracks and embankments along defendant’s right of way clearly demonstrates that neither the tracks nor defendant’s right of way afforded any facilities for play.</p>

      <em>In the present case there was neither allegation nor proof of wilful or wanton negligence. </em>The only evidence to prove any negligence was the testimony of decedent’s 13 year old sister, who testified that the train did not sound a whistle or horn and was going fast.

The boy was six years old, too young to be contributorily negligent; but he was nevertheless a trespasser on the right-of-way, and for an injury resulting under such circumstances defendant will not ordinarily be liable: Conn v.

The duty to exercise care after such presence becomes known is, of course, greater in the case of infants, who are not supposed to be as fully aware of their danger, than it is in the case of adults.

The law of humanity, while not accepted with statutory authority, still controls the logic of human responsibility. And this responsibility on thé part of railroads has been recognized in numerous cases decided by this Court. In <em>O’Leary v. Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie R. R.

It was established at the trial that the tracks in question had for years been used as a playground by the children. In setting aside a non-suit ordered by the trial Court, the Supreme Court said: (p. 10) “The permissive use of its tracks placed the defendant company in a different attitude toward the children playing upon its ground and imposed upon it different duties for their protection in its use. In moving its trains on the tracks, the defendant, therefore, did so with the knowledge that the children of the neighborhood had been for many years using the ground as a playground, and was re<a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>quired to anticipate that they would continue to do so. This imposed upon the company the duty of reasonable care in the operation of its trains over the tracks so as to avoid injury to those who might be making a permissive use of them. If the jury found that the defendant failed to exercise such care in the operation of its trains on the day of the accident which resulted in the death of John O’Leary it would be negligence which would impose liability.”</p>

Here there was ample testimony that for years children were wont to play daily on defendant’s grounds without its objective disapproval. Therefore defendant may not disregard the likelihood of their presence in the conduct of its operations (O’Leary v. Pittsburgh and Lake Erie R. R.

Several cases decided by this court are cited in support of the proposition and as sustaining the contention of the defendants that by reason of the trespass there can be no recovery here. But those cases were ruled on a different state of facts and do not control the present case. . . . Here, as we have seen, the peculiar location of the ground where the accident occurred imposed the duty of reasonable care in the use of it on the defendants, and it is averred as the cause of action that the plaintiff’s injuries were due to a negligent performance of that duty. This was a question for the jury.”</p>

It could well be that the jury would decide that the defendant company was not negligent and that it had met its obligations of reasonable care, but its obligations in this respect were not so clearly and conclusively discharged as to deprive the plaintiff of the right to have a jury pass upon that question.</p>
