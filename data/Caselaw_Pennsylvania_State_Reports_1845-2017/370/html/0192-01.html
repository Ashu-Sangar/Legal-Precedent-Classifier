A jury returned a verdict in Ms favor in the sum of $3000 but this was set aside when the learned court below entered a judgment non obstante veredicto. Plaintiff has appealed from that judgment.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[157,644,1153,1309]]]'>The accident occurred early in the afternoon of May 14, 1949, at defendant’s grade crossing on York Road, in Willow Grove, Montgomery County Plaintiff, who was 77 years old, was a friend of the watchman on duty at the crossing and had stopped in the watch box to talk with him. The watchman excused himself after a few minutes of conversation to go to the station house, asking plaintiff to stay at the watch box until he returned. A few moments later plaintiff heard the whistle of an approaching locomotive and, seizing a metal “stop” sign, walked to the middle of York Road on the south side of the tracks to warn the vehicular traffic. He was in this position, facing north, when the locomotive was approximately 200 feet from the crossing. About that time plaintiff noticed an automobile coming towards the crossing and, in an effort to attract the driver’s attention, he took a step towards it and waved his left hand. This of course, brought him closer to the tracks. The automobile came to a stop but, by that time, the locomotive, which was travelling at approximately twenty to twenty-five miles per hour, reached the crossing and, as it passed in front of plaintiff, one of its cylinder heads struck him on the right arm and he was thrown to the street.</p>

He contends, instead, that the approach of the automobile from the north of the cross<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>ing created an emergency which involved risk to the lives of those in the car and that he was not negligent, as a matter of law, in risking injury to himself to save them from impending danger. In support of this contention plaintiff has cited <em>Toner v. Penna. R. R. Co., </em><a href="/pa/263/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="263 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="1047430" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0438-01">263 Pa. 438</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20A.%20797" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="106 A. 797">106 A. 797</a>, <em>Corbin v.

In <em>Corbin v. Philadelphia, </em>supra, we said (at p. 471, 472) : “While one who rashly and unnecessarily exposes himself to danger cannot recover damages for injuries thus brought on himself, yet, where another is in great and imminent danger, he who attempts a rescue may be warranted, by surrounding circumstances, in exposing his limbs or life to a very high degree of danger. In such case, he should not be charged with the consequences of errors of judgment resulting from the excitement and confusion of the moment; and, if he did not act rashly and unnecessarily expose himself to danger, and is injured, the injury should be attributed to the party that negligently or wrongfully exposed to danger the person who required assistance.”</p>

The automobile was not in the path of the locomotive when plaintiff started forward nor was there any proof that it probably would be there when the locomotive reached the crossing. The fact that it did stop a safe distance from the locomotive indicates that the driver was aware of the danger and was able to avoid it. Furthermore there was nothing in the record to indicate that the driver of the car did not have it under control as he approached the crossing, or that he was not aware of the oncoming locomotive or to justify plaintiff in thinking that the driver would not observe the duty imposed upon him by law to stop, look and listen before entering upon a railroad crossing. In the absence of such evidence and of proof that the occupants of the automobile were in imminent and serious danger, we must conclude that plaintiffs action was unwarranted and that he was negligent in stepping from a place of safety in to the path of the locomotive.</p>

He said that as the train neared the crossing the plaintiff took a step closer to the automobile coming from the north, “which, of course, took him a step closer to the tracks being used by the oncoming freight train.” There is no evidence in the record that the plaintiff, once he had taken his place at the spot where he was seeking to stop the oncoming motorist, “took a step closer to the tracks.”</p>

    <p id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[252,535,1146,374]]]'>Appellee’s counsel in his brief said: “. . . as the train came into the crossing the plaintiff turned his body so as to move closer to the train and was struck by the cylinder head.” Under the rule that all inferences in the case must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, this statement by appellee’s counsel is not warranted by the testimony.</p>

And he was standing in the crossing at the time the train was abreast? A. Yes. Q. You are sure, therefore, that he'was not moving, or walking, or hurrying, and he was not still hurrying to reach that position after the train passed him? A. No, he was not in motion, he was standing. Q. And, he was standing, facing the north, so the train was coming from his immediate right. A. Yes.”</p>
    <p id="b218-6" data-blocks='[["BL_218.6",218,[251,1543,1147,694]]]'>The plaintiff was struck, not because he made any movement, but because he was close to the track while engaged in flagging down a motorist who insisted on driving over the crossing into the path of the rapidly approaching train. The witness Michael Clem testified: “A. There was a car that seemed to want to get across the crossing, as if he thought he could get ahead of the train, but when he got there, he came to a sudden stop, and he was across the tracks. Q. How close did the car come before it stopped — to the railroad? A. From my point of view, I would say pretty close — maybe, 3 or 4, feet. Q. From where? A. From the southbound tracks.”</p>

    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[151,536,1150,699]]]'>The negligence in this case on the part of the train crew was complete. They saw the plaintiff at the crossing when they were at least 250 feet away; they saw him active in saving human life and protecting the interests of the railroad company at the same time; they saw that he was about 2 or 3 feet from the track; they knew that the overhang of the train was 3 feet; they knew that the speed limit of trains across the York Road was ten miles per hour, but they continued to proceed at 25 miles per hour; — and, what was so easily and clearly foreseeable, happened. The plaintiff was struck by the overhang of the cylinder head of the locomotive.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[151,1262,1149,598]]]'>Since the evidence is to be considered most favorably to the one suffering the judgment n.o.v., the statement of Witness Clem that the train was travelling “not less than 25 miles per hour” must be taken as true. But even if the testimony of Louis Mitnek, the fireman, that the train was moving from 8 to 10 miles per hour, is accepted as fact, the negligence of the train crew is established all the more flagrantly because they could have stopped the train within even a shorter distance and within briefer moments than if it had been travelling at 25 miles per hour.</p>

The picture of just how the accident occurred was minus some details, which appellee’s counsel apparently filled in with the paint of imagination. It was argued, and even demonstrated at the hearing before this Court, how the plaintiff stepped forward at the crucial moment, thus bringing him into contact with <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>a part of the locomotive. But Louis Mitnek, the brakeman, and certainly not sympathetic to the plaintiff’s case, portrayed no such incident. He testified that the plaintiff did not turn until AFTER he had been hit. “Q. When you first saw Mr. Cooper he was flagging with one hand traffic down; is that right? Did he continue to flag traffic down until he Avas hit? A. He was flagging all the time until we struck him, but he turned after we struck him.”</p>

Within minutes after his departure, a freight train from the West heralded its approach through signals in the watchbox which included a light and a ringing bell. Cooper, concerned for the safety of those who might be at the highway intersection, seized a “Stop” sign and hurried to a point at the crossing where he could warn all persons approaching it to cease movement. York Road crossing is a busy spot in this little town with midday traffic moving in both directions, so that Cooper’s solicitude was not merely gratuitous and certainly not superfluous. Apparently all those within the visual perimeter of his warnings heeded Cooper’s signals of alarm, except one unknown motorist heading southwardly on York Road. .</p>

The distance between the two tracks was some 8 or 9 feet. The impetuous automobilist crossed the first tracks and entered into the space between the two tracks while Cooper kept frantically warning him with arm-waving and an uplifted sign to stop. He was finally halted within inches of death or serious injury. Who he was no one knows.

But they did not even attempt to slow up the train until after the inevitable had happened. The only precaution taken was to sound a warning whistle. One witness who heard the whistle testified: “It seemed as if he [someone in the engine] pulled on the whistle as if he had seen something. You can tell the difference between a loud and a soft whistle.” But this feature was not left to inferential testimony. The brakeman testified that the whistle was blown to warn William Cooper.</p>

The accumulated experiences of a life’s living comes to the fore in an emergency, and one acts in a cowardly or noble fashion not because of what he thinks at the flash of decision but because of what he has thought all his life, for in that instant of crisis there is no time to do aught but respond to one’s immediate reflexes.
