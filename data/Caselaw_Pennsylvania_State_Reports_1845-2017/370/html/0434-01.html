With respect to this contention that there was no valid exercise by will of the power of appointment, appellants are in the anomalous position of arguing that section 6 makes testator’s testamentary appointment to charity void, but that this void appointment shows an intention that the testator did not wish it to pass to the residuary legatee [his wife] since he had already specifically, although ineffectively, said he wanted it to go to charity. In other words, the bequest is absolutely void under section 6 as a bequest, but is valid for the purpose of showing the testator’s intention (viz., the contrary intention referred to in section 11 (supra)). This specious argument is further weakened by the remaining pertinent and very important language of section 6 which appellants ignore (and which we shall hereinafter more fully discuss), as well as by the known fact which has long ago been established as a legal principle, namely, that a residuary gift is intended by a testator as a “catch-all.” A catch-all residuary clause carries out testator’s dominant intent to dispose of everything which he still owns or has a dispositive interest in or general power over — everything not otherwise specifically or effectually disposed of by the will: Cf. <em>Carothers’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/300/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="300 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1125941" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0185-01">300 Pa. 185</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20585" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A. 585">150 A. 585</a>; <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>

Such an intention can have no greater weight than the clearly expressed intention of a testator that a void bequest or devise shall go to some one other than his residuary legatee. But, as we have seen, such a void bequest or devise will pass to the residuary legatee to effectuate what the law deems testator’s controlling intention, . . .”.</p>
