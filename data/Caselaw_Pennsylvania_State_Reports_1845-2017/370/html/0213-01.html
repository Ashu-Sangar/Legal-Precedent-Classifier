S. T. Metal Products Company, Inc., defendant, to recover possession of goods in defendant’s hands under a contract by the terms of which defendant was to manufacture magnetic tape recorder-reproducer units for plaintiff. To defendant’s answer and amended new matter claiming <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>a right of possession and a special property right in the nature of a lien, plaintiff filed preliminary objections which were dismissed by the court below.

Defendant corporation manufactures metal equipment. By contract of May, 1948, and amendment thereto of August, 1948, defendant agreed to manufacture the tape recorder-reproducer units for plaintiff. Under the contract defendant agreed to produce, jigs, dies, tools, etc., necessary to manufacture and supply the units and plaintiff agreed to reimburse defendant for this expense up to approximately $47,000, the estimated maximum tooling cost, and advance 51% thereof. Plaintiff was to pay for this production (tooling) equipment at “cost of manufacture”. In addition, sums were to be advanced to defendant by plaintiff for the purchase of raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacture of the units. These advances were to be repaid by credit of a certain percentage against invoices rendered by defendant for completed units. The contract provided that title to all tooling, materials and parts and to all units produced from such materials and parts should be vested in plaintiff. Defendant was required to produce all the units which plaintiff might require for one year from June 1, 1948.</p>

Cancellation under this section of the contract should be effective in the manner and upon the date specified in the notice. In the event of such cancellation, however, plaintiff would be required to pay de<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>fendant cancellation and other charges, including general and administrative overhead expense, as provided in Schedule A attached.

By letter of October 1, 1948, however, plaintiff notified defendant that inasmuch as the production schedule had not been met, the contract was breached and plaintiff thereupon declared it terminated. Defendant contends that it did not breach the contract; that delays occasioned by plaintiff because of changes in specifications and other causes were the real reason for the delay in production.</p>

Upon refusal, plaintiff instituted replevin with bond in the amount of $125,000 on October 18, 1948 and obtained possession thereof. Defendant in its answer <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>denied the right of possession of plaintiff and, under new matter, claimed damages by “way of recoupment and/or lien” against plaintiff. No completed units were included in the property replevied. Plaintiff’s preliminary objections to defendant’s answer were dismissed in part, and as respects the defendant’s new matter, sustained with leave given defendant to file amended new matter; and from this order plaintiff appealed to this Court which, in a Per Curiam opinion (<a href="/pa/365/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="365 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="1225622" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0173-01">365 Pa. 173</a>), declared the appeal to be premature inasmuch as there had been no action by the lower court on the permitted amended pleading. Thereupon defendant filed its amended new matter and plaintiff again filed preliminary objections which were based upon defendant’s failure to assert facts sufficient to justify its possession of the property and upon the claim that defendant could not by the terms of the contract, assert any lien. The lower court, in its opinion of July 11, 1951, overruled and dismissed all of plaintiff’s preliminary objections, and this action by the court below is now before us.</p>

In order to maintain replevin, the plaintiff must have a general or special property right in the thing taken or detained. The common law view was that replevin lay only for goods wrongfully dis-trained, which, of course, presupposed a prior possession by plaintiff. The modern rule is, however, that one may maintain replevin if he has the right of pos<a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>session irrespective of whether or not he has ever had actual possession. In order to sustain replevin, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to show not only that he has title, but that he has also the right of immediate possession: <em>Heilman v. McKinstry, </em><a href="/pa-super/18/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 Pa. Super. 70" data-case-ids="837269" data-case-paths="/pa-super/18/0070-01">18 Pa. Superior Ct. 70</a>.

In that case defendant offered no defense and this Court summarily disposed of the contract between the parties and said: “A contract providing for delivery of materials by the owner to another for the performance of specified services upon them does not, as against the owner, vest any property, special or general, in the one who is to perform the services, nor does such contract confer upon him a right to retain possession of the goods until performance of the contract has been completed or it has been breached or cancelled in a lawful manner. Such contract, as against the owner, gives no right to retain possession and must be distinguished from a bailment lease, which gives the bailee a special property, entitling him to retain possession as against the owner, in the absence of a breach of contract on his part or its termination in accordance with its terms.”</p>

We think that Judge Milner properly distinguished that case in his earlier opinion of December 14, 1949. We quote therefrom: “In that case the plaintiff brought a replevin action for rayon material delivered to a manufacturing company to manufacture into finished products. The plaintiff at the trial made out a prima facie case by presenting uncontroverted evidence of title entitling it to immediate, exclusive possession of the property as against the appellant (defendant). The defendant did not offer any defense and thus it failed to shoAV that it had a general or special property right of possession, or lien for services. All that can be learned about the terms of the contract from the opinion is that it Avas a 'contract proAdding for delivery of materials by the <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>owner to another for the performance of specified services upon them.’ At the trial, the defendant, without introducing any testimony, moved for a directed verdict on the ground that plaintiff had failed to mate out a prima facie case entitling it to possession of the goods. The court below refused defendant’s motion and directed a verdict for the plaintiff, which was affirmed upon appeal. It will be seen at once that this was not a case where a summary judgment was entered upon the pleadings, as is sought in the case at bar, but was the case of a trial where the plaintiff made out its case and the defendant offered no evidence. Furthermore, the terms of the contract in the <em>Blossom Products Corporation </em>case and those in the contract between the parties in the case at bar are not analogous. The Supreme Court in the cited case referring to the contract between the parties states, ‘nor does such contract confer upon him (defendant) a right to retain possession of the goods until performance of the contract has been completed or it has been breached or cancelled in a lawful manner.’ The contract in the case at bar specifically provided for possession of the property in question by the defendant during the term of the contract.”</p>

S. T. Metal Products Company is not here suing International. The latter is suing the former and to maintain its replevin action it must establish its immediate right of possession in the goods sought to be replevied. The contract between the parties is made a part of plaintiff’s complaint and bestowed the right of possession upon the defendant. Plaintiff must establish a breach of the contract by defendant, entitling plain<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>tiff to possession of the goods.

In support of this argument plaintiff relies, first, upon the cancellation clause of the agreement. The plain answer to this proposition is that plaintiff admittedly did not proceed under the cancellation clause of the agreement in which event certain charges would have been due the defendant but elected to terminate the agreement because defendant “failed to meet the agreed upon production schedule” (Exhibit A of defendant’s answer which must be assumed to be true for the purpose of deciding plaintiff’s preliminary objections).</p>

There is no doubt that a bailee who at the request of a bailor does work or adds materials to a chattel is entitled to a possessory lien for the value of the work performed: Restatement, Security, §61 (a). And if the work is performed under a single contract the fact that the lienor surrenders part of the property does not prevent him from refusing to release the remainder. Restatement, Security, §61, comment f. In this case defendant claims liens on the tools, dies, jigs, etc., and the raw materials (inventory). The agreement is silent with respect to whether or not the defendant has a lien, and does not, as was the case in the <em>Blossom Products, </em>case, supra, provide specific cally that the property is not to be subjected to any <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>lien.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It does provide that the shipments of all articles (completed units) are to be in accordance with the plaintiff’s instructions and that payments for such should be made monthly on defendant’s invoices with credit for advancements on account of raw materials. However, this does not mean that defendant waived his rights to a common law lien on articles such as the tools, dies and jigs and inventory for there was no agreement with respect to delivery of those items without payment.</p>

In its answer and new matter defendant in substance avers that the plaintiff wilfully failed to furnish defendant with adequate testing equipment with malicious design to fabricate an excuse for terminating the contract and that plaintiff thereupon oppressively and vexatiously sued out a writ óf replévin instead of proceeding under the cancellation or ar<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>bitration clauses of tbe contract, thereby depriving the defendant of his rights thereunder.</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[145,454,1148,983]]]'>Whether defendant’s proofs at the trial of this case are sufficient to permit a jury to award exemplary damages in the event that it finds for the defendant in the action, is for the determination of the trial judge, subject to review on appeal. But such proofs may not include loss of profits or counsel fees as here asserted, for neither properly relates to the punitive purpose of exemplary damages. Evidence thereof as elements for the jury’s consideration in awarding such damages is, therefore, inadmissible. Under our decisions the jury fixes the amount of such damages (which are in no sense compensatory but purely penal in nature) without yardstick, subject only to reduction by the court if deemed excessive under the circumstances of the particular case: See <em>Voltz v.
