Several inches of snow had fallen during the night and at the time of the accident it was- dark and- snow was still falling. Library Boad .is-a two-lane concrete.highway, without any sidewalks, and was straight for several hundred feet in both <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>directions from the place of the accident. Plaintiff usually walked on the left hand side of the road in order to face oncoming traffic, but because of snow drifts, walked this morning on the right hand side of the road. Plaintiff noticing the headlight beam of defendant’s car approaching from the rear, looked over her left shoulder just as the car was almost upon her. She was struck by the front of the ear and thrown into a snow bank some four feet or more off the east edge of the paved highway. The only other important eye-witness was the defendant, who testified that he first saw plaintiff when he was 8 or 10 feet away from her, that she was walking on the road and not on the berm; that she had no flashlight; that he was in second gear and moving very slowly with his lights lit, chains on, windshield wiper operating; that as soon as he saw plaintiff he sounded his horn but she did not move out of the way; that he swerved to the right and his wheels skidded and he struck plaintiff with the car’s left headlight. Plaintiff testified that defendant did not sound his horn.</p>
    <p id="b394-4" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[247,1534,1145,264]]]'>Plaintiff suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of her left leg, which required the insertion of a metal plate. Her doctors’ and hospital bills amounted to $1,351.00; she lost her job as a result of the accident, and the jury awarded her a verdict of $6,500.00.</p>
    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.5",394,[247,1821,1144,210]]]'>Defendant contends that he was free from negligence and that plaintiff was guilty of contributory neg^ ligence because she was walking on the wrong side of the road and did not carry a lighted flashlight.</p>

Moreover, even if we assume, contrary to the plaintiff’s testimony and to the verdict of the jury, that she was walking along the right hand side of the highway instead of along the berm, this would not amount to negligence per se: <em>Christopher v.
