B. Taylor (referred to in the agreement as the “party of the second part”) the right to buy from the defendants 30 acres of land in Mercer County. The option contained the following terms and conditions: “. . . the party of the second part shall <em>exercise </em>the within option within sixty (60) days from date of the within option; the said <em>purchase price </em>to be paid by the party of the second part to the parties of the first part for said described land in the sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars; if the party of the second part does not <em>exercise </em>the within option within said sixty (60) days then this agreement to be null and void.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

At that time, according to the findings of fact by the chancellor, Taylor said to Hartman, “I’m going to take this.” Gibbs then asked, “Well, how about the test from the State Highway?” Taylor replied, “Regardless of whether it passes their specifications or not, I’m going to use my own judgment. I think it’s all right. I’m going to take it.” About Christmas, 1949 the plaintiff offered the defend<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>ants $500 to $1,000. Defendants declined to accept the partial payment stating, “No, we’ll not take any, we’ll get everything in shape and then clean 'all onr business up at one time.”</p>

    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[251,870,1148,544]]]'>An option is an offer and when accepted there is a valid and binding contract: <em>Phillips et ux. v.

But where the payment of the purchase price is not provided as necessary to the exercise (or acceptance) of the option and no time is specified for the payment of the price, payment is separate from acceptance. The acceptance in such circumstances must he within the specific time allowed by the option; payment must be within a reasonable time: <em>Pennsylvania Mining Company v.

    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[146,917,1148,648]]]'>With these general principles in mind we turn now to a consideration of. the agreement in dispute. This agreement provides that the optionee must “exercise” it “within sixty (60) days.” It then provides that “the said <em>purchase price </em>to be paid” shall be “the sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars.” Nothing in this clause which deals with the purchase price leads to the conclusion that either payment or tender had to be made <em>within sixty days. </em>The option then concludes with the statement that if the optionee does not <em>“exercise” </em>the option within sixty days, the agreement shall be null and void.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[147,1586,1147,599]]]'>This case is analogous to cases in which no time has been expressed in the option for the payment of the purchase price.

      <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[246,1651,1149,687]]]'> Plaintiff’s words on December 6, 1949, “I’m going to take it.” cannot properly be construed as an indication of a future intention rather than a present acceptance: See <em>Detwiler et al. v. Capone et ux., </em>supra, where this Court, speaking through Chief Justice Maxey, said of the word “desire” at pp. 500, 501, “The court below construed the word ‘desire’ employed by plaintiffs in their letter to defendant as indicative of ‘future contemplated action’ on their part. This construction is captious. We do not believe that appellees'had any doubt of plaintiffs’ intention to exercise the option when notified that plaintiffs ‘now desire to exercise the option’.” That appellees in the present case considered plaintiff’s words an acceptance and not a future contemplated action is manifest from their refusal of part payment, not on the ground that there had been no unequivocal acceptance, but because they wanted to wait and “clean” it all up at one time.</p>
