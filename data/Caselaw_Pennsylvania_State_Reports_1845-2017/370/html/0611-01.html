I would say that even if the Act did not confer upon him this authority, it would be his because of the intrinsic nature of his duties, which require never-failing vigilance.

L. 1183, to hear their grievances having to do with job security, recognition of labor union, activities of labor union members and the discharge of the two plaintiffs, Robert C. Broad-water and Chester L. Alburger. The defendants declined to cooperate in the procedure set up by the Act referred to. They made no answer to the request of the employes for a panel hearing on the subject of job security and labor union recognition, and, with regard to the discharge of the two plaintiffs, contented themselves with averring that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a hearing since they were no longer employed as prison guards.</p>

The union claims further that two employes were discharged because they were active in the formation and continued existence of a labor union. These declarations amount to nothing less than the very serious accusation that the defendants are attempting to destroy the machinery of collective bargaining. This they have no right to do under the law of the land. How can we then refuse to consider the merits of a controversy which revolves around the vital issue as to whether, in today’s jurisprudence, any employer can deny an employe the right to join and belong to a labor union?</p>

The plaintiffs did not'go out on strike. The plaintiffs were <em>discharged. </em>For the defendants to say, as they do, that employes are on strike when they are denied access.to their jobs is ifco impart a strange interpretation to the word “strike.” A strike is a voluntary collective cessation of work. It is the laying down of tools.
