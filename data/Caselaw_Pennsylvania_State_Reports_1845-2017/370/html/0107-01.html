Twigg and wife. The right-of-way agreement, entered into by the Twigg’s predecessors in title, contained a reservation which permitted cultivation of the ground between 'the company’s poles and underneath its wires “provided that such use shall not interfere with or obstruct the rights” of the company therein granted. The transmission line ran diagonally across the field. From a pole at the corner of the field to the next pole in the middle of the field, a distance of 275 feet, there was a guy wire for anchoring and support fastened to the corner pole between the cross-arms at the top and extending to the other pole to which it was fastened at á point about 8 feet above the ground. The sag in this guy wire between the poles brought it at the lowest point within 5 or 6 feet of the ground. The transmission line carried high tension wires of 13,600 volts <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>and service or distribution wires of 4,600 volts. The former were attached to the upper of two cross-arms at the corner pole and the latter to the lower cross-arm. There was a transformer attached to the pole below the cross-arms mentioned. The guy wire was fastened to this pole at a point between the two cross-arms which were 2 feet apart. There was an insulator on the guy wire about 1 foot from where it was fastened to this corner pole. Both the high tension and distribution wires were uninsulated. There was testimony that this was the general practice in rural transmission lines.</p>

On August 7, 1947, between 4 and 5 o’clock in the afternoon, the date and hour of the occurrence, he was removing hay from the field where defendant’s transmission line was located. He had farmed the property for a number of years, both for the Twiggs and their predecessor owner. The decedent was operating a Papec harvester and tractor. This equipment would cut hay, but the hay was already cut and lying on the ground, so that it was being used for another of its functions, to gather the hay and blow it through a pipe into a truck at the rear. The decedent’s nephew, Gerald Gettle, then 11 years of age, was in the truck. When the portion of the field where defendant’s transmission line was located was reached by decedent, since the outfit he was operating could not be driven underneath the guy wire, he drove to the pole in the middle of the field, obtained a wrench from the tractor, stood on the running board of the truck and removed the bolt which ran through the pole, after detaching the nut on the other side. The wire fell down somewhat away from the pole. The decedent then took the end of the wire and with the assistance of the boy who grasped it about 15 feet away from him, dragged the wire a distance of 140 feet to the edge of the field. At this point <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>both the decedent and the boy received an electrical shock and both were thrown to the ground. The decedent’s hands and clothing were burned and he died a short time thereafter. The boy was unconscious for a short time and his hands were burned, but he survived and testified as an eye witness on behalf of the plaintiff. The only reasonable inference to lie drawn was that the guy wire when thus dragged or pulled 140 feet had come into contact with wires of the service line running from the second cross-arm.</p>

At the trial plaintiff called a professor of electrical engineering and consulting engineer and offerred to prove faulty construction on the part of the defendant, particularly with respect to the location of the insulator on the guy wire. An objection to the qualification of this witness was sustained on the ground that he had had no experience with rural transmission lines of the voltage of electricity here involved.</p>

It had remained, as originally affixed to the two poles, without incident. Only if tampered with and removed from its location could it become charged with electricity. It is not necessary to decide whether such possible removal fell within a foreseeable orbit of danger, for, assuming negligence on the part of the defendant, the decedent’s action was a proximate cause of the accident making him clearly guilty of contributory negligence. Since <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>we must so hold, it is unnecessary to pass upon the ruling of the court below with respect to the proffered testimony of plaintiffs expert.</p>

The decedent had been farming in this field for a period of five years and upwards. The guy wire was attached in the same manner during this period of time,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the decedent was familiar therewith. The guy Avire was not charged with electricity while it remained in its original position prior to being detached and moved by the decedent for a distance of approximately one hundred and forty feet in the direction at right angles to the transmission line. It was apparent when the decedent and young Gettle moved the guy Avire, as aforesaid, that it came in contact with the transmission line of defendant and thereby became charged with electricity Avhich killed the decedent. The decedent was the sole actor in the operation Avhich led to his death. . . . However, assuming that the defendant was chargeable with negligence, we are of the opinion that the facts and circumstances testified to in this case so clearly showed that the decedent was chargeable with contributory negligence that reasonable persons Avould not fail to agree with that conclusion. We are of the opinion that the decedent not only heedlessly brought himself into a position that the guy wire came in contact with the distribution circuit, but that the manner in which the decedent removed the guy Avire and <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>moved it in a direction in which it was certain to come in contact with the distribution circuit, was foolhardy. Any reasonable person would know that when two wires that were not insulated came into contact, one of which was charged with electricity, that the other was bound to become charged with it.”</p>

There the plaintiff’s wife was killed by an electric current that passed from the defendant’s feed wire to a guy wire and thence to a wire clothes line in her yard on which she was hanging clothes. Her property fronted on a borough street and extended back to an alley. There was an electric light pole on the street near the division line between her property and that of an adjoining owner, and a pole in the alley close to the fence in the rear of her lot. A guy wire extended from the top of the electric light pole in the street along the division line to the pole in the alley where it Avas fastened 7 feet from the ground. The plaintiff some years before the accident fastened one end of a wire clothes line to this pole and the other end of the wire to a grape arbor. The guy wire was afterAvards re<a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>moved and a new one put in its place. At the time of the accident the clothes line was wrapped around the guy wire and around the pole. Entry of judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>by the court below was affirmed in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion which stated: “The only danger in the situation was created by the deceased, or by someone acting for her, in making an unauthorized and manifestly unsafe use of the pole and guy wire.” In unsuccessfully endeavoring to distinguish this case, plaintiff’s learned counsel suggests that the affixation of the clothes line to the pole and guy wire in the <em>Everett </em>case was an act of trespass. Certainly plaintiff’s decedent in the present case was even more of a trespasser when he detached the guy wire and dragged it 140 feet. The right to cultivate under the defendant’s wires was conditioned upon there being no interference with defendant’s transmission line and its adjunctive facilities.</p>

The accident happened in an urban area. The defendant company had extended its wire, apparently without permission, across the corner of a house and so close that by rubbing against it the insulating material was partly worn off. Plaintiff’s decedent was engaged in painting the house and was lawfully upon the roof in the exercise of his business. In order to get at the cornice to paint, he propped the wire with a board which slipped loose. He received an electric shock and fell to the ground. Just how he came into contact with the wire did not appear. This Court said: “. . . but though he [the decedent] was bound to know in general the dan<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>gerous nature of such wires, and to use proportionate care in interfering with them, he was also entitled to presume, from the general custom, that they were properly insulated, unless the defect in their covering was visible to such examination as he ought to have made.” Thus in this case the wires were insulated and the question was whether the decedent should have discovered the defect in the insulation. He was in close proximity to the wire and could see that it was an insulated wire, whereas the decedent in the instant ease either knew that the transmission wires were uninsulated or heedlessly failed to concern himself as to the fact.</p>

In discussing the question of contributory negligence on the part of the boys, Mr. Justice Walling, speaking for the Court, said: “They came suddenly upon this wire in their path at night; they could not see where it was attached or know that its movement would bring it in contact with a highly charged wire; they were not bound to anticipate defendant had left it in a dangerous condition.”</p>

Because of a short elbow at the end of the pipe, it was necessary to push the elbow end of the pipe in through one of the windows of the pump house and up and out a <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>trap-door opening in the roof until the lower end of the pipe was in position over the well. The end of the pipe extending above the roof came into contact with the lower of two high tension wires which were negligently maintained too close to the roof of the pump house. There was testimony that these wires because of shrubbery and trees were not visible where the men were working and there was “not a shred of evidence” that the decedent either saw or should have seen the high voltage wires.

In support of these allegations, the plaintiff called as a witness a concededly well-qualified expert in mechanical and electrical engineering of many years active experience who testified that the span of the transmission line’s suspension in front of the plain<a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>tiff’s place of business was unusual and not ‘ordinary-good practice’; that this condition produced a heavy sag in the line of approximately five feet at the place in question which made it a comparatively easy matter for the line to be blown or swayed by the wind into any nearby structure. The expert further testified that the absence of insulating wrapping laid the rubber insulation of the line open to deterioration and to ready abrasion from swinging into and rubbing against the edges of the sign; and that the defective condition of the insulating wrapping of the line was not of recent development but due to the wear and tear from exposure to the elements for ‘at least twenty-five years.’ ”</p>

When a person darts out before an oncoming automobile, it is obvious what the contributory negligence is, but in dealing with so intangible a substance as electricity, skilled evidence is required to discover the forces which brought about the mishap. Where did Ira K. Rank’s contributory negligence begin? He carried the wire 139 feet without incident. At the 140 foot mark something occurred.

He could have ploughed the land with a hand plow, sowed from an apron, and harvested the wheat with a sickle. But there was nothing in the contract signed by the defendant which empowered it to compel the farmer to use the back-breaking manual methods of prehistoric Egypt so as not to come into contact with the wire negligently or non-negligently adjusted and maintained by the defendant company.</p>

It is said that there was no evidence that it was necessary for him to go on the roof to do the painting. No such evidence was required. His convenience was reason enough. It was convenient for him to get at the cornice in that way and he had a right to do so. He found the wires in his way, and proceeded to prop them up so that he could work under them. Whether the means he took were such as a prudent man should have taken is not so clear that it can be determined by the court. If the weight of the wire when it fell on him had been such as to knock him into the street, that would have been so clearly his own negligence that the court could have said so as matter of law. But though he was bound to know in general the dangerous nature of such wires, and to use proportionate care in interfering with them, he was also entitled to presume, from the general custom, that they were properly insulated, unless the defect in their covering was visible to such examination as he ought to have made. All these considerations entered into the question of his negligence, and made it one for the jury.”</p>
