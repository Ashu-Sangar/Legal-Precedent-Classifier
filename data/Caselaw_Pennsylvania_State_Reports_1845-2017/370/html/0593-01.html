    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.9",617,[147,792,1151,439]]]'>This is an appeal from the refusal of a court in banc to take off a compulsory non-suit entered at the trial of an action in trespass. The suit was brought by a minor, through his father as guardian, and by the minor’s parents in their own right, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the child in the ladies’ lounge at the North Philadelphia Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>
    <p id="b617-6" data-blocks='[["BL_617.10",617,[146,1244,1151,1048]]]'>Such lounge is approximately twenty feet square and has a mirror about three feet wide on one wall. On either side of the mirror is a window six feet wide, with a steam radiator about five and one-half feet wide directly in front of each window. On November 5, 1948, the mother, Eleanor Della Porta, entered the lounge accompanied by her five and one-half year old nephew and her one and one-half year old son, the minor plaintiff. The radiators were heated, but the windows were open because the weather was mild. While female plaintiff was looking into the mirror, she heard her nephew say “Look at the train” and observed him picking up her child. She directed her attention to the mirror momentarily, until she heard the infant scream. She then turned and snatched him from the radiator, where the older child had placed him so that he might view the passing trains. The tender flesh of the child’s bare legs was severely burned during the short period of contact with the radiator.</p>
    <p id="b617-7" data-blocks='[["BL_617.11",617,[146,2302,1150,100]],["BL_618.1",618,[244,370,1157,1994]]]'>Plaintiffs’ entire theory of liability is contained in this statement in their paper book: “The radiator <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>in question, at the time of the accident, was both actually and in legal contemplation a highly dangerous instrumentality.” There is no allegation that the radiators were defective in any way — only that they were hot. The picture offered in evidence shows that they were ordinary cast-iron radiators, and counsel admitted orally that they were much like the radiators in the room in which this Court heard argument oh the case. No reason has been suggested why we should permit submission of the question of the dangerous nature of these radiators to a jury unless we are prepared to rule as matter of law that the countless thousands of steam radiators which heat homes, schools, hospitals, churches, offices, and courtrooms may constitute dangerous instrumentalities. Counsel for appellants have cited many cases in which dangerous instrumentalities have been found to exist, but it is significant that none presents a factual situation remotely similar to the one at bar.

E. 895</a>, is “the only case decided in the United States in which all of the controlling facts are on all fours with the case at bar.” In that case, plaintiff placed her two year old son “upon a smooth, mahogany topped bench, provided by the defendant for use by those coming to the premises, which stood from eight inches to two feet away from a vapor heating radiator, then heated to at least two hundred twelve degrees Fahrenheit, and not guarded in any way from contact with anyone upon the bench.” While the mother was attending to her banking, the child in some unexplained way fell onto the radiator and was burned. In sustaining a jury’s verdict for plaintiff, the Massachusetts court said: “It remains to decide whether there was negligence on the defendant’s part, and, although the question is close, upon the evidence it was for the jury to say whether the existing <em>combination </em>of bench and unguarded radiator was reasonably safe.” (emphasis supplied) The distinction is obvious: the Massachusetts court felt that the bank should have anticipated the possibility- that someone might slip from the smooth bench onto the hot radiator. We do not feel that defendants herein were bound to anticipate that anyone would deliberately contact a radiator which was isolated from the furniture in the room or that one child would place another in contact with such radiator. It is significant in this connection that female plaintiff did not anticipate any such action although she observed her nephew lifting the child and telling him to look at the train.</p>

    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[240,1094,1149,819]]]'>In my opinion the lower court committed grave error in not permitting the plaintiff to show by expert testimony that in other public places catering to the same kind of clientele, dangerous radiators were suitably covered or equipped with guard rails so as to prevent contact with human bodies. The only standard of care that justice expects of any one is reasonable care. What is reasonable depends upon circumstances, situation and environment. While we all know that there are many radiators which are uncovered, we also know that in numerous public places the radiators are sheathed or so situated that people cannot come into direct contact with them. And the reason for this is that the proprietors of such places are aware of the dangers attendant upon unguarded radiators.</p>
    <p id="b622-7" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[238,1935,1148,432]],["BL_623.1",623,[145,364,1151,661]]]'>Reasonable care, like everything else arising out of human conduct, develops with circumstances and time. Motorists today are required to do many things in order to protect the pedestrian population which decades ago would have been regarded as highly visionary. Jurisprudence advances with the awareness of the people as to the sequence of events and the irrefragable bond between cause and effect. Reasonable<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>ness under the circumstances will always remain the standard of responsibility, but the circumstances are not always constant. If a radiator can be covered and thus made safe to the travelling public by the trifling expenditure of from $18 to $25, as the plaintiff offered to prove in this case, is it not a question for a jury as to whether the railroad company exercised reasonable care (or as the law requires, the highest degree of care) when it refused to install such a safeguard? Especially if it can be shown, as the plaintiff was prepared to show, that in other similar public places such covers were standard equipment?</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[142,1048,1153,1105]]]'>Counsel for the defendants argue in their brief “that the proximate cause of the injury was the act of the older child in placing the plaintiff on the radiator.” But if the instrumentality was inherently dangerous, the railroad would not be absolved from responsibility because an immature child did an impulsive thing. The act of Roberto was not an intervening incident which eliminated the proximateness of the cause planted by the defendant through the installation of a device inherently dangerous to children. Renato, the injured boy was one and a half years old; Roberto, who placed Renato on the radiator, was five and a half years old. The instinctive desire of the infant Roberto to have his little cousin infant Renato share with him the exciting spectacle of a passing train caused him to commit the heedless act. The combined performance of a five and a half years old child and a one and a half year old child does not total up to a mature reflection, any more than ten three-year olds can produce the thought responsibility of a thirty year-old person.</p>

The child was on the radiator for only a second but he sustained not a “very superficial burn,” but very serious third degree burns. The burns were so serious that the child was taken to a hospital and two skin grafting operations followed. In addition, one of the child’s legs had to be subjected, for a period, to a plaster cast.</p>

The most utilitarian object can, under certain circumstances, become a dangerous agency. We all know that occasionally chandeliers fall, carpets slip, stoves blow up, furnaces crack, water pipes burst, and gas tubes leak — and, as a consequence, people are injured. Did the owner of the agency which was the proximate cause of the injury exercise reasonable care under the circumstances of the case?
