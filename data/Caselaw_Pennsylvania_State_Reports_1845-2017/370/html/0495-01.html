In connection with the business, he was the registered licensee of a liquor license from the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. On April 22, 1945, Perri and one Zopito Chiavaroli entered into a written agreement looMng to the association of the two parties as partners in the conduct of the ShamoMn Cafe “subject however to the consent of The Pennsylvania Liquor. Control Board to transfer of the existing Restaurant Liquor License to the joint names of the parties . . . .” The agreement provided that Chiavaroli should pay Perri for a one-half interest in the business the sum of $500 which was to be deposited with a bank in escrow “pending application to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board for its approval to trans<a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>fer of tlie license to the joint names of the parties . . . .” The agreement further provided that if the application for transfer of the liquor license to the joint names of the parties was granted by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the bank should pay to Perri the $500 held in escrow, but if the application for transfer was disapproved, the bank should return the $500 to Chiavaroli and the “agreement [was to] become null and void.” The agreement also provided that if either party should die during the continuance of the partnership, the surviving partner should have the right to purchase the deceased partner’s entire interest in the business for the sum of $500.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[147,1114,1146,647]]]'>Luigi Perri died testate on April 26, 1945, just four days after the agreement with Chiavaroli was signed. He left to survive him a wife, a son and three daughters all of whom were residents of Amanteo, Italy. Perri named Zopito Chiavaroli executor of his will. He therein devised and bequeathed one-third ' of his estate to his wife, one-third to his son and one-third to his three daughters in equal shares. Chiavaroli offered the will for probate on April 27, 1945, the day following Perri’s death, and letters testamentary were granted to him by the Register of Wills of Northumberland County on the same day.</p>

Nor had Chiavaroli deposited in escrow the $500 called for by the agreement for his purchase of a half interest in the business. However, on April 28, 1945, the day after Chiavaroli qualified as executor of Luigi Perri’s estate, he did pay to the estate by certified check the sum of $500 as payment of the amount required under the agreement for the purchase by a sur<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>viving partner of' a deceased partner’s interest in the restaurant business.</p>

The application was forthwith granted and a transfer of the license was accordingly made from Luigi Perri to the estate of Luigi Perri, Zopito Chiavaroli, executor. On the same day (April 30, 1945), Chiavaroli applied for a transfer of the liquor license from himself as executor of the estate of Luigi Perri to himself as an individual. That application was likewise granted and the license was thereupon transferred to Zopito Chiavaroli individually. Thenceforth, Chiavaroli operated the restaurant business as his own. He filed his first and final account as executor of the estate of Luigi Perri in the Orphans’ Court of Northumberland County on October 31st; the account was thereafter confirmed absolutely; and Chiavaroli was discharged as such executor on December 31, 1945.</p>

Chiavaroli, to be added to his own as the licensee of the liquor license in connection with the operation of the Shamokin Cafe. On August 7, 1947, the wife and children of Luigi Perri filed their bill in equity in this case against Zopito Chiavaroli and Conn A. Chiavaroli, and thereafter an amended bill, praying that the agreement between Luigi Perri and Zopito Chiavaroli of April 22, 1945, be set aside; that, all agreements between Zopito Chiavaroli and .Conn A. Chiavaroli with respect to the business of. the Shamokin Cafe be set aside and declared null . and . void; that, the defendants,. Zppito Chiavaroli and . Conn A.

The court en banc, however, sustained exceptions of the plaintiffs to the adjudication and decree nisi and entered a final decree awarding the plaintiffs in full the relief prayed for in their amended bill. It is from that decree that the defendants brought this appeal.</p>
