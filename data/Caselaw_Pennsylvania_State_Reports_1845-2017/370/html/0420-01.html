Speaking through Justice (now Chief Justice) Drew, we said: “In Commonwealth v.

It was there said: (pp. 88-89) ‘We are of opinion that Raudenbush could not vote for the acceptance of his own resignation which, therefore, never became effective. In 28 Cyc. 337, citing numerous authorities to sustain the text, it is said: “There is a general rule of law that no member of a governing body shall vote on any question involving his . . . pecuniary interest, if that be immediate, particular, and distinct from the public interest.” [‘A member of a municipal council is disqualified from voting in proceedings involving his personal or pecuniary interest: 20 Am. &amp; Eng.

It could happen that a member of council would be, because of his experience on the council, the best qualified person to hold the office of chief executive of the municipality. In cities of the second class, the law not only permits but requires when a vacancy in the mayor’s office occurs, that the president of council shall act as mayor until the vacancy is filled.

But he cannot make phantoms of these five councilmen, who, regardless of <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>the efficacy of their vote, were present for business and did vote.</p>

Not only was a majority of the council present at the meeting in question: the <em>whole </em>council was present — nine members. The majority of those voting, therefore, would be five.

Thus, disregarding his vote, he only received 7 out of 15 votes. But if his vote is counted as a vote not cast, the result is still 7 out of 14, and, therefore, not a majority of those voting.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[241,573,1149,1145]]]'>The same holds true in the case of <em>Reckner v.

The appellant lays stress on the quotation from the opinion in that case: “There was no ratification of the resolution because there was no resolution to ratify, for by disregarding Younkins’ interested vote, the resolution did not secure the affirmative majority.” Appellant argues that because the court there used the word ‘disregarding’ it considered the secretary’s interested vote to be a nullity. But all the court there said was that the resolution did not secure the requisite majority, for disregarding Younkins’ interested vote, the vote was then 3 to 3 which would not be a majority of 7 votes (if you included Younkins’ vote as a “vote cast,”) nor would it be a majority of 6 votes, if you did not count Younkins’ vote as a “vote cast.”</p>

It does not apply, however, where the ballot or vote is for any reason invalid or void.” All the cases cited in support of that proposition were cases that dealt with either unintelligible ballots, blank ballots or illegal ballots.
