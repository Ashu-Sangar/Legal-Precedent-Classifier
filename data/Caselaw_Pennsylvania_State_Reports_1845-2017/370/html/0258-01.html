Martin, appellant-plaintiff in this appeal, was driving a 1938 Oldsmobile Sedan belonging to his father, A. W. Martin, on Meadowlands Pike in Washington County. As he approached a point where the Meadowlands Pike intersects with Allison Hollow Road he observed the defendants’ truck coming from the right. A stop sign at this intersection <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>required all traffic on Allison Hollow Road to come to a definitive halt before proceeding across the through highway on which the plaintiff was moving. The truck, however, did not stop and a collision occurred.</p>

Martin filed a suit in trespass for personal injuries sustained by him in the collision and joined with him his father, A. W. Martin, for damages done the Oldsmobile car. At the termination of Walter M. Martin’s case, the Court entered a compulsory non-suit against him, finding him contributorily negligent as a matter of law, and allowed the case to go to the jury as to the property damages sustained by the owner of the Oldsmobile. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the owner, A. W. Martin, in the sum of $600.</p>

Martin testified that he was driving at about 35 miles per hour when he saw the defendants’ truck approximately 150 feet from the intersection. <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>The truck gave every indication of a progressive retardation of speed in order to obey the Stop Sign, and was faltering along at 6 to 7 miles per hour. However, when the plaintiff was about 25 feet from the intersection, the truck suddenly picked up speed and moved into the path of the car of the plaintiff who sounded his horn, vigorously applied his brakes and turned sharply to the right toward the curb to avoid striking the truck. The wheels of the plaintiffs car locked and it skidded a short distance so that its left side came into contact with the center portion of the truck on its right side.</p>

Through highways would lose their whole significance if motorists on those highways were required themselves to stop to ask the pleasure of cars in transversal traffic. All vehicles moving into through highways are statutorily called upon to cease movement not only to allow through traffic to pass but to cease movement absolutely, even though no one else be on either of the intersecting highways.</p>

Jordan, </em><a href="/pa/313/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="313 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="1152706" data-case-paths="/pa/313/0197-01">313 Pa. 197</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20A.%20151" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="169 A. 151">169 A. 151</a>, the lower Court had declared as a matter of law that the defendant there was negligent because while traveling on a through highway at the rate of 20 to 25 miles per hour, he had not looked, after passing a point 75 feet from an intersection, to see whether anyone was ap<a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>proaching that intersection. In reversing the lower court this Court said that the driver had the right “. . . to suppose that anyone coming to the crossing would obey the stop signal, and give him the right of way, as required by the Yehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, sections 1014 and 1016, as amended by the Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 751, section 2. It was error for the trial judge to say as a matter of law that Jordan was negligent under such circumstances. His negligence was clearly a question for the jury.” Further, the Court said: “But in determining whether reasonable care was exercised it must be remembered that a driver having the right of way may take into consideration, as a factor upon which, with others, to base his conduct, the duty of other drivers to obey the law and the probability that they will do so . . .”</p>

This Court, through Chief Justice Drew, said: “It is contended that the driver of the fire truck was not entitled to assume that the motorman would respect his superior right at the intersection. We are firmly of the contrary opinion. It is true that the driver of a motor vehicle may not proceed blindly in reliance upon his right of way (Mathiasen v. Brennan, <a href="/pa/318/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="318 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="1159613" data-case-paths="/pa/318/0577-01">318 Pa. 577</a>; Byrne v.

However, the defendant’s testimony is irrelevant in this proceeding since it was heard in the case involving the owner of the Oldsmobile car and came <em>after </em>the Court had entered a non-suit against the present plaintiff, the appellant here.</p>
