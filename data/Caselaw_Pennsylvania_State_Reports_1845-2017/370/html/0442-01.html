The facts.are recited at length in our opinion in <em>Abel et al. v. Girard Trust Company et al., </em><a href="/pa/365/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="365 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1225574" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0034-01">365 Pa. 34</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.2d%20682" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="73 A.2d 682">73 A. 2d 682</a>. The action was in equity in the nature of <em>quia timet. </em>Trustees of a closed bank secured a title to real estate by <em>sheriffs deed </em>following an attachment execution upon a judgment obtained in á suit against a corporation upon two of its promissory notes. After securing such title the trustees agreed to sell the real estate in fee simple to the present appellants. The title examination disclosed a question whether the trustees could convey a valid title in fee simple, the solution of which depended upon the effect of the words constituting the <em>habendum </em>clause in the deed to the judgment debtor. The trustees filed their complaint, in <em>quia timet, </em>as above stated. All interested parties were joined. The trustees alleged that the Bangor Park Association, the judgment debtor, had acquired title <em>in fee, </em>with power to convey free of trust restrictions, and hence under the sheriff’s deed title passed to the trustees in fee simple, which they were able to transfer to the present appellants. The grantors of such judgment debtor, the Brown Estate, on the contrary, contended that their conveyance created a <em>base fee </em>and because of non-user in accordance with the terms of the grant, a reversion to the grantors resulted. This Court decided that the fee was not base but was absolute and there was no reverter. We also held (which <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>was a necessary consideration in a <em>quia timet </em>proceeding) that such transfer was made to the Bangor Park Association under a valid <em>charitable trust. </em>Since this decision we have re-affirmed both principles. See <em>Hoffman v. Pittsburgh et al., </em><a href="/pa/365/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="365 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1225529" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0386-01">365 Pa. 386</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.2d%20649" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="75 A.2d 649">75 A. 2d 649</a>, as to reverter and <em>Loechel v.

      <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>The present record discloses the disregard of our decision. As the trustees of the closed bank possess no title to the real estate, they are not parties in interest. They do not have the status to petition for the appointment of a substituted trustee, and for the sale of the premises. Obviously, therefore, the court could not approve the proposed sale upon petition of parties without interest, even though real estate experts may have testified at the hearing that the $5,000 consideration agreed upon was a full and fair price. But in addition an answer was filed by one Capozzolo offering $6,000, a thousand dollars more than has been offered by appellants. Another answer was filed by the Burgess of Bangor Borough, objecting to the sale at $5,000 and requesting the court to appoint a substituted trustee, which has not yet been done. Three individuals, Horn, Wagner and Bemagon answered that the petitioners had resigned as trustees for the closed bank, and that they had been appointed in their place, and “acquiesce in said proceedings and join in the prayer of said Petition.” Lastly, appellants answered, in a formal answer filed by Mr. Turtzo, their counsel, with language which we regard as an impertinent and scandalous affront to this Court.</p>

All that the sheriff’s deed transferred to the creditors was the association’s interest and title in the real estate (i.e. not that as trustee), which, as above indicated, was nothing.

If it has then a substituted trustee may be appointed. If the association is still in existence, but has ceased to function, it may be necessary first to <em>remove </em>it as a delinquent trustee. As the judgment and execution were apparently effective, it would seem necessary first to make such inquiry. After a trustee is shown to exist or a substitute appointed then a hearing must be had and testimony presented to determine whether or not the purposes of the trust may be carried out, and if not, then to direct a sale. As the real estate is impressed with a charitable trust, the substituted trustee will be required, after an appropriate order of sale by the court, to obtain the highest and best price under all the circumstances. As this constitutes a judicial sale, such sale will be subject to the approval of the court: <em>Baton Coal Company Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/365/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="365 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="1225627" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0519-01">365 Pa. 519</a>, 524, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.2d%20194" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="76 A.2d 194">76 A. 2d 194</a>, and cases therein cited.

The usual case of unjust enrichment involves a suit to “reach the trust estate by a proceeding against the trustee in his representative capacity and . . . recover the amount by which the estate was enriched, although the trustee exceeded his authority .in incurring the liability.”: 2 Scott on Trusts, sec. 269.1, p. 1516. Here there was no suit against the association in its representative capacity as trustee for the inhabitants of the Borough of Bangor, nor does it appear from the record that the purchase money was originally borrowed <em>in such capacity. </em>Even though the corporate association may have borrowed money from the bank upon its notes and used part or all of the borrowed money in the purchase of real estate which it then caused to be dedicated for charitable uses, this fact <em>alone </em>did not give the' bank, or its trustees, an equitable lien on the real estate or require restitution because of unjust enrichment. In the absence of additional facts or equities no such interest can be declared. But in any event, any such claim would not affect the <em>title </em>as above indicated but would constitute an equitable lien or claim against the <em>fund, </em>which is not yet before the Court. No election by the borough is, therefore, necessary or required. As a charitable trust has been declared by this Court to' <em>exist, </em>title is already in J;he present or substituted trustee and no <em>transfer </em>of title-is-requisite.'</p>
