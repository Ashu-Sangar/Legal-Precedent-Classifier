Plaintiff, Pennsylvania Excavators’ Association* <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>an unincorporated association, lias approximately fourteen members doing large excavating work. Plaintiff, Contractors’ Association of Philadelphia, a nonprofit corporation, consists of about fifty-five contractors engaged in construction of bridges, roads, highways, subways and heavy sewer lines. The three associations act as negotiating agents for their constituents in consummating collective bargaining agreements with employes. Defendants are Local Unions No. 542, 542A and 542B, International Union of Operating Engineers, an unincorporated association, and Roy J. Underwood, its president and business manager.</p>
    <p id="b97-3" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[145,1042,1148,544]]]'>Plaintiffs and defendants on October 7, 1949, entered into a retroactive written collective bargaining agreement for a term of one year to expire April 30, 1950. The agreement was signed by Roy J. Underwood for defendants, by William F. Lotz, president of General Building Contractors’ Association, by John Buckley, president of Pennsylvania Excavators’ Association, and by Harry R. Halloran, chairman of the board of directors of Contractors’ Association of Philadelphia.</p>

By letter of February 15, 1950, Underwood wrote, “We shall be pleased to discuss with you at your convenience the terms and conditions of a new agreement to become effective May 1, 1950.” Plaintiffs advised Robert G. Kelly, Esquire, attorney for the Union, that any wage increases would be resisted.</p>

Kelly, representing plaintiffs and defendants respectively, had negotiated and prepared the collective bargaining agreement of October 7, 1949 covering the year May 1, 1949 to April 30, 1950. These individuals acted because group or committee meetings had become too acrimonious to <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>achieve results. The same individuals for the same reason carried on negotiations for their respective principals for an agreement to become effective May 1,1950. Kelly suggested that a welfare fund might be established. Halloran advised Kelly that no increase in wage could be granted but that it might be possible to work out an arrangement for a working welfare fund.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[248,757,1152,926]]]'>Underwood was authorized by the Union to negotiate for a welfare fund subordinating other issues such as wage rates and working conditions. Halloran, at the suggestion of Kelly, secured authority from the plaintiff associations to negotiate such collective bargaining agreement and was advised by Kelly that the latter had secured similar authority from the defendants. All negotiations and communications between the parties during the months of March and April, 1950 were restricted to Kelly and Halloran. The two negotiators agreed that in consideration of creation of a welfare fund, the existing collective bargaining agreement would be extended for a period of two years. The employers were required to contribute to such fund 10^ per each man hour worked. This agreement was verbally made on April 14, 1950, by Kelly and Halloran, to become effective as of May 1, 1950.</p>

Meanwhile a strike threatened for May 1, 1950 did not materialize. Prior to the execution of this instrument, at the request of Halloran, Kelly reduced to writing the oral agreement reached by them on April 14, 1950 as agents for their respective principals. This was captioned “Addendum Dated April-14,-1950, to Agreement and Working Eules Dated October 7,- 1949, by and between Local Union 542, <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>542A and 542B, International Union of Operating Engineers, A. F. L. and General Building Contractors Association, Pennsylvania Excavators Association and Contractors Association of Philadelphia”, and in accord with the oral agreement made the effective date May 1, 1950, provided for the creation of the welfare fund and continued all of the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement of October 7, 1949 until April 30, 1952. It was signed by Halloran and Kelly as the “duly authorized” representatives of the plaintiff associations and the defendant Unions. Prior to the execution of the trust agreement, the six trustees provided for therein, three of whom were representatives of the associations and three representatives of the Unions, including Underwood, unanimously passed a resolution adopting the welfare fund “. . . in accordance with the terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiated by the parties thereto under date of April 14, 1950.”</p>

Underwood, on October 11, 1950, attempted to repudiate Kelly’s authority and the terms of the agreement. Halloran, to whom the letter of repudiation was addressed, immediately notified Kelly that the employers insisted that the agreement of the parties be honored.</p>

The Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, as fiscal agent, opened its trust account on December 7, 1950. Subsequent to the execution of the trust agreement, the trustees held meetings on October 19 and 27, 1950, and March 26, 1951. More than a quarter of a million dollars has been paid into the welfare fund.</p>

Plaintiffs, on April 27,1951, filed their bill in equity averring the collective bargaining agreement, a threat of a strike in violation of the provisions thereof, irreparable loss and damage which would be suffered as a result of the breach, and inadequacy of a remedy at law.</p>

    <p id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[164,760,1147,593]]]'>Appellants’ fundamental challenge, viz., jurisdiction of a state court to issue a restraining order enjoining violation of a collective bargaining agreement was not presented in the court below. Because of the challenge to the judicial power we will consider it on this appeal. The attack is based on an asserted supremacy of federal statutes relating to labor relations, it being claimed that the business of the employers affects interstate commerce. We will assume in the disposition of this case that interstate commerce is affected.</p>

There is not involved any action for damages arising from breach of a collective bargaining agreement within the intendment of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 USCA §185). Decisions of courts involving actions for damages arising from a violation of a collective bargaining agreement are, therefore, inapposite. This disposes of defendants’ reliance upon the cases of <em>Shirley-Herman Co., Inc., v.

The legislation must, therefore, be examined as a whole to determine the intention of the Congress.” Unquestionably if Congress has legislated upon the matter specifically or in a manner to clearly exclude the jurisdiction of a state court, its mandate must control: <em>Pittsburgh Railways Company Substation Operators and Maintenance Employees’ Case, </em><a href="/pa/357/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="357 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="472082" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0379-01">357 Pa. 379</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=54%20A.2d%20891" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="54 A.2d 891">54 A. 2d 891</a>.</p>

Defendants’ contention that Congressional provision for the prohibition of injunctions <em>in United States courts </em>and provision for <em>recovery of damages by reason of a breach of contract </em>constituted a preemption of all phases of law in so far as recognition and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements are concerned, cannot be accepted. We can agree that federal labor legislation must be regarded as a single integrated program. It does not follow, however, that assertion of power over labor disputes and employe-employer relations deprived state courts of equity from exercising their traditional power to require performance of solemn contractual duties and, by injunctive relief, to prevent irreparable damage which would be brought about by failure to perform such duties.
