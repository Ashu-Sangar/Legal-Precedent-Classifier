Prior to his hospitalization he authorized certain friends, who had urged him to be a candidate for Justice of the Peace, to take whatever action might be required to qualify him as a candidate. A nomination petition was circulated in his name and the Qualified Elector’s affidavit, as well as the Candidate’s affidavit attached thereto, were signed by Chas. R. Steinmetz, county treasurer of Northampton County. The paper, with the affidavits appended thereto, was taken to Chris J. Hannon, Jus<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>tice of the Peace, who affixed his jurat and filed it with other petitions with the County Board of Elections.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[245,474,1146,541]]]'>McFall, being the only candidate on the Democratic ticket, for Justice of the Peace, was duly nominated on July 24th. On September 28th, Ernest Turtzo, who received the nomination for the same office on the Republican ticket, filed a bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County, seeking to restrain the county commissioners from printing the name of McFall on the ballot for November 6, 1951. The lower court dismissed the bill, and the petitioner appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[244,1029,1146,305]]]'>It is the contention of the appellant that since it is admitted McFall did not personally sign the Candidate’s Affidavit and Steinmetz did not circulate the petition, nor swear to the affidavit he signed, the nomination petition was void and, therefore, McFall could not have been elected in November.</p>
    <p id="b550-6" data-blocks='[["BL_550.6",550,[242,1355,1148,591]]]'>Section 977 of the Pennsylvania Election Code Act of June 3,1937, P. L. 1333, Art IX, as amended May 21, 1943, P. L. 353, Sec. 1, provides, inter alia: “All nomination petitions and papers received and filed within the periods limited by this act shall be deemed to be valid, unless, within seven days after the last day for filing said nomination petition or paper, a petition is presented to the court of common pleas of the county in which the nomination petition or paper was filed, specifically setting forth the objections thereto, and praying that the said petition or paper be set aside.”</p>
    <p id="b550-7" data-blocks='[["BL_550.7",550,[242,1958,1147,317]]]'>This means, therefore, that unless objections were filed on or before May 28, 1951, (the last day for filing such petition being May 21st) McFall’s nomination petition would be deemed valid. Ernest Turtzo did not file his objections until September 28th, four months after the last day for taking such action.</p>

It was established, however, that the plaintiff visited the office of the county Board of Elections and inspected the petition within the week after its filing. There is no evidence that anyone on behalf of McFall attempted to conceal the procedure which had been followed, it being simply asserted that his friends had acted under McFall’s instructions and authorization in view of McFall’s serious illness and hospitalization.</p>
    <p id="b551-4" data-blocks='[["BL_551.4",551,[145,986,1144,90]]]'>Why did Ernest Turtzo wait four months to protest what was a matter of record?</p>
    <p id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[144,1097,1148,311]]]'>This Court held definitively in <em>American Labor Party Case, </em><a href="/pa/352/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="352 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="464121" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0576-01">352 Pa. 576</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2048" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="44 A.2d 48">44 A. 2d 48</a>, that the provision of the Election Code requiring that petition to set aside a nomination petition be presented to the Court of Common Pleas within seven days is mandatory and cam not be waived.</p>
    <p id="b551-6" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[144,1429,1148,704]]]'>The plaintiff contends, however, that this rule does not apply where a fraud has been perpetrated since fraud vitiates the entire proceedings involved. But fraud when discovered must be acted upon with dispatch. It is not enough to allege fraud; it must be established that the perpetrator of the fraud made efforts to conceal the fraud if the statutory period for appeal has expired. The lower court well expressed the principle involved here when it said: “In an action based upon a fraud, the statute of limitations will run from the date of the fraudulent act complained of, unless such fraud has been actively concealed by the wrongdoer: Smith v. Blachley, supra.</p>

In determining whether the rights claimed should have been more promptly asserted, plaintiff is chargeable not only with what he knew but also with what he could have discovered with reasonable diligence: Barnes and Tucker Company v.

    <p id="b552-5" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[252,996,1146,811]]]'>There was no proof here, nor was any contention to that effect made, of any concealment of facts surrounding the execution of the affidavits. Where ignorance of rights or wrongs is relied on, to account for laches and failure to seek relief within the limitation provided by statute, it must be alleged and proved why the plaintiff was kept in ignorance, and why the facts could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence. “. . . the tendency of courts in recent years has been to hold the plaintiff to a rigid compliance with the law which demands, not only that he should have been ignorant of the fraud, but that he should have used reasonable diligence to have informed himself of the facts.” <em>(Patton et al. v.

The appellant chose to disregard that procedure. This Court said, in <em>Thompson v. Morrison, </em><a href="/pa/352/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="352 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="464058" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0616-01">352 Pa. 616</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=44%20A.2d%2055" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="44 A.2d 55">44 A. 2d 55</a>. “If the regulations provide, as they have provided, how alleged infractions of the election law shall be dealt with, the procedure must be followed.

Unless time, limits were set within which to challenge the results of elections, government would permanently. sit on a shaky foundation, and the citizenry would never be certain of the identity of thé office-holder chosen to direct and operate the complex activities of the State, County and Municipality. Civilization must protect itself from the sluggard, as well as from the evildoer.
