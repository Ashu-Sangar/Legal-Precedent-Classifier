        "text": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nPlaintiffs, Norman M. Bashore and his wife, Helen M. Bashore, brought this action in trespass for the damage done to their restaurant building when the truck owned by defendant, Publix Shirt Corporation, crashed into the front of it. The jury returned a verdict of $6,070.53. After its motion for judgment n.o.v. was denied and judgment was entered on the verdict, defendant appealed.\nPlaintiffs are the owners and operators of a restaurant located on the north side of Route 22 in Bethel Township, Berks County. At that point Route 22 is a two-lane concrete highway running east and west. On December 19, 1949, defendant\u2019s truck was being operated in a westerly direction on this roadway. Plaintiffs adduced testimony to show that when the truck reached a point on the highway near plaintiffs\u2019 place of business, it left the highway, travelled through soft, muddy ground a distance of approximately ninety-seven feet, hit a parked car, then, without slowing down, struck the front of the restaurant, and proceeded into the building a distance of about fifteen feet. The collision demolished the building and caused extensive damage to its interior as well as to furnishings, fixtures and supplies. Plaintiffs also testified that after the accident, defendant\u2019s driver stated to them that he \u201cmust have got on the gas instead of the brakes.\u201d\nOn this evidence, it is clear that the jury properly could infer that the negligence of defendant was the proximate cause of this accident. Defendant\u2019s driver admittedly was in exclusive control and management of the truck, and the collision obviously was such that in the ordinary course of events would not happen when a motor vehicle is operated with due care. It is well settled that negligence may be inferred from the circumstances attending an accident: Turek v. Pennsylvania, R. R. Co., 361 Pa. 512, 64 A. 2d 779. This Court in this connection said, in Commonwealth v. Montour Transport Co., 365 Pa. 72, 76, 73 A. 2d 659: \u201cThe facts pleaded by the plaintiff, when proven, will afford an inference of negligence that will carry the case to the jury; and the duty will then be upon the defendant to exculpate itself by acceptable explanation that the accident occurred through no fault of its own.\u201d (Italics added). See also Shafer v. Lacock, Hawthorn & Co., 168 Pa. 497, 32 A. 44.\nAs a defense, defendant introduced testimony to the effect that a truck, travelling eastwardly on Route 22 swerved to avoid an oncoming car, brushed against defendant\u2019s truck, causing the latter vehicle to leave the highway and crash into plaintiffs\u2019 restaurant. It is the contention of defendant that even though there may be \u25a0 sufficient evidence in plaintiffs\u2019 case to take the question of defendant\u2019s negligence to the jury,, nevertheless, since the testimony offered by defendant would indicate that the damage to plaintiffs\u2019 building was brought about through no fault of defendant\u2019s driver, the court below erred in refusing to enter judgment n.o.v. for defendant. With this contention we cannot agree. It was still a matter exclusively for the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses and to ascertain, after considering all the evidence, whether or not plaintiffs had met the burden of proof that defendant\u2019s driver was negligent and that that negligence was the proximate cause of the damage to their building.\nEven though the jury believed defendant\u2019s testimony that its truck was brushed by another vehicle causing the former vehicle to leave the highway, the fact that defendant\u2019s truck travelled a distance of ninety-seven feet from the roadway, without an apparent slackening of speed, ran into a parked car and crashed into plaintiffs\u2019 building with such terrific force as to demolish it, warranted the jury in finding that defendant\u2019s driver put his foot on the accelerator instead of, on the brake and that his truck was out of control because of the driver\u2019s failure to act properly under the circumstances.\nWe are convinced that the learned court below did not err in refusing to enter judgment for defendant, notwithstanding the verdict.\nJudgment affirmed.",
