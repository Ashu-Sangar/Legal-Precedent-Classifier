Joseph Thomas, Esq., Meadville, Pa.; and defendant\u2019s address is 175 Inglewood Drive, Mt. Lebanon Township, Pittsburgh, Pa.\nBenjamin Jacobson,\nAttorney for Plaintiff.\u201d\nThis question is governed by the Act of April 16, 1840, supra, which provides: \u201cIn addition to the remedies now provided by law, hereafter any judgments, in any district court, or court of common pleas in Pennsylvania, may be transferred from the court in which they are entered, to any other district court, or court of common pleas in this .Commonwealth, by filing of record, in said, other court a certified copy of the whole record in the,case) and any.prothonotary receiving such certified copy of record, in any case in which judgment has been entered by another court, or in another court, by transcript from justices of the peace, shall file the same, and forthwith transcribe the docket entry thereof into his own docket, and the case may then be proceeded in, and the judgments and costs collected by executions, bill of discovery, or attachment, as prescribed by the act entitled \u2018An act relating to executions,\u2019 passed June 16, 1836; and as to lien, revivals, executions, and so forth, it shall have the same force and effect, and no other, as if the judgment had been entered, .or the transcript been originally filed, in the same court to which it may thus be transferred.\u201d\nAppellant contends that the whole record means merely the Appearance Docket and the Judgment Docket; that the Court of Allegheny County has no power to inquire into the merits of the case except for purposes of 'execution, and that it would be a vain and useless, and hence unnecessary requirement to transfer a certified copy of all the papers in the case from the county in which the judgment was originally entered. Appellant\u2019s argument is fortified by the following quotation from First National Bank and Trust Co. v. Laubach, 333 Pa. 344, 5 A. 2d 139, where this Court said, page 349, \u201cIt is to be noted that this act [of April 16, 1840] is entitled \u2018An Act Relating to Executions, . . .\u2019 and it does not undertake to deal with a transferred judgment other than for purposes of realizing thereon. Such a transferred judgment is merely \u2018a quasi judgment, and that too only for limited purposes\u2019: Brandt\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 343, 346. It has been held time and again that the court of the county to which the judgment is transferred has no power over it except for purposes' of execution,1 and cannot'inquire into its merits. That can be done only by the' court in which it was originally obtained: King v. Nimick, 34 Pa. 297; Mellon v. Guthrie, 51 Pa. 116; Beck v. Church, 113 Pa. 200; Nelson v. Guffey, 131 Pa. 273; Lehigh & New England R. R. Co. v. Hanhauser, 222 Pa. 248; Shotts & Co. v. Agnew & Barnett, 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 458, 461.\u201d Appellant\u2019s argument is both plausible and practical but it cannot prevail because we cannot disregard the plain language and the clear meaning of the governing act. The Act of 1840, supra, specifically requires that there be transferred and filed of record, a certified copy not of the docket entries but of the whole record in the case, and the Prothonotary of the receiving court, \u201cshall file the same, and forthwith transcribe the docket entry thereof into his own docket. . .\u201d It is manifest that the Act draws a distinction between the whole record and the docket entry thereof; and consequently this distinction and this language cannot be ignored.\nBoth appellant and appellee agree that there is only one appellate court case construing the Act of 1840, namely, Updergraff v. Perry, 4 Pa. 291 (1846); but each contends the case supports his position. In that case the exemplification of record which the court held was insufficient, purported to be merely the docket entries in the appearance docket and did not include the judgment docket. Some of the broad language used by the Court must be considered in the light of those unusual facts. However, we quote with approval the following excerpts from that opinion (pages 294 et seq.): \u201cThis certificate, it is quite obvious, does not pursue the directions of the act of Assembly, which requires the whole record to be certified. It would be a large extension of liberality, ... to presume, from a mere certificate that the docket entry of a judgment was full and complete, that the whole record was therefore certified. The certificate does not, in fact, purport to authenticate an exemplification of the record. ... A copy of the docket entry, in legal or common parlance, is not understood to mean a copy of the whole record, but rather the contrary. . . . The certificate of the officer ought to show in a satisfactory manner that the whole record is certified; that would comply with the provisions of the statute . . . The law guards the rights of the debtor as well as those of the creditor. It is the duty of the plaintiff to see that his proceedings are properly conducted. A rule is presented in the statute so plain that he who runs may read, and if the plaintiff suffers loss by his own negligence, or. the carelessness- of the officer, although it may be regretted it cannot be repaired in this case by the law.\u201d This language is equally applicable to the facts in the present case.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed.\nP.
