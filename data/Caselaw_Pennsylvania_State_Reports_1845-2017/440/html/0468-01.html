Moreover, that this rule applies even in cases where there is a <em>specific </em>statutory remedy at law is shown clearly by Studio Theaters. . . .

There is no such problem involved in the case at bar. In addition, we recently stated: “what is required to confer jurisdiction on an equity court is the existence of a substantial question of constitutionality (and not a mere allegation) and the absence of an adequate statutory remedy.” <em>Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. v.

While appellants contend this factor to be present, the record is barren of any direct correlation. As was stated by one lower court concerning the valuation of an occupation, “economic return is not the sole measure of the value of an occupation. ...

We concluded “assess” covered the former, so that the school district’s only assessing power was to compute the tax. Thus, “assess”, within the meaning of section 672 of the Public School Code, read in conjunction with The Local Tax Enabling Act, refers simply to this ministerial computation.

In that case, we found a $10 per annum occupational privilege tax on every individual engaged in an occupation within the corporate limits of the city, whose earnings would amount to $600 or more during the year, to violate the uniformity requirements. As age was not a factor, that case is readily distinguishable. Initially, it must be noted that the magic age of majority supports many distinctions outside the field <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>of state taxation. There are several reasons for holding this tax classification to be similarly acceptable. While the revenues to be derived from taxing the occupations of minors would be relatively small, the difficulty of collecting the tax from minors who refuse to pay would be relatively great because, <em>inter </em>alia, they usually do not own property upon which a levy could be made. It should also be realistically noted that many minors only work during nonschool hours, and it would be unfair to tax them as if they have full-time occupations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> We ascertain no sound reason to find this tax classification to be unreasonable.</p>

I also must confess that I am unable to perceive Justice Jones’ recently created distinction between a “substantial constitutional question” as opposed to a “constitutional question.” Is it suggested that there is some jurisprudential difference between the degree or extent of unconstitutionality, and that some unconstitutionality may be ignored, but not other? In any case, it is a distinction which invites confusion in its application.</p>
