After trial, the court en banc ruled that, under the facts, the contributory negligence of Westfall must be imputed to the owner of the automobile as a matter of law, and this precluded recovery by the Smalich Estate against defendant Blank. This conclusion of the court below was based on our ruling in <em>Beam v. </em>Pitts<em>burgh Railways </em>Co., <a href="/pa/366/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="366 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="8845581" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0360-01">366 Pa. 360</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=77%20A.2d%20634" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="77 A.2d 634">77 A. 2d 634</a> (1951), and admittedly was clearly dictated by that decision.</p>

In considering the instant case, we have re-examined <em>Beam </em>and conclude that, as to the portion of the holding above set forth, it should be overruled and no longer be recognized as the law of this Commonwealth.</p>

See also, Restatement (Second), Torts §§485, 486 and 491 (1965).

Therefore in a,n action in trespass by a bailor to recover for damage to the thing bailed, caused by the negligent act of a third party, the contributory negligence of the bailee is no defense, unless the bailee was at the time acting as the bailor’s servant: <em>Commercial Banking Corp. v.

Further, the principal has power to revoke the agent’s authority, although this would constitute a breach of his contract with him .... The control of the principal does not, however, include control at every moment; its exercise may be very attenuated and, as where the principal is physically absent, may be ineffective:” Restatement (Second), Agency §14, comment a. Since an agent who is not a servant is not subject to any right of control by his principal over the details of his physical conduct, the responsibility rests upon the agent alone, and the principal is <em>not </em>liable, for harm caused by his unauthorized negligent physical conduct: <em>Commonwealth v.

No. 7: If you find that the decedent, Julia Smalich, relinquished her right to control her automobile, either expressly or impliedly, by words, actions or conduct, and at the time of the accident had transferred that right to control the car to the defendant Westfall, then you should find that any conduct by defendant Westfall cannot affect or bar the right of the decedent’s personal representative to recover in this case.” The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiffs against defendant Blank, and, therefore, must have determined that Julia Smalich had relinquished her right to control her automobile to defendant Westfall.
