In September 1965, plaintiff entered into an oral lease with Mrs. Luksa for the rental of a box stall, the use of a tack room and the pasture, all to be used in connection with his stabling of a horse in the barn. The rent was $15 per month.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[137,1081,1152,699]]]'>A disagreement arose almost immediately between plaintiff and another tenant, Bob Foster, who boarded his horse at the barn, over plaintiffs use of the tack room to store his tack. Rather than arguing with plaintiff, Foster complained to Mrs. Luksa, who informed him that plaintiff had a right to use the tack room as part of their rental agreement. Plaintiff thereafter suggested that “rather than have hard feelings with other people,” he would store his tack in the “loft” and Mrs. Luksa agreed. However, shortly thereafter Foster left, and plaintiff went back to using the tack room pursuant to his original lease agreement with Mrs. Luksa.</p>

Mrs. Luksa agreed to this request, but did not increase plaintiffs rent or charge anything extra for this privilege.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> Mrs. <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>Luksa continued to use part of the loft for the storage of her lawn furniture.</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[176,409,1160,1141]]]'>The usual means of access to the loft was by the • use of a 12-foot wooden ladder which led to a hole in the floor of the loft, approximately four feet by three feet. The hole was approximately eight feet from the floor of the barn and was covered over by a board, which, after climbing up the ladder, was slid back in order to gain entrance into the loft. The ladder was placed at about a forty-five degree angle from a wall, and rested on a smooth cement floor. The top of the ladder leaned against a beam running, along the ceiling of the barn. The ladder was secured to the beam by baling twine and baling wire tied to the sides of the ladder and to nails driven into the beam. The baling twine and wire were used to prevent the ladder from slipping. There was testimony describing the condition -of the ladder as being generally “shaky” and “wobbly.” The area of the bam surrounding the ladder was dimly lighted. Plaintiff testified that he had used the ladder to get into the loft <em>at least forty or fifty times prior to the accident, </em>and had even used it the day before his accident.</p>

Plaintiff had a horse sleigh outside the barn which Zunic suggested they put in the loft. Plaintiff, Zunic and a third party carried the sleigh to the large barn doors in the front of the barn, through which they were going to take the sleigh to the loft. Zunic went to the house to get a wrench to loosen the nuts on the shafts of plaintiffs sleigh so that the sleigh could be semi-dismantled for storage in the loft, and plaintiff entered the stable area of the barn in order to climb to the loft and unlock the barn doors from inside the barn. He climbed <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>the ladder and, as he was sliding away the trap door, the ladder suddenly slipped away or fell from the wall, causing him to fall to the floor of the barn and sustain the injuries for which he brought this suit.</p>

Superior Ct. 243</a> (1913). The trial court is of course always free to withdraw a question of fact from the jury’s consideration and decide it itself when the evidence so dictates, but withdrawal of the question of the terms of the contested oral lease was not warranted here.</p>
    <p id="b158-8" data-blocks='[["BL_158.10",158,[183,1986,1149,319]],["BL_159.1",159,[128,320,1151,422]]]'>As the majority recites, appellant entered into an oral lease with Mary Luksa in September of 1965 for the use of a stall, tack room and pasture for a monthly rental of $15. Later in the same month appellant received permission to store his tack in the loft in order to avoid an argument with another tenant concerning <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>use of the tack room. In October, after that other tenant had departed and the original reason for appellant’s use of the loft had ceased, appellant requested and was granted the continued use of the loft for the purpose of storing hay. Another tenant was extended the same privilege. Finally, in March of the following year appellant was injured while attempting to climb the ladder to the loft.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[122,763,1155,1415]]]'>The majority apparently reasons that the loft could not have been included in appellant’s leasehold because unsupported by any consideration. In so holding, however, it overlooks long settled principles of property law. A parol lease which does not fix the term of the lease but which reserves rent at a specified rate per month will, without more, create a tenancy from month to month. <em>Hollis v. Burns, </em><a href="/pa/100/0206-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="100 Pa. 206" data-case-ids="498454" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0206-01">100 Pa. 206</a> (1882). Furthermore, the continuance of a tenant in possession into a new term is deemed a new and separate agreement requiring no additional consideration. <em>Supplee v, Timothy, </em><a href="/pa/124/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="124 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="563067" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0375-01">124 Pa. 375</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20A.%20864" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="16 A. 864">16 Atl. 864</a> (1889). Thus, in September of 1965, during the <em>original </em>term of the lease, there was indeed no consideration for appellant’s use of the loft. He was at that time but a licensee “privileged to enter or remain on land only by virtue of the posessor’s consent.” Restatement (Second) of Torts §330 (1965). However, it is possible, and the jury could have so found, that the continued permission to use the loft in the following months was intended by the parties as a renegotiation and expansion of the original lease. To be sure, Mary Luksa received no additional rental, but consideration could certainly be inferred from appellant’s willingness to rent from her in the subsequent months leading up to and including the month in which the accident occurred.</p>

There was sufficient evidence that a reasonable inspection would have disclosed the dangerous condition of the ladder and that appellant did not voluntarily assume the risk of its use.</p>
