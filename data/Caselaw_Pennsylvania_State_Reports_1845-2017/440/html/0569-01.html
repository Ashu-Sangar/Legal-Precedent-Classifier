But we are not disposed to fashion a <em>per se </em>rule requiring reversal of every conviction following tardy appointment of counsel or to hold that, whenever a habeas corpus petition alleges a belated appointment, an evidentiary hearing must be held to determine whether the defendant has been denied his constitutional right to counsel.” <a href="/us/399/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="399 U.S. 42" data-case-ids="6168334" data-case-paths="/us/399/0042-01">Id. at 54</a>. The United States Supreme Court’s failure to place any emphasis on, or even mention the burden of proof question, coupled with the refusal to fashion a per se rule, seemingly vitiated the Third Circuit’s <em>Mathis </em>approach to ineffective assistance of counsel cases as far as the presumption with respect to shortness of time was concerned.</p>

We believe it is preferable that the factual question whether the defendant received adequate assistance of counsel should not be enwrapped in the label of a presumption which itself floats adrift and first requires a preliminary decision on the uncertain question of what is a belated appointment without eliminating a full inquiry thereafter into the facts to determine whether the presumption has been overcome or rebutted. ... A belated appointment of counsel would be strong evidence in a defendant’s behalf, but a decision on the claim would <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>still require an inquiry into the ability, experience and zeal with which counsel acted, both at the trial and in preparation, to determine whether the charge was made out.</p>

In dismissing appellant’s post-trial motions and petition at the PCHA hearing, the trial court wrote an opinion in accordance with Rule 46 of the Superior Court. The trial court noted that appellant’s testimony as to ineffective counsel was unconvincing. Appellant had alleged that he did not see appointed counsel until a few minutes before trial and that he never was interviewed at the prison by representatives of the Defender’s Office. This testimony was contradicted by Leonard Packel, Esquire<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> of the Defender Association of Philadelphia who was called by the Commonwealth. He testified that the interview records of the Defender Association showed two interviews with the defendant. These interviews were dated December 2, 1959, and February 17, 1960, while the trial itself took place March 18, 1960. The information obtained from the interviews disclosed that <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>Woody had knowledge of the charges against him, which Woody now denies. The Defender Association also instituted an investigation on behalf of Woody. In addition, neither Woody nor his counsel requested more time to prepare for trial. Further, the record disclosed that in a five page colloquy with the court after trial, Woody failed to mention that he had had insufficient time to prepare for trial. The trial court chose to believe the testimony of the representative from the Defender’s Office.</p>
    <p id="b603-3" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[153,877,1154,753]]]'>While our review of the stewardship of the appellant’s attorney is not limited to the trial court’s findings, we find ample support for the trial court’s conclusions in this case. In his appeal, appellant argues that his right to counsel was denied because his attorney did not stress enough appellant’s alibi concerning his presence in New York while the crime was being committed in Philadelphia. Examination of the trial record, however, discloses that defendant’s attorney put on a vigorous defense, including several lengthy and searching cross-examinations of the Commonwealth’s witnesses, numerous objections and exceptions to the prosecution’s tactics, and finally the placing of defendant himself on the stand.</p>

Appellant’s attorney stressed the identification issue, while appellant wished his attorney had pressed his alibi of being in New York. As we said in the <em>Washington </em>case, reaffirmed today: “We cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, that our inquiry ceases and counsel’s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had <em>some reasonable basis </em>designed to effectuate his client’s interests.” <a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. at 604</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A. 2d at 352</a> (emphasis in original).
