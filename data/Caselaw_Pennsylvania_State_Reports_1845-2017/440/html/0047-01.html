The accident occurred when the appellant and his foreman were attempting to unjam the appellant’s plastic grinding machine and the foreman accidentally pushed the starter button while appellant’s hand was in the grinding device. Appellant’s evidence tended to show that the accident never would have happened had the grinder been equipped with an inexpensive device known as a micro-switch, and that the appellee, <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>who was in charge of plant safety, was negligent in failing to equip the grinder with the micro-switch. Appellee argued that the existence of a company regulation requiring that a machine be unplugged before repairs are attempted,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> together with the fact that micro-switches were not commonly used on grinders of the type which injured appellant, indicated that he was not negligent in failing to equip the grinder with such a micro-switch.</p>
    <p id="b77-4" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[134,810,1151,542]]]'>On the issue of negligence the trial judge gave the jury the following charge: “The test of negligence in machinery and appliances is the ordinary usage of the plastic business in this case, and however strongly they [the expert witnesses] may be convinced, people may be convinced, or individuals may be convinced that there is a better or less dangerous way, no jury can be permitted to say that the usual and ordinary way commonly adopted by those in the same business, is a negligent way for which liability shall be imposed.”</p>
