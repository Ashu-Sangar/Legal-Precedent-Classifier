This section was not, of course, self-executing, and on December 2, 1968 the General Assembly adopted four statutes designed to implement it. They were Acts Nos. 351, 353, 354, and 355. Act No. 351 provides for a right of appeal in all cases not otherwise provided for from a lower court of record to an appellate court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Act No. 355 is entitled “Minor Judiciary Court Appeals Act”, and provides for a right of appeal in all cases from decisions of the minor judiciary. Acts Nos. 353 and 354 provide a right of appeal from administrative agencies, and are the ones we are here concerned with. Act No. 354 is an amendment to the Administrative Agency Law, Act <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>of June 4, 1945, P.

As stated in the title to the Act, it implements Section 9 of Article V of the Constitution “by providing for a right of appeal in all cases from adjudications of administrative agencies of political subdivisions; and providing for the practice and procedure before said agencies.” It specifically does not apply to an “agency” as defined in the Administrative Agency Law.</p>

Hence the necessity of an appellate determination. Preliminarily, however, as indicated above, we are confronted with a question of the appellate court jurisdiction to decide the question of common pleas court jurisdiction.

This statute, until the recent enactment of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> was the principal statute delineating the respective jurisdictions of the Superior Court and the Supreme Court. As extensively amended in 1963 (Act of August 14, 1963, P. L. 819, §1), it provided that the Superior Court should have exclusive appellate jurisdiction in, <em>inter alia, </em>“[a] 11 actions arising from proceedings and orders of any commission or administrative agency, except as otherwise provided by statute.” 17 P.S. §184.1 (Supp. 1970). The Administrative Agency Law, §45, similarly provides for appeal to the Superior Court, except as limited by §46, by an agency or by any party affected by any decision of a court on an appeal from an adjudication. 71 P.S. §§1710.45 and 1710.46. Thus <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>whether the Board is a local agency under Act No. 353, an administrative agency under Act No. 354, or an agency of a different stripe not embraced by either Act, appeal should be to the Superior Court unless there is a statutory direction to the contrary.

While the point is not free of difficulty, we are satisfied that the present case does not come within the ambit of “right to public office”. It is unnecessary and would be unwise to try to indicate in this opinion the complete content of the clause. The “right” to office undoubtedly includes questions of qualification, eligibility, regularity of the electoral or appointive process and other preconditions to the holding of a particular public office. We think “right” should not normally include an appraisal of the sufficiency of or ruling upon evidence or other allegedly irregular aspects of the proceedings before a hearing tribunal resulting in an office holder’s discharge from his position. The appeal from the Board’s action in this case alleged these kinds of errors, together with other charges of <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>denial of procedural due process.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> “Public office”, in turn, we take to mean an elective or appointive position in which the incumbent is exercising a governmental function which involves a measure of policy making and which is of general public importance. We recognize, of course, that public education is an important function of government, and that a district superintendency is an important office within the educational structure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> We think, however, that in the context of the jurisdictional statute the emphasis should be on the governmental aspect of public office in the popular sense of the term governmental; this, in our opinion, does not include education.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

    <p id="b347-4" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[120,658,1160,1309]]]'>With respect to the time within which appeals to an appellate court must be taken from lower court decisions reviewing adjudications of local agencies, Section 9 of Act No. 353, the Local Agency Law, clearly provides for 30 days. This period pertains to appeals to this Court as well as the Superior Court, and is by way of an exception to the normal three month period provided by the Act of May 19, 1897, P. L. 67, §4, as amended, 12 P.S. §1136. The Administrative Agency Law has a comparable thirty day appeal period from a lower court decision on appeal from an administrative agency adjudication. 71 P.S. §1710.45. The appeals from both McKean County and Dauphin County were taken after the expiration of the respective 30 day periods, but within three months in each case. Since neither court below entertained the appeal to it from the action of the Board, but rather dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, it is arguable that these appeals are under the Act of 1897, <em>supra, </em>in which event they were timely brought. We think this reasoning is unsound, however, and that the 30 day period of both agency statutes applied. The appeals are thus untimely if brought pursuant to either Act No. 353 or Act No. 354.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

      <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>Normally <em>this </em>Court quashes an untimely appeal. In this case, however, we find overriding and unique considerations which convince us that we should not quash. As what has been said above makes clear, the essential issue both at the lower court level and on appeal was whether the Bowers’ complaint was within the purview of the Local Agency Law or of the Administrative Agency Law, or neither of them. The McKean County Court held that the Local Agency Law did not apply and appellant followed that court’s suggestion to seek relief in the Dauphin County Court, a procedure which was not completed until 67 days after the Mc-Kean County Court dismissal. As stated above, both appeals would have been timely had the Act of 1897, <em>supra, </em>been applicable, and, as indicated in footnote 15, it is not certain that that Act might not yet apply. Moreover, the appeals are not from a decision on the merits of Bowers’ dismissal, but are simply preliminary to getting a decision on the merits. Finally, as we have had recent occasion to point out, there has been understandable uncertainty in the profession as to the interrelationship of the several acts which implement Section 9, Article Y of the new Constitution and the relationship of those acts to the pre-existing statutes regulating appellate review. In several similar situations which have recently been before us under Act No. 351 of 1968, we have granted extensions of the 30 day appeal period to the Superior Court where petitions for allowance of appeal were erroneously filed with this Court.
