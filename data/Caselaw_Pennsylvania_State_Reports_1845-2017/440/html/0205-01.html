      <em>Coleman </em>reversed an Alabama murder conviction because of the lack of counsel at a defendant’s “preliminary hearing.” The Court found that proceeding to be a “critical stage” in the prosecution at which he was entitled to counsel as a matter of constitutional right. Under Alabama law, the accused was not required to plead or to advance any defenses at his preliminary hearing, and Alabama law prohibited the prosecution’s use of anything that occurred at the uncounseled hearing. The Court nevertheless discerned a substantial potential for prejudice flowing from the absence of counsel.</p>

Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial.
