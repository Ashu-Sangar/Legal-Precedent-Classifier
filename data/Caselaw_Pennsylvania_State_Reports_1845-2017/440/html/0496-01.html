As to this contention we could simply affirm on the basis of <em>Crosson. </em>However, since the proper jurisdiction of equity in tax disputes has recently been expanded as well as contracted in a trilogy of cases, perhaps a more thorough explanation of this development is in order. The first of these cases, <em>Lynch v. Owen J. Roberts Sch. Dist., </em><a href="/pa/430/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="430 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1915751" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0461-01">430 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="244 A.2d 1">244 A. 2d 1</a> (1968), considered the earlier case law in this area and concluded that, when a constitutional challenge to a tax resolution is pre<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>seated, equity has the jurisdiction and competency to consider both the constitutional and nonconstitutional challenges even though there exists a <em>specific </em>statutory remedy at law. Moreover, <em>Lynch </em>demonstrated that, once equity obtains jurisdiction by reason of the presence of the constitutional issue, it may invalidate the tax resolution on solely nonconstitutional grounds without ever considering the constitutional argument. <em>Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Indiana County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, </em><a href="/pa/438/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="438 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1929250" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0506-01">438 Pa. 506</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%2078" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="266 A.2d 78">266 A. 2d 78</a> (1970), actually restricted the broad doctrine of <em>Lynch </em>by requiring that the constitutional challenge affording jurisdiction to a court of equity must be “a substantial question of constitutionality (and not a mere allegation).” <a href="/pa/438/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="438 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1929250" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0506-01">438 Pa. at 508</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%2078" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="266 A.2d 78">266 A. 2d at 79</a>. Finally, <em>Crosson </em>limited <em>Lynch </em>by holding that, even the presence <em>of </em>a substantial question of constitutionality concerning the tax resolution, does not justify equity taking jurisdiction over <em>every </em>collateral, nonconstitutional attack on the assessment. The thrust of <em>Crosson </em>is that, if the nonconstitutional challenge to the assessment could not have been maintained in a separate action in equity on the assessment, it cannot be advanced in an attack on the tax resolution which was based on the assessment. As in <em>Crosson, </em>appellants’ instant contentions in this regard do not substantially question either the constitutionality of the assessment or that the Chief County Assessor lacked the power to make the assessments and, in addition, a statutory appeals route is available.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, a court of equity should not entertain these collateral attacks.</p>

    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[143,655,1151,765]]]'>In the court below appellants contended that, while the tax resolution contained no exemptions, it was the policy of the school district in the enforcement of the resolution to exclude persons under twenty-one or over sixty-five or earning less than $600 per year and that these <em>de facto </em>exemptions violated the Uniformity Clause of our Constitution and should be enjoined. In <em>Saulsbury v. Bethlehem, Steel Co., </em><a href="/pa/413/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="413 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1888552" data-case-paths="/pa/413/0316-01">413 Pa. 316</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=196%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="196 A.2d 664">196 A. 2d 664</a> (1964), we found an occupational privilege tax imposed solely on persons earning $600 or more violated the uniformity requirements.

    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.6",529,[143,1431,1150,763]],["BL_530.1",530,[189,329,1148,878]]]'>We have never decided the substantial constitutional question of whether persons over sixty-five may be released from liability from taxation nor do we need to decide it now.

Our case law involving the constitutionality of state taxation places a very heavy burden on those who seek to upset such taxation. <em>Prichard v. Willistown Township Sch.

We ascertain no reason to apply a different test in determining the validity of local municipal taxation. The record before us discloses that only one of twenty assessors testified that she excluded anyone—those under twenty-one only—another witness testified that the instruction complained of was given and eight other assessors did not state whether there was any such policy. Other evidence in this vein was without substance. The chancellor and the court en banc made no finding of fact that any such exclusionary instruction was given and our scrutiny of the record convinces us no failure to so find was justified by the evidence of record.
