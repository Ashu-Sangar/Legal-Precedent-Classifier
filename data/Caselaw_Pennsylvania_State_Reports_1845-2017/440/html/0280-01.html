Both Thelma Tompkins and Alma Arzoo in the appeal in the equity action from the decree rendering void the title of Ervin Hohensee in the land owned by Scientific in Lackawanna County not only made no effort to protect the interests of testator’s estate but adopted a position contrary to the best interests of the estate and its beneficiaries, particularly the minor, Euphemia Hohensee.

As the court below well stated in its adjudication: “The supporting role of Thelma Tompkins and Alma Arzoo, two of the co-executrices, in the effort of Ervin Hohensee to overthrow the Decree of the Court in Equity, relative to the disputed lands of Scientific Living, Inc., is in utter disregard of their fiduciary duty to the estate of the decedent.”</p>
