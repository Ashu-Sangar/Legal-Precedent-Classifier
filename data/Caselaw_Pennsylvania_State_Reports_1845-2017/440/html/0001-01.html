The presumption of sanity reflects a common sense view that a man is more likely than not to be sane; speaking as it does to the generality of cases, the presumption is entitled to no evidentiary or probative weight when it is rebutted in a particular case. Quite simply, I understand the presumption of sanity to be a product of procedural convenience, eliminating the issue of sanity from the trial of the case unless and until some attempt is made by the defendant to raise the issue and rebut the presumption.</p>

In cases like that now before us, some courts have found that the defendant’s burden is met by the production of “some” or “any” evidence; others have held that the burden of production is met only by evidence which is fairly preponderant or by evidence adequate to sustain a juror’s reasonable doubt as to the fact presumed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">1</a> In my view, it is most appropriate to require the defendant, if he would rebut the presumption, to produce competent evidence sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of the jury. Competent evidence may ultimately be found incredible by a jury, but credibility is of <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>course a fact issue which arises only after a case has been properly submitted to the jury. In the present case it is clear that the defendant’s evidence, consisting as it did of the unequivocal testimony of four well-qualified psychiatrists, was adequate to rebut the presumption of sanity regardless of the standard employed. Having produced competent testimony adequate to create a reasonable doubt as to his sanity, the defendant in my view met his burden of production, and the presumption of sanity, having been rebutted, disappeared from the case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">2</a>

I realize that our case law has placed upon the defendant the burden of establishing his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. This rule was accepted without question by the appellant in the case at bar, and the trial judge correctly so charged. Upon reflection, however, I see no reason why the Commonwealth should not have the same burden with regard to sanity, once that matter has been put in issue, as we have placed upon it as to all other facts necessary to support a guilty verdict. As has been noted by one leading authority, “. . . as to all these claims for exoneration [affirmative defenses such as insanity] their truth goes in final analysis to the guilt,—to the rightness of punishing the accused. Thus it seems inconsistent to demand as to some elements of guilt, such as an act of killing, that the jury be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and as to others, such as duress or capacity to know right from wrong, the jury may convict though they have such doubt. Ac<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>cordingly, the recent trend both in English and Amer-can decisions is to treat these so-called matters of defense as situations wherein the accused will usually have the first burden of producing evidence in order that the issue be raised and submitted to the jury, but at the close of the evidence the jury must be told that if they have a reasonable doubt of the fact on which the justification is based they must acquit.” McCormick, Evidence, at p. 684 (1954).</p>

Section 1.12(1) provides that each element of an offense is to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the innocence of the defendant being assumed absent such proof. Section 1.12(2) provides that an affirmative defense such as insanity need not be disproved “unless and until there is evidence supporting such defense.” Thus the Code places the burden of production upon the defendant, but that burden having been met, the burden of persuasion lies with the prosecution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">3</a>
