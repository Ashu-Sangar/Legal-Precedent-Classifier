Church), and as such subscribed to the doctrine, jurisdiction and theological control of the parent church.</p>

The deeds of conveyance contained substantially identical trust clauses, one of which follows: “In trust, that said premises shall be kept and maintained as a place of worship for the use of The Sawyer Church of the Evangelical United Brethren Church at Sawyer City, Pa., subject to the doctrines, laws, usages, and ministerial appointments of The Evangelical United Brethren Church as from time to time established, made and declared by the lawful authority of said Church, with the right to sell or encumber,' subject to the Discipline of the Evangelical United Brethren Church, and the laws of the State, Province, or Country,, and if said property be sold or encumbered, the proceeds of the sale or encumbrance shall be applied to the use of the aforesaid Church, subject, however, to the provisions of the laws of the Evangelical United Brethren Church relating to the sale and encumbrance of houses of worship and their premises <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>there being no obligation on the part of any purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money.”</p>
    <p id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[126,421,1149,597]]]'>At the annual conference of the E.U.B. Church in 1966 and in 1967, attended by ministers and lay representatives of each member church a majority of more than two-thirds voted approval of uniting or merging with the Methodist Church, another church organization of national dimension. This merger was later finalized at a uniting conference of the two organizations. Under the plan of merger, the new denomination was to be known as the United Methodist Church, which would thereafter exercise jurisdiction over all local churches of the two uniting national churches.</p>
    <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[124,1029,1151,486]]]'>A number of parishioners of Sawyer Church, its pastor and a majority of its trustees refused to recognize the merger or submit to the jurisdiction of the United Methodist Church. The property of Sawyer Church was seized by the individual defendants on behalf of the local congregation, and a pastor assigned by the United Methodist Church to serve Sawyer Church was denied recognition and access to the church property.</p>
    <p id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[124,1529,1150,433]]]'>The present action was instituted by the United Methodist Church through one of its corporate entities against the pastor and trustees of Sawyer Church to gain possession and control of the Sawyer Church property. After an extended hearing, the chancellor entered an adjudication and decree nisi in favor of the plaintiff. Exceptions thereto were later dismissed, and a final decree was entered. The defendants appealed.</p>

Church, and held its property in trust subject to the discipline of that church. And it has long been established in Pennsylvania that, when a church is organized and holds its property as a constituent <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>part of a hierarchically governed denomination, it cannot sever itself from such religious denomination without forfeiting its property to the parent denomination. See <em>Pilgrim Holiness Church v. Pilgrim Holiness Church of Athens Twp., </em><a href="/pa/436/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="436 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="1926015" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0239-01">436 Pa. 239</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=259%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="259 A.2d 870">259 A. 2d 870</a> (1969), and cases cited therein. However, the defendants-appellants contend that the E.U.B. Church has gone out of existence as a legal entity due to the merger and has also departed substantially from the faith and doctrine of the original denomination; hence, the local congregation “should be released from the trust contract with the denomination,” i.e., the E.U.B. Church. We cannot agree.</p>
