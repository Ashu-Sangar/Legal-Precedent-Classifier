At the subsequent hearing before the court <em>en banc </em>to determine his degree of guilt, appellant was adjudged guilty of murder in the second de<a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>gree and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 8 to 20 years. No appeal was taken from that judgment of sentence. In 1966 appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.8. §§1180-1 et seq.

    <p id="b628-4" data-blocks='[["BL_628.5",628,[213,705,1149,488]]]'>In his petition appellant alleged that his conviction had resulted from the introduction into evidence of a coerced confession and of a statement obtained from him when he was without the assistance of counsel at a time when such assistance was constitutionally required. He did hot allege, however, that his guilty plea had been unlawfully induced or that the existence of the allegedly coerced confession had been the primary motivation for his plea.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.6",628,[213,1205,1148,920]]]'>The law is well settled that a plea of guilty to a charge of murder generally is itself sufficient to sustain a conviction of murder in the second degree. <em>Commonwealth v.

As a corollary to this rule we have held that the evidentiary use of a confession, improperly obtained, at the degree of guilt hearing after acceptance of a guilty plea is constitutionally harmless error if the defendant is convicted only of second degree murder. <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/430/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="430 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="1915723" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0188-01">430 Pa. 188</a>, 190, <a href="/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="242 A.2d 266">242 A. 2d 266</a> (1968). Thus, even were we <em>to </em>assume that appellant’s confession was improperly obtained, we could not conclude that, his conviction had resulted from its evidentiary use.</p>

Neither in appellant’s petition nor in his counsel’s brief in the court below was any connection alleged between the confession and the plea. In appellant’s brief before this Court, the contention is made that the confession motivated the plea. However, “[t]he well established doctrine that appellate courts will not entertain arguments raised for the first time on appeal applies with equal force to appeals from collateral hearings such as this.
