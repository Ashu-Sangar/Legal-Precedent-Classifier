Thus, when an accused pleads guilty to an indictment charging him with murder, he admits that a murder has been committed and that he is the perpetrator thereof. “A plea of guilty to murder generally is sufficient of itself to sustain a conviction of murder in the second degree. Commonwealth ex rel. Bostic v. Cavell, <a href="/pa/424/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="424 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1904920" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0573-01">424 Pa. 573</a>, 576, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20662" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="227 A.2d 662">227 A. 2d 662</a>, 664 (1967)”. <em>Commonwealth v.

At the degree of guilt hearing, therefore, the Commonwealth had no burden of proving that Kern by his acts had committed a murder. The issue as to which proof was called for from the Commonwealth was the degree of the crime committed; on that issue the Commonwealth introduced evidence tending to show a serious beating inflicted upon the decedent by appellants in the course of committing a robbery. The evidence on this point was found sufficient by the trial court to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Kern’s admitted murder was murder in the first degree; its finding in this regard is adequately supported by the evidence and is not contested in this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus Kern’s present al<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>legation that the Commonwealth’s evidence was insufficient to establish that which his plea had already admitted presents no cognizable issue. It neither undermines the court’s finding of first degree nor does it indicate that Kern’s plea was involuntary, unknowing, or otherwise invalid. Any evidence of causation at the degree of guilt hearing was in fact surplusage, and any defect which there may have been in such evidence is not a ground for setting aside the judgment of sentence or for allowing a withdrawal of Kern’s plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

In that case, however, the defendant had <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>pleaded <em>not guilty, </em>and the challenge to the evidence relative to causation was in light of the Commonwealth’s burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The difference in the pleas is, of course, crucial, and renders <em>Radford </em>quite inapposite. See <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, supra, </em><a href="/pa/436/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="436 Pa. 423" data-case-ids="1926129" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0423-01">436 Pa. at 426, 427</a>.</p>

It is well established that a defendant convicted of second degree murder following a plea of guilty to murder generally may contest only the validity of his plea and the lawfulness of his sentence. Because those issues are fully cognizable in collateral proceedings, a denial of the defendant’s right to appeal is nonprejudicial and a petitioner’s allegation that his right of appeal was abridged is not, standing alone, a basis for relief.
