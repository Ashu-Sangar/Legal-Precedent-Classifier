However, the County Board, under the plan which it prepared, provided no indication that it had complied with the legislative standards, policies and remedies.

Thus, under the instant circumstances, appellee urges that it could not exercise its statutory right of appeal, because the County Board had not prepared a plan of organization suitable for appropriate review by the State Board in accordance with law. Absent the assigned bases for the County Board’s plan, the statutory procedure would be inadequate.</p>
