The allegations raised in those petitions were identical to those raised in the state court proceedings: (1) trial had been held in an improper court; (2) defendant had been without coun-, sel at his preliminary hearing; (3) trial counsel had been ineffective; (4) his conviction was the result of an involuntary confession; and (5) his request for a lawyer at the time he gave his confession had been improperly refused. The federal district courts have consistently denied Meholchick the relief he has sought, either on the merits or because of waiver. Their decisions have been affirmed on appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. E.g., <em>United States ex rel. Meholchick v.

The sole question raised on appeal is whether the hearing court erred in not affording Meholchick a hearing. Appellant alleged various points of error, but the trial court dismissed because the petition did not contain sufficient facts which, if proven, would entitle him to relief. The hearing Court, however, gave appellant an opportunity to amend his petition, so that he could include the necessary facts. Act of January 25,1966, P. L.
