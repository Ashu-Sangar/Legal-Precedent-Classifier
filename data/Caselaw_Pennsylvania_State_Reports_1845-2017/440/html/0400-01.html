On February 8, 1966, he was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree and robbery. Subsequently, the trial court granted a new trial. At the retrial, the Commonwealth proceeded on the murder indictment only, and Williams was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. A new trial motion was refused, and a prison sentence was imposed. This appeal followed.</p>

At trial, the Commonwealth’s case connecting Williams with the crime depended almost entirely on the testimony of Eobert Mathis, an eyewitness, who was a customer in the store at ¡the time. Williams did not testify personally, but presented the testimony of several witnesses to establish an alibi defense.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[198,807,1148,1085]]]'>Immediately after the occurrence, Mathis provided the police with a description of the killer’s approximate height and weight. He also described the felon as wearing a cap and a long trench coat. In the days immediately following, Mathis was shown “thousands” of “mug shots” by the police, but failed to identify any of those portrayed. On January 18,1965, he was shown “12 to 15” photographs and selected one of Williams as the man guilty of the crime. The photographs exhibited to Mathis on this date included “mug shots” of different individuals and a “polaroid” photograph of Williams wearing a cap and a long trench coat. As a result of this identification, Williams was taken into police custody, and on January 19th a line-up was conducted in police headquarters. The line-up included Williams wearing a long trench coat and a cap, and four other black males with varied dress. Mathis viewed the line-up, and again picked out Williams as the perpetrator of the crime. During these proceedings, Williams did not have counsel.</p>

A hearing followed and the court refused to suppress the incriminating utterances. A determination of whether or not the <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>testimony concerning the pretrial identification should be suppressed was reserved for consideration and decision at trial.</p>

The district attorney then commenced to inquire of Mathis about his pretrial identification, and counsel for Williams requested a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of this particular testimony. Such a hearing was denied, and the testimony was received over objection. The court’s denial of the requested hearing is assigned as error.</p>
    <p id="b431-4" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[160,1093,1149,525]]]'>The present trial commenced on July 3, 1968, and concluded on July 16th.

Such a requirement was incorporated in Rule No. 323 by Amendment, effective February 3, 1969. Hence, no transgression of our then procedural rules occurred. Nor are we persuaded that constitutional due process was violated.</p>

On the day that Mathis picked out defendant’s picture, he had been shown a group of between fifteen to eighteen pictures, all but three of which were mug shots, which have a head-on and a profile view of the suspect.

Ct. 824</a> (1967).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Among the facts that I consider im<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>portant in this respect are the following: Mathis had an opportunity to observe the unmasked culprit at close tange for over two minutes in a lighted room during the daytime at the time of the crime; Mathis was able to give the police an accurate enough description of the perpetrator right after the crime so that an artist’s composite sketch was made which aided the police in first apprehending the defendant for questioning; Mathis was always positive about Ms identification; the police made no statements to Mathis alleging that Williams was their prime suspect; and defendant’s counsel conducted an extremely thorough cross-examination of all of the Commonwealth’s witnesses who were in any way involved with the lineup procedure. For these reasons, I find that the unconstitutional lineup was on this record harmless error.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[204,1201,1151,920]]]'>Second, defendant’s counsel failed to object to any of the three separate in-court identifications of defendant by Mathis, all of which occurred prior to <em>any </em>of the challenged lineup testimony. Possibly defendant’s counsel would argue that he was waiting for the lineup testimony ito make his objections. However, if defendant is making an issue of mistaken identification, he must object to the in-court identifications as well, alleging that they are tainted by the complained of pre-trial confrontation. The efficient and proper administration of justice dictates that this Court not consider issues on appeal which were not raised at trial when the trial court could have corrected the error had it been brought to that court’s attention.
