One action, at No. 361 January Term, 1970, concerns the affairs of Long’s Dairies, Inc. The other, at No. 362 January Term, 1970, concerns the affairs of Laurel Co-operative, an Agricultural Association.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Laurel appellants filed preliminary objections alleging that quo warranto rather than a complaint, in equity was the proper remedy and that the jurisdiction for such was in Blair County alone and secondly that there was no venue in Clearfield County because there had been no service on any defendant within that county. The court below felt the issues should not be decided upon the pleadings alone and that a hearing should be held. It therefore entered two orders dismissing the prelimin<a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>ary objections without prejudice and directing the filing of answers within twenty days.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[217,444,1146,648]]]'>The background of the Long’s Dairy dispute is as follows. As a result of a dispute between shareholders a special board of directors was created on December 15, 1965 to serve for a three year term in order to resolve the difficulties. This attempt was unsuccessful, and the board expired on December 15, 1968. After that there was a dispute as to how the corporation would be run, and on February 14, 1969 a meeting was held at which thirty-one out of the forty-one shareholders were represented. At this meeting the Long’s appellees were chosen as directors; thereafter they attempted to take control of the corporation’s affairs.</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.6",546,[217,1101,1147,483]]]'>As to Laurel Co-operative, no directors had been elected in 1966, 1967 and 1968, and twenty members undertook to organize a special meeting early in 1969. That meeting was held on March 17, 1969, and the twenty-seven members present unanimously elected the Laurel appellees directors. When the Laurel appellees attempted to take control of the co-operative, they met opposition from the Laurel appellants who were its manager and accountant.</p>

L. 23, §1, 12 P.S. §672. In their preliminary objections both sets of appellants alleged that because this action was a test of title to corporate office the proper venue was Blair County rather than Olear<a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>field County. We have recently held that objections to venue are jurisdictional and orders relating thereto are appealable under the Act- of 1925. <em>Caplan v.

In the Long’s Dairies complaint paragraph two states, “The Defendants are all pretenders to the offices and directorships of said Corporation and have falsely declared themselves to be entitled not only to occupy the titles of directors and officers but to operate and manage the entire business. . . .” Paragraphs 5-15 describe the election, and paragraph eighteen states, “When Defendants learned of this (the election and appellees’ attempts to have financial institutions recognize them as the legitimate board) they contacted one Leo Mullen, an attorney, who had at one time represented plaintiffs in their efforts to seek their proper place in the Corporation <em>much in the manner of what they are presently doing. . . .” </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Paragraphs 21-25 repeat appellees’ contention that they are the rightful officers and directors and that appellants are pretenders who are refusing to relinquish control. Paragraphs 26-30 do allege improper conduct on the part of the appellants in the management of Long’s, but this is merely incidental to the question of the validity of the election which is the basis of appellees’ claim. <em>Bedford Springs Co. v.
