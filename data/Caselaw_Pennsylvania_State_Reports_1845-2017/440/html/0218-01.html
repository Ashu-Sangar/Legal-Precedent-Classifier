Thus, if there is any issue of fact which is unresolved, no motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted. Analogous to the motion for a judgment on the pleadings is the motion for summary judgment and in connection with the latter procedure, we recently stated: “The applicability and effect of the parol evidence rule are properly considered in the context of a motion for summary judgment. [Citations omitted.] There is no logical reason for forcing the parties to go to trial when there could be no genuine issue as to a material fact, regardless of the reasons for the lack of such issues. Of course, if there are factual issues bearing on the applicability of the parol evidence rule or other genuine issues as to material facts, then the case ought properly proceed to trial.” <em>Rose v.

(394 Pa. at 233). . . . Before examining the trial testimony and pleadings to ascertain if, <em>in fact, </em>such an <em>admission </em>exists, it must be noted thalt the burden was upon [the appellees here] to show that [the Chairman] has <em>admitted </em>that the [written agreement] did not express the entire agreement between the parties and such proof must be by ‘clear, precise and convincing’ evidence: Universal Film Exchanges, Inc. v.
