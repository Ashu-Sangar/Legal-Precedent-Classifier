January 5, 1951, appellant was found guilty of first degree murder after a trial by jury at which he was represented by counsel. A sentence of life imprisonment was imposed in accordance with the verdict. In the decade following appellant’s conviction he filed numerous post-conviction petitions, the details of which are summarized in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Corbin v. Myers, </em><a href="/citations/?q=76%20York%2030" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="76 York 30">76 York 30</a> (1961).</p>
    <p id="b94-5" data-blocks='[["BL_94.7",94,[195,797,1148,875]]]'>On June 7, 1967, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. §1180-1 et seq. (the Act), alleging several constitutional grounds for relief, but stating facts which supported only the claim that appellant had been denied the right to counsel to assist in an appeal from his judgment of sentence. Counsel was appointed for the purpose of the post-conviction proceeding and an evidentiary hearing was held solely on the issue of whether defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel to perfect on appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The hearing court granted appellant permission to appeal <em>nunc pro tuno. </em>A direct appeal to this Court followed, and the judgment of sentence was affirmed. <em>Commonwealth v.

The basis for relief set forth in that petition was that the confession of appellant’s codefendant, which implicated the appellant in the murder, was made when the codefendant did not have the benefit of counsel. The only issue presented to this Court is whether the appellant has waived the right to litigate the issue presented by his latest petition. We find that he has.</p>
