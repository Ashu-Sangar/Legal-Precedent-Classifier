    <p id="b207-12" data-blocks='[["BL_207.15",207,[156,1632,1150,590]]]'>A pre-trial deposition of Wirth was taken subject to the express stipulation, “. . . all objections except as to the form of the question shall be reserved to the time of trial.” During the taking of the deposition, opposing counsel asked, “Do you feel you were traveling at an excessive rate of speed in view of the nature of the road, now that you look back?” In reliance on the stipulation, no objection to the improper nature of the answer sought to be elicited by that question was made by counsel for Wirth. Wirth then answered, “I would say a little bit.”</p>
    <p id="b207-13" data-blocks='[["BL_207.16",207,[160,2235,1146,99]],["BL_208.1",208,[197,316,1148,649]]]'>During cross-examination of Wirth at trial, he was asked, “Now, as you have reflected upon that kind of <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>road, and the speed to [sic] which you were going, Mr. Wirth, would you tell us whether or not the speed at which you were going just prior to the accident, was or was not excessive?” Objection to this question on the ground that it called for a conclusion which only the trier of fact could make was sustained. Counsel for Starner then requested a side-bar conference during which he stated that, in the event of a negative answer by Wirth, he proposed to read into evidence Wirth’s admission in the pre-trial deposition that his speed was a little bit excessive. The objection by Wirth’s counsel was again sustained and the evidence was excluded.</p>

Whatever may be the content of the answer, the court must rule without the answer in mind.

      <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>In resolving this ultimate issue we must first decide if the opinion evidence rule, which excludes the opinion of third-party witnesses, applies with equal force to an adverse parity. There can be no doubt that had Width’s counsel asked this question, an objection based on the opinion evidence rule would clearly be sustained. An examination of the theories underlying this rule of evidence reveals the correct reason to be that such testimony is superfluous: “witnesses having <em>no special </em>skill, who have had <em>personal observation </em>of the matter in hand, may, as a result of their personal observation, have drawn inferences or made interpretations which the tribunal could equally well make from the same data of personal observation, if laid before them; and thus if it is possible to detail these data fully for the tribunal, the witness’ own inferences are superfluous.” VII Wigmore on Evidence §1918, at 13 (3d. ed. 1940). (Emphasis original.) The soundness of this theory has been recognized by this Court. <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Phila</em>delphia, <a href="/pa/357/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="357 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="472073" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0101-01">357 Pa. 101</a>, 114-15, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20250" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="53 A.2d 250">53 A. 2d 250</a>, 256 (1947). There can be ho doubt that this policy would make no distinction between witnesses or parties, adverse or otherwise nor would any differentiations be warranted by any of the erroneous theories sometimes advanced for the opinion evidence rule. VII Wigmore on Evidence, §§1919-22 (3d ed. 1940). The circumstances of the accident—several estimates of speed, the condition of the road, the time of day, etc.—were fully detailed to the jury which was then in a position to decide if the speed was “excessive”. Any other testimony in this regard would be superfluous, and, hence, excludable under the opinion evidence rule.</p>

Read together, Pa. R. C. P. <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>4020(c) and 4016(b) provide that, while an objection may be made at trial to the introduction of any part of a deposition in the same manner as if the deponent were then testifying, the failure to object during the 'taking of the deposition will preclude an objection at trial if “the ground of the objection is one which was known to the objecting party and which might have been obviated or removed if made” at the time of the deposition. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the reason for the objection could have been removed if made at the time of the taking of this deposition, we believe the stipulation is controlling and gives full effect to the timely objection at trial. The total weight accorded by courts to private agreements between counsel is too well established to be doubted. Therefore, we hold that the objection at trial to the proffered opinion was not only proper but timely. It then follows that the exclusion of the admission was correct and the order granting a new trial based solely on the ground of this “improper” exclusion should be reversed.</p>

While this argument was advanced below, it was dismissed by the trial judge.
