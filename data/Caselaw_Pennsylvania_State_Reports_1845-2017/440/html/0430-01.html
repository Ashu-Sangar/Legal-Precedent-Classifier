(corporate appellant) and her husband, Samuel Meyers, executed a judgment note in the face amount of $10,000, in favor of the appellee, Vincent Emperee, promising payment one day after date. At the time of the execution of the note, the other two directors of corporate appellant were Stephen J. Harris, Esquire and Louis Simon, who were also treasurer and secretary, respectively, and Who were nominees of Tavern Lending Corporation (T.L.C.), a creditor of corporate appellant.</p>
    <p id="b461-10" data-blocks='[["BL_461.17",461,[142,1833,1149,374]]]'>Corporate appellant was formed to purchase and operate a restaurant and bar. Since Tris Meyers had no experience in such a business and her husband was retired, the appellee was employed to be the manager and bartender.
