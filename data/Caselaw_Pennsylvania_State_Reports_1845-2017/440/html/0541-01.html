This identical question was raised by the appellant in a habeas corpus action filed in 1964, and after an evidentiary hearing, the trial court dismissed the action based on its finding that the evidence did not support the allegation that the confession was coerced. The appellant was represented by counsel in this action and did not appeal from the court’s order, and there is no allegation in the present proceedings that the failure to appeal was due to any <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>lack of knowledge or understanding on the part of the appellant as to Ms appeal rights. Under such circumstances, the issue has been finally litigated. See <em>Commonwealth v.
