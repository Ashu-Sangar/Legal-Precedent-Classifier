Following the denial of a motion for a new trial, sentence was imposed in accordance with the jury’s verdict. This appeal was then filed.</p>

About 3:30 a.m. on April 5th, he made an incriminating statement which was record<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>ed on a typewriter. The incriminating statement occurred during police questioning while Davis was without the assistance of legal counsel, although such counsel had previously been retained and the police were aware of this fact. A pretrial motion to suppress this evidence was denied, and it was admitted at trial over objection.</p>
