Suit was instituted against appellee, Philadelphia Coca Cola Bottling Company, on November 8, 1968. On February 14, 1969, appellant filed interrogatories<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> on appellee, the interrogatories noting that an answer was required to be filed within twenty days. See Pa. R. C. P. 4006. On April 11, 1969, appellant, not having yet received appellee’s answers, wrote a letter to counsel for appellee requesting the answers and advising appellee that a motion for <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>sanctions would be filed if tbe answers were not submitted by April 18.

    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.4",194,[201,481,1161,586]]]'>On May 20 the court, per Judge Barbieri, ordered appellee to file answers within thirty days. The order further provided that if the answers were not filed witMn that time, appellant could, by filing a praecipe, enter judgment against appellant. On June 16, four days before the answers were due, counsel for appellant and appellee engaged in a telephone conversation in which, among other things, appellant again requested the answers. Counsel for appellee stated that the in-' terrogatories were out to the client for answer. No answers were filed on the June 20 deadline.</p>

On July 8 counsel for appellant attempted to contact counsel for appellee by telephone; the latter never returned the call.

Nor is this a case where appellant made a “studied attempt” to obtain a default judgment, see <em>Fox v. Mellon, </em>supra. Appellant carefully, and explicitly, preserved his rights. He certainly cannot be foreclosed from exercising them simply because he was courteous and extended the time limits. See <em>Kramer v.
