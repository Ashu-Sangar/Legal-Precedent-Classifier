      <em>On </em>November 15, 1966, tbe appellant, Vernon C. Marsh, in the presence of self-retained counsel, entered a general plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with the murder of Bruno C. Roehrl. After a hearing before a three-judge court, he was adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, and sentenced to imprisonment for life. No appeal from the judgment was then filed.</p>

The United States Supreme Court there held that a defendant must demonstrate <em>all </em>of the following to successfully collaterally attack a plea of guilty on such grounds: (1) an involuntary pretrial confession (or presumably any other constitutionally infirm incriminating evidence); (2) that the guilty plea was primarily motivated by such evidence; and, (3) that defendant was incompetently advised by counsel to plead guilty, in the circumstances, rather than stand trial. In fact, the Court ruled that a defendant is not even entitled to a hearing in the federal courts on the mere allegation that his otherwise valid guilty plea was primarily motivated by an involuntary pretrial confession. And this is so even in those instances where there is an absence of proof other than the evidence of questionable evidentiary use.</p>
    <p id="b621-3" data-blocks='[["BL_621.4",621,[134,1275,1156,596]]]'>As the Court pointed out, conviction after a plea of guilty is based not on the evidence in the hands of the prosecution, which may include a pretrial confession, but rather upon the defendant’s own admission in open court that he committed the crime. The key question is whether the defendant had the opportunity to make a reasonable choice. The existence of an involuntary confession does not, in itself, demonstrate that the defendant did not make a reasonable choice, and thus it cannot establish, in itself, that the plea was not intelligently and knowingly entered.</p>

He does not maintain nor does the record demonstrate that his counsel’s advice to plead guilty was incompetent. Hence his attack on the validity of the plea must fail, and the lower court correctly rejected this challenge.</p>

Ed. 2d 694</a> (1966), “. . . it is necessary to warn [the accused] not only that he has the right to consult with an attorney, but also that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. Without this additional warning, the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one.”</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[211,906,1148,645]]]'>In the present case, as the opinion of the Court indicates, the police officer testified without contradiction that the appellant “was told that he had the right to an attorney and that if he could not afford one, one would be obtained for him.” I am unable to see wherein this statement does not comport with the warning prescribed by <em>Miranda. </em>Appellant argues that the adjective “free” was not used in this warning in connection with the word “lawyer”, but there is no requirement either by the United States Supreme Court or in our own prior decisions that the word “free” must be used in this connection.</p>
