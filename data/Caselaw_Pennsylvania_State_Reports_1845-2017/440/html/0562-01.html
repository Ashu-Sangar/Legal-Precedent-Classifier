The case was tried nonjury, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant-city. Subsequently, exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, and a final judgment entered. The University Club appeals.</p>

    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[206,661,1148,700]]]'>The appellant is a nonprofit corporation operating as a private social club, with a membership of over two thousand. The facilities are located on University Place in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Adjacent to its clubhouse the Club has provided an uncovered parking lot for seventy cars which only members are allowed to utilize. A flat rate of eighty-five cents is currently assessed every time a member parks his car in the lot. This rate is comparable to short-term parking rates in the area but is less than all-day parking rates in the Oakland section. The fee is not immediately collected; instead the amount is added to the member’s bill.</p>
    <p id="b592-6" data-blocks='[["BL_592.7",592,[205,1380,1148,870]]]'>In 1962 the city of Pittsburgh levied a parking tax of 10% on the gross receipts with respect to transactions involving the parking of motor vehicles at commercial parking places. The legislation, Ordinance No. 434 of 1962, subsequently re-enacted, imposes the tax on “all transactions of each operator with respect to each commercial parking place . . . .” Transaction is defined as “the parking or storing of a motor vehicle at a commercial parking place for a consideration.” “Commercial parking place” is defined as “any place within the City, whether wholly or partially enclosed or open, at which motor vehicles are parked or stored for any period of time in return for a consideration . . .” The only enumerated exceptions are parking lots operated in connection with residences, apartments, hotels, and trailer courts.</p>

It is urged that sinee the Club’s lot is closed to the general public and is not operated at a profit, it cannot be said the Club is engaging in commercial parking transactions and therefore the ordinance is not applicable to it.</p>

    <p id="b593-5" data-blocks='[["BL_593.6",593,[119,931,1152,819]]]'>That the City had the power to tax the appellant in the manner in which it did we think is evident from The Local Tax Enabling Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, re-enacted and clarified by Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, 53 P.S. §6902 (1970 Supp.) (The Tax Anything Act). The act conferred upon political subdivisions the power to levy taxes upon all subjects of taxation which the Commonwealth has the power to tax but which it has not so exercised. Section 2(7) of the 1965 act contains the only restriction on taxing private social organizations: “Such local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act: (7) to levy, assess or collect a tax on membership in or membership dues, fees or assessment of charitable, religious, beneficial or non-profit organizations . . . .”</p>
