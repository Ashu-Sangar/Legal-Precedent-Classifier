    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[158,619,1152,644]]]'>In 1946 appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally. Following a degree of guilt hearing, he was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death, a sentence which was later commuted to life imprisonment. No appeal was taken. In 1965 appellant filed a habeas corpus petition, in which he alleged that his confession was elicited at a critical stage in the proceedings, but without the presence of counsel, and hence its admission into evidence at the degree of guilt hearing constituted error. The hearing court found against appellant, the petition was dismissed, and an appeal taken.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.8",515,[154,1286,1152,483]]]'>In 1968 appellant filed a PCHA petition, alleging that the confession was obtained unconstitutionally through physical force, that this confession primarily motivated his guilty plea, and hence the plea was invalid, and that he was denied his right of appeal.

The evidence shows that immediately after appellant had his preliminary hearing the police kept him in their custody and interrogated him, securing his confession, rather than returning him to the city prison to which the magistrate had committed him. Since this interrogation occurred <em>after </em>the preliminary hearing, petitioner urges that it therefore constituted a critical stage in the proceedings, and that the <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>Sixth Amendment required the presence of counsel.

    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[188,731,1148,767]]]'>Appellant’s contention has now been answered by the Third Circuit in <em>United States ex rel. Dickerson v.

J., Fkeedman and Adams, JJ., dissenting). There the majority of the court held that a defendant, interrogated <em>after </em>his preliminary hearing, and pursuant to an ex parte bring-up order, “stood in the same legal shoes as did the defendant in Massiah,” <a href="/f2d/430/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="430 F.2d 462" data-case-ids="2231897" data-case-paths="/f2d/430/0462-01">id. at 467</a>, and hence his interrogation did constitute a critical stage requiring counsel. <em>Massiah’s </em>protection, however, is not to be retroactively applied, so that Dickerson’s confession was therefore properly utilized. See <em>United States ex rel. Allison v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/f2d/418/0332-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="418 F.2d 332" data-case-ids="2166142" data-case-paths="/f2d/418/0332-01">418 F. 2d 332</a> (3d Cir. 1969).</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[190,1506,1148,487]]]'>Although appellant in the instant case did not even have the protection of an ex parte bring-up order, the principles enunciated by the majority of the Third Circuit in <em>Dickerson </em>are still applicable. Appellant’s interrogation held after his preliminary hearing was a critical stage, but the confession cannot be attacked because it was obtained before the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Massiah. </em>Hence appellant’s claim for relief on this ground must be rejected.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[189,2005,1149,321]],["BL_517.1",517,[118,347,1149,211]]]'>Appellant’s next claim centers around his contention that his confession was physically coerced. Appellant testified at the PCHA hearing that the police secured his confession by beating him with a rubber hose; his mother testified that when she went to see him at the police station appellant told her about this <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>beating. Trial counsel also testified that he had investigated the incident, but had decided not to press the matter. No testimony was presented at the PCHA hearing to contradict appellant’s.</p>
    <p id="b517-3" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[113,570,1153,712]]]'>The burden of proof in this collateral proceeding, however, is upon the petitioner, see <em>Commonwealth v. McBride, </em><a href="/pa/440/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="440 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1932320" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0081-01">440 Pa. 81</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20737" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="269 A.2d 737">269 A. 2d 737</a> (1970), and the hearing court chose to disbelieve his testimony. We are unable to find an abuse of discretion in this finding, particularly in light of the fact that appellant waited so long before asserting it, and so the finding-must be affirmed. Likewise we must sustain the hearing court’s finding that the plea was knowingly and intelligently entered, a finding not vigorously disputed in this appeal. Further, since the confession has not been shown to have been improperly obtained, we need not consider whether it primarily motivated the plea.</p>

Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder after a plea of guilty to murder generally, and hence the denial of his right to appeal would be prejudicial, there being the possibility of non-constitutional errors in his degree of guilt hearing. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Zaffina, </em><a href="/pa/432/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="432 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="1919706" data-case-paths="/pa/432/0435-01">432 Pa. 435</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=248%20A.2d%205" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="248 A.2d 5">248 A. 2d 5</a> (1968) ; cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

This claim was raised in appellant’s petition, appellant testified at the PCHA hearing that he was not informed of his right to appeal, and one of appellant’s trial counsel testified that he did not think he mentioned anything about it. Nevertheless, the hearing court made no finding on this point. While normally we would remand for a further hearing, the record of appellant’s original trial is silent on the question whether he was informed of his right to appeal, or of his right to free <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>counsel on appeal. Thus the burden of proof on this issue rested with the Commonwealth. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v.

Dickerson v. Rundle, </em>supra, in which he notes that the majority’s conclusion in <em>Dickerson </em>is inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court’s recent decision in <em>Coleman v. Alabama, </em><a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">399 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">90 S. Ct. 1999</a> (1970). There the Supreme Court held that an ac<a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>cused must have counsel “ ‘at any stage of the prosecution, formal or informal, <em>m court or out.’ </em>” <a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">Id. at 7</a>, <a href="/us/399/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="399 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167869" data-case-paths="/us/399/0001-01">90 S. Ct. at 2002</a> (emphasis added). This again supports my view that once the accused is held for the grand jury, the prosecution has commenced, and the accused is consequently entitled to the assistance of counsel at every stage thereafter. In the instant case, as in <em>Dickerson, </em>the accused was prejudiced by the denial of counsel at a later stage, and under <em>Coleman, </em>relief must therefore be granted. See <em>United States ex rel. Dickerson v. Rundle, </em><a href="/f2d/430/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="430 F.2d 462" data-case-ids="2231897" data-case-paths="/f2d/430/0462-01">430 F. 2d 462</a>, 472 (Adams, J., dissenting).</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[192,1014,1148,590]]]'>Accordingly, with all deference to a majority of the Third Circuit, it is my view that the above United States Supreme Court decisions require us to give appellant relief. Certainly, I might add, there is nothing in either federal or state law which compels us to follow <em>Dickerson, </em>a four-to-three decision of the Third Circuit, and, in my judgment, erroneously deny to appellant the relief to which he is entitled. Hence I would grant appellant a new degree of guilt hearing, free of the taint of the unconstitutionally obtained confession.</p>
