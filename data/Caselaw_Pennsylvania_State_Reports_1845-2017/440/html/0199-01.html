Ct. 1458</a> (1970). And, of course, if this is true, the plea and conviction should be set aside because for a plea to be valid, it must not only be the free and voluntary act of the maker, but it must also be intelligently and knowingly entered. <em>Commonwealth v.

First, he says that when he plead guilty he thought he was merely admitting he fired the shot which caused the victim’s death, and that he would be given the opportunity of showing the trial court that he shot in self-defense and was not criminally responsible. Secondly, he says his testimony at the plea proceedings indicated he acted in self-defense and, therefore, the court erred in not rejecting his guilty plea after hearing this testimony.</p>

In other words, a defendant should not be allowed to plead “guilty” from one side of his mouth and “not guilty” from the other.

Shortly thereafter, Bobby Delaney, another patron in the bar, told him “you know you don’t supposed to be up here” and suddenly hit him in the jaw. Since he didn’t wish further trouble, he left the establishment, but Wright, Delaney and others followed him outside. Delaney then challenged him to a fight and, in the physical combat that ensued, Roundtree knocked Delaney down. Wright then secured a banister post from a nearby porch and started hitting Round-tree over the head. Billy Redmond followed suit with something he broke off from a nearby motor vehicle, and, Delaney, regaining his feet, started assaulting him with a “bucket”. Roundtree broke away and started to run when he saw a man in the crowd whom he didn’t know “going to his belt for something . . . which is shining.” He wrested a gun from this man’s grasp and ran “about 30 or 40 yards,” but his attackers, after pursuing him for “10 or 15 feet,” abandoned the chase. Moreover, when Delaney, Wright and the others observed the gun in his hand, they fled from the scene in all directions but Roundtree noticed two re-entering the bar. He then turned around and also re-entered the bar. There he saw Alfred Washington sitting on a stool and when he started to get up, Roundtree “punched him.” When Washington straightened up and started towards him, Roundtree fired a shot from the gun, and when Washington kept coming he fired two more shots (two shots entered Washington’s body <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>and caused Ms immediate death). As he started to leave the bar, Roundtree noticed another patron start up from a stool, and thinking he was trying to stop his exit, Roundtree hit tMs individual in the face with the gun.</p>

Before the degree of guilt could be adjudicated, the true facts had to be found and in so doing, the court had not only the right, but the duty to weigh and consider all of the testimony, that of the Commonwealth as well as the defendant.
