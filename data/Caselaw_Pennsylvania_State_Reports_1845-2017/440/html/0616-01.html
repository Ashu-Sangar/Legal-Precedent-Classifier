Following his death, this will was duly probated by his youngest child, Charles Edward Treitinger, who was named executor. Testator gave all real property owned by him at his death and all his household goods and furnishings to his daughter-in-law, Imelda Marie Treitinger, the wife of his youngest child Charles, who (with their children) lived with testator at his home. His real estate was inventoried at $20,000, although one of his sons testified that it was worth approximately $100,-000. Testator then bequeathed the rest of his estate to his six children in equal shares, and directed that his death taxes be paid out of his residuary estate. His personal estate was inventoried at $18,770. An appeal from probate was filed by five of his children, alleging that (1) at the time of the execution of the will their father lacked testamentary capacity, and (2) the will was invalid because not properly executed, and (3) the will had been procured by Imelda’s undue influence. Upon contestants’ petition, the Orphans’ Court Judge impaneled a jury to hear the case. The jury, after hearing the evidence, found (1) that the testator was of sound mind and possessed testamentary capacity, and (2) that the signature was in fact that of the testator, but (3) that the writing (the probated will) was procured by undue influence by Imelda. The Court agreed with the first two findings, but disagreed with the third. In spite of the jury’s finding of undue influence by Imelda, the Orphans’ Court Judge—as is his power, since a jury’s verdict is advisory only, see <em>Duross Will, </em><a href="/pa/395/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="395 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1282767" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0492-01">395 Pa. 492</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20710" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A.2d 710">150 A. 2d 710</a>, infra—granted proponents’ (appellees’) motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and entered a Decree dismissing the appeal from <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>probate.

Charles and his wife, Imelda, came to live with his father and mother shortly after they were married in 1950. Testator’s other children had left their parental home. A few years after Charles and Imelda moved into his parents’ home, testator’s wife was unable to perform the household duties and Imelda assumed the responsibility of caring for the family and took over all the household duties. Testator’s wife died in 1956 and thereafter Imelda continued to attend to all the household duties and soon thereafter commenced to look after the testator when his blindness increased and restricted his ability to care for himself. She did all the cooking for the testator, and her husband and their children, and took care of the house. As the testator got older, he became more dependent upon Imelda and her care, and later authorized Imelda to sign checks on his bank account in order to pay the expenses of maintaining his home. On November 1, 1966, testator was admitted to the hospital on his doctor’s orders, where he subsequently died on December 19, 1966.</p>

Michalski, and asked him to visit his father to discuss the preparation of his will. Michalski, who had never previously represented the testator, called upon him at his home and, in the presence of Charles and Imelda, obtained from Joseph Treitinger his wishes for his will. On October 28, 1966, Attorney Michalski, accompanied by his brother Edward, returned to the testator’s home with the proposed will which he had prepared. This challenged will was <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>read to the testator by Michalski in the presence of his brother Edward, and Florence A.

Testator then signed his name on the last page, very slantingly to the left of the line normally used for signing a will, and also made his mark by an “X” on the signature line.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">*</a> These signings were witnessed by Michalski and by his brother Edward, and by Florence A. Watkins, who signed their names as subscribing witnesses. Their testimony supporting the will will be discussed hereinafter.

Suffice it to say that in reviewing the record and the actions and rulings of the hearing Judge, in light of all the evidence and the pertinent legal principles, we find (1) that the findings by the Chancellor, which were approved by the Court en banc, were based upon legally competent and sufficiently convincing evidence, and (2) that there was no error of law or abuse of discretion.</p>
