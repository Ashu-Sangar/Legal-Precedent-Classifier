There are two aspects to this “factor” which must be weighed in deciding whether the fiduciary may defend against a surcharge attempt on the basis of reliance upon the advice of counsel. The initial choice of counsel must have been prudent under all the circumstances then existing, and the subsequent decision to rely upon this counsel must also have been a reasonably wise and prudent choice. <em>Vandergrift </em>Estate, <em>id. </em>at 37-38, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.2d%20432" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="177 A.2d 432">177 A. 2d at 443</a>; <em>Stirling’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/342/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="342 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1206951" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0497-01">342 Pa. 497</a>, 503-04, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.2d%2072" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="21 A.2d 72">21 A. 2d 72</a>, 75-78 (1941) (and cases cited therein). <em>See generally Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>§ 225 (1959) ; Scott on Trusts § 201 (1939).</p>

Adair lacked the necessary experience to do the work himself, and Rosenbaum had been practicing law for thirty-five years, had a Treasury card, and was thoroughly familiar with federal estate tax regulations. In addition, Rosenbaum had prepared the federal estate tax return for Adair in another matter, and had done a completely adequate job.

Both men should have been aware of, or, at least, should have taken steps toward ascertaining <em>when </em>the federal estate tax was due. Even though Adair was inexperienced in fiduciary estate tax matters and Kunst was a layman unversed in the law, it was their duty as executors of the estate to ascertain the crucial date when the return should have been filed. The record shows that neither Adair nor Kunst made any effort to ascertain such date. A prudent man may not have the technical knowledge or skill to prepare an estate tax return or even an income tax return, and so would properly rely on one more knowledgeable. But a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs would certainly know that there is <em>a time when a tax return must he made and a time when a tax is due and payable, </em>and, if he did not know what those times were, he would find out. No one files his own death tax returns, but the majority of us file other tax returns of one sort or another. What “prudent man” is there who does not know that April 15 is the normal date by which individual federal income tax returns must be filed and the tax paid? We have difficulty in comprehending how, in this tax conscious age, an executor of an estate can with impunity be or remain ignorant of the <em>time </em>for filing tax returns or paying the taxes in the estate he is managing. The need to schedule the payment of bills, to plan for advance and final distribu<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>tions, to do what is necessary to meet cash requirements by sales of assets or otherwise, to prepare for the time a final account can be filed and an estate can be wound up,—indeed all the principal aspects of an executor’s job—are related in a significant way to the time for the payment of taxes, be they state or federal or both, and to some approximation of the amounts thereof.</p>

The matter of missing a tax return due date, a pivotal factor in connection with the administration of the entire estate, is not an error of law or of judgment for which the entire blame can be shifted to the expert.

La<em>Rocca Estate, </em><a href="/pa/431/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="431 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="1917393" data-case-paths="/pa/431/0542-01">431 Pa. 542</a>, 546, <a href="/citations/?q=246%20A.2d%20337" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="246 A.2d 337">246 A. 2d 337</a> (1968). In the case at bar, Mr. Adair engaged co-counsel for the purpose of preparing and filing the federal return. By reason of the untimely filing, the estate has incurred a loss which <em>at a minimum </em>exceeds (by $315) the fund available for the compensation of both lawyers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The question, therefore, is whether any part of that loss should be borne by the estate and its beneficiaries so that counsel for the estate at the time the loss was incurred may receive compensation. We do not see how distinction can be made, or should be attempted, between the l-awyer who was negligent and the lawyer who was ignorant. While we recognize that “no attorney can be expected to be familiar with every aspect of the law,” yet if an attorney is not competent to perform work properly he should not undertake the service. See in general 7 Am. Jur. 2d §167 et seq.; compare Rule DR 6-101, Code of Professional Responsi<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>bility of the American Bar Association (now in force in this Commonwealth: Pa. R.C.P. Rule 205); <em>Degen v. </em>Steinbrink, <a href="/ad/202/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="202 A.D. 477" data-case-ids="4655834" data-case-paths="/ad/202/0477-01">202 App. Div. 477</a>, 481, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20N.Y.S.%20810" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="195 N.Y.S. 810">195 N.Y.S. 810</a>, 814 (1922). Here Mr. Adair was co-counsel, and we think he should not be able to cast the entire burden of the mistake on his other co-counsel at the expense of the estate. That is to say, the two attorneys, <em>like </em>two partners, should stand jointly and severally liable to the estate, and the estate should be made whole before counsel fees are allowed to either lawyer. The $16,000 balance which normally would be available for attorney’s fees would thus be available to offset the minimum loss of approximately the same amount. Should the federal tax loss eventually be determined in the federal courts to exceed the figure of $16,351 conceded by appellants, and should there be a consequent Pennsylvania estate tax deficiency, separate proceedings might be brought to recover a personal judgment against the responsible party or parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>
