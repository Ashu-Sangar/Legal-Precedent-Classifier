        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nIn this action of assumpsit, the University Club of Pittsburgh (Club) sought a refund of taxes paid the city of Pittsburgh (City) which allegedly were not due. The case was tried nonjury, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendant-city. Subsequently, exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed, and a final judgment entered. The University Club appeals.\nThe material facts are undisputed.\nThe appellant is a nonprofit corporation operating as a private social club, with a membership of over two thousand. The facilities are located on University Place in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Adjacent to its clubhouse the Club has provided an uncovered parking lot for seventy cars which only members are allowed to utilize. A flat rate of eighty-five cents is currently assessed every time a member parks his car in the lot. This rate is comparable to short-term parking rates in the area but is less than all-day parking rates in the Oakland section. The fee is not immediately collected; instead the amount is added to the member\u2019s bill.\nIn 1962 the city of Pittsburgh levied a parking tax of 10% on the gross receipts with respect to transactions involving the parking of motor vehicles at commercial parking places. The legislation, Ordinance No. 434 of 1962, subsequently re-enacted, imposes the tax on \u201call transactions of each operator with respect to each commercial parking place . . . .\u201d Transaction is defined as \u201cthe parking or storing of a motor vehicle at a commercial parking place for a consideration.\u201d \u201cCommercial parking place\u201d is defined as \u201cany place within the City, whether wholly or partially enclosed or open, at which motor vehicles are parked or stored for any period of time in return for a consideration . . .\u201d The only enumerated exceptions are parking lots operated in connection with residences, apartments, hotels, and trailer courts.\nThe appellant contends that the parking lot ordinance is applicable only to transactions where the operator is in the parking lot business. It is urged that sinee the Club\u2019s lot is closed to the general public and is not operated at a profit, it cannot be said the Club is engaging in commercial parking transactions and therefore the ordinance is not applicable to it.\nThe appellant\u2019s attack on this ordinance by way of the principles of statutory construction is a confusion which obscures the fundamental issues presented here, namely (1) did the City have the power (legal authority) to tax the appellant in the manner in which it did; and, (2) did it intend to so do.\nThat the City had the power to tax the appellant in the manner in which it did we think is evident from The Local Tax Enabling Act of June 25, 1947, P. L. 1145, re-enacted and clarified by Act of December 31, 1965, P. L. 1257, 53 P.S. \u00a76902 (1970 Supp.) (The Tax Anything Act). The act conferred upon political subdivisions the power to levy taxes upon all subjects of taxation which the Commonwealth has the power to tax but which it has not so exercised. Section 2(7) of the 1965 act contains the only restriction on taxing private social organizations: \u201cSuch local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act: (7) to levy, assess or collect a tax on membership in or membership dues, fees or assessment of charitable, religious, beneficial or non-profit organizations . . . .\u201d\nSince parking transactions for which a consideration is paid are nowhere mentioned in the exception, it is a reasonable assumption that they are proper subjects of taxation.\nDid the City intend to tax lots operated by nonprofit organizations?\nThe City, as it had the right to do, provided its own set of definitions to aid in the understanding and interpretation of its legislation.\nPerhaps its definition of \u201ccommercial\u201d is not literally what one would find in Webster\u2019s but it is now late in the day to challenge, even indirectly, Justice Stern\u2019s oft-cited dictum in Sterling v. Philadelphia, 378 Pa. 538, 542, 106 A. 2d 793 (1954): \u201cA legislative body may, in a statute or ordinance, furnish its own definitions of words and phrases used therein in order to guide and direct judicial determination of the intendments of the legislation although such definitions may be different from ordinary usage; it may create its own dictionary to be applied to the particular law or ordinance in question.\u201d\nThe definition of a \u201ccommercial\u201d parking lot urged by the Club as one operated for profit and open to the public is not the definition of commercial parldng places contained in the city ordinance. It is the imposition of a charge for parking that makes a parking lot \u201ccommercial\u201d under the clear language of the ordinance. \u201cThe \u201clegislature must be intended to mean what it has plainly expressed ....\u2019\u201d (Orlosky v. Haskell, 304 Pa. 57, 62, 155 A. 112).\u201d Commonwealth v. Rieck Inv. Corp., 419 Pa. 52, 59, 213 A. 2d 277 (1965). \u201c[Where] the language is clear and free from ambiguity ... we may not disregard or change it by construction. Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a751.\u201d Commonwealth v. Harrison, 183 Pa. Superior Ct. 133, 137, 130 A. 2d 198 (1957). It is not the function of this Court to change the plain language of the ordinance.\nAppellant contends that its case is on all fours with the decision in City of Pittsburgh v. University of Pittsburgh, 114 P.L.J. 237 (1965), affirmed without opinion 208 Pa. Superior Ct. 718, 219 A. 2d 364 (1966), a case which construed Ordinance 434, involved here, also.\nIn the Pitt case, supra, certain campus parking lots were restricted solely to faculty and employees of the University, and a small charge was made for their use. However, two of the lots were available for public use on days of athletic events. The court, Wessel, J., held that these Pitt lots were not \u201ccommercial\u201d parking lots and not subject to the Pittsburgh Parking Tax Ordinance except with respect to the receipts at the two lots received from the general public in connection with the sports events.\nAppellant contends that the difference between the taxable and nontaxable portions of the Pitt case, supra, was the type of activity, i.e., open to the general public or restricted to faculty and employees. But even this distinction does not help appellant because the decision in the Pitt case turned on the activity of a special sort of actor, that of an eleemosynary educational institution, a definition which does not fit the University Club.\nIf anything the Pitt case, supra, illustrates that the City was (and is) attempting to enact as broad a taxing measure as possible. Thus it fell to the court to carve the exception in this broad language for eleemosynary institutions in order to remain consistent with, state legislative policy of tax exemption for places of purely public charity.\nThere is no reason in public policy why special treatment should be accorded to private social clubs in matters like the one before us.\nHere the preamble to the ordinance explained the imposition of the tax in terms of the traffic congestion from commercial parking lots and the problems presented thereby to municipal services. From the location and use of the appellant\u2019s lot, outlined in the record, it is clear that the very burden on the municipality noted in the Ordinance is applicable to the parking lot; in question here.\nThe levy imposed by the city of Pittsburgh differs in no important particulars from that upheld by this Court in Blauner\u2019s Inc. v. Philadelphia, 330 Pa. 342, 198 A. 889 (1938). There it was held that the sale of food by a club to its members was subject to sales tax just as food served in a public restaurant. There the sales tax was imposed on the transaction whereby property was acquired; here the Parldng Tax is by terms of the Ordinance, \u201ca tax upon the transactions involved in parldng motor vehicles at commercial parking places.\u201d,\nAs to appellant\u2019s argument that the revenues received for parking the automobiles of full-time residents of the Club falls under the exception outlined in the ordinance as to hotels and apartments, we need not speculate, since no evidence was presented in the court below as to how much this revenue amounted to.\nNor need we reach the question of whether or not the ordinance involved violates Art. Ill, \u00a73 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, since appellant\u2019s position in this regard is based on the premise that its parking lot is not a \u201ccommercial parking place.\u201d As pointed out before, the ordinance itself controls our determination of what constitutes a \u201ccommercial parking place\u201d for the purposes of the taxation imposed.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien and Mr. Justice Pomeroy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAppellants admit that motor vehicles are parked in the Club lot in return for a consideration but submit that the lot is operated on a nonprofit basis, indeed at a loss. Little, if any, weight should be assigned to the basis of operation here since cross-examination revealed a conscious unconcern by the Club as to how the lot operated. The manager, Mr. Schleicher, testified: \u201cIf we can break even fine, if we lose a little bit\u2014Q. That\u2019s fine too? A. Yes.\u201d\nThe only loss the Club accountant could substantiate for the five year period during which the tax was in effect up to the time of trial was a loss of $391 in 1968.\nIn the Pitt case, supra, Judge Wessel at page 240 states as follows: \u201cWe feel that the position taken by the Supreme Court in the Hill School case, [370 Pa. 21 (1952)] governs the case at bar, that is to say, the University of Pittsburgh, an eleemosynary institution, does not cease to be such where it receives some payment for its services and, therefore, is not subject to tax merely because the institution makes a charge for the use of its facilities at a figure which clearly is not commercial and which use is confined to the faculty and employees of the University.\"\nThe record shows that the Club administration\u2019s study of its parking facilities showed a capacity use of the lot on the average of five times a week during the luncheon hours and three times per week during dinner hours.",
