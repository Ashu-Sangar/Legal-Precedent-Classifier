        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nOn Ocober 6, 1961, Gabriel E. Marino died intestate, owning, inter alia, 12.81 acres of land in Washington County. He was survived by the following named sister and four brothers: Teresino Marino, Ralph Marino, Anthony Marino, Patsy Marino and Russell Marino.\nOn March 6, 1969, Russell Marino, as administrator for the estate, filed a petition seeking leave to retain separate counsel to aid with certain condemnation proceedings. On March 18, 1969, Judge Charles D. Copeland, specially presiding, granted this petition to retain separate counsel. Anthony Marino appealed from the order of March 18, 1969, and Russell Marino has filed a petition to quash the appeal. The appeal must be quashed.\nIn the absence of express statutory authorization, an interlocutory order is generally unappealable (McGee v. Singley, 382 Pa. 18, 114 A. 2d 141 (1955)) and no such statute is presently applicable. \u201cThe evident policy of the law in such regard is to preclude piecemeal determinations and the consequent protraction of litigation.\u201d Sullivan v. Philadelphia, 378 Pa. 648, 649, 107 A. 2d 854, 855 (1954).\n. . An order is not interlocutory if it precludes a party from presenting the merits of his claim to the lower \u2022court. Ventura v. Skylark Motel, Inc., 431 Pa. 459, 246 A. 2d 353 (1968); Stewart Estate, 423 Pa. 189, 223 A. 2d 685 (1966); Stadler v. Mt. Oliver Borough, 373 Pa. 316, 95 A. 2d 776 (1953).\nIn the case at bar, Anthony Marino, apparently, would like to have Russell Marino removed as administrator, although Anthony\u2019s position is none too clear from the pleadings. The order from which this appeal has been taken only pertains to the retention of additional counsel to aid the estate in certain condemnation proceedings. The order of March 18, 1969, not only fails to raise the issue which is apparently in controversy but is also interlocutory. Middleberg v. Middleberg, 427 Pa. 114, 233 A. 2d 889 (1967). Accordingly, this appeal must be quashed. Any discussion on the m\u00e9rits of this case must be deferred until such time as we may have a complete record before us. Adcox v. Pennsylvania Mfr's. Assn. Ins. Co., 419 Pa. 170, 213 A. 2d 366 (1965).\nAppeal quashed. Appellant to pay costs.\nPatsy Marino is the judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County.\nRussell Marino, since 1968, has been the Clerh of the Orphans\u2019 Court and Register of Wills of Washington County.\nThe disposition of this appeal shaU in no manner be deemed a condonation of the participation of Judge Marino at any stage of the proceedings in this estate nor of the action of Russell Marino in continuing as administrator of this estate after becoming Clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court and Register of Wills of Washington County. A judge must not act in a controversy wherein he is a party in interest (Canons of Judicial Ethics, \u00a7\u00a713, 29 of the American Bar .Association adopted by this Court) and the conduct of Judge Marino clearly and flagrantly violated the ethical standards of the judiciary. Moreover, Russell Marino, although he was not Register of Wills when appointed administrator, should have resigned as administrator upon his election as Register of Wills.",

However, I must note my strong disapproval of the actions of Anthony Marino, a member of the Bar of this Court, who is apparently attempting to use the judicial system to further his personal intra-family feud.\nIt should be noted that Anthony Marino has had the services of five different attorneys since 1964. In addition, he acted as his own counsel in the Answer he filed on March 8,1966 which led to a contempt citation. As a lawyer Mr. Marino should recognize that the judicial system should not be further burdened with his personal antagonism.",
