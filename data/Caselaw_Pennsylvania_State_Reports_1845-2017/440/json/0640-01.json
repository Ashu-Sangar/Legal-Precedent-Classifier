However, we do agree with the majority that the defendant insurance company owed a duty under the policy to defend Huntingdon in the action instituted by Herman Weber & Co., Inc., and having failed to fulfill this duty is liable for the costs reasonably expended by Huntingdon in defense of that action. We would modify the judgment entered in the court below accordingly.",
