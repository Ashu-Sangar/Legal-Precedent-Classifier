(“Ganzer”). The permit would allow Ganzer to establish and operate a solid waste landfill on a certain 40-acre tract in Erie County, for the purpose of providing a disposal site for residual waste from the Hammermill Paper Company. The property on which the fill is to be located is adjacent to a 1,343-acre tract of wetlands maintained by the Commission as a waterfowl refuge. The Commission raised various environmental objections to the proposed landfill, and subsequently challenged the issuance of the permit by taking an appeal to the Board pursuant to section 1921-A of the Administrative Code of 1929.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The appellant also alleged that the operation of the landfill, in its actual effect, would produce polluted ground water and surface-water runoff, and that such would adversely impact upon the eco-system of the waterfowl sanctuary.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[258,578,1153,410]]]'>In its argument based on the Solid Waste Management Act, the Commission objected to the ratio of waste to renovative soil that would exist at the landfill, and to the fact that the fill would not have a liner or leachate collection system. According to the appellant, such defects would be violative of design standards mandated by regulations implementing the statute and would be environmentally injurious.</p>
    <p id="b188-5" data-blocks='[["BL_188.6",188,[251,1016,1157,1117]]]'>The Commission’s central statutory challenge, however, was based on the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (“DSEA”). That statute, like others has as one of its express purposes the protection of natural resources and environmental values, 32 P.S. § 693.2(3). To that end, the DSEA provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that “[n]o person shall construct, operate, maintain ... any dam, <em>water obstruction </em>or encroachment without the prior written permit of [DER].” 32 P.S. § 693.6(a) (emphasis added). DER did not consider the DSEA applicable to the landfill; thus, a water-obstruction permit was deemed unnecessary. The Commission, however, contended that the Ganzer fill would create a “water obstruction” as to be subject to the foregoing provision, and that the absence of the special license mentioned therein negated the validity of the solid waste permit. In sum, the Commission urged that DER could not legitimately authorize the Ganzer landfill without first securing compliance with the DSEA. These same contentions were reiterated by the appellant as its exclusive basis for asserting that permission of the landfill would offend Article I, § 27 of the state constitution.</p>

Subsequently, in a pre-hear<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>ing ruling, the Board determined that the Commission did have standing to prosecute the appeal.</p>

With particular regard to the arguments based on the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, the Board found as a matter of fact that no streams or drainage courses run through the landfill site, and that the site was higher in elevation than any neighboring watercourses and the wetlands constituting the Commission’s wildlife refuge. On the strength of those findings, the Board concluded that the Ganzer landfill would not create a “water obstruction” as that term is defined by the DSEA,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and thus, that the statute was not applicable to the case.</p>

The Board went further and gauged the propriety of the solid waste permit under the governing environmental statutes, and under the environmental article of our state constitution. After making extensive findings of fact based <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>on the evidence, the Board determined that the proposed landfill would not have an adverse impact on the environment and that permitting the landfill was otherwise in compliance with the law.</p>

Although it is clear from the Board’s adjudication that the Commission was actually accorded standing to press its challenges, the Commission, in its appeal to the Commonwealth Court, included an assertion that it had been denied “standing” to raise the DSEA as an issue before the administrative tribunal.</p>

The court first concluded that the Commission lacked standing to raise the DSEA, as a basis for challenging the Ganzer permit. The court then proceeded to also decide that, even if the Commission did have the requisite standing, the Board’s adjudication had to be sustained under the standard of judicial review prescribed by section 704 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 704.</p>

The reasoning of the Commonwealth Court on this point is not altogether clear, but it seems to have at its core a determination that the purposes of the DSEA have nothing to do with the functions of the Commission, <em>i.e., </em>protecting wildlife. Based on that premise, the court decided that the Commission could not be “aggrieved” by DER’s non-enforcement of the DSEA and thus had no legal standing to make an issue of it. Having concluded that the Commission lacked standing to raise the DSEA itself, the Commonwealth Court added that the absence of standing was not cured by the Commission’s attempt to reiterate its DSEA argument under Article I, § 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. For the reasons that follow, it <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>is our view the Commonwealth Court erred in its holding as to the Commission’s standing.</p>

    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[252,389,1157,1659]]]'>Although our law of standing is generally articulated in terms of whether a would-be litigant has a “substantial interest” in the controverted matter, and whether he has been “aggrieved” or “adversely affected” by the action in question, we must remain mindful that the purpose of the “standing” requirement is to insure that a legal challenge is by a proper party, <em>Application of Biester, supra. </em>The terms “substantial interest”, “aggrieved” and “adversely affected” are the general, usual guides in that regard, but they are not the only ones. For example, when the legislature statutorily invests an agency with certain functions, duties and responsibilities, the agency has a legislatively conferred interest in such matters. From this it must follow that, unless the legislature has provided otherwise, such an agency has an implicit power to be a litigant in matters touching upon its concerns. In such circumstances the legislature has implicitly ordained that such an agency is a proper party litigant, <em>i.e., </em>that it has “standing.” An instructive illustration of this point is the case of <em>Chapman v.

Of course, wildlife are dependent for their continuing viability upon the natural resources of their ecosystem and habitat, but it is an illogical jump for us to proceed from this premise and conclude that as trustee of game wildlife in the Commonwealth, the Game Commission has standing under the DSEA to insure the maintenance of all natural resources required to sustain its faunal wards.
