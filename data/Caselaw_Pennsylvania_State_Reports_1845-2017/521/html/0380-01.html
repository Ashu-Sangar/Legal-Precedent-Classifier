We hold that the land title company’s liability is limited to indemnification of its insured and that direct liability to an uninsured third party is precluded.

Liederbach, </em>the promisee was a testator; the promisor was an attorney retained to draft his will. The intended third party beneficiary was sole legatee under the will. The entire legacy failed because the legatee witnessed the will, at the attorney’s direction, despite a statute which voided any legacy to a person who has attested a will. It was abundantly clear that the testator intended to confer a benefit directly upon his legatee when he retained the attorney to prepare the will. In that context, this Court recognized a limited exception to the general rule that <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>negligence in the performance of an undertaking by a professional creates liability only to the promisee.

It was critical that the beneficiary was an <em>intended </em>beneficiary, that is, one intended by the promisee to receive the benefit of the promised performance. Restatement § 302(l)(b).

This finding is unsupported by the evidence and therefore erroneous, for a court of equity has broad powers to fashion relief according to the equities of the case. If the Saboes expended money and labor on their residence which increased its value while Mrs. Hicks delayed filing suit, it is well within the chancellor’s power to compensate the Saboes by awarding money damages <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>against Mrs. Hicks to reflect the increase in value.
