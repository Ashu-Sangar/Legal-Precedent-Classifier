In 1981, the West Miflin Township police arrested one JoAnn Walters for retail theft. Ms. Walters retained attorney Bruce Carsia to defend her. With Ms. Walters’ consent, Carsia contacted Khorey, a police officer from Munhall Township, which is contiguous to West Miflin Township, in an attempt to “fix” the case. Khorey agreed to the scheme and contacted the arresting officer in an effort to further it. The arresting officer, in turn, contacted the Bureau of Criminal Investigations of the Attorney General’s Office. As a result of the Bureau’s investigation, Khorey, Carsia, and Walters were arrested and prosecuted.</p>

The trial court accepted the plea, and imposed a sentence of probation on the bribery count while suspending sentence on the remaining counts.</p>

These attorneys were known by various names such as “attornati regis,” “narratoreas pro rege,” men “qui secuuntur [sic] pro rege” and the King’s Serjeants [sic]. During the middle ages the tendency arose to supersede these several attorneys with limited powers by a single attorney with much wider ones and to give this attorney the right to appoint deputies.

Appellant’s Brief at 13. This argument is not persuasive.

Section 205(a)(3) provides that the attorney general shall have the power to prosecute:</p>

The language of this section makes clear that not just any request will suffice to vest the attorney general with authority to conduct the prosecution. The request must flow from either a lack of resources, either to investigate or to prosecute, or a potential conflict of interest.</p>

The language of the statute is clear, and permits no exceptions not expressly listed in the statute. We must conclude that, in the absence of a valid request, the attorney general lacked the authority under the Attorneys Act to conduct the prosecution. Nor do we believe, as the Commonwealth claims, that such a reading of the statute leads to the anomolous result that the “concern for the autonomy of our district attorneys has been translated into a holding which limits the ability of a district attorney to, in effect, delegate his prosecutorial ability by voluntarily assenting to the attorney general’s request that his office prosecute a particular case.” Appellant’s Brief at 14.</p>

There would simply be too small an incentive, or, in fact, a disincentive, for the district attorney to police his or her own authority.</p>

The delegation of authority from a district attorney to a deputy district attorney is characterized by a different relationship than would be a “delegation” of authority to the attorney general. While a district attorney has control over deputy or assistant district attorneys because they are subordinates, such would not be the case with the attorney general, who would not be subject to the <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>same supervision.

An appellate court should not lightly reverse the findings of fact made by a trial court. We hold that appellate review is limited to review for abuse of discretion, and that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the district attorney lacked resources within the meaning of section 205(a)(3) of the Attorneys Act. Here, the district attorney had filed the information and was apparently prepared to proceed. That the attorney general’s office requested the district attorney to relinquish control over the prosecution strongly suggests that the district attorney was not motivated by a lack of resources. Further, the formal request, <em>see supra </em>at 103 n. 8, was itself requested by the attorney general. In addition, that letter cites no lack of resources. Although the letter does state that the prosecution could be handled “in the most practical manner” by the attorney general because of the related prosecutions in other counties, mere practical convenience is not a substitute for the lack of resources required by the statute.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

Of course, the jury verdict against Trputec did not preclude our review, and approval, of his objections to the information. We further note that Khorey knew of the error, and that the improper signature was not of the type which would be "difficult for defendants to uncover.” <em>United States v.

We do not in any way encourage the attorney general to file informations without first undertaking an inquiry into the authority of the attorney general under the Attorneys Act to prosecute. To the contrary, Pa.R.Crim.P. 225 requires such an inquiry. Yet, the inquiry need not be exhaustive, and need not always prove to be correct. Although the official who signed the information against Khorey was incorrect, as we held in <em>Carsia, supra, </em>the law was not so clear at the time that the error was unreasonable, especially when Khorey knew of it and chose not to challenge it.</p>

Such a defect in the information would be non-curable and goes to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court. We do not in any way retreat from our holdings that objections to subject matter jurisdiction are non-waiveable. Similarly, this case is distinguishable from one in which “the Military Police,” Appellant’s Brief at 18, officials not serving under the sovereignty of the Commonwealth, signed the information. A signature from such a person would, of course, not satisfy the traditional purpose of an information, namely, to insure that an “attorney for the Commonwealth ... sign the information and thereby assume responsibility for his discretionary and deliberative charging act." <em>Commonwealth v.

Of course, an attorney not working for an agency of the Commonwealth would not be readily accountable for the decision to sign the information.</p>

Although not dispositive of this issue, a letter is extremely useful in establishing a documentary record of the request, not only for a court reviewing the legitimacy of the request, but also for simplicity and efficiency in discovery where the defendant seeks to challenge the authority of the attorney general.</p>
