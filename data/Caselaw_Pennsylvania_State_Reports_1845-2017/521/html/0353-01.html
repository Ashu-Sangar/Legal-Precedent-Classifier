Specifically Weakland pled guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of criminal conspiracy, and nolo contendere to one count of kidnapping, four counts of aggravated assault, one count of theft, and a general charge of homicide. Following a degree of guilt hearing, conducted on April 11 and 12, 1977, a three judge panel ruled that he was guilty of first degree murder. On November 29,1977, following denial of post-trial motions, Weakland was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction. On April 24, 1978, he was sentenced to fifty-three and one-half to one hundred seven years on the remaining charges, consecutive to the life sentence. Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence on appeal, and this Court denied a petition for allowance of appeal.

So long as the evidence is properly admitted by the court prior to sentencing, and so long as the defendant has the right to challenge it, it may be considered for sentencing purposes.</p>

Janies Weak-land entered the repair bay of the station, where Cecil Rash was working on a car, struck him with a wrench, knocking him to the ground, and removed $51.00 from his wallet. He then entered the office of the station, where his brother Robert was holding Mrs. Rash. One of the brothers then tore the telephone from the wall, and Robert assaulted Mrs. Rash. Both brothers took money and other items from the service station, and placed them in their car. The two robbers were approaching their car when Mrs. Rash, who had been thrown to the ground outside the station, got up and shouted to an approaching customer that the station was being robbed and that the customer should leave and call the police. James, who was apparently not far from Mrs. Rash when she warned the customer, started to pick up a cinder block which was used to anchor an air hose. At that point, Mr. Rash, covered with blood, and without , his glasses, emerged from the garage, armed with a .22 caliber nine-shot revolver. He ordered James not to hurt his wife, and then fired at him, wounding him in the leg. James fell to the ground and crawled a short distance away. Robert began throwing bottles at the Rashes from behind the Weaklands’ car, and Mr. Rash fired at least once at Robert, but to no avail. James also began throwing items at the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>Rashes, and after he hit Mr. Rash with a trashcan, he rushed him and the two men wrestled for the gun. While the two men wrestled, Mrs. Rash repeatedly struck James on the head with a large tire gauge until it broke, and then turned to wave for help from passing motorists. James finally got the gun from Mr. Rash and fired at Mrs. Rash, striking her in the fingers and arm. He then fired twice at Mr. Rash, striking him in the heart and killing him.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[168,731,1155,747]]]'>By the time James Weakland shot Mr. Rash, a witness, Edwin Wilson, had pulled his car into the service station, and was standing in front of his car, three or four paces from James, when the shooting occurred. James then rushed the Mr. Wilson, striking him in the head with the gun. The two struggled, and then stopped when James told the witness that he did not want to have to kill him. Mr. Wilson said that he did not want to be killed, but then James struck him again in the face with the gun and forced him into Mr. Wilson’s car. Mr. Wilson was then required to push the Weaklands’ car with his car to start it and to drive his own car from the station with James as a passenger. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Wilson was forced from the car and James used it to perfect his escape.</p>

James Weakland was charged with violations of 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1), causing or attempting to cause serious bodily injury to another, and § 2702(a)(4), causing or attempting to cause bodily injury with a deadly weapon. Because Superior Court declined to consider evidence presented at the degree of guilt hearing, and the only evidence of assault presented at the guilty plea hearing concerned Weakland’s shooting of Mrs. Rash, that court concluded that the two assault charges must merge. As we have discussed earlier, however, Superior Court’s decision not to consider evidence presented at the degree of guilt hearing was error. At that hearing Mrs. Rash testified that during the time Robert Weakland was demanding her mon<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ey and James Weakland was attacking her husband in another part of the station, she responded:</p>

In <em>Leon Williams </em>we held that where the same facts are used to support convictions for crimes having different elements, the crimes do not merge for sentencing purposes, unless the same facts support convictions of lesser included offenses. That holding does not apply to the present case because the problem here is not whether the same facts support multiple convictions, but whether facts in evidence <em>additional </em>to those facts establishing aggravated assault, i.e., that James Weakland continued to threaten Mr. Wilson with a handgun, should have been used to satisfy the threat or force <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>requirement of kidnapping.

The former protects the bodily integrity of the victim. The latter variously prevents felons from shielding attempted flight with innocent hostages, prevents the taking of persons for <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>ransom, and prevents various other kinds of criminal victimization which often follows the taking and isolation of a kidnap victim. Since substantially different interests underly both statutes, I have no hesitancy in concluding that Appellee should have been sentenced on both convictions.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[174,601,1153,1125]]]'>While I have serious questions as to the majority’s wisdom in discarding the <em>Michael Williams </em>analysis, I am still more concerned with the test substituted for the <em>Michael Williams </em>analysis. If I understand the majority correctly, if a person commits one act of criminal violence and that act is the only basis upon which he may be convicted of another crime, the act will merge into the other crime. Thus, arsonists should be comforted in the knowledge that they can burn down our homes, with our families in them, and be convicted of one crime. So, too, murderers can drive into a crowd of pedestrians killing and maiming at will and be convicted only of one crime. Is the majority also discarding our holding in <em>Commonwealth v. Frisbie, </em><a href="/pa/506/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="506 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1790972" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0461-01">506 Pa. 461</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="506 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="1790972" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0461-01">485 A.2d 1098</a> (1984)? The wisdom of such logic escapes me but since we have now abrogated our duty to look at the <em>legislature’s </em>intent in determining how to apply their sentencing scheme, maybe the next step will be to ignore the Crimes Code altogether and promulgate our own Crimes Code. The future should be interesting, but criminals should take heart for they have a friend in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>
