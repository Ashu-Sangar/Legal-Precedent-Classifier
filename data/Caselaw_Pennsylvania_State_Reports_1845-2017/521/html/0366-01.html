That verdict resulted from a civil action brought by Appellant against Appellee, Easton Publishing Company and one of its reporters, Thom Loverro, under § 5725 of the Wiretapping and Surveillance Control Act (Act) 18 Pa.C.S. § 5701 et seq. Section 5725 provides a civil cause of action for damages incurred due to the unlawful disclosure or use of a wire or oral communication obtained pursuant to or in violation of the Act. The trial court, in rejecting Appellee’s motion, took the position that the Act created a limited right of disclosure which previously had not existed and therefor, notwithstanding the status of Appellee as “the press”, “[the Legislature] evidences an overiding legislative concern for the protection of privacy. Thus, we believe that <em>all </em>disclosures and uses of wiretap information must be in strict compliance with the Act.” Opinion of Common Pleas Court at 8. (Filed, March 6, 1984) (emphasis added).</p>

At the request of the State Police, a private individual, known to Appellant, consented to a telephone tap between himself and the Appellant. Shortly thereafter, the State Police intercepted a telephone conversation between Appellant and the consenting individual which revealed the Appellant’s involvement in illegal betting activities on college football games. Based upon the information obtained from the intercept, the State Police raided Appellant’s home and charged him with bookmaking, pool selling and conspiracy. After being held for court on the charges, Appellant filed a timely motion for discovery, requesting the District Attorney produce a transcript of the intercepted call. Inadvertently, but in violation of the disclosure section of the Act, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5717(b), the District Attorney attached a copy of the transcript to his answer and filed it with the clerk of courts. No attempt was made by the District Attorney to direct the clerk to impound the file as required by § 5714(b) of the Act.</p>

One of the observers present at the hearing was Thom Loverro, a reporter for the Easton Express, a newspaper owned by Appellee’s publishing company. Loverro expected that the hearing would disclose the contents of the wiretap, however, the hearing judge disposed of the motion without such disclosure. Following the <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>hearing, Loverro went to the office of the clerk of court and requested the case file. The file was made available to Loverro, who discovered the transcript of the interception which had been attached to the District Attorney’s answer to Appellant’s discovery request. Loverro made extensive notes on the contents of the transcript and subsequently wrote a story based upon those notes. He withheld publication of the story for approximately seven days, however, while he discussed the matter with his superiors. On April 7, 1982, the managing editor approved publication and the article was published with excerpts of Loverro’s notes from the transcript.</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[243,970,1154,739]]]'>After the publication, Appellant filed a lawsuit against Easton Publishing Company and Loverro predicated upon the common law tort of invasion of privacy and the statutory civil action created by § 5725. Subsequently, Loverro was dropped as a defendant and the common law invasion of privacy count was withdrawn. Following trial on the action, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of Appellant as to the issue of liability. The jury then returned a verdict of $1,000 in actual damages, no punitive damages, and $17,409.43 in attorney’s fees. The court en banc dismissed Appellant’s post-trial assertion that punitive damages were mandatory, and likewise dismissed Appellee’s motion for judgment n.o.v., attacking the directed verdict on various grounds.</p>

As such, there is no justification to allow the media a unique prerogative to trespass where the general populace is barred.

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>The common thread running through the <em>Cox </em>line of cases is the Constitutional tenet that a state may not impose prior restraint or penal sanction upon the media for publishing lawfully obtained, truthful information contained in official court records open to public inspection. In <em>Cox, </em>the Supreme Court invalidated a Georgia statute which prohibited the news media from publishing or broadcasting the name or identity of a rape victim and provided misdemeanor penalties for its violation. A reporter for Cox had obtained the name of a rape victim by examining copies of indictments handed to him in open court by a clerk, and subsequently caused the identity of the victim to be broadcast; an act for which Cox was sued civilly by the victim’s father. The Court, in pronouncing the statute constitutionally infirm, indicated that the operant factor in its holding was that the prohibited sanction applied to information “from judicial records which are maintained in connection with a public prosecution and <em>which themselves are open to public inspection.” </em><a href="/us/420/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="420 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="11643989" data-case-paths="/us/420/0469-01">420 U.S. at 491</a>, <a href="/us/420/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="420 U.S. 469" data-case-ids="11643989" data-case-paths="/us/420/0469-01">95 S.Ct. at 1044</a> (emphasis added) (In effect, the statute prohibited the media from disclosing what was otherwise public knowledge).</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[244,1461,1156,798]]]'>Similarly, in <em>Oklahoma Publishing Co., </em>the Court struck down legislation prohibiting publication of the name and picture of a juvenile defendant. The identity of the juvenile was acquired by reporters solely through their presence at open court proceedings. Correspondingly, in <em>Smith, </em>the Court held that West Virginia could not punish truthful publication of an alleged juvenile delinquent’s name where the information was lawfully obtained. In this instance, the identity was gleaned by monitoring police radio frequencies and querying eyewitnesses to the crime. Finally, in <em>Landmark Communications, </em>the case most analogous to the instant facts, the Court held that Virginia could not impose criminal sanctions on the media for publishing confidential information relating to judicial disciplinary proceedings in violation of its state constitution and statutory law.</p>

Initially, the present case is distinguishable from the <em>Cox </em>rationale by virtue of the fact that the information sought to be prohibited in those cases was of a type legally and publically obtainable either from official court records <em>intentionally </em>placed in the public domain, or from information readily obtainable through attendance in open court. In contrast, in this case the information was neither readily obtainable in open court nor <em>intentionally </em>placed in records accessible to the general public. Since the Act requires that all transcripts be sealed until such time as there is disclosure, it cannot be said that the transcript obtained by Appellee’s reporter was officially placed in the court record and intended to be accessible to the public. The statute clearly sets forth the mandatory sealing of the transcript and its ability to be disclosed by one not authorized <em>only </em>upon a court order. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 5715 and 5725(c).</p>

      <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>The more proximate and difficult holding we must reconcile with the case before us is the circumstances presented in <em>Landmark Communications, supra. </em>In <em>Landmark, </em>confidential information concerning the disciplinary actions taken against a judge by the Virginia Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission was obtained in violation of a Virginia code which made it unlawful to divulge the identification of a judge when he was the subject of an investigation and hearing by the commission. The statute provided criminal penalties for its violation. The United States Supreme Court defined the narrow and limited question as “whether the First Amendment permits the criminal punishment of third persons who are strangers to the inquiry, including the news media, for divulging or publishing truthful information regarding confidential proceedings of the judicial inquiry and review commission. <a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">435 U.S. at 837</a>, <a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">98 S.Ct. at 1540</a> (footnote omitted). The court held that it did not and based its decision on the fact that neither the Commonwealth’s interest in protecting the reputation of its judges nor its interest in maintaining the institutional integrity of its courts is sufficient to justify the subsequent punishment of speech here at issue. Interestingly, the court declined to completely answer the broader question, unquestionably germane to the present inquiry and first acknowledged, but not decided, in <em>Cox, </em>which asks whether the publication of truthful information, withheld by law from the public domain, enjoys a similar privilege as does public information released to the general public in official court records? This is the precise question now before us. The <em>Landmark </em>court declined to address all the implications of this question but would decide it only in relation to the unique circumstances presented there, to wit, whether that specific publication enjoyed such a privilege.</p>

The operant factors in the decision were a penal statute and the balancing of First Amendment rights versus the state’s <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>interest in protecting the reputation of its judges and maintaining the institutional integrity of its court.</p>

This is true for the privacy interests in <em>Cox </em>were viewed in terms of the disclosure of information otherwise of public record. In contrast, the privacy interest we now consider consists of information gathered in temporary derogation of a Pennsylvania citizen’s right to privacy and protected by our Commonwealth through a pervasive legislative scheme uncompromisingly delineating and limiting its collection and use. Weighing these interests against those contained in the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of the press, we perceive it readily apparent that Pennsylvania’s interest in protecting its citizen’s rights far outweighs the negligible effect the Act’s blanket prohibition on disclosure creates. To understand our rationale in minimalizing the interest of <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the newspaper, it is important to bear in mind that, but for the enactment of the Act both the collection and dissemination of electronically obtained conversations would be clearly and <em>absolutely </em>prohibited. From this we reason that <em>only </em>when the protected information is disseminated either through an order of court unsealing it or through its use as evidence in an open court proceeding does the media’s interest rise above those of the Commonwealth and its citizens.</p>

    <p id="b442-10" data-blocks='[["BL_442.11",442,[250,1867,1153,487]]]'>Today the majority holds that a newspaper is liable in a civil action under Section 5725 of the Wiretapping and Surveillance Control Act (Act), 18 Pa.C.S. § 5725, for publishing the contents of an intercepted communication obtained by one of its reporters from a public court file. The majority’s disposition of this appeal ignores a vital fact in these circumstances, <em>i.e., </em>that the transcript was publicly disclosed by the district attorney, who mistakenly attached it to a public court document.</p>

The recordings, along with any transcripts, orders and reports, must be sealed, held in custody, and disclosed only under certain conditions.</p>
    <p id="b443-4" data-blocks='[["BL_443.5",443,[146,643,1153,481]]]'>The disclosure in this case resulted from the inadvertence of the judicial system. Having placed the transcript within the public file, the members of the press, like anyone else in the community, had access to it and had no personal obligation to maintain the secrecy of the documents. The fact that the transcript is supposed to be kept secret is not directed at the person who accesses it in a public file, but is directed at the persons entrusted to keep it secret. That is the judicial system.</p>
    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.6",443,[144,1154,1154,1125]]]'>Thus, the burden for securing the secrecy of the transcripts was placed by statute on the judicial system which failed, in this instance, to sustain that burden. It is the judicial system which is responsible for the <em>public </em>disclosure of the transcript for once it became a part of the public file, it became accessible to the public, including the press. To place the onus on the newspaper to keep secret that which is public knowledge seriously conflicts with the First Amendment rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution. <em>Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, </em><a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">435 U.S. 829</a>, <a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">98 S.Ct. 1535</a>, <a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">56 L.Ed.2d 1</a> (1978). Although the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Landmark, supra, </em>from the case at bar, its distinction remains unconvincing. In <em>Landmark, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the First Amendment does not permit criminal prosecution of a newspaper for publishing truthful information regarding confidential judicial proceedings. Here the newspaper published information from a public file which it could properly have presumed to be public knowledge. Clearly the right involved here “lies near[er] the core of the First Amendment” protection. <em>Id. </em>at 839, <a href="/us/435/0829-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="435 U.S. 829" data-case-ids="2526" data-case-paths="/us/435/0829-01">98 S.Ct. at 1541</a>.</p>
