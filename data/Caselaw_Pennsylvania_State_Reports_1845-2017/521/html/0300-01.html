It is equally clear that the receipt of money had never entered her mind. The expression of gratitude for labor’s support, at the urging of her political sponsor, was the sole reason for her meeting with Traitz. Traitz knew the requirement for PAC contributions, he knew there was cash in the sealed envelope, and he knew that the gift of cash was not a legal PAC contribution.
