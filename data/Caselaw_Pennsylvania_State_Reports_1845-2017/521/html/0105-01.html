Smyth presiding. Subsequently, on November 15, 1985, Judge Smyth filed a decree and order divorcing the Husband and Wife from the bonds of matrimony. Further, he ordered that the parties’ residential property be sold for a price no lower than $72,000.00 and the net proceeds of the sale be divided 50%-50% between the Husband and Wife. All other claims for relief asserted by the Wife were denied. Shortly thereafter, on November 19, 1985, Judge Smyth filed an adjudication containing findings of fact and conclusions of law. Following entry of the written adjudication, the Wife discharged her trial counsel. On November 26, 1985, the Wife retained new counsel to represent her. The Wife’s new counsel, without having access to former counsel’s file, prepared post-trial motions on behalf of the Wife and filed them on November 27, 1985.</p>

Similarly, the lower court did not raise the late filing of the Wife’s motions when they came before it for argument. The court considered the Wife’s post trial motions on their merits and, by order dated January 3, 1986, denied relief. The Wife proceeded to file a timely Notice of Appeal from that order.</p>

At no time during the briefing process or at oral argument did the Husband raise any question concerning the timeliness of the post trial motions in the lower court. The late filing of the motions was raised for the first time in the Superior Court’s memorandum opinion deciding the case. In its unpublished memorandum opinion the Superior Court said: “Because the post-trial motions were not filed within ten days of the date of entry of the final decree and <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>order, we find the issues raised therein to be waived and affirm the order of the lower court.”</p>

Rule 1920.52(a) provides that post-trial procedures “shall be in accordance with Rules of Civil Procedure 227.1 to 227.4, inclusive. Rule 227.1(c) mandates that Post Trial Motions shall be filed within ten days after the filing of the decision. In this case the decision was filed by the court on November 15,1985 when the decree and order divorcing the parties from the bonds of matrimony and disposing of all economic claims was entered. Thus, under the dictates of Rule 227.1(c), post-trial motions had to be filed by November 25, 1985. The record shows that the wife did not file her motions until November 27, 1985, two days beyond the time set by the applicable rule. Further, it is clear from the record that the Husband, at no time, raised the question of the timeliness of the Wife’s post-trial motions. Thus, the question present in this case is: May the Superior Court raise, <em>sua sponte, </em>the timeliness of the Wife’s motions and then dismiss her appeal on the basis that because her motions were untimely, she waived all of the issues set forth therein.</p>
