The defendant argued that even though various constitutional provisions and statutes might have removed any possibility of criminal punishment for persons’ conduct during the war, there still remained the potential for other legal disabilities arising out of the answers to questions about one’s allegiance or whether he had been attainted of high treason. Such questions were thus improper under Article 1, Section 9 of the constitutions of 1776 and 1790, which, the defendant contended, should be read broadly to mean that no question should be asked, the answer to which might tend to charge one with a crime or bring him into disgrace or infamy.

We had no need to analyze the extent of the state constitutional privilege. Since the immunity statute involved granted transactional immunity, and this was clearly more than sufficient to supplant the Fifth Amendment privilege according to <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em><a href="/us/406/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="406 U.S. 441" data-case-ids="6171486" data-case-paths="/us/406/0441-01">406 U.S. 441</a>, <a href="/us/406/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="406 U.S. 441" data-case-ids="6171486" data-case-paths="/us/406/0441-01">92 S.Ct. 1653</a>, <a href="/us/406/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="406 U.S. 441" data-case-ids="6171486" data-case-paths="/us/406/0441-01">32 L.Ed.2d 212</a> (1972), our analysis shed no light on whether a lesser degree of immunity would be sufficient to displace the privilege as expressed in the state constitution, the question now before us.</p>
      <p id="AGk" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[261,1875,1119,506]]]'>Finally, <em>Commonwealth v. Kilgallen, </em><a href="/pa/379/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="379 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="1253613" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0315-01">379 Pa. 315</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20A.2d%20780" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="108 A.2d 780">108 A.2d 780</a> (1954), though it was decided on purely state constitutional grounds, involved an explicit <em>constitutional </em>exception to Article I, Section 9, compelling testimony in certain cases while providing use immunity, Article III, Section 32 (Constitution of 1874). We held, in effect, that the latter constitutional provision could not be invalidated as inconsistent with the former, but that it would be construed as providing an exception. It would seem that under the then-prevailing view of the Fifth Amendment, a claim that Article III, Section 32, violated the Federal Constitution by not requiring transactional immunity would have succeeded. This argument, however, was unnecessary to the defendant, who had been indicted on the basis of his compelled testimony, and thus in violation of Article III, Section 32 itself.</p>
