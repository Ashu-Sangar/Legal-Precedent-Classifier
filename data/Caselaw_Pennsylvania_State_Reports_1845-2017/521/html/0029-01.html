It is also alleged that PCC knowingly decided not to warn employees of the health hazard presented by exposure to high levels of asbestos dust.</p>

However, in the immunity provided for the employer, under section 303 of the ODA no such exception was engrafted. This omission cannot be lightly ignored. It is obvious that the legislature considered the issue of intentional torts and created an exception to the statutory immunity when intentional harm was caused by the co-employee. The legislature’s failure to provide a similar exclusion to the immunity provided for the employer must be deemed to have been deliberate. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania Agricultural Co-op Marketing Association v.

This would suggest a clear legislative judgment not to recognize an intentional tort exception for employers. In view of this clear legislative expression, the Superior Court’s theory that the exclusion of intentional misconduct under sections 205 of the ODA and the WCA exhibits a legislative “general intention ... that the Act should not operate as a shield”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> of immunity for intentional torts flies in the face of a clear legislative scheme to the contrary.</p>
