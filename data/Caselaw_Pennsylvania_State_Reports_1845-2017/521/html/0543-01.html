We hold that a conviction used as an aggravating circumstance under § 9711(d)(9) which is valid at the time of the sentencing proceeding, but is later reversed and vacated, renders the jury’s finding of that aggravating circumstance invalid. We hold further that a subsequent conviction for the same crime may not be used to revive the invalid aggravating circumstance.</p>

The Commonwealth sought the imposition of the death penalty and a sentencing hearing was conducted before the jury on the following day. Evidence was introduced by the Commonwealth to establish: (1) the defendant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9), and (2) the defendant had been convicted of another Federal or State offense, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable or the defendant was undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10).</p>

Nicholas Hoffman, the Clerk of Courts of Dauphin County, identified certified copies of the official docket entries entered in both of those cases. The Commonwealth’s Exhibit No. 3, a transcript from the trial of the murder charge, indicated that Karabin had been found guilty of first degree murder by a jury on December 14, 1978 for which he received a life sentence on March 27, 1979. Exhibit No. 4, a copy of the docket entries in the aggravated assault charge, indicated that Karabin had changed his plea and had plead guilty on January 17, 1979 to that charge. On March 27, 1979, he had been sentenced to undergo a five to ten year term of imprisonment. No other evidence of aggravating circumstances was introduced by the Commonwealth.</p>

On April 9, 1979, the Commonwealth answered the petition and on April 25, 1979, the trial court denied the petition. This denial was appealed to the Superior Court on May 16, 1979.

On December 30, 1981, the Court of Common Pleas approved Karabin’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. A trial was held March 22, 1982, and resulted in a deadlock jury.

He was also facing the charge on Mr. Christiano and on the 17th of January, he pled guilty to that charge.

It may well be that the jury would have sentenced Karabin to death on the basis of his prior murder conviction, since he was already serving a life sentence and such a finding would have been fully warranted and entirely proper. However, there is no way for this court at this time to invade the deliberative process of the jury and determine what weight the jury gave the testimony of the Christiano shooting. The prosecuting attorney should have brought to the trial court’s attention the full circumstances surrounding the defendant’s guilty plea and the subsequent efforts to withdraw it, and certainly defense counsel should have strenuously objected and at least cross-examined Mr. Hoffman as to the other relevant docket entries.</blockquote>

Thus, his conviction for aggravated assault was effectively overturned. It is true that appellant was later tried and convicted on the same charge of aggravated assault. This conviction, however, occurred after sentencing in the instant case and cannot support an aggravating circumstance in determining this sentence. Here, the lower court, which was the reviewing court, determined that the aggravated assault conviction should not have been considered by the jury as an aggravating circumstance because appellant had subsequently withdrawn his guilty plea to that charge.

Although the Appellee was subsequently convicted of the same crime, the aggravating circumstance speaks of “convictions”, not of crimes.

One might gather that a previous murder and a plea to another shooting were an unremarkable paucity of effort by the appellant. The majority has, however, other more engaging quiddities to entertain them. This appellant pled guilty on January 17, 1979 to the shooting, and was sentenced on March 27, 1979, after which he filed to withdraw his guilty <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>plea. His petition was denied and he appealed to Superior Court. His appeal to withdraw his guilty plea was pending, unresolved, in August 1979 when he stood trial for the instant murder.

It is not because the appellant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea of the aggravated assault, but because he was retried and reconvicted and that conviction now stares us in the face. It was, it was not and now it is; which is to say that all that was told the jury was in fact the case: he did as he pled, shot another in the neck. The majority, unwilling to accept the staggering fact that killing while under life sentence for murder is an aggravating <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>circumstance to which more need not be added are now sending him back that a jury hear what a jury was already told. That is to say that all must be done again that was done before. This is not a case where a conviction was nullified and unusable as an aggravating circumstance, or where it stood alone. It pales beside the other killing by a killer, and seems to me an “appropriate circumstance” for us not to use our power to vacate a sentence. To do so under these circumstances, where nothing has changed from what was, in fact, told the first jury, is “extraordinary and incredible.” It is a stultifying sensitivity that can only be satisfied by a perfection we cannot obtain and yet do obvious justice to all concerned.
