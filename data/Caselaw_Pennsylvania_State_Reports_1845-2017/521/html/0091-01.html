    <p id="b157-8" data-blocks='[["BL_157.9",157,[138,876,1153,368]]]'>This case presents the question of whether the jurisdiction of a Common Pleas Court is defeated in a declaratory judgment action where all parties having claims are joined at the time of the action, but subsequently, additional claimants file suit against one of the parties and the additional claimants are not added as parties to the original declaratory judgment action.</p>
    <p id="b157-9" data-blocks='[["BL_157.10",157,[139,1262,1152,692]]]'>The factual background of the case is that J.H. France Refractories Company (hereinafter J.H. France) and its now wholly-owned subsidiary, the Van Brunt Company, between 1956 and 1972 manufactured and marketed a product containing asbestos. J.H. France also marketed and continues to market products containing silica, which, like asbestos, is claimed to cause physical injury to those who breathe it. On April 19, 1979, Gladys Temple, administratrix of the estate of Charles Temple, filed suit against J.H. France, claiming that her decedent, Charles Temple, suffered from asbestos-related diseases contracted through exposure to J.H. France’s asbestos-containing products from 1948 through 1978.</p>
    <p id="b157-10" data-blocks='[["BL_157.11",157,[138,1971,1152,370]],["BL_158.1",158,[238,282,1155,1283]]]'>J.H. France was insured during various time periods relevant to this action by the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, St. Paul, Allstate, U.S. Fire, Wausau, and Rockwood Insurance Companies. Upon receipt of this suit, J.H. France presented the Temple claim to Allstate, St. Paul and PMA for defense and indemnity, the insurers who had provided coverage between 1967 and 1979. None of these <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>insurers agreed to defend or indemnify, and J.H. France undertook its own defense. In 1981 J.H. France filed this declaratory judgment action for the purpose of determining the insurers’ duty to defend and indemnify against the Temple claim. Subsequent to the filing of this declaratory judgment action, additional asbestos and silica-related lawsuits were filed against J.H. France. Apparently because these actions were for injuries allegedly sustained during a time period which went beyond 1979 (into the 1980’s), additional insurance companies became involved. In 1984, Allstate filed its own declaratory judgment action, naming PMA, St. Paul, U.S. Fire, Wausau and Rockwood Insurance Companies, as well as fourteen individuals who had filed asbestos or silica-related lawsuits after J.H. France filed its original declaratory judgment action. Still other asbestos or silica-related claims against J.H. France were filed after Allstate’s declaratory judgment action was filed, and the claimants therein have not been joined in any pending action. J.H. France’s and Allstate’s declaratory judgment actions were consolidated, and the carriers who insured J.H. France during the relevant time periods have taken differing positions with respect to their duty to indemnify and defend. If a defense has been provided, it has been provided subject to reservation of rights.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[234,1592,1152,744]]]'>The issues at trial were whether the various insurance companies were liable for the defense and indemnification of J.H. France for claims based on exposure to its products containing asbestos and silica, and if they were liable, how the liability was to be apportioned among the insurers. The various insurance contracts could be adjudicated in one action because the relevant language was virtually identical in all of the contracts. The trial court, acting on J.H. France’s motion for summary judgment, worked out a scheme, not relevant here, in which the various insurers were required to defend and indemnify against asbestos or silica related claims made against J.H. France and determined that the insurers had not acted in bad faith in failing to defend or indemnify at an earlier time.</p>

For the following reasons, we reverse the order of Superior Court and remand for that court’s determination of the substantive issues raised in the appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

Superior Court ruled that the failure to join these additional parties in the pending declaratory judgment actions defeated common pleas’ jurisdiction, citing <em>Vale Chemical Co. v.

First, this Court has held that once the jurisdiction of a court attaches, it continues until the cause is finally determined. <em>Get Set Organization v.

Secondly, were we to decide otherwise, we would be, in practical effect, depriving parties such as these access to declaratory judgment actions, for the expense and inconvenience of constantly adding parties as new claims surface would defeat the purpose of simplicity and efficiency of this form of action.</p>
