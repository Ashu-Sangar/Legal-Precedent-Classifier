Erdman (social hosts who allegedly served alcoholic beverages to defendant Howe); and twenty-two individual property owners (who allegedly owned the road which led into the intersection).

    <p id="b587-8" data-blocks='[["BL_587.7",587,[170,877,1155,871]]]'>I agree with the majority herein that Superior Court properly quashed as interlocutory the appeal from the order of Common Pleas Judge DiBona refusing to reconsider his order denying the Pfaumers’ petition to transfer. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 311(c). Similarly, I agree with the majority that Judge DiBona’s ruling on the Pfaumers’ petition was contrary to jurisprudential policy and his interpretation of Judge White’s order as applying only to the Denison petition was in error. It is at this juncture I part company with the majority in its conclusion that the Pfaumers are not entitled to transfer of venue pursuant to Judge White’s order. For the reason set forth in the following section, I must disagree with the majority’s conclusion that this matter should be returned to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County for that court to rule on the Pfaumers’ petition.</p>

This occurs because the majority engrafts on to Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1) a requirement that a judge in determining <em>forum non conveniens </em>must conduct a hearing in order to develop a record on which to base his order. The plain language of the rule does not require such a result. Furthermore, Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1) is distinguishable from Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(2) which requires a hearing when parties seeking a change of venue have alleged reasons why a fair trial can not occur in the county. <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>The contrasting language of these subsections serves to confirm that a hearing is not required to develop a record in the case <em>sub judice.</em>

    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[215,510,1159,1219]]]'>Review of the record indicates, however, there was an adequate factual basis for Judge White to have made his decision. In fact, the information before Judge White was virtually indistinguishable from that presented to Judge DiBona, which was later used by Superior Court to finally determine not to transfer the action to Montgomery County. Furthermore, in contrast to Superior Court’s determination that there was limited information in the petition and answer, review of the record reveals that both of those documents were accompanied by extensive memoranda of law. This detailed information supplied by the parties addressed each of the important considerations affecting their interests. <em>See Fox v. Pennsylvania Power and Light Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/315/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="315 Pa.

Because no abuse of discretion can be attributed to Judge White, it can be discerned that Superior Court merely substituted its own judgment for that of Judge White. <em>See Iole v.
