      <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>On January 29, 1982, appellee, Donald K. MaeConnell, Chief of Police of South Whitehall Township, issued a memorandum to all personnel indicating that township police officers were not issuing a suitable number of traffic citations, warnings, and parking tickets. The memorandum cautioned that any officer who fell below the average number of contacts made in the preceding month would be advised that he was below the department norm. On February 8, 1983, appellee issued a second memorandum which expressed concern about the minimal number of traffic citations and DWI arrests being made by the officers, and which established a minimum number of contacts that a police officer would be required to make. These “contacts” were described as citations, warnings, and field interrogations. Failure to meet this standard would result in progressively more serious sanctions and would culminate in a letter of termination.</p>

Appellant later amended the complaint to include, as part of the challenged policy, a memorandum issued by Chief MaeConnell on December 26, 1985. This third memorandum required 25 contacts per month and gave as examples of such contacts: 1) investigation of a citizen complaint made directly to a police officer; 2) issuance of a warning or citation; 3) apprehension/contact with or arrest of a suspect or suspicious person or vehicle; 4) engagement in the abatement of a problem; and 5) submission of a complaint initiated by the officer.</p>

The trial court granted appellees’ motion for summary judgment, stating that appellant could represent “the uniformed police <em>only </em>with respect to collective bargaining,” and therefore lacked standing to pursue the litigation which was brought <em>dehors </em>the bargaining agreement. Opinion of the Court at 6 (Oct. 30, 1986) (emphasis in original). The trial court also noted that this result was consistent with a Commonwealth Court determination that the recipients of traffic citations issued pursuant to a quota system could not maintain a class action for declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis of Act 114. <em>Woolston v.

They are afraid that the language of this bill — and I have to agree with them— would prohibit the supervisors and administrators of police departments from ever saying to a police officer, ever calling him forward before them and saying, why have you not given a ticket in the last month? I do not think the bill intends to do that. The bill speaks to what is perceived to be a problem which people have complained about in this Commonwealth for years, about local police departments have quotas to meet and officers giving unwarranted tickets as a result to meet their quotas. Certainly nobody can be in favor of that. But the language of the bill, if you look at it, seems to go an awful lot further than that. It talks about no political subdivision being permitted in any manner, directly or indirectly, from suggesting to any police officer that he issue a certain number of traffic citations during a certain period. And I do think that that would prevent a police chief or police captain from asking one of his patrolmen why that individual had not issued any traffic citations, for example, in the past quarter when all of the individual’s coworkers might have given out 10 or 15 or 20 traffic tickets during that same period.</blockquote>
