The subject matter of this case concerns the constitutionality of the State Employees’ Retirement Code of 1974, 71 Pa.C.S. §§ 5101-5956 (“1974 Code”), which reduced pension benefits for members of the Commonwealth judiciary taking office after March 1, 1974, and the 1983 amendment thereto, which increased the basic contribution without a corresponding increase in benefits.</p>

This argument is meritless as these two factors fail to illustrate that judges entering service on or after March 1, 1974, are adequately compensated. We are not convinced that a large number of applicants for judicial vacancies demonstrates the availability of qualified applicants for judicial service. Indeed, the mere fact that one has a law degree does not show that he is competent to be a judge. In addition, we are not persuaded that the compensation of judges is adequate simply because certain private organizations provide fewer retirement benefits than those offered to judges. As we have previously noted, retirement benefits are a <em>part </em>of total compensation. To properly compare compensation offered by the private sector with compensation offered by the public sector, total compensation must be evaluated. Moreover, a true comparison cannot be made without considering the training, responsibility, education and experience of the individuals whose salary packages are being compared.</p>

In those instances the quarrel centered upon the failure of a legislative body to provide adequate funds for the performance of the mandated judicial responsibilities. Thus the crux of the dispute in those cases was the determination of the adequacy of the funds supplied for the designated purpose. In this case the legislature has designated the compensation package that it has deemed to be adequate for judges serving on the courts of common pleas. Thus there is no dispute as to adequacy but rather the instant complaint relates to the legislative body’s departure from its own determination. Having determined the compensation package,that should be paid for judges serving on the courts of common pleas, the legislature was bound to provide that same package for all judges serving on that bench.
