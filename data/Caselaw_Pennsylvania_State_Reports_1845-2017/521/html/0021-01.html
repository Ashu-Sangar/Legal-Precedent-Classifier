Harvilla, was a passenger in<a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>jured in a vehicle driven by Appellee, Rodney J. Delcamp and owned by Appellee, Timothy M. Rupp. The pertinent facts of the case are as follows. On December 7, 1979, Harvilla, Delcamp, Rupp and two other young men were at a party and after some discussion decided to go on a hunting trip to the Pocono Mountains. All of the men drank beer at the party before leaving at approximately 3:00 a.m. on the morning of December 8, 1979. The men arrived at their destination at dawn. None of them slept during the trip.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[255,858,1152,617]]]'>After the group entered the woods Harvilla and Delcamp became cold and decided to return to the Rupp car which had a working heater. When they got into the car they drank more beer and then decided to get something to eat. Delcamp drove the car and eventually discovered a diner where they ate breakfast and, again, drank beer. After leaving the diner, Harvilla, recognizing that Delcamp was drunk, fought with him about who would drive the car. Unfortunately, Delcamp refused to let Harvilla drive and on the way back to the hunting site the car left the road and smashed into a tree. Both men were injured as a result of the accident.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[252,1502,1153,415]]]'>Harvilla brought a suit against Delcamp for negligent operation of the vehicle and against Rupp, the owner of the car, under the theory of <em>respondeat superior. </em>At trial Harvilla testified that he fell asleep and did not know how the accident happened. Delcamp testified that he had no memory of how the car left the roadway and smashed into the tree. At the close of Harvilla’s case Appellees Rupp and Delcamp moved for compulsory nonsuits.</p>

Additionally, a compulsory nonsuit is valid only in a clear case where the facts and circumstances lead to one conclusion — the absence of liability. <em>McKenzie v.

Goldberg, </em><a href="/pa/375/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="375 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1244394" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0397-01">375 Pa. 397</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">100 A.2d 630</a> (1953), a case very similar to the case at bar. In <em>Kotal </em>both the plaintiff/passenger and defendant/driver died in an automobile accident and, thus, were unable to testify. However, evidence was presented at trial that the car was traveling at an excessive rate of speed. The defendant, who sought a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, argued that the driver committed “no proven act of negligence” and that the jury was permitted to speculate as <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>to the cause of the accident. Justice Musmanno, writing for a majority of the Court, held that where an automobile “dashes completely off the highway with such velocity that the car overturns numerous times, [the plaintiff/passenger] has no legal burden to explain the mechanical, mental or muscular lapse which precipitated the catastrophe”. <em><a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/375/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="375 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1244394" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0397-01">375 Pa. at 403</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">100 A.2d at 633</a>. Thus, this court found that the disputed facts and inferences concerning the negligence of the driver (including the evidence of excessive speed) and the cause of the accident were properly submitted to and resolved by the jury. <em><a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[251,936,1155,799]]]'>If speed was, in the words of Justice Musmanno the “burden” of the lawsuit in <em>Kotal, </em>fatigue and intoxication are the central theme in the present case. First, Harvilla testified that he and Delcamp drank beer after returning to the car from the woods, and after eating breakfast at the diner. Furthermore, he specifically described Delcamp as being intoxicated just before the accident. More importantly, Delcamp admitted that he drank approximately two six packs of beer at the party, did not sleep on the trip to the Poconos, and was “drunk and a little light headed due to lack of sleep” when he and Harvilla left the woods. N.T. March 29, 30, 1983 at p. 91. Therefore, the numerous references in the record describing Delcamp’s fatigue and intoxication, provided circumstantial evidence of his negligence, sufficient to preclude a nonsuit.</p>

As Justice Musmanno clearly explained in <em>Kotal, </em>a plaintiff “is not required to produce a blueprint to show why the offending motorist acted in the manner he did”. <em><a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/375/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="375 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1244394" data-case-paths="/pa/375/0397-01">375 Pa. at 403</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20630" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="100 A.2d 630">100 A.2d at 633</a>.</p>

This case, by contrast, presents no evidence of negligence, unless it be asserted that driving after consuming an unspecified quantity of alcohol over an unspecified period, without more, constitutes negligence, which is not the law, or that driving while fatigued is negligent.

Clearly, a plaintiff need not “eliminate every conceivable cause of an accident in order to recover,” or, in Justice Musmanno’s graphic parlance, “produce a blue print to show <em>why </em>the offending motorist acted in the manner he did.” But the plaintiff must produce <em>some </em>evidence of negligence, as he did in <em>Kotal, </em>where there was proof of undue speed.
