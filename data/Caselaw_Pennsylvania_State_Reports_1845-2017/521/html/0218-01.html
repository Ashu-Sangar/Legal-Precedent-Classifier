Simmon was later charged with aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2701, 2702; recklessly endangering another person, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2705; and possession of an instrument of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 907.</p>

Simmon’s testimony differed markedly. According to her version of the events, Hood confronted her about Armstead and then began to hit Simmon with her fist. Although Simmon did not see that Hood had a weapon, she was sure Hood had something because of the prior incidents in which Hood had followed Simmon and her daughter with a knife. Simmon testified further that while she told Hood to leave her alone, Hood kept coming at her. Finally, out of fear that Hood would use a weapon, as she had previously threatened to do, Simmon testified she drew her own knife in self defense and wounded Hood. N.T. 65-68.</p>

In a memorandum opinion and order, the Superior Court panel affirmed the judgment of sentence. Acknowledging that juvenile records are generally inadmissible for impeachment purposes, the court stated these records, however, are admissible to demonstrate bias because of the vulnerable status as a probationer as well as possible concern the witness might be a suspect in the investigation. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In <em>Slaughter, </em>midway through cross-examination of the prosecution’s key identification witness, defense counsel requested the prosecuting assistant district attorney to give him a copy of the witness’s juvenile record. The trial court in that case refused the request based on a belief that any questioning of witness, Anthony Ragland, by defense counsel regarding Ragland’s juvenile record would have been improper.

We have most recently reaffirmed this position in <em>Commonwealth v.

In support of its mandate to look to the record to determine whether the evidence supports a bias claim, Superior Court mistakenly relies on <em>Mines, supra. </em>However, <em>Mines </em>was not a case in which the court did not allow defense counsel access to the prosecution witness’s juvenile record but rather denied counsel the opportunity to use the witness’s probationary status for purposes of cross-examination.</p>

Although Appellant’s counsel was permitted to cross-examine Hood, counsel was unable, based on the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s motion in limine, to adequately develop the issue of bias. This limited cross-examination was fatal to Appellant’s defense. Hood was the sole prosecution witness who could testify as to the events that transpired during the confrontation with Simmon. Because Hood’s testimony was the crucial link in the proof of Appellant’s act, the accuracy and truthfulness of Hood’s testimony became key elements in the Commonwealth’s case. Without being permitted to expose the facts bearing on the reliability of Hood, Appellant was denied her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation through effective cross-examination.

Indeed, it might precede the prosecutor’s involvement by providing the motivation for the complainant to report that she had been assaulted.
