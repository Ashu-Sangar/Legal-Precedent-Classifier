During the early afternoon, the appellant and the victim were observed relaxing at lakeside listening to the radio and alternately swimming and sitting in the sun. Later that afternoon the appellant and the victim left the immediate lakefront area and walked approximately two miles over rural roads to a country tavern known as Phillips Manor. They arrived there sometime between 4:45 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. There was no evidence that either had anything to <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>drink prior to going to Phillips Manor.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Both were sober when they arrived.</p>

The appellant ordered a shot of whiskey and a beer; the victim ordered a rum and coke. The pair struck up a conversation with other patrons at the bar. Later, the victim started into a game of shuffleboard with some of those other patrons. Sometime later the appellant ordered five quarts of beer to take out. The bartender filled the order, putting the bottles in a paper bag. The bag of beer sat on the bar while the appellant continued conversing with others and the victim continued to play the shuffleboard game. After the appellant and the victim had been in the tavern for an hour or so they became loud and boisterous, using profanities and vulgarities in their conversations. The bartender, judging that the victim had become intoxicated, refused to serve her any more alcoholic drinks. He did continue to serve the appellant who began to order double shots of whiskey. Although the double shots were ordered by and served to the appellant, the victim drank most of them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The victim, who was now intoxicated, took the bag of beer from the bar and went outside. A short time later the appellant learned that the victim, either intentionally or accidentally, dropped the bag in the parking lot breaking all of the bottles of beer. This angered the appellant and he stated “I’m going to f_in’ kill her.” “All f_in’ broads need to be put in their place.” (N.T. 3/14/85, p. 12.) The appellant then <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>ordered five more quarts of beer which were placed in another paper bag. The appellant kept this bag beside him at the bar. The victim re-entered the tavern and returned to the bar near the appellant. She and the appellant continued their loud and boisterous conduct, annoying and causing some concern to the others in the tavern. After an unpleasant exchange of words with another tavern patron, the appellant picked up the bag from the bar and he and the victim began to leave. On their way out the appellant banged the victim into the door and door jamb as they proceeded to the outside. Once in the parking lot the victim fell to the ground a couple of times and while she was down the appellant kicked her in her side and rib cage. He pulled her up by the arm and dragged her a distance in the lot. The victim was then knocked to the ground once again, this time she fell with such force that she banged the back of her head on the ground. The appellant pulled her up only to have her go crashing to the ground once again. This time the bandanna she was wearing came off her head and the appellant picked it up and tied it around his head. The appellant picked her up once more and she was staggering as she and the appellant proceeded into the woods. It was sometime between 6:30 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. that the appellant and the victim had left the tavern and disappeared into the woods. Shortly thereafter, fearing that they might return, the bartender called the police. He asked that a police officer stop by the tavern because he feared that the appellant would return and cause trouble.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

He noticed nothing unusual or out of the ordinary upon his arrival. He went into the tavern and learned that the reason why the police were called was because of the boisterous and menacing conduct <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>of the appellant who had left a short time earlier. Officer Pozza was told by some of the patrons that they believed the appellant and the victim were still in the area. He was informed that they had gone into the woods next to the parking lot. Three patrons of the tavern, Florence Healey, Joyce Davis and Bill Davis went outside with officer Pozza to show him where the appellant and the victim had gone. Florence Healey proceeded into the woods with Joyce Davis lagging behind her. She went in at the same place that the appellant and the victim had entered. A short piece into the woods she observed the appellant with his pants down, kneeling on his hands and knees. She could see his bare back and behind. She could not see the victim. She immediately retreated from the woods and said to the police officers that it appeared that the parties were in there having sex.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[166,1183,1159,1016]]]'>Officer Pozza went into the woods and he observed the appellant in a semi-crouched position in a ravine right next •to the victim who was partially nude and lying by a stream. The victim’s panties were pulled down to her ankles and her top was pulled up so that her breasts were exposed. From his angle of view he could not see her face but he did observe that she had blood on her legs. The appellant had blood on his shirt and about his face, beard and forehead. Officer Pozza was accompanied into the woods by officer Petronchak of the Archbald Borough Police Department. The two officers working together were able to get the appellant to come up out of the ravine. Appellant had some difficulty negotiating the steep slope with an open quart bottle of beer in his hand. When he reached the top, officer Pozza kicked the bottle out of his hand and the appellant was made to lie on the ground. At this point he was cuffed with his arms behind his back. Without anyone asking him a question, the appellant blurted out: “I didn’t do anything” and “She’s okay.” (N.T. March 12, 1985, pp. 18, 19.)</p>

The victim had been beaten savagely; her face was a flattened mass of <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>blood, wounds, tears, bruises and broken bones. Subsequent examination revealed that there were seven major fractures and numerous tiny fractures of the victim’s face. The rest of her body was marked by at least thirty-five human bite wounds. The victim had been bitten on her chest, breasts, stomach, thighs, pelvis, arms and hands. The bite marks were vicious, deep and penetrating. The bites on her breasts were so deep and cruel that the nipple on her right breast was almost completely removed and the nipple on the left breast was severely lacerated. There were other circular marks in the same general areas of her body which were incomplete and thus could not be identified as human bites. Many of the bites showed bruising around them and bleeding indicating they were inflicted while the victim was still alive. Also many of them showed-slippage or blurring at one edge indicating that the victim was moving when the bite was inflicted. The bites on the victim’s arms and hands were defensive wounds indicating that she was trying to defend herself from the merciless attack. Additionally, there were tears and bruises on the victim’s vagina. The cause of death was traumatic strangulation with significant conditions being facial and skull fractures, and numerous contusions, abrasions and lacerations. The strangulation was accomplished by a metal choker twisted around her neck with such force that the hyoid bone, which lays on top of the voice box, was fractured. There was considerable bruising and bleeding that extended all the way back to her spinal column. Dr. Thomas DiSilvo, the pathologist who performed the autopsy testified that there was no place on the victim’s face that was unmarked by injury. The blows to the face were not random blows. They had a pattern to them so as to systematically cover every area of her face. Further, Dr. DiSilvio testified that considerable force is required to break facial bones as the victim’s were broken in this case. The bites, like the blows to her face, were not random bites. Except for the defensive wounds, the bites were systematically inflicted in sexual areas of the victim’s body.</p>

A conversation developed among the three prisoners during which the appellant seemed to boast about his responsibility for the death of Debbie Prislupsky. Appellant admitted that, against her will, he dragged the victim into the woods, lowered her panties to her ankles, took one of her legs out of her panties and forcibly started to have sexual intercourse with her. Further, appellant stated that when he was unable to reach a climax and get satisfied he started to punch and bite the victim — biting her on her breasts, stomach, legs and pubic area.

After the jury returned its verdict of murder of the first degree, the court took a short recess before beginning the penalty hearing. During the recess the prosecutor informed appellant’s counsel that the Commonwealth intended to raise and establish rape and torture as aggravating circumstances. When the penalty phase began the appellant objected to the introduction of any evidence tending to establish torture because he had no prior notice that the Commonwealth intended to proceed on that theory. The trial court overruled appellant’s objection and permitted the Commonwealth to produce evidence of torture and proceed on that basis. The trial court held that there was no rule that required pre-trial notice of the aggravating circumstances which the Commonwealth intended to prove at the penalty hearing. The trial court suggested that <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>there was no such rule because an aggravating circumstance can arise out of the evidence as it is presented at the trial to establish the accused’s guilt. The Commonwealth contends that this is exactly what happened in this case. The circumstance of torture did not arise until the testimony of the pathologist was received into evidence during trial. Dr. DiSilvio testified that the victim suffered seven major fractures to her face and numerous minor fractures. He stated:</p>

This required, probably, at least, five blows of an average size fist, and probably more, but at least five blows systematically covering every area of this face — from the top of the right eye down to the bottom of the left side of the jaw.

There were thirty-five of these, many of which pierced the surface of the skin, and they had a very unusual distribution____ I found four on the right breast including the nipple area. There were two large ones over the nipple area almost completely removing the right nipple____ There was one on the left breast at the nipple area which was also severely lacerated, or torn, one up here on the thorax, sort of a double one, and six on the abdomen, two on the pelvis, on the fatty part of the female body that the pubic hair is on.
