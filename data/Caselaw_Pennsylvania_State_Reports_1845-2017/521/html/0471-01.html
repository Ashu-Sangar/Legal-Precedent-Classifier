The O’Reilly’s claimed they were eligible for a full dollar-for-dollar credit against their tax liability as a consequence of earned income taxes paid in those years to the Republic of Ireland. This claim was based upon the enabling act, which provided for a taxpayer credit for “payment of any tax on income to any State other than Pennsylvania.” 53 P.S. § 6914. Their claim was denied on March 26, 1982. On April 21, 1982, the O’Reillys again filed a claim, on the same basis, for $7,978.98 based on earned income taxes paid to Fox Chapel in 1981. This claim was denied on November 2, 1982. The basis of these denials was the taxing authority’s position that the tax credit only applied to taxes paid to “states” which were part of the United States.</p>

In a later opinion and order, dated May 7, 1986, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denied the counterclaim for additional taxes, holding that taxpayers may deduct business losses from earned income in computing their local tax. Cross appeals to the Commonwealth Court were filed, and that court affirmed both lower court orders on June 10, 1987.

One of those rules is that statutory provisions exempting persons and property from taxation shall be strictly construed, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(5). Thus, where as here a tax statute provides for an exemption of taxation on a certain portion of property, that exemption should be limited to the terms stated, and any ambiguity should be resolved against an expansion of the exemption.</p>

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[231,462,1154,1015]]]'>Both lower courts deemed it significant that in drafting this statute the General Assembly found it necessary to modify the phrase “any State” with the phrase “other than Pennsylvania”. It is another rule of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed to attach importance to every word. <em>Commonwealth v. Lobiondo, </em><a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">501 Pa. 599</a>, 603, <a href="/pa/501/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="501 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1782462" data-case-paths="/pa/501/0599-01">462 A.2d 662</a>, 664 (1983). <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. 1921(a). Consequently, we must presume that the latter phrase was not mere surplusage. If, however, as the O’Reillys contend, the word “State” was to be given a broad generic interpretation the inclusion of the phrase “other than Pennsylvania” would have been wholly unnecessary. Therefore, we are constrained to find that the legislature had some reason for phrasing section 6914 in the manner in which it did. The most logical reason is that the legislature intended the phrase to distinguish Pennsylvania from other “states” of the same general type, specifically other “states” of the whole of which Pennsylvania is a part, to wit: the United States of America.</p>
