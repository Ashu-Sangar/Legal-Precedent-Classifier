The Abington Township police officer who investigated the accident noticed a strong odor of alcohol on Appellant’s breath and conducted a field sobriety test. When Appellant could not pass the test, the officer arrested Appellant for driving under the influence of alcohol. Appellant was immediately advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and taken to the Township Police Station where he was again given his <em>Miranda </em>rights in written form. The document was read to Appellant and he was asked to respond to each question in writing. Paragraph 6 of the form asked, “Do you want to talk to a lawyer at this time or have a lawyer with you while we ask you questions?” Appellant initially answered this question “No”, but subsequently changed his answer to “Yes”.</p>

At this point, the facts are somewhat disputed. Appellant testified before the trial court that he refused to take the test and that he told the officer that he was refusing because he had not been permitted to contact his attorney. The officer testified that Appellant refused three times and that he gave no reason for his refusal. The officer also testified that after the third refusal Appellant was permitted to call his lawyer and that following this conversation, Appellant was willing to submit to the breathalyzer test, but that the officer refused to administer the test because he had been unable to observe Appellant personally for the past 35-45 minutes.</p>

The question in the case then, is whether the refusal was a knowing one. Appellant asserted at the hearing before the trial court that he refused to take the test because he was misled into believing that he was entitled to confer with an attorney prior to deciding to take the test. On direct examination, Appellant explained that he told the arresting officer he was refusing to take the test for the following reason:</p>
    <blockquote id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[189,1493,1108,95]]]'>... I would not take the test until I was able to speak to a lawyer. That was the grounds on that answer.</blockquote>

Thus, the trial court was confronted with two witnesses who remembered the events of June 19, 1983 quite differently and who was in the position to decide for himself which of the two witnesses was more credible. The trial court chose to believe Appellant and his findings in this regard are conclusive. It was not for the Commonwealth Court to read into the record, weigh the evidence, and to decide for itself that Appellant did or did not state his <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>reasons to the officer or that Appellant could or could not recall what he said to the officer. That, as we have said, was for the trial court to do. We read this record to contain evidence which can support Appellant’s position, that he was misled into thinking that he had a right to speak to his attorney before taking the breathalyzer test, and therefore affirm the trial court’s findings in Appellant’s favor. To the extent that the Commonwealth Court chose to accept and reject portions of Appellant’s testimony and, in effect, to make its own findings of fact, it exceeded its scope of review and its decision must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[260,898,1155,573]]]'>Appellant also argues, however, that this whole controversy arose because the request to take the breathalyzer test came hot on the heels of the <em>Miranda </em>questioning. Appellant specifically chose to exercise his right to speak to his attorney before proceeding any further in any questioning dealing with the drunk driving charges. Since the Appellant chose to exercise his rights, the arresting officer promptly and properly stopped any questioning, but did not let Appellant make his phone call. Instead, the officer began his requests that Appellant submit to the breathalyzer test.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[253,1500,1158,852]]]'>Appellant argues that when he chose to exercise his right to speak with an attorney and his request was met with a request to take a test, he was confused. The Department argues that a driver’s responsibility to take a breathalyzer test arises in a civil, not criminal, context and no right to speak to counsel is implicated. Accordingly, the Department argues that since Appellant was properly placed under arrest and asked to submit to the test and told the consequences if he refused to submit to the test, he was told all that the law required. The Department concludes that anything short of an unqualified assent to take the test under these circumstances is viewed as a refusal and cites various Commonwealth Court decisions in this area of the law supportive of the argument that confusion arising as to whether a driver may speak to an attorney is not a sufficient reason to refuse to submit to the breathalyzer test.</p>
