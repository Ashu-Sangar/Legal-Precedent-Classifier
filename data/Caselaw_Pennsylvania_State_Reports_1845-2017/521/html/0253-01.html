Many municipalities, of course, including Northampton, <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>have built only sewer lines (interceptors) to collect effluent and pass it through to other municipalities which actually treat the sewage in their own plants. In these cases, DER interprets the language of the statute to require payment only to those which qualify within the meaning of its regulation 103.25(e)(1): “Interceptors which are considered integral portions of the sewage treatment works____ That portion of an interceptor between the treatment facility and the first connection.”</p>
    <p id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[157,789,1155,750]]]'>Here, Northampton County created a municipal authority, Northampton, Bucks County Municipal Authority (NBCMA) which built three sewer lines, the Pine Run Interceptor, the Iron Works Creek Interceptor, and the N-IWPR Interceptor. Pine Run and Iron Works collect sewage from the many sources along their routes. They form a junction (Langhorne Avenue) which connects to the N-IWPR Interceptor which, in turn, runs to the boundary of Northampton and Lower Southampton Townships where it becomes the Neshaminy Interceptor. The Neshaminy line then proceeds to the Philadelphia Northeast Treatment Works for proper disposal. The N-IWPR Interceptor carries the materials from Pine Run and Iron Works only and does not collect other sewage along its route.</p>
    <p id="b321-7" data-blocks='[["BL_321.6",321,[155,1571,1154,357]]]'>In 1981, 1982 and 1983, NBCMA filed timely applications with DER for the yearly subsidies, authorized by Act 339, for the entire lengths of Pine Run, Iron Creek, and NIWPR. NBCMA has maintained consistently that <em>all </em>of its lines are an “integral” part of the “treatment facilities” and “plant system” and thereby qualify for state payments under Act 339.</p>
    <p id="b321-8" data-blocks='[["BL_321.7",321,[153,1969,1153,368]],["BL_322.1",322,[260,282,1152,98]]]'>DER rejected eligibility by applying the “first connection” regulation and paid NBCMA only for the costs of the N-IWPR line lying between the conjunction of Pine Run and Iron Creek at Langhorne Avenue and the Neshaminy Interceptor. DER, in effect, argues that state subsidies under Act 339 are available only for the construction between where the municipality’s lines join at Langhorne <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>Avenue, the “first connection,” and the N-IWPR segment which runs into the Neshaminy Interceptor.</p>
    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.5",322,[257,399,1153,791]]]'>In essence, DER’s argument rests on various interpretations and definitions. First, the agency distinguishes between “collecting” interceptors (Pine Run and Iron Creek) and “conveying” interceptors (N-IWPR and Neshaminy). Second, it argues that only “conveying” interceptors qualify as “integral” and “essential” to the “plant” because without them the “plant” could not function; the “conveying” line, which does not “collect” from sources other than Pine Run and Iron Creek, thereby is part of the “plant” itself. Finally, DER argues that only by drawing such a line at the “first connection” is it possible to implement the limitations on subsidies envisioned by the statute’s qualifying language and legislative intent not to fund all sewer lines, as evidenced as well by the limited budget appropriation for this purpose.</p>
    <p id="b322-5" data-blocks='[["BL_322.6",322,[252,1209,1157,798]]]'>For its part, NBCMA insists that DER’s interpretation of the statute is arbitrary and capricious and unenforceable as applied to this case. In particular, the Authority argues that the use of the word “system” connotes a broad legislative intent to cover and fund <em>all </em>sewer lines rather than only those within the fence of the plant. Moreover, the Regulation flies in the face of the purposes of the Clean Stream Program, especially by discouraging municipalities from embarking on expensive construction projects. Lastly, NBCMA alleges that a fundamental discrepancy exists between 103.25(e)(1) and subsection (2) which appears to apply eligibility to interceptors “back to the point of interception of the furthest untreated sewage discharge from the plant.” Such contradiction, it is argued, affirms the unreasonableness of the entire Regulation.</p>

The Board decided specifically that, “Therefore, the General Assembly did not intend all interceptors to be eligible in the basis for calculating subsidies under Act 339, but only those that are an ‘integral part of <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>the treatment facilities/ and those that are ‘essential to the sewage treatment plant system.’ ” Furthermore, “the Board believes that the first connection interim is not an irrational basis for distinguishing which interceptors are integral for purposes of Act 339.” (Reproduced Record, 193a, 195a). The Commonwealth Court also concluded “that the Section 103.25(e)(1) first connection limitation is reasonable.” <em>Northampton, Bucks County Municipal Authority v.
