In so doing, the Superior Court relied upon earlier cases from this Court, the most recent of which is <em>Hughes v.

Because we disagree with the Superior Court’s <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>analysis regarding the continued viability of the reasonable relationship requirement, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[239,424,1154,748]]]'>In <em>Hughes, </em>the plaintiff was hurled by the defendant across a 7V2 foot hallway resulting in the plaintiffs arm being fractured. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $2,500 compensatory damages and $5,000 in punitive damages. After the plaintiff agreed to a $2,000 remittitur of the punitive damages, the judgment was entered for $5,500. We affirmed the compensatory damages but reduced the punitive damages from $3,000 to $1,000. In doing so, we stated that punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, but gave no legal or policy reasons why. In fact, we relied upon Section 908 of the Restatement of Torts and analyzed the verdict in conjunction with the factors set forth in Section 908(2).</p>

While comment (e) does speak in terms of proportionality, the elements being compared are the wealth of the defendant and the seriousness of the acts committed. Thus if a wealthy person commits a rather heinous act, nominal punitive damages will not deter either that person or any other similarly situated person from committing a similar act. Therefore, when this Court required proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages in <em>Hughes, </em>we misconstrued comment (e) and substituted our own judgment for that of the jury in evaluating the factors set forth in Section 908. We will not perpetuate this misreading of the rule offered by the Restatement.</p>

    <p id="b165-4" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[162,534,1152,532]]]'>In <em>Hilbert v. Roth, </em><a href="/pa/395/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="395 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1282769" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0270-01">395 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.2d%20648" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="149 A.2d 648">149 A.2d 648</a> (1959), we stated that an award of punitive damages is not appropriate if actual damages have not been suffered. However, in <em>Hilbert </em>the plaintiff attempted to pursue an independent cause of action for punitive damages since the cause of action for compensatory damages had been dismissed. Since punitive damages are an element of damages arising out of the initial cause of action, if that cause of action is dismissed, the punitive damages which are incident to actual damages cannot stand.</p>

In <em>Rhoads, </em>Superior Court affirmed a punitive damage award to two injured parties notwithstanding that neither party received any compensatory damages for personal injuries. In doing so, the Superi- or Court distinguished between an independent and a derivative action for punitive damages. If no cause of action exists, then no independent action exists for a claim of punitive damage since punitive damages is only an <em>element </em>of damages. To this extent, punitive damages must, by necessity, be related to the injury-producing cause of action. This does not mean, however, that specific compensatory damages must be awarded to sustain a punitive damage award. In <em>Hilbert, </em>when the underlying cause of action was dismissed, there existed no cause of action upon which the plaintiff could claim punitive damages. <em>Hilbert </em>is distinguishable from <em>Rhoads </em>in that in <em>Rhoads </em>damages were not awarded, however, liability was determined on the facts and punitive damages were awarded predicated upon the finding of liability.</p>

      <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>Likewise, in <em>Laniecki, </em>the Superior Court affirmed a judgment of only punitive damages in a libel action. The jury had returned a verdict for the plaintiff and had awarded only punitive damages believing that the plaintiffs reputation had been satisfactorily reinstated, thereby negating any compensatory damages. In affirming the award, the Superior Court reviewed the record and concluded that the plaintiff sustained a cause of action for compensatory damages even though he did not receive a monetary award for them. However, once a cause of action was proven, the jury was permitted to award punitive damages as an element of damages incident to the cause of action. Even though compensatory damages had not been awarded, punitive damages could be appropriate, the critical factor being the establishment of sufficient evidence to sustain the cause of action.</p>

    <blockquote id="Ac1n" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[266,1472,1110,418]]]'>(2) Punitive damages may be awarded for conduct that is outrageous, because of the defendant’s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others. In assessing punitive damages, the trier of fact can properly consider the character of the defendant’s act, the nature and extent of the harm to the plaintiff that the defendant caused or intended to cause and the wealth of the defendant.</blockquote>
    <p id="b166-5" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[221,1923,1153,424]]]'>Noticeably missing from Section 908(2) is any requirement that an award of punitive damages be proportional to compensatory damages. Section 908(2) sets forth three factors to be considered in awarding punitive damages: 1) the character of the act; 2) the nature and extent of the harm, and 3) the wealth of the defendant. It is for the jury to weigh these factors in arriving at an appropriate punitive damage award.</p>
    <p id="b167-3" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[167,282,1154,856]]]'>
      <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>Finally, in <em>Martin, </em>a plurality decision, Justice Hutchinson, writing for himself and Justice Flaherty, stated that “in order to recover punitive damages the plaintiff must first prove actual compensatory damages____ (citations omitted). Any punitive damages which are awarded must then bear a reasonable relationship to those actual compensatory damages____ (citations omitted).” <a href="/pa/508/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="508 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1793984" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0154-01">508 Pa. at 173</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="508 Pa. 154" data-case-ids="1793984" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0154-01">494 A.2d at 1098</a>. The genesis for this theory appears to have arisen out of products liability litigation as an attempt to prevent a single plaintiff from receiving punitive damages owed to all consumers as the result of a defendant’s decision to place a defective product on the market. In addition to the fact that this proposition did not command a majority, the harm it was intended to prevent is not present in this case. Therefore, any reliance upon <em>Martin </em>in the appeal <em>sub judice </em>would be misplaced.</p>
    <p id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[165,1164,1155,1179]],["BL_168.1",168,[247,289,1151,153]]]'>If the purpose of punitive damages is to punish a tortfeasor for outrageous conduct and to deter him or others from similar conduct, then a requirement of proportionality defeats that purpose. It is for this reason that the wealth of the tortfeasor is relevant. In making its determination, the jury has the function of weighing the conduct of the tortfeasor against the amount of damages which would deter such future conduct. In performing this duty, the jury must weigh the intended harm against the tortfeasor’s wealth. If we were to adopt the Appellee’s theory, outrageous conduct, which only by luck results in nominal damages, would not be deterred and the sole purpose of a punitive damage award would be frustrated. If the resulting punishment is relatively small when compared to the potential reward of his actions, it might then be feasible for a tortfeasor to attempt the same outrageous conduct a second time. If the amount of punitive damages must bear a reasonable relationship to the injury suffered, then those damages probably would not serve as a deterrent. It becomes clear that requiring punitive damages to be reasonably related to compensatory damages would not only usurp the jury’s function of weighing the factors set forth <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>in Section 908 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, but would also prohibit victims of malicious conduct, who fortuitously were not harmed, from deterring future attacks.</p>

In those rare instances, the court is given discretion to remit the damages to a more reasonable amount. <em>See Sulecki v.
