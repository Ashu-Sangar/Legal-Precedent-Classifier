The events culminating in Welsh’s death are so bizarre that one would be tempted to dismiss them as the stuff of pulp fiction were it not for the corroboration of disinterested witnesses and for the fact that the literature on the “battered woman syndrome” is <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>replete with similar cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a>

    <p id="b109-4" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[158,372,1153,1016]]]'>The chronology of events leading to Welsh’s death are as follows. In March of 1980, less than a month after appellant completed her training as a police cadet and assumed her duties as a police officer in the City of Pittsburgh, appellant met Welsh. Welsh was married at that time and had served as a Pittsburgh police officer for approximately twenty years. Appellant had been twice divorced. The two began dating shortly after they met. Welsh often left his “beat” to visit appellant, and he assured her that other police officers would cover for him. Notes of Testimony at 803 (Aug. 30 — Sept. 14, 1983) (hereinafter referred to as N.T.). Within the first three months of their relationship, Welsh broke into appellant’s apartment once, N.T. at 803, and, shortly thereafter, made such a nuisance of himself by banging on her door late at night, that she called the police. N.T. at 804-08. That incident was treated as a “domestic” by the officers, who knew Welsh, and no police report was filed. N.T. at 1683-40. Appellant attributed Welsh’s behavior to a drinking problem and continued dating him.</p>

By the fall of 1980, whenever appellant did not do what he told her to do, Welsh would let the air out of the tires .of her car. N.T. at 813. This occurred as often as two or three times a week. Welsh admitted doing this, but insisted that appellant would never be able to prove he was doing it. N.T. at 814. Arguments began to occur with some frequency, and, after one such argument, Welsh was able to enter appellant’s secured apartment building and place flowers outside her door. N.T. at 811-13. Welsh told appellant the flowers were for her funeral. N.T. at 813. Welsh also put sugar in the gas tank of appellant’s car, N.T. at 817, and on many occasions <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>he would take appellant’s car and move it, N.T. at 817, or he would pull the ignition wires. N.T. at 819, 1630. It was also in the fall of 1980, that Welsh began to harass appellant by telephoning her late at night. N.T. at 815.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[251,540,1153,632]]]'>Welsh justified his acts of vandalism and harassment by stating to appellant that she “deserved it.” N.T. at 816. Welsh threw a brick through the back door of appellant’s apartment when she was having a beer with a friend who had given her a ride on one of those occasions when her car was not running. N.T. at 820, 1631. Welsh told appellant she could not prove who had broken the window, so she did not file a police report, yet he fixed the window for her. <em>Id. </em>Despite the fact that appellant changed the locks on her apartment doors, Welsh was always able to get in and would take things, particularly personal phone books and papers with phone numbers on them. N.T. at 821.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[247,1191,1154,626]]]'>Before the end of 1980, appellant no longer wanted to see Welsh, but if she refused to date him, he would “punish” her by letting the air out of her car tires. N.T. at 822. Welsh continued to enter her apartment when appellant was away and, in October of 1980, he broke in once when appellant was in her apartment. N.T. at 824. Appellant tried to eject him by brandishing a blackjack, and when Welsh hastily retreated, he broke his ankle. N.T. at 826. In spite of the fact that his injury did not occur on the job, Welsh bragged to appellant that his friends in the police department were able to secure workmen’s compensation benefits for him.

Several times, that officer’s car tires were flattened. N.T. at 828, 1589. In October of 1980, while Welsh was still on crutches, he responded to appellant’s conversation in a bar with another man by wrecking appellant’s apartment. N.T. at 830-39. Welsh threw food on the floors and walls, cut up appellant’s clothes, tore the curtains from the windows, urinated on and sliced the bed, ripped the wires out of the television, and soaked appel<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>lant’s shoes and clothes in hot water. Appellant did not call the police immediately because she did not think she could prove that Welsh had damaged her apartment. N.T. at 832. Later that night, Welsh returned and appellant called the police. He tried to leave, but appellant wanted to make sure he would be there when the police arrived, so she attempted to subdue him with a blackjack, and she took his crutches from him. N.T. at 834-35. The police knew Welsh, so they did not make a report. They insisted that appellant serve as the arresting officer. N.T. at 836. Appellant wrote her own report and also approached Internal Affairs with the problem, with no result. N.T. at 837. Appellant filed a complaint with a magistrate regarding this incident. Upon appellant’s return from the magistrate’s office, she encountered Welsh coming out of her apartment, and he threatened to kill her. N.T. at 837. The magistrate knew Welsh, so Welsh was only required to stay away from appellant for thirty days, after helping her clean the apartment, and replacing her clothes and drapes and the money he had taken. N.T. at 839.</p>

N.T. at 843. Appellant felt sorry for Welsh, so she agreed to meet with him to make it clear that she did not want to see him any more. N.T. at 844-45. When appellant asked Welsh to take her home from this meeting, Welsh drove instead to a shopping center where he dragged her out of the car and then repeatedly attempted to run over her with the car. N.T. at 845-46. Failing to run over appellant, Welsh finally jumped out of the car and punched appellant, breaking her nose and rendering her semi-conscious. Appellant recalled seeing flashing red lights at the scene, but no arrest was made of Welsh at that time. N.T. at 1177-79. Welsh took appellant to the hospital for treatment. N.T. at 846.</p>

N.T. at 853. When <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>appellant prepared to move from her apartment, Welsh came in, broke a box of dishes, and left without saying a word. N.T. at 849. Appellant had not had much time to find an apartment, so she moved to an available unit that was one block outside the City of Pittsburgh. <em>Id. </em>Following the move, Welsh spent many hours in appellant’s apartment when she was not there, and if he was not in the apartment, he would be parked outside the building. N.T. at 852. Appellant did not intend to remain there long, knowing that residency in the city is required of police officers, but her daughter, who was separated from her husband at that time, moved into appellant’s new apartment with her baby. N.T. at 854. Appellant did not call the police to complain about Welsh’s behavior because she was living outside the city limits.</p>

Welsh broke into appellant’s apartment, retrieved the card from the garbage, pieced it together and placed it on appellant’s bed. N.T. at 856. Appellant saved the notes Welsh left for her and made notations regarding his acts of harassment. N.T. at 857. Welsh took the folder in which she stored the notes. <em>Id. </em>At trial, appellant introduced three notes into evidence, which notes Welsh had evidently overlooked.

The first time, Welsh entered appellant’s room in the middle of the night. A physical scuffle ensued which threatened the safety of appellant’s grandchild who was sleeping in the room. N.T. at 867. The same week, Welsh entered the apartment and dumped a bucket of ice water on appellant in the middle of the night. N.T. at 868. He left <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>and then returned with another bucket.

N.T. at 1683. As the police were questioning appellant at the apartment, Welsh called to say he would break the windshield of appellant’s car, and then he immediately did so. N.T. at 1686. Welsh was arrested and became combative. <em>Id. </em>Welsh kicked and struggled in the police truck and made lewd remarks. N.T. at 1687. He also threatened the arresting officer. N.T. at 1689.

In January of 1982, Welsh entered appellant’s apartment in the middle of the night and threatened to “slice up” appellant’s face. N.T. at 877. When asked if she had done anything to provoke this attack, appellant replied, “No. I wasn’t going out. I was trying not to provoke him. That’s why I quit going out, because everything I did, I didn’t do nothing right. Couldn’t do nothing right.” <em>Id. </em>The same night, Welsh put a gun to appellant’s head and threatened to blow her brains out. <em>Id. </em>Appellant was so terrorized by Welsh that she <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>fled early one morning in January of 1982, to her sister’s home, certain that Welsh was going to kill her.

These myths were also exploited by the prosecutor who introduced testimony that detailed the police training appellant had received, implying that her training made her incapable of being victimized by a batterer, and who argued to the jury that appellant could have been rescued, if she had wanted to be rescued, by a law enforcement system ready, willing and able to protect women who are victims of domestic violence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">10</a> To the contrary, <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>researchers have shown that many battered women are highly competent workers and successful career women, who include among their ranks doctors, lawyers, nurses, homemakers, politicians and psychologists.

Trial counsel proceeded to trial on the theory that appellant had experienced psychological and physical abuse inflicted upon her by the victim and that at the time she shot Welsh she was acting in self-defense.

    <p id="b130-8" data-blocks='[["BL_130.10",130,[246,1144,1157,951]]]'>I agree with Justice Larsen that Appellant’s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request an instruction that would have provided guidance to the jury as to the import of the history of the physical and psychological abuse in determining whether the Appellant reasonably believed that she was in danger of death or serious bodily injury. The jury heard extensive testimony about the victim’s violent nature and the abusive relationship between the Appellant and the victim. The jury was never instructed, however, that this history of abuse should be considered in determining whether the Appellant’s belief that she was in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death prior to the shooting was reasonable. The trial court’s instructions on the issue of self-defense did not address this critical point of law, <em>see Commonwealth v. Watson, </em><a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">494 Pa. 467</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="494 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="1769170" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0467-01">431 A.2d 949</a> (1981). Trial counsel’s failure to request such an instruction was inimical to his client’s interests. No more harmful omission is conceivable.</p>

I would not address the second issue of whether a separate defense referred to as “battered woman syndrome” is recognizable under the law of this Commonwealth. Although <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>the issue was addressed by amici, the Appellant has made it clear that the “battered woman syndrome” is not involved in this matter. In footnote 5 of Appellant’s brief, appellate counsel made it clear that Appellant’s position on the self-defense issue is not to be mischaracterized as a failure to raise the “battered woman syndrome” issue. While I recognize the import of this issue, I believe its resolution is best left to a time when the issue is squarely before us.</p>

    <p id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.7",131,[134,869,1156,1045]]]'>The appellant here is a uniquely fortunate litigant in that the Supreme Court of this Commonwealth has elected to serve as her counsel. At trial, the parties contented themselves to address the self-defense issue in the traditional mode. On appeal, the issue of self-defense was argued consistent with traditional standards. The defense, as well as the prosecution, advised this Court at oral argument that the question of the applicability of the theory of what is known as “the battered women syndrome,” was not an issue in this case. Indeed the only reference in the briefs to this theory was by the amici. Notwithstanding this Court has chosen this appeal as the vehicle to recognize this doctrine as a valid defense for the first time in the history of this Commonwealth. Without commenting as to the merits or advisability of recognizing such a defense, I am constrained to express my chagrin with the abandonment by my colleagues of fundamental principles of sound jurisprudence. Regardless how laudable a particular provision may be, that judgment should only be made on a record that has fully explored all the ramifications of its adoption.</p>
    <p id="b131-8" data-blocks='[["BL_131.8",131,[133,1932,1153,301]]]'>Experience has repeatedly demonstrated that precipitous judicial action often provides unfortunate consequences in the long run. In my view this issue is not properly before the Court in this appeal and therefore I cannot agree with this Court’s conclusion that counsel’s failure to pursue it constitutes ineffective assistance.</p>
