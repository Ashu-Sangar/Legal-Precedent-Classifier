The car was driven by the appellant’s brother, William Cook. After making the stop, Officer Faulkner called for assistance on his police radio, requesting a police wagon to transport a prisoner. While Faulkner was trying to handcuff Cook, the appellant ran from across the street and shot the officer <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>once in the back. Faulkner was able to fire one shot, which wounded the appellant, but after Faulkner had fallen to the ground the appellant shot him four more times at close range, once through the center of the face. The appellant was found slumped against the curb in front of Cook’s car and taken into custody by police officers who arrived on the scene within thirty to forty-five seconds. The officers had been in the area and were turning onto Locust Street from Twelfth Street in response to Faulkner’s radio request. They were flagged down by a cab driver who had witnessed the shooting while stopped at the intersection of Thirteenth and Locust. Two other pedestrians also witnessed the incident and identified the appellant as the perpetrator, both at the scene and during the trial.</p>

Principal among these arguments is the contention that the prosecution systematically excluded jurors by race through the use of peremptory challenges, violating rights of equal protection and trial by impartial jury secured by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The appellant relies on <em>Batson v.

The appellant notes that he is black and the victim was white. He states that the prosecutor used eleven peremptory challenges to remove blacks from the jury, with the result that the original panel consisted of ten whites and two blacks. Furthermore, one of <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>the black jurors was replaced before the start of the trial by an alternate, who was white, resulting in a greater racial imbalance. The appellant argues that he has proffered sufficient evidence to raise an inference that the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges because of race. Accordingly, the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Commonwealth can overcome the presumption of discriminatory use of challenges.</p>

In further demonstration that any challenge to the racial composition of the jury was waived, the Commonwealth notes that the appellant made only an incomplete record of the relevant information, and here attempts to rely on defense counsel’s affidavit, filed four years after the fact and obviously <em>dehors </em>the record, to establish his claim.</p>

In light of this, the Commonwealth has argued in the alternative — waived or not, the appellant’s claim of improper use of peremptories is without merit. In this regard, the Commonwealth disputes the representations made by the appellant as to the race of several prospective jurors, peremptorily excused, whose race does not appear of record. The Commonwealth also argues that the mere invocation of a disparity in the numbers of blacks and whites who sat on the jury is inadequate and unreliable as an indicator of whether a prima facie case has been made out. It is noted that in at least one instance the appellant used a peremptory challenge to strike a black venireperson deemed acceptable by the Commonwealth, and the record clearly indicates that the Commonwealth had no responsibility for the circumstances that required replacement of a black juror with a white alternate juror. Finally, the Commonwealth presents non-racial reasons, apparent on the face of the record, to justify the use of a peremptory challenge against each of the prospective jurors isolated by the appellant.</p>

They are, nevertheless, two of the three “elements” necessary to establish a prima facie case. According to <em>Batson, </em>these facts, when taken with “any other relevant circumstances”, must raise an inference that the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to exclude venirepersons on account of their race.

The ultimate composition of the jury is affected not only by the prosecutor’s use of peremptories, but by the defendant’s use of such, by challenges for cause (more acute in capital cases because of the <em>Witherspoon </em>inquiry), and by jurors’ inability to serve for personal reasons. The Commonwealth cites at least one instance where the appellant removed a black juror already passed as acceptable by the Commonwealth; it cannot be determined whether any of the venire, who were dismissed when it was the appellant’s turn to <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>first pass on their acceptability, were black and might have been acceptable to the Commonwealth. Moreover, we find no “pattern” in the use of peremptories. The Commonwealth used fifteen of the twenty available challenges. The record reflects that eight of these venirepersons were black. Had the appellant not peremptorily challenged the black venireperson acceptable to the Commonwealth, the first two jurors seated would have been black. We also note our agreement with the Commonwealth’s argument that the replacement of the first juror chosen, a black woman, with an alternate, a white man, was entirely beyond the Commonwealth’s control, and the resulting disparity in numbers of blacks and whites on the jury is no basis for an inference of purposeful discrimination. Finally, we have examined the prosecutor’s questions and comments during <em>voir dire, </em>along with those of the appellant and his counsel, and find not a trace of support for an inference that the use of peremptories was racially motivated.</p>

The appellant had exercised eighteen of his allotted twenty peremptory challenges during the selection of the panel of twelve, and had used another to remove a venireperson prior to Courchain being questioned as a potential alternate. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1108(b) explicitly negates the appellant’s inference that peremptory challenges not used in selecting the jury may be “carried over” for use in the selection of alternates. (“All peremptory challenges remaining unexercised after the selection of the principal twelve jurors shall be considered exhausted____”) The rule clearly separates the peremptories for use in the selection of alternates from those available for selection of the principal jury, and so the appellant’s argument in this regard must fail.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

After the first two days of <em>voir dire, </em>however, the trial court determined that the appellant’s questioning was unnecessarily lengthy and often improper. The judge also observed that many of the venirepersons were “visibly shaken and uncomfortable”. Concerned that a fair and impartial jury might not be possible to achieve by such laborious and disquieting procedures, the court took upon itself, the task of posing all questions to the prospective jurors. This procedure was used for only half a day, however, because the appellant consented to allow back-up counsel to conduct <em>voir dire </em>questioning thereafter.</p>

He claims that the court’s decision was based merely on expediency, which, he asserts, ought not outweigh his constitutional right to represent himself.</p>

It is apparent that the manner in which <em>voir dire </em>will be conducted is left to the discretion of the trial judge; discretionary rulings will be reversed only where the record indicates an abuse of the discretion given. The appellant argues only in the most general of terms that once he had been permitted to conduct the questioning himself, it was error for the court to change the procedure. The court, however, amply documented its reasons for acting as it did, and we find no error in that decision. There being no requirement, constitutional or otherwise, that the parties, through counsel or <em>pro se, </em>be permitted to engage in <em>voir dire </em>questioning, the court’s decision cannot be said to have deprived the appellant of any aspect of his rights of self-representation and due process.</p>

The appellant argues that the cross-examination should not have been permitted at all because it was irrelevant to the witness’s familiarity with the appellant’s reputation; alternatively, he argues that its limited relevance was far outweighed by its prejudicial nature.

Such a fact, if established, would obviously not be relevant to show that the appellant had killed a policeman. It could, however, indicate to the jury that Sanchez had an enmity toward policemen, an attitude that could cause her to shade her testimony to benefit the appellant. As the Commonwealth suggests, this fact is also relevant to defining the community Sanchez referred to as regarding the appellant as a peaceful man.

We find that the argument here was within the bounds of proper response and did no more than suggest that the jury’s decision, like the appeals and all other procedures, was part of the system of “law and order” that ought to govern the case. In <em>Baker, </em>it was the prosecutor who first noted that no one had been executed since 1963 and without further explanation added his comments about the length and thoroughness of the appeals process. The juxtaposition of these observations in this manner created an unacceptable possibility that the jurors could conclude that even if they voted for a death sentence it would likely never be carried out. In this case the prosecutor’s argument was more limited. He did not initiate the reference to the last time an execution had been carried out. Rather this was offered as an aside, following up on defense counsel’s prior reference to it. Defense counsel had used the <em>Smith </em>reference to argue that because no-one had been executed in Pennsylvania since the United States Supreme Court’s decisions in 1976 approving some death penalty procedures, there was some doubt as to whether the death penalty could be constitutionally imposed and carried out in Pennsylvania. This argument followed immediately upon the suggestion that all executions carried out prior to the 1972 decisions striking down capital sentencing <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>schemes had been unconstitutional and that “thousands of people” had thus “been killed in America unconstitutionally.” Defense counsel bluntly argued to the jurors that if they imposed a death sentence that ultimately was carried out, and at a later time the United States Supreme Court again declared capital punishment unconstitutional, their sentence would have been illegal and thus they would have participated in the “murder” of the appellant. 3) In <em>Baker, </em>the jury had reported itself hopelessly deadlocked on the proper sentence, and had later indicated substantial confusion about the role of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in reaching a decision as to life imprisonment. In such a circumstance the potential was particularly great that a wavering juror might assent to a verdict, not because he believed it to be proper but because he believed this Court would re-examine it for appropriateness. The effect of the risk inherent in the prosecutor’s argument was thus magnified. In this case we find no comparable circumstances.</blockquote>

The first flaw in the appellant’s argument is that the reference to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1405(a) is clearly misplaced. The Rules of Criminal Procedure contain a separate section, Subchapter 350, providing special rules for cases in which the death sentence is authorized. Rules 352(b) and 353(b) state that “the sentencing proceeding shall be conducted <em>as provided by law.” </em>(Emphasis added.)

Whatever force the common law of allocution has with respect to other criminal cases, the General Assembly has abrogated that law and replaced it with statutory law devised specifically for first degree murder cases. The legislature has provided that a sentencing hearing is required at which evidence may be presented to the jury, or the judge as the case may be. The court is given discretion to determine what evidence will be received as relevant and admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed. Following the presentation of evidence, counsel are permitted to argue to the sentencing body for or against the death sentence.</p>

Implicit in the fact that the statute assigns to the defendant the burden of proving mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of evidence is the understanding that the jury is to asses the evidence for credibility. It must be left open for the Commonwealth to challenge the veracity of facts asserted and the credibility of the person asserting those facts, whether that person is a witness or the defendant. We find no reason in law or logic why the defendant’s presentation of evidence in support of his claim that life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence should be shielded from the testing for truthfulness and reliability that is accomplished by cross-examination.</p>

The first of these arguments is that the prosecutor’s inquiry was unrelated to any aggravating circumstance and that the statutorily defined aggravating circumstances are the only matters relevant for the prosecutor to pursue. We do not read the statute as limiting the scope of the sentencing hearing to this extent. The legislature has directed that “[i]n the sentencing hearing, evidence may be presented <em>as to any matter that the court deems relevant </em>and admissible on the question of the sentence to be imposed <em>and shall include matters relating to any of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances </em>specified in subsections (d) and (e).” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a)(2) (emphasis added).

More importantly, the Opinion did not suggest that a prosecutor’s evidence and argument are limited to the enumerated aggravating circumstances. What is limited are the factors on which a sentence of death can be based. Thus, for example, a prosecutor could not introduce evidence and argue to the jury that a defendant convicted of first degree murder merited the death penalty <em>because of </em>a psychiatric report that he could kill again. If, however, the defendant offered evidence that he was not likely to be dangerous in the future, the prosecutor would not be prohibited from introducing such contrary evidence in its possession for the purpose of contradicting the defendant’s assertions.</p>

Stephens had argued that because the trial court had instructed the jury on an aggravating circumstance later found to be invalid, the jury’s deliberations may have been tainted by irrelevant considerations. The Court’s response suggested only that it would violate due process for a state to make constitutionally protected conduct an aggravating circumstance, thereby “elevating” a crime to the status of a capital offense on the basis of impermissible factors. The appellant and amici conveniently ignore that portion of the Opinion in <em>Stephens </em>immediately following the paragraph they cite. The Court, observing that the statutory aggravating circumstance had been invalidated for vagueness, nevertheless found no harm in the jury having been instructed about it because the underlying evidence was fully admissible in the sentencing phase.

The prosecutor simply introduced evidence by way of cross-examination, and clearly limited his use of this evidence to: 1) rebutting the suggestion advanced at trial by way of character witnesses that the appellant was a “peaceful, genial” man, 2) countering the appellant’s claim at the penalty hearing that the incident in which Officer Faulkner was killed was in fact a failed attempt by the police to execute the appellant, and 3) in an oblique way, supplementing the “law and order theme” of his summation, by which he tied together, through use of contrast, the purpose of aggravating circumstance (d)(1), the jury’s function in deciding on a penalty according to the law, and the appellant’s longstanding disdain for the system.</p>

There is apparent from this scenario a question of interpretation as to Rule 1108(b) that has not been raised by the parties, or more precisely, the answer to which has been assumed by all the parties. The Rule provides that "the defendant and the Commonwealth shall each be entitled to one peremptory challenge for each two alternates to be selected." Quaere whether, if four alternates are to be selected, each side has two peremptories available for use at any time during the alternate selection process? Or whether each side has one peremptory for use in selecting the first two alternates and one for use in <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>selecting the second pair, the first one being “waived" if not used before the first two alternates are seated? In the present case, the unstated holding of the trial court must have been in conformity with the latter view. Four alternates were to be selected, and the appellant had only used one peremptory challenge before Courchain was examined. He was later permitted to use a peremptory challenge prior to the seating of the third alternate juror. Under the first interpretation of Rule 1108, the peremptory challenge of Courchain would have been allowed, the appellant thereafter having no peremptory challenges remaining for use in the alternate selection process.</p>
