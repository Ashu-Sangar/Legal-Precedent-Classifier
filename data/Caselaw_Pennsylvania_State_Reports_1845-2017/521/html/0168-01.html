The following day, that same jury sentenced appellant to death. Post-verdict motions were denied by the presiding judge who formally sentenced appellant to death on November 18, 1987.

In addition to defensive wounds on her hands <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>and arms, the victim had been stabbed eight times including once in the chest which penetrated her lung, and once in the neck. The knife had broken off and was protruding from her neck. Additionally, the victim had sustained <em>a </em>blunt force injury to her head which was of sufficient force to fracture and expose her skull. A bloody aluminum baseball bat was found in the victim’s kitchen.</p>

Medical examination discovered the presence of semen in the victim’s vagina from a “Type A secretor,” but no other indication of sexual assault. It was established that, on the morning of her murder, the victim had been wearing several items of jewelry, namely: a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant with the inscription “Sweet 16,” which she had received for her birthday the day before; a necklace imprinted with the name “Maria”; two other gold chains and a ring with the word “love” on it. The jewelry was missing when the victim’s body was discovered.</p>

Appellant, twenty-one years old at the time, had spoken with the victim from the window of his room at the nearby Kensington Pre-release Center, a converted YMCA building, where he was serving part of a jail sentence for a previous conviction. The victim had recently given appellant a Christmas card with a photograph of herself. Appellant had given the victim the “love” ring.</p>

He returned to the Center later that day, and a detective interviewed him at the Center that evening. On January 10, 1987, appellant again left the Kensington Center without authorization, taking with him his clothes and personal belongings. Earlier that day, appellant had given two gold chains with pendants to his cellmate, Andre Rodriquez (no relation to the victim), one with the name “Maria” on the <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>pendant and the other with the inscription “Sweet 16.” Mr. Rodriquez turned these items over to the police, and informed them that appellant also had a couple of other gold chains in his possession. Appellant’s mother (Mrs. Lottie Billa) returned appellant to the Kensington Center on January 11, 1987 at about 1:00 a.m. A search warrant executed at Mrs. Billa’s home on January 17, 1987 produced a pillowcase containing appellant’s clothing which, upon analysis, revealed type “0” blood stains which matched the victim’s blood type.</p>

Appellant stated the following: He left the center at about 10:00 — 10:30 a.m. on January 8, 1987, and went to the victim’s house. In the kitchen, they discussed their “relationship,” and the victim told appellant she could not have a relationship with him because she had another boyfriend. They argued and, according to appellant, the victim grabbed a knife on the kitchen table and ordered him out of her house. Appellant’s statement reads as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="Akb" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[229,1518,1128,636]]]'>So, I grabbed the knife. The cellar door was open. We struggled down the cellar steps. By me grabbing hold of her hand, that is how she got stabbed, by us tussling that is how it was going. I don’t know how many times that was. Then we tumbled on the floor. That is when I got a hold of the knife. She grabbed a hold of my hand when I stabbed her in the neck. I left the knife in her neck. The only time that I wanted to stab her was when I' stabbed her in the neck. I ran up the steps and went out the front door. I went back to the “Y.” I got into the YMCA by the same way I left. That was through the metal fire escape door which is in the back of the YMCA.</blockquote>

He also stated that, after he stabbed the victim, he gave her “two cracks on her head” with an aluminum bat.</p>

    <p id="b238-6" data-blocks='[["BL_238.5",238,[234,788,1153,852]]]'>The Commonwealth also introduced evidence concerning a prior offense committed by appellant some two months prior to the murder of Maria Rodriquez. Florence Morales, twenty years old, testified that on November 7, 1986, a few blocks from the Kensington Center, appellant accosted her at about 2:00 p.m. and, when she attempted to evade him, he pushed her onto some steps, bit her face, threatened her with a gun that he said was in his pocket, took gold chains from around her neck, and made her go to a nearby vacant lot with him. At that point, appellant knocked Ms. Morales to the ground, attempted to have her perform oral sex on him, pulled down her pants, and raped her. During the rape, appellant commanded this victim to tell him that she loved him and when she complied, he struck her in the face saying “Bitch, you know you don't love me.” The appellant and this victim were not acquainted.</p>

Fortunately, this victim did not die. She was discovered and taken to a hospital where she received emergency treatment. Medical evidence established that semen in her vagina was from a “Type A secretor.” Appellant was shown to be a “Type A secretor.” Approximately a week before the instant trial began, appellant was tried and convicted of rape, attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, robbery and aggravated assault for his attack on Ms. Morales. The Superior Court has affirmed these <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>convictions. <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court admitted said evidence, over vigorous objection of defense counsel, on the Commonwealth’s theories that the crimes were similar enough in modus operandi to permit an inference that the perpetrator of one was the perpetrator of the other, to show appellant’s intent and motive in murdering Ms. Rodriquez (i.e., to prevent her from reporting him after he had compelled her to have sex with him), and to negate appellant’s defense that the killing of his victim was accidental.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

He also denied at trial that he ever intended to stab Ms. Rodriquez. His theory of the homicide was that, in the struggle for the knife that Ms. Rodriquez had picked-up, the knife stabbed her accidently. He further claimed that when he went to the victim’s house, he was there not to have sex with the victim (on cross-examination he denied having sex with her) but just to establish a closer relationship with her “as a friend.”</p>

However, this general proscription against admission of a defendant’s distinct criminal acts is subject to numerous exceptions where special circumstances exist which render such evidence relevant for some legitimate evidentiary reason and not merely to prejudice the defendant by showing him to be a person of bad character. Some of the exceptions that this Court has recognized in the past as legitimate bases for admitting evidence of a defendant’s distinct crimes include (but are not limited to): (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme, plan or design embracing commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one naturally tends to prove the others; (5) to establish the identity of the person charged with the commission of the crime on trial where there is such a logical connection between the crimes that proof of one will naturally tend to show that the accused is the person who committed the other; (6) to impeach the credibility of a defendant who testifies in his trial; (7) situations where defendant’s prior criminal history had been used by him to threaten or intimidate the victim; (8) situations where the distinct crimes were part of a chain or sequence of events which formed the history of the case and were part of its natural development (sometimes called “res gestae” exception). <em>See Commonwealth v.
