Moreover, on the second day of trial, the Court and counsel questioned all fourteen members of the jury about whether they had read or heard anything in the news media, or from third persons, that would affect their ability to render an impartial verdict. N.T. at 148-75. Most jurors stated that they had heard nothing. Juror number four stated that juror number twelve told her that she had heard about the case on the news. The Trial Court stated, “[u]pon examining the demeanor of juror 12 in the witness box and analyzing the testimony of both juror 4 and juror 12, this Court determined that juror 12 had not heard <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>anything on television which would prevent her from being a fair and impartial juror.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Trial Ct. slip. op. at 29. Moreover, defense counsel conceded that a mistrial was not necessary. N.T. at 175-76. The Trial Court then immediately sequestered the jury for the remainder of the trial. We believe that the Trial Court’s instructions to avoid media contact, the results of the voir dire, and the subsequent sequestration of the jury afforded Appellant sufficient protection to guarantee him a fair trial.</p>

Having considered the circumstances of the crime and the character of the Appellant, we conclude the sentence is not excessive or disproportionate. The jury determined there were no mitigating circumstances but found one aggravating circumstance, namely, killing while in the perpetration of a felony. N.T. 3-23 and 3-24-81 at 2118. The statute requires a verdict of death in such circumstances. 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. § 9711(c)(l)(iv) (Purdon 1982). The study maintained by the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts indicates the sentence is neither disproportionate nor excessive in comparison with similar cases.</p>
