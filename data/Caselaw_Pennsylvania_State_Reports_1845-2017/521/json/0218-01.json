        "text": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThe issue presented in this appeal is whether Appellant Grace Simmon was denied her right under the Confrontation Clause to inspect and use complainant\u2019s juvenile record for cross-examination purposes. Because Appellant\u2019s counsel was denied access to the principal Commonwealth witness\u2019s juvenile record after claiming the existence of bias and motive based on the witness\u2019s probationary status, we reverse Superior Court\u2019s order, 353 Pa.Super. 647, 506 A.2d 1338, and remand to the trial court with instructions.\nOn September 25, 1982, Rochelle Hood, age seventeen, and Appellant became embroiled in a confrontation on Sixth Street in Philadelphia. This encounter was the culmination of an ongoing feud between these two neighbors and their families involving Ronald Armstead, Appellant\u2019s paramour. Hood believed Armstead to be the father of her eight month old daughter and wanted him to live with them. Tensions quickly escalated on the otherwise barren street corner, resulting in Hood receiving a stab wound of the right lower chest.\nFollowing this incident, Hood walked home and related the events that occurred to her mother. The complainant\u2019s mother called the police to report the episode and then took Hood to the Guiffre Medical Center. The police, responding to the call, picked up Appellant. She was then taken to the hospital where Hood identified Simmon as her assailant. Simmon was later charged with aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701, 2702; recklessly endangering another person, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705; and possession of an instrument of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.\nOn April 9, 1984, prior to the commencement of trial, Appellant waived her right to a jury trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel at the same time made a motion in limine to have the court produce the complainant\u2019s juvenile record so as to allow Appellant\u2019s counsel to examine it for potential use on cross-examination to show inter alia bias and motive. Appellant\u2019s counsel underscored the need for the record by asserting a theory of self defense.\nThe trial court denied the motion for two reasons. First, it was the judge\u2019s understanding that juvenile records, pursuant to the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6301 et seq., were not available except for use in limited circumstances by specially designated persons or agencies. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6307. The trial court also denied Appellant\u2019s motion in limine believing that a juvenile record is not available for purposes of impeaching credibility. N.T. 7-8. Thereafter, the trial proceeded.\nHood testified on direct examination that she was approached from behind by Simmon who called out to her about leaving Armstead alone. It was also Hood\u2019s testimony that her hands were in her pockets and she was unarmed. Hood claimed as she put her hands up to protect herself, Simmon stabbed her. N.T. 17-21. Simmon\u2019s testimony differed markedly. According to her version of the events, Hood confronted her about Armstead and then began to hit Simmon with her fist. Although Simmon did not see that Hood had a weapon, she was sure Hood had something because of the prior incidents in which Hood had followed Simmon and her daughter with a knife. Simmon testified further that while she told Hood to leave her alone, Hood kept coming at her. Finally, out of fear that Hood would use a weapon, as she had previously threatened to do, Simmon testified she drew her own knife in self defense and wounded Hood. N.T. 65-68.\nAppellant was found guilty, following the bench trial, of aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and possession of an instrument of crime. Post-trial motions were filed and later denied. Appellant was sentenced on August 29, 1984 to five years probation on the aggravated assault charge. The trial judge suspended sentence on the two remaining convictions.\nAppeal was taken to Superior Court. In a memorandum opinion and order, the Superior Court panel affirmed the judgment of sentence. Acknowledging that juvenile records are generally inadmissible for impeachment purposes, the court stated these records, however, are admissible to demonstrate bias because of the vulnerable status as a probationer as well as possible concern the witness might be a suspect in the investigation. See Commonwealth v. Mines, 321 Pa.Super. 529, 468 A.2d 1115 (1983). The court then reviewed the trial transcript and was not persuaded that the stabbing incident would have either jeopardized Hood\u2019s assumed probationary status or resulted in criminal charges being brought against her. Specifically, the court concluded based on Simmon\u2019s testimony that her claim that Hood was the initial aggressor was not adequately supported by the record. The Superior Court held that because the juvenile record of the complainant could not have been properly introduced to show bias, the trial court did not err in denying inspection.\nThe case sub judice is on all fours with our decision in Commonwealth v. Slaughter, 482 Pa. 538, 394 A.2d 453 (1978). In Slaughter, midway through cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s key identification witness, defense counsel requested the prosecuting assistant district attorney to give him a copy of the witness\u2019s juvenile record. The trial court in that case refused the request based on a belief that any questioning of witness, Anthony Ragland, by defense counsel regarding Ragland\u2019s juvenile record would have been improper. Relying on Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), we held that the juvenile record of a prosecution witness must be made available to the defense for the purpose of allowing the defense to determine whether there was anything in the witness\u2019s juvenile record which would indicate that the witness might be biased against the defendant and in favor of the prosecution. We have most recently reaffirmed this position in Commonwealth v. Evans, 511 Pa. 214, 512 A.2d 626 (1986).\nSuperior Court, in the case sub judice, would find no error in depriving Appellant\u2019s counsel of access to the principal Commonwealth witness\u2019s juvenile record. This conclusion is based on Superior Court\u2019s examination of the trial transcript and its determination that the trial transcript does not support an inference that the incident would have jeopardized Hood\u2019s probationary status. In support of its mandate to look to the record to determine whether the evidence supports a bias claim, Superior Court mistakenly relies on Mines, supra. However, Mines was not a case in which the court did not allow defense counsel access to the prosecution witness\u2019s juvenile record but rather denied counsel the opportunity to use the witness\u2019s probationary status for purposes of cross-examination.\nBy adhering to Superior Court\u2019s mandate, we would in effect turn the rationale of Slaughter on its head thereby requiring Appellant to establish evidence \u201con the record\u201d which would demonstrate bias when in fact Appellant had been denied access to the juvenile record. See Slaughter, 482 Pa. at 552, 394 A.2d at 460. Although Appellant\u2019s counsel was permitted to cross-examine Hood, counsel was unable, based on the trial court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion in limine, to adequately develop the issue of bias. This limited cross-examination was fatal to Appellant\u2019s defense. Hood was the sole prosecution witness who could testify as to the events that transpired during the confrontation with Simmon. Because Hood\u2019s testimony was the crucial link in the proof of Appellant\u2019s act, the accuracy and truthfulness of Hood\u2019s testimony became key elements in the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Without being permitted to expose the facts bearing on the reliability of Hood, Appellant was denied her Sixth Amendment right of confrontation through effective cross-examination. We, therefore, reaffirm our position in Commonwealth v. Slaughter, supra.\nOur conclusion is within the requirements of Davis in which the United States Supreme Court said of the defense theory of bias based on the witness\u2019s status as a probationer:\nWe cannot speculate as to whether the jury, as sole judge of the credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had counsel been permitted to fully present it. But we do conclude that the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense theory before them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place on [the witness\u2019s] testimony.\n415 U.S. at 317, 94 S.Ct. at 1111.\nFollowing Davis on which Slaughter relies, we now disavow Commonwealth v. Mines, supra and herein hold that a prosecution witness\u2019s juvenile probationary status is relevant to show bias regardless of whether the person appears as the victim/complainant.\nBecause Superior Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence based on a misapplication of the law, thereby denying Appellant\u2019s counsel access to the information in Hood\u2019s juvenile record, we reverse the order of Superior Court. Furthermore, since the record is unclear as to whether the claimant was on probation either on the date of the incident or at the time of trial, we remand this matter to the trial court with instructions that Hood\u2019s juvenile record be reviewed in an in camera proceeding. If in the trial court\u2019s opinion its original refusal prevented Appellant from presenting evidence of complainant\u2019s bias or other information to bring this matter within the scope of Davis, it shall vacate the judgment of sentence and order a new trial. Conversely, if in the trial court\u2019s opinion its original refusal did not prevent Appellant from presenting evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias or motive, then the trial court shall affirm its original order.\nJURISDICTION RELINQUISHED.\n. Appellant claims that the trial court denied her the right to confrontation and due process under the state and federal constitutions. The applicable provisions are Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nArt. I. Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, in pertinent part provides:\nIn all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel, to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to meet the witnesses face to face____ The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, in pertinent part provides:\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed ... and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him____\nThe state constitutional claim is raised by Appellant for the first time in this appeal. Accordingly, we do not consider this issue because it has been waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).\n. Appellant\u2019s counsel alsb argued that Hood\u2019s prior adjudications for crimen falsi and violent offenses should be admissible to impeach her credibility and support Appellant\u2019s claim of self defense. Because these issues were not raised on appeal to Superior Court, we need not consider them any further.\n. Appellant claims the prosecution did not challenge the assertion that the complainant was on probation, nor was defense counsel asked to state a basis of his belief. The trial court opinion indicates that the record [trial transcript] was devoid of evidence that Hood was in a probationary status prior to or during the trial. Trial Court Slip Opinion p. 3. Similarly, the Commonwealth asserted in its Superior Court brief that it is prepared to show that complainant was not on probation at either the time of the incident or at trial. Superior Court Slip Opinion at 3.\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that Hood was the victim of the assault and therefore her probationary status was not endangered merely states a conclusion. Such, inverted logic denies the reality of the vulnerable status of a probationer. The threat of revocation, no matter how subtle, based on a violation of a probation condition (i.e. not engaging in assaultive behavior) always can be used by the prosecution to ensure cooperation. Indeed, it might precede the prosecutor\u2019s involvement by providing the motivation for the complainant to report that she had been assaulted. Were Hood the aggressor and Simmon the victim, assuming she were on probation, it would benefit Hood to report her wound as though she were the victim, thus deflecting any inquiry that might jeopardize her probation.\n. The Commonwealth, relying on Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987), asserts that mere invocation of the Confrontation Clause does not require unlimited access to confidential material. In Ritchie, the Respondent, who was charged with various sexual offenses against his minor daughter, sought access, during pre-trial discovery, to Children and Youth Services (CYS) records which CYS claimed were privileged pursuant to the Child Protective Services Law, 11 P.S. \u00a7 2201 et seq. The majority, in that case, although unable to reach a concensus as to the protection the Confrontation Clause affords, was able to agree that Respondent\u2019s interest in ensuring a fair trial could be protected by requiring that CYS files be submitted only to the trial court for in camera review.\nJustice Blackmun, who concurred in part and concurred in the judgment in Ritchie, did so because the in camera review procedure was adequate to address any confrontation problem. He specifically noted that the trial court\u2019s obligation to review the confidential record for material information is an ongoing obligation. Impeachment evidence, Justice Blackmun stated, is precisely the type of information that might be deemed to be material only well into the trial, as, for example after the key witness has testified. Ritchie, 107 S.Ct. at 1004-1006.\nAlthough Ritchie establishes a procedure which comports with the Federal Constitution by which confidential records are accessed in an in camera proceeding, we leave for another day, consideration of this issue in terms of the state constitution which may provide a basis to establish a broader right of access.\n. Hood testified that she turned eighteen on September 30, 1982 five days after the confrontation. N.T. 21. This fact would not necessarily affect juvenile probationary status. Pursuant to the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6302, a child is an individual who is under the age of 18 years; or is under the age of 21 years who committed an act of delinquency before reaching the age of 18 years.
