      {
        "text": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) from an order of the Commonwealth Court, 97 Pa.Commw. 78, 509 A.2d 877 affirming an adjudication of the Environmental Hearing Board (\u201cBoard\u201d). We granted review to address the alternative holding of the court below regarding the Commission\u2019s standing to litigate the matter in controversy.\nThe subject of this case is a solid waste permit granted by the Department of Environmental Resources (\u201cDER\u201d), under the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Act, to Ganzer Sand & Gravel, Inc. (\u201cGanzer\u201d). The permit would allow Ganzer to establish and operate a solid waste landfill on a certain 40-acre tract in Erie County, for the purpose of providing a disposal site for residual waste from the Hammermill Paper Company. The property on which the fill is to be located is adjacent to a 1,343-acre tract of wetlands maintained by the Commission as a waterfowl refuge. The Commission raised various environmental objections to the proposed landfill, and subsequently challenged the issuance of the permit by taking an appeal to the Board pursuant to section 1921-A of the Administrative Code of 1929.\nIn its appeal to the Board, the Commission asserted that allowance of the landfill violated several environmental laws, namely, regulations promulgated under the Solid Waste Management Act, provisions of the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, and the environmental rights article of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article I, \u00a7 27. The appellant also alleged that the operation of the landfill, in its actual effect, would produce polluted ground water and surface-water runoff, and that such would adversely impact upon the eco-system of the waterfowl sanctuary.\nIn its argument based on the Solid Waste Management Act, the Commission objected to the ratio of waste to renovative soil that would exist at the landfill, and to the fact that the fill would not have a liner or leachate collection system. According to the appellant, such defects would be violative of design standards mandated by regulations implementing the statute and would be environmentally injurious.\nThe Commission\u2019s central statutory challenge, however, was based on the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (\u201cDSEA\u201d). That statute, like others has as one of its express purposes the protection of natural resources and environmental values, 32 P.S. \u00a7 693.2(3). To that end, the DSEA provides, inter alia, that \u201c[n]o person shall construct, operate, maintain ... any dam, water obstruction or encroachment without the prior written permit of [DER].\u201d 32 P.S. \u00a7 693.6(a) (emphasis added). DER did not consider the DSEA applicable to the landfill; thus, a water-obstruction permit was deemed unnecessary. The Commission, however, contended that the Ganzer fill would create a \u201cwater obstruction\u201d as to be subject to the foregoing provision, and that the absence of the special license mentioned therein negated the validity of the solid waste permit. In sum, the Commission urged that DER could not legitimately authorize the Ganzer landfill without first securing compliance with the DSEA. These same contentions were reiterated by the appellant as its exclusive basis for asserting that permission of the landfill would offend Article I, \u00a7 27 of the state constitution.\nThe Board preliminarily questioned whether the Commission, as a sister agency of DER in the Commonwealth governmental structure, had standing to challenge DER\u2019s issuance of the waste permit. Subsequently, in a pre-hearing ruling, the Board determined that the Commission did have standing to prosecute the appeal.\nAfter conducting hearings de novo, the Board entered an extensive written adjudication in which it rejected each of the Commission\u2019s challenges on the merits, and sustained the issuance of the permit to Ganzer. With particular regard to the arguments based on the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, the Board found as a matter of fact that no streams or drainage courses run through the landfill site, and that the site was higher in elevation than any neighboring watercourses and the wetlands constituting the Commission\u2019s wildlife refuge. On the strength of those findings, the Board concluded that the Ganzer landfill would not create a \u201cwater obstruction\u201d as that term is defined by the DSEA, and thus, that the statute was not applicable to the case.\nWith the rejection of the Commission\u2019s assertions under the DSEA, so too failed its argument pursuant to the environmental rights article of the Pennsylvania Constitution, since the constitutional challenge was based exclusively on the appellant\u2019s contentions regarding the DSEA. Although it is clear from the record that the Board\u2019s resolution of the DSEA argument was based on its conclusion that the statute did not apply to the case, the Board articulated that result by loosely stating that the Commission did not have \u201cstanding\u201d to make the statute an issue.\nIt should be emphasized that the Board\u2019s adjudication sustaining the Ganzer permit was not restricted to a determination that the Commission had not met its burden of proof and that its particular legal challenges lacked efficacy. The Board went further and gauged the propriety of the solid waste permit under the governing environmental statutes, and under the environmental article of our state constitution. After making extensive findings of fact based on the evidence, the Board determined that the proposed landfill would not have an adverse impact on the environment and that permitting the landfill was otherwise in compliance with the law.\nIn response to the Board\u2019s decision, the Commission filed a petition for review with the Commonwealth Court. Although it is clear from the Board\u2019s adjudication that the Commission was actually accorded standing to press its challenges, the Commission, in its appeal to the Commonwealth Court, included an assertion that it had been denied \u201cstanding\u201d to raise the DSEA as an issue before the administrative tribunal.\nAs noted at the outset, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board\u2019s adjudication. In so deciding, the intermediate appellate court put forth two alternative grounds. The court first concluded that the Commission lacked standing to raise the DSEA, as a basis for challenging the Ganzer permit. The court then proceeded to also decide that, even if the Commission did have the requisite standing, the Board\u2019s adjudication had to be sustained under the standard of judicial review prescribed by section 704 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704.\nWe will consider first the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the Game Commission lacked standing to use the DSEA as a ground for challenging the permit issued by DER. The reasoning of the Commonwealth Court on this point is not altogether clear, but it seems to have at its core a determination that the purposes of the DSEA have nothing to do with the functions of the Commission, i.e., protecting wildlife. Based on that premise, the court decided that the Commission could not be \u201caggrieved\u201d by DER\u2019s non-enforcement of the DSEA and thus had no legal standing to make an issue of it. Having concluded that the Commission lacked standing to raise the DSEA itself, the Commonwealth Court added that the absence of standing was not cured by the Commission\u2019s attempt to reiterate its DSEA argument under Article I, \u00a7 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. For the reasons that follow, it is our view the Commonwealth Court erred in its holding as to the Commission\u2019s standing.\nThe concept of \u201cstanding,\u201d in its accurate legal sense, is concerned only with the question of who is entitled to make a legal challenge to the matter involved. Sprague v. Casey, 520 Pa. 38, 550 A.2d 184 (1988); Application of Biester, 487 Pa. 438, 409 A.2d 848 (1979); Wm. Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975); Keystone Raceway Corp. v. State Harness Racing Commission, 405 Pa. 1, 173 A.2d 97 (1961); Department of Labor and Industry v. Unemployment Compensation Review Board, 362 Pa. 342, 67 A.2d 114 (1949). As a general matter, the core of the concept of standing is that a person who is not adversely affected in any way by the matter he seeks to challenge is not aggrieved thereby and has no right to obtain a judicial resolution of his challenge. E.g., Independent State Store Union v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, 495 Pa. 145, 432 A.2d 1375 (1981); see Pierro v. Pierro, 434 Pa. 131, 252 A.2d 652 (1969); Louden Hill Farm, Inc. v. Milk Control Commission, 420 Pa. 548, 217 A.2d 735 (1966); Department of Labor and Industry, supra.\nWith regard to actions or decisions of state administrative agencies, section 702 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702, mandates that a person\u2019s right to obtain judicial review depends upon his having a direct interest in the agency\u2019s action and being aggrieved thereby. In re Family Style Restaurant, Inc., 503 Pa. 109, 468 A.2d 1088 (1983); Susquehanna County v. Department of Environmental Resources, 500 Pa. 512, 458 A.2d 929 (1983); Franklin Township v. Department of Environmental Resources, 500 Pa. 1, 452 A.2d 718 (1982); Application of El Rancho Grande, 496 Pa. 496, 437 A.2d 1150 (1981). A substantially similar definition of \u201cstanding\u201d has been legislatively provided with respect to administrative appeals to the Environmental Hearing Board from actions of DER. To have \u201cstanding\u201d in that context, section 1921-A of the Administrative Code of 1929, supra, requires that the complainant be \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the DER action in question. 71 P.S. \u00a7 510-21 (Supp.1988).\nAlthough our law of standing is generally articulated in terms of whether a would-be litigant has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in the controverted matter, and whether he has been \u201caggrieved\u201d or \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the action in question, we must remain mindful that the purpose of the \u201cstanding\u201d requirement is to insure that a legal challenge is by a proper party, Application of Biester, supra. The terms \u201csubstantial interest\u201d, \u201caggrieved\u201d and \u201cadversely affected\u201d are the general, usual guides in that regard, but they are not the only ones. For example, when the legislature statutorily invests an agency with certain functions, duties and responsibilities, the agency has a legislatively conferred interest in such matters. From this it must follow that, unless the legislature has provided otherwise, such an agency has an implicit power to be a litigant in matters touching upon its concerns. In such circumstances the legislature has implicitly ordained that such an agency is a proper party litigant, i.e., that it has \u201cstanding.\u201d An instructive illustration of this point is the case of Chapman v. Federal Power Commission, 345 U.S. 153, 73 S.Ct. 609, 97 L.Ed. 918 (1953), in which the United States Supreme Court held that the Secretary of Interior had standing to challenge an order of the Federal Power Commission licensing a new hydroelectric generating station. The Court\u2019s decision was based on the fact that the action of the Power Commission impacted upon the Department of Interior\u2019s statutorily mandated role as the marketer of excess hydroelectric power and its general statutory duties relating to the conservation of the nation\u2019s water resources. We find Chapman to be a sound principle for resolving certain questions of standing that may arise in our jurisdiction.\nIn the instant case, the Commonwealth Court negated the Game Commission\u2019s standing to raise the DSEA by concluding that the statute had nothing to do with the Commission\u2019s statutory functions. That determination is patently erroneous.\nThe powers and duties of the Commission are set forth in the Game and Wildlife Code (\u201cCode\u201d), 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 101 et seq. Section 103(a) of the Code states that \u201cownership, jurisdiction over and control of game or wildlife is vested in the [Commission as an independent agency of the Commonwealth____\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 103(a). Another section of the Code provides that the Commission, as an agency of the Commonwealth, is \u201cauthorized to regulate, protect, propagate, manage and preserve game or wildlife----\u201d34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2161(b) (emphasis added). With respect to state-owned game lands or waters as such, section 706 of the Code mandates that title to such property shall be in the name of the Commonwealth \u201csolely for the use of the [CJommission.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 706.\nIt is clear from the above that the Game Commission has a substantial interest in the lands and wildlife under its control. This alone would be sufficient to give it standing to legally challenge any action which allegedly would have an adverse impact on those interests. However, of particular significance to the instant case is section 2161(c) of the Code, which provides in pertinent part as follows:\nConcurrent authority \u2014 The Commission shall have concurrent authority to enforce ... the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act, and the regulations thereto, with respect to encroachments and water obstructions ... if a violation would, in the opinion of the [commission, negatively impact upon a swamp, marsh or wetland.\n34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2161(c) (emphasis added).\nThis provision is a clear legislative recognition that the DSEA has a relationship to the functions and interests of the Commission, and it expressly gives the Commission the power to enforce the DSEA where a violation of it would adversely impact upon the property under the Commission\u2019s control. We therefore conclude that the Commission had standing to raise the DSEA in its challenge to DER\u2019s issuance of the solid waste permit in this case.\nAlthough we reject the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding as to the Commission\u2019s standing, we agree with that court\u2019s alternative conclusion that the Board\u2019s adjudication had to be affirmed on the merits. As the Commonwealth Court correctly observed, judicial review of such an adjudication is narrow in scope. Section 704 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704, dictates that judicial review is restricted to a determining whether there has been an error of law or a violation of constitutional rights, and whether any finding of fact necessary to the adjudication is unsupported by substantial evidence. E.g., Wiley House v. Scanlon, 502 Pa. 228, 465 A.2d 995 (1983); Norfolk and Western Ry. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 489 Pa. 109, 413 A.2d 1037 (1980); Willowbrook Mining Co. v. Department of Environmental Resources, 92 Pa.Commw. 163, 499 A.2d 2 (1985); Einsig v. Pennsylvania Mines Corp., 69 Pa.Commw. 351, 452 A.2d 558 (1982). Absent any of those infirmities, an adjudication by a state administrative agency must be affirmed by the courts. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704. Our review of the record in this case convinces us that the Board\u2019s adjudication in this matter is not judicially disturbable under the governing scope of review.\nFor the reason last mentioned, the order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion.\n. Act of July 7, 1980, P.L. 380, as amended, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6018.101 et seq. (Supp.1988).\n. Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq. Section 1921-A of the Code was added by the Act of December 3,1971, P.L. 834, 71 P.S. \u00a7 510-21 (Supp.1988). Section 1921-A(c) provides that an action of the Department of Environmental Resources \"adversely affecting any person\" shall be appealable by such person to the Environmental Hearing Board. Section 1921-A also provides that the hearings and adjudications of the Board shall be in accordance with the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501-508, 701-704.\n.

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI join in the majority opinion. There is no question that the Pennsylvania Game Commission has standing under our constitution, statutes and caselaw to challenge the issuance of a solid waste permit by the Department of Environmental Resources (DER) for the establishment and operation of a solid waste landfill, where said landfill could potentially affect wetland property (known as Siegel Marsh) maintained and protected by the Commission as a waterfowl refuge. The Commission is a Commonwealth agency explicitly charged by statute with the obligation and authority to regulate, protect, manage and preserve the game or wildlife of this Commonwealth and the lands and waters entrusted to the care of the Commission, specifically including (but not limited to) the enforcement of the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act where an encroachment or water obstruction would negatively impact upon a swamp, marsh or wetland. 34 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2161(c).\nAs one of this Commonwealth\u2019s trustees of our natural resources and the public estate under Article I, section 27 of our Constitution, the Commission must have standing to take whatever legal action is necessary and appropriate to \u201cconserve and maintain\u201d our \u201cclean air, pure water,\u201d and \u201cthe natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment\u201d where threats to game or wildlife and to waterways and lands acquired and managed by the Commission arise.\nI also agree with the majority that, under our standard of review, the decision of the Environmental Hearing Board affirming the grant of a solid waste permit by DER should be affirmed. That decision was adequately supported by the record, did not commit an error of law and did not violate any constitutional rights. I write separately, however, to emphasize that the Commission\u2019s standing does not cease once the solid waste permit has been granted and affirmed on appeal.\nOn the contrary, the Commission retains the authority and the obligation to protect, preserve and maintain the Siegel Marsh wetlands and its inhabitants. Should the Commission, at some point in the future, detect environmental damage to Siegel Marsh or its inhabitants which, in the Commission\u2019s reasoned opinion, is caused by operation of the landfill, the Commission will have standing to petition DER to suspend or modify its landfill permit in accordance with the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Act, see section 503(c) and (e), Act of July 7, 1980, P.L. 380, No. 97, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6018.503(c) and (e), or to take appropriate action in the courts of this Commonwealth to abate pollution and/or nuisances, see id at section 607, 35 P.S. \u00a7 6018.607.\nPAPADAKOS, J., joins in this concurring opinion.",

        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI concur in the result. I would hold that the Pennsylvania Game Commission did not have standing to raise the violations of the Dam Safety and Encroachment Act. I do not agree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reasoning underlying its conclusion that the Commission lacked standing is unclear. I believe the statement of its rationale is readily understood and is, in fact, correct.\nThe Commonwealth Court reasoned that,\nLooking to the DSEA itself, it is difficult to conclude that it has the preservation of wildlife as one of its central concerns. Sections 2(1), 2(3), and 2(4) of the Act specify that people and property, natural resources, and water obstructions are among the concerns of the Act. Of course, wildlife are dependent for their continuing viability upon the natural resources of their ecosystem and habitat, but it is an illogical jump for us to proceed from this premise and conclude that as trustee of game wildlife in the Commonwealth, the Game Commission has standing under the DSEA to insure the maintenance of all natural resources required to sustain its faunal wards. Such a conclusion would give every Commonwealth agency the right to intervene in another agency\u2019s proceedings, so long as the interest concerned was a \u201cprerequisite\u201d to the health or well-being of the interest entrusted to the rival agency.\nThis approach ignores the requirement of showing a direct, immediate, and substantial interest in the matter to be adjudicated. Such a requirement must be met by specific pleadings in at least some circumstances. Here, the Game Commission would have been required to show that violations of the DSEA bore a direct, immediate, and substantial relation to its status as a trustee of the Commonwealth\u2019s wildlife. Our review of the record indicates that the Game Commission failed to plead sufficient facts or law in support of its conclusion that it had standing.\nCom., Pennsylvania Game Commission v. Com., Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, 97 Pa. Cmwlth. 78, 509 A.2d 877, 881 (1986) (footnote deleted.).\nThe majority interprets the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision as \u201c... at its core a determination that the purposes of the DSEA have nothing to do with the functions of the Commission, i.e., protecting wildlife.\u201d (Slip opinion at 6). The majority misunderstands. The Commonwealth Court was pointing out that the Commission\u2019s general interest in preserving wildlife was insufficient without more to confer standing to challenge alleged violations of the DSEA.\nTo establish the requirements of standing, the party, to be aggrieved, must have a direct, immediate and substantial interest in the matter to be adjudicated, and there must be a direct causal connection between the act complained of and the harm alleged. William Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975). The Commission simply failed to establish that it had a \u201cdirect, immediate and substantial interest\u201d in the controversy.\nI disagree also with the majority that its conclusion is bolstered by 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2161(c) which grants concurrent authority to enforce the DSEA with respect to encroachments and water obstructions if the violation would negatively impact upon a swamp, marsh or wetland. This provision grants concurrent authority to enforce the DSEA against violators to the Commission. It is inconclusive, however, on the question of whether the Commission may intervene in DER\u2019s proceedings.",
