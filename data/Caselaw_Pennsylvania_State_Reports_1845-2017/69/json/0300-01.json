        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, October 16th 1871, by\nAgnew, J.\nIn this case but a single error deserves notice. It runs, however, throughout the assignments of error numbered as 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 18. Some of these standing alone are rather indefinite, but others can be sustained. The purpose of the offers contained in the bills therein set forth was to show the relation of John Neel as trustee for Samuel C. Neel his brother. It is quite possible the court below rejected the evidence of a trust upon the supposition that it was in violation of the provisions of the Act of 22d April 1856, because there was no writing to evidence it, and because it was barred by the proviso to the 6th section. But the purpose of the offer was not to claim title through the trust. The plaintiffs had rested their claims of title upon a possession of more than twenty-one years, under the Statute of Limitations, and to rebut the adverse character of that possession, the defendants had given in evidence a lease dated 12th March 1849, from Samuel C. and John Neel to John and Thomas Neel, sons of Samuel C. Neel. Though this paper bears date after the twenty-one years were alleged to have run against the title of John Neel, yet the inference to be drawn from it by a jury tended strongly to rebut the adverse character of Samuel C. Neel\u2019s previous possession. The question would very naturally arise, if Samuel claimed title in his own right, why did he join with John in the lease ? But if John Neel were a trustee only of the legal title for Samuel, and admitted his relation, there would be nothing inconsistent in Samuel\u2019s joining with John in the lease; and it would not contradict the fact that Samuel was holding for himself during the previous period of twenty-one years, and, therefore, that his possession was adverse to any claim of title by John Neel for himself. Whatever might have been the power of Samuel to sustain himself under the trust alone, before the statute had closed against John; clearly if John suffered him to hold the land as his own under an alleged trust for the statutory period, the statute closed the door against John\u2019s title, and made perfect the title in Samuel. So far then as the lease had tended to contradict the adverse character of Samuel\u2019s possession, it was Samuel\u2019s right to rebut it by showing, by the admitted trust, that the instrument was not inconsistent with his previous possession in his own right. These offers should therefore have been received as rebutting evidence.\nIn connection with this, it was the intention of the plaintiffs, in their third point, the refusal of which is assigned as the 23d error, to ask the court to say to the jury that twenty-one years of unmolested possession, unqualified by any circumstances or considerations to the contrary, is to be presumed to be an adverse possession. It is very difficult to understand the point as drawn, and the judge therefore cannot be censured for declining it, especially in view of the rule of the court; but certainly where one holds a possession for himself, taking the profits of the land to himself exclusively for a period of twenty-one years, with nothing in the evidence to stamp upon it a different character, his possession is presumptively adverse to all others (excepting in the case of co-tenants), for he who holds for himself necessarily does not hold for another. The point when properly understood was important to the plaintiffs\u2019 case in furnishing a rule to the jury from which they might infer the adverse character of the possession of Samuel C. Neel. But it was the fault of the plaintiffs that the point was so obscurely drawn. For the reasons already given, however, the judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo is awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Neel et al. versus McElhenny et al.\n1. S. claimed title to Land against J. by twenty-one years adverse holding. J. gave in evidence a lease of the land by him within the twenty-one years, in which S. recognised J.\u2019s title. Declarations of J. made after the twenty-one years, were evidence to show that he was holding as trustee for S., and not by absolute title.\n2. J. permitting S. to hold the land as his own for twenty-one years under an alleged trust, made the title of S. perfect.\n3. Where one holds land for himself, taking the profits to himself exclusively for twenty-one years, with no evidence to stamp upon it a different character, the presumption, except as to co-tenants, is that the possession is adverse.\nOctober 2d and 3d 1871.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, Agnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nError to the District Court of Allegheny county: No. 15, to October and November Term 1870.\nThis was an action of ejectment for 100 acres of land in Mifflin township, brought by William Neel, Samuel C.

Neel and as heirs of John Neel, deceased.\nThe defendants pleaded, \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and filed their abstract of title denying every specification of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.\nThey also specified in their abstract as follows:\u2014\nJohn Neel the elder died seised of the premises intestate in 1801, leaving a widow and seven children, of whom (General) John Neel was one.\nBy agreement of March 29th 1810 and June 11th 1811 of widow and heirs, by which the property became vested in General John Neel.\nRelease, August 18th 1820, Samuel- C.

Neel, deceased, the father of some and grandfather of others of the plaintiffs, for some twenty-three years before his death, which occurred in 1850 or 1851. They also gave in evidence the agreement of March 20th 1810, between the widow and heirs of John Neel (the first), deceased, Samuel 0. and General John Neel being two of them, by which they agreed to part the lands of the decedent into four lots; valued them and allotted them to four of the heirs; the premises in dispute having been allotted to General John; the allottees to pay the other heirs their shares of the valuation as stipulated in the agreement.\nThe plaintiffs having rested, the defendants gave in evidence a deed of confirmation of the foregoing partition, dated June 11th 1811, between the heirs; also, release, August 18th 1820, from Samuel C. Neel to General John Neel for the consideration of $350 of Samuel C.\u2019s interest in the premises.
