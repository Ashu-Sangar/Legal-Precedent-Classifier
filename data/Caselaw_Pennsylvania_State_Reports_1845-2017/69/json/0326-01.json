Taking care of the key of the house and repairing the floor after the tenant had voluntarily left, were no eviction. \u25a0 He would have been entitled to enter if he had returned \u2014 but he did not return. He was neither put out nor sold out by the plaintiff.

    "head_matter": "Pier versus Carr.\n1. Carr rented to Sewell; during the term Sewell\u2019s goods were levied on for tax; before the sale he left the premises. The constable delivered the key to Carr, who had a bill, \u201c To Let \u201d put on the house, retained the key, had repairs done to the house, and showed it to a person applying to rent it. Held, that these did not discharge Sewell from the rent before the end of the term.\n2. Had the tenant returned during the term he would have had the right to enter.\n3. When a tenant is evicted he is discharged from the rent for the time following, not for that due before eviction. Per Stowe, J., of Common Pleas.\n4. If the acts of the landlord are such an interruption of the tenant\u2019s rights under the lease as interfere with his possession, or amount to taking the property off the tenant\u2019s hands, the rent will be suspended from that time. Id.\nOctober 5th 1871.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, Asnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1870, No. 96.\nThis was an action of covenant by William Carr against R. W. Pier, commenced July 3d 1869, on a covenant of suretyship for the performance of the covenants in a lease from Carr to James Sewell, dated January 10th 1868.\nBy the lease Carr rented a tavern-house in Penn Street, Pitts-burg, to Sewell for one year from the 1st of April 1868, at $2000 per annum payable monthly. Pier by an agreement under seal attached to the lease and of the same date stipulated \u201c to be responsible\u201d to Carr, \u201cfor the true and faithful performance of the above contract on the part of James Sewell.\u201d\nIn January 1869, a constable levied, on Sewell\u2019s goods for taxes ; the building was then occupied by Sewell\u2019s family; before the sale, which took place February 1st, Sewell and his family left the premises; the constable left the key with the plaintiff. The defendant bought some goods at the constable\u2019s sale. On the day after the sale there was a bill \u201cTo Let\u201d put upon the house. The defendant sent in February or March for the goods which he had bought; the messenger went to the plaintiff for the key, one of the persons in plaintiff\u2019s employ went to the premises, with the messenger who got the goods, the employee of plaintiff locked the door and took the key with him. In March 1869, a new tenant leased from plaintiff who then had the key,, opened the house and showed it to the new tenant. After Sewell had left and previously to the expiration of his term, the plaintiff made some repairs to the bar-room.\nThe claim was for rent from December 1st 1868 until April 1st 1869, less $50; after suit brought $292 were paid by the defendant.\nThe defendant\u2019s 2d point was:\u2014\n\u201cIf Carr, the plaintiff, took possession of the premises by receiving and retaining the key, putting a workman or workmen into the house for the purpose of making repairs during the term created by the lease, without the assent of the tenant or his surety, it would be such an entry upon the demised premises as would stop the running of the rent.\u201d\nThis was refused.\nThe court (Stowe, J.) charged:\u2014\n\u201c [The simple question here, is, whether the plaintiff took the possession of this house at or about the 1st of February, or subsequently, so as to interfere with the possession of the lessee if he chose to occupy it; in other words, took actual and adverse possession of the property so as to interfere with the lessee or his right under the lease, or to indicate that the landlord took it off the hands of the tenant.] The mere receiving of the key and taking care of it when left by the officer, or putting up a notice that the house was for rent, will not of themselves be such acts as will release the tenant or his security. Nor will a mere entry for the purpose of repairing the floor after the tenant has left, and during the term, in the bar-room five or six feet square, if that was the purpose and effect of the entry, do so. [But if, under all the evidence, you-believe that the acts of plaintiff were such as we have indicated, viz., an actual adverse possession and substantial eviction of the tenant, or an interruption of his rights under the lease such as interfered with his possession, or as satisfies you that plaintiff took the property off his hands, the rent will be suspended from such time, to wit, from the time of such entry, and not for the time which precedes it; in other words, if the entry was on the 20th of March you should allow rent to that date \u2014 for the tenant is bound to pay to that time.\u201d]\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $358.10.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned for error the answer to his point and the parts of the charge in brackets.\nB.
