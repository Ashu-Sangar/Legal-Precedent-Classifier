        "text": "Tbe opinion of tbe court was delivered, October 9th 1871, by\nRead, J.\nBender and Bender & Co., on judgments held by them against Joseph E. Foust, issued three executions on the 15th January 1869, amounting to about $2400, which were levied the next day, on the personal property of the defendant, valued at about $8000. On the 16th January, a judgment was entered in favor of Hyatt & Clark for $890, and on the 18th a fi. fa. was issued and levied on the same property, subject to the three prior executions, 9, 10 and 11, April Term 1869, being the Bender executions. On the 27th January, Hyatt & Clark\u2019s judgment and execution were marked for the use of Jacob Spangler. On the 28th January Benders\u2019 writs of fi. fa. Nos. 9,10 and 11, were stayed, and costs paid and satisfaction subsequently entered on the judgments. On the 30th January, Jacob Spangler released the still-house property from the lien of the judgment assigned to him.\nJacob Spangler, therefore, had under his execution property of Foust sufficient to pay his debt twice over. Spangler had conceived the idea of purchasing the judgment and execution of Hyatt & Clark, and paying them in barrels, but was anxious to be made safe, as the personal property might not reach, and Foust then gave his note to Spangler, with \u00c9. Sheffer as surety, for the sum of $800, payable at three months, which was the return-day of the writs of execution, as collateral security. The note is dated 26th January, and the assignment by Hyatt & Clark was made the next day.\nBy Spangler\u2019s conduct, the levy under Hyatt & Clark\u2019s execution was lost, and he then brought this suit on Foust and Sheffer\u2019s note for $800, alleging that it was an engagement for a stay of execution till the time of the payment of the note. The question whether there was any such arrangement for a stay of execution was distinctly submitted to the jury, by the court helow, and was found against the plaintiff, who is concluded by it, unless there was some mistake in law made by the learned judge.\nThe 1st point presented to the court by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel really covers his whole case.\n\u201c 1st. If the note in suit was given by the defendants to the plaintiff, and accepted by him as collateral security for the Hyatt & Clark judgment, a,nd an execution and levy were pending thereon at the time, the presumption is that it was an engagement for a stay of execution till the time of payment of the note.\u201d\nThe court said, \u201cWe cannot answer this point in the affirmative. It may be a circumstance amongst others tending to prove that there was an engagement for stay of execution, bu.t it does not constitute an absolute presumption of that fact. That there was such an engagement must be proved by evidence positive or circumstantial, but in either case it must be strong enough to enable the jury to say that such an e' expectation and belief will not be s no error in this, nor do we perceiv/ the court. cent was made \u2014 mere t.\u201d There is clearly m the other rulings of\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Spangler versus Sheffer et al.\n1. Foust\u2019s goods being levied on under a fi. fa., Spangler bought the judgment and execution, Foust giving his note payable on the return day of the execution, with Sheffer as his surety, as collateral security for the judgment. Held, that this did not raise the presumption of an engagement for a stay of execution, till the maturity of the note.\n2. By Spangler\u2019s conduct the levy was lost. Held, that he could not recover from Sheffer on the note.\nMay 25th 1871.\nBefore Read, Aunew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of York county: No. 87, to May Term 1871.\nThis was an action of assumpsit brought May 4th 1869, by Jacob Spangler against Joshua E. Foust and Emanuel Sheffer on this promissory note:\u2014\n\u201c $800. Glen Rock, January 26th, 1869.\nThree months after date we promise to pay to the order of Jacob Spangler, Esquire (cooper), eight hundred dollars, value received.\nJoshua E. Foust,\nE. Sheerer.\u201d\nThe note was given under these circumstances. On the 15th of January 1869, judgments amounting in all to about $2400 were recovered by plaintiffs named Bender against Foust; three writs of fi. fa. were on the same day issued on these judgments, and on the 16th personal property of the value of $8000 belonging to Foust levied on. On the same day judgment was entered in favor of Hyatt & Clark against Foust, for $890, an execution issued on the 18th to April term 1869, and on that day a levy made on Foust\u2019s personal property subject to the Bender levies. Foust desired Spangler to buy this judgment; he consented to do so if he was made safe; and the note in suit, which would fall due on the return day of the Hyatt & Clark\u2019s fi. fa, \u2014 Sheffer being the surety for Foust, \u2014 was made and delivered to Spangler as collateral security for the Hyatt & Clark judgment; and on the 27th of January that judgment and the execution were marked to the use of Spangler. On the 28th of January the Bender executions were stayed. To the Hyatt & Clark writ the sheriff returned :\u2014\n\u201cJanuary 30th 1869. Jacob Spangler, * * * informed the sheriff that he had fixed his matters now, and considered himself safe, and the sheriff should do nothing in it; * * * and nothing further was done on this writ.\u201d\nIn March a considerable quantity of Eoust\u2019s property, which had been levied on, was delivered to other creditors, without execution in payment of their claims. In the same month an execution was issued on a judgment of Jacob Grove against Foust, and the remainder of the personal property, which had been under levy on the Hyatt & Clark execution sold, and the proceeds were paid into court and afterwards awarded to Grove\u2019s execution.\nThere was some evidence tending to show that the understanding between Sheffer and Spangler, at the execution of the note, was, that the execution upon the Hyatt & Clark judgment should not be pressed, but that it should be stayed until the note fell due. There was evidence also for the purpose of contradicting the sheriff\u2019s return that Spangler had directed a stay on the Hyatt & Clark execution.\nThe defendant gave in evidence also an ex parte affidavit made by Spangler in relation to the Hyatt & Clark execution, before this suit, and filed with that execution, in which he denied the truth of the sheriff\u2019s return, but .made no averment of an understanding with Sheffer for a stay.\nThere was a large amount of evidence bearing upon the ques- \u2019 tions raised in the case; the foregoing will sufficiently present the questions.\nThe points of the parties with their answers are as follows:\u2014 Plaintiff\u2019s: 1. \u201c If the note in suit was given by the defendants to the plaintiff and accepted by him as collateral security for the Hyatt & Clark judgment, and an execution and levy were pending thereon at the time, the presumption is that it was an engagement for a stay of execution till the time of payment of the note.\u201d Answer: \u201cWe cannot answer this point in the affirmative. It may be a circumstance amongst others tending to prove that there was an engagement for a stay of execution, but it does not constitute an absolute presumption of that fact. That there was such an engagement must be proved by evidence positive or circumstantial, but in either case it must be strong enough to enable the jury to say that such an engagement was made. Mere expectation and belief will not be sufficient.\u201d\n2. \u201c If the defendant, Sheffer, became surety for the defendant, Foust, in the note in suit, and said note was taken by the plaintiff as collateral security on the Hyatt & Clark judgment, Sheffer was a mere volunteer, and stands in the place of a surety not entitled to indemnity, and his liability is absolute, notwithstanding the security arising by means of the levy made on said judgment may have been lost.\u201d\nAnswer: \u201cWe cannot answer this point in the affirmative.\u201d\n8. \u201c If there was a levy made on the execution issued on the Hyatt & Clark judgment, of sufficient property of the defendant to satisfy the judgment, and the plaintiff as holder of said judgment had thus the means of satisfaction in his hands, and the defendant, Sheffer, interposed 'in behalf of the defendant, Foust, and gave the note in suit as collateral security, any release of the property levied was occasioned by the defendant, _Sheffer\u2019s, own act, which was to the detriment and not to the benefit of the plaintiff, and Sheffer cannot now set up the plaintiff\u2019s failure to collect the money on Hyatt & Clark\u2019s execution against the right of the plaintiff to recover in this suit.\u201d\nAnswer : \u201c We cannot answer this point in the affirmative, unless there was an agreement on the part of Sheffer that the giving of the note was to have the effect of a stay of execution, or, in other words, that it was given as the consideration of a stay of execution.\u201d\n4. \u201c It was the duty of the defendant, Sheffer, under the circumstances of this case, if he desired to be relieved from his collateral 'undertaking, to notify Spangler as holder of the Hyatt & Clark judgment, not to relinquish the lien of the levy on the defendant\u2019s property, but to push the same and collect the money.\u201d\nAnswer: \u201cWe cannot answer this point in the affirmative.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s: 1. \u201c If the jury believe that Emanuel Sheffer is ' the surety in the note in suit, and that it was given as collateral or additional security for the judgment and execution in favor of Hyatt & Clark against Foust to Jacob Spangler, at the time of his taking an assignment thereof, and that said execution was levied upon the personal property of the defendant therein, sufficient to satisfy the same, such levy is a satisfaction of the said judgment and execution as respects Emanuel Sheffer, and the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.\u201d\n4. \u201c The return of the sheriff upon the execution is conclusive against Spangler, that the writ was stayed, and this cannot be controverted.\u201d\nBoth these points were affirmed.\nIn the general charge, the court (Fisher, P. J.), said :\n* * * \u201cA fourth question is, did Sheffer agree, that in consideration of Spangler\u2019s staying the execution, the note in. suit should be given, or that the consideration of the note was that the execution should be stayed. In deciding this case, the jury will take into consideration all the evidence, and all the facts and circumstances of the case. I say the facts, for the jury cannot presume an agreement or contract to stay the execution from the mere expression by Sheffer of a desire, or a hope, or an expectation that Spangler would stay the execution, if he gave the note as a surety and as collateral security.\u201d\nThe jury having been out some time, came into court and said they had not agreed upon a verdict. The court said to the jury that \u201c the court thought that this case was one. about which they ought to have no difficulty. It was the duty of Mr. Spangler to satisfy the jury that the contract or agreement to stay the execution was made. Sheffer and Foust swore positively that no such agreement was made, and the affidavit of Spangler does not state that there was such an agreement. There are circumstances in the case that may tend to another conclusion which we do not think proper to take from the jury.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the defendants.\nThe plaintiff took out a writ of error and assigned for error the answers to the points, and the foregoing portions of the charge.\nH. L. Fisher and J. Gibson, for plaintiff in error.\nThe act of Sheffer, in giving the note contemporaneously with the assignment of the judgment to the plaintiff, amounted not only to a presumption, but to a suspension of the remedy against the debtor: Okie v. Spencer, 2 Wharton 253; Shaw v. The First Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, 3 Wright 226; Pott v. Nathans, 1 W. & S. 155; Schnitzel\u2019s Appeal, 13 Wright 23; Bank of Penna. v. Potius, 10 Watts 148. Sheffer\u2019s collateral undertaking was that of a volunteer, and is similar to bail for stay of execution: Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. & S. 352; Hoover v. Epler, 2 P. F. Smith 522; Wallace\u2019s Estate, 9 Id. 406; Lewis v. The Bank of Penn Township, 3 Wharton 531; Dyott\u2019s Estate, 2 W. & S. 463; Lishy v. O\u2019Brien, 4 Watts 141; Miller v. Howry, 3 Penna. R. 374; Lord v. The Ocean Bank, 8 Harris 384. Sheffer ought to have notified Mr. Spangler, not to relinquish the lien of the levy, but to push the same and collect the money: Commonwealth v. Miller, 8 S. & R. 452; Cathcart\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 416; Schuylkill Bank v. Macalester, 6 W. & S. 147; Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. & S. 36. A sheriff\u2019s return is only primff facie evidence of facts incidentally in question in a contest with a third party: Lowry v. Coulter, 9 Barr 349; Gyfford v. Woodgafe, 11 East 148 ; Paxson\u2019s Appeal, 13 Wright 195; Watson on Sheriffs 72; Sewell, Id. 387; Keyser\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 409.\nV. K. Keasey and J. L. Mayer, for defendants in error.\nWhere there is a levy on personal property of the principal, it is a satisfaction pro tanto, as regards the surety, of which nothing can deprive him, except his assent to the arrangement by which the property is released: Cathcart\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 416-420. They also cited as to the plaintiff\u2019s first point: Weakly v. Bell & Sterling, 9 Watts 273; Bank of Penna. v. Potius, 10 Watts 148; Shaw v. The First Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, 3 Wright 226."
