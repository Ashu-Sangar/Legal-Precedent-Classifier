[The tax demanded is not on ‘ dividends,’ but on <em>net earnings, </em>one of altogether a different character. Even if the company compounds for the tax on dividends, it did not preclude the state from imposing other taxes on this corporation. It could tax its property, real or personal, its net or gross earnings, its sales or any other taxes deemed proper.] The right to levy and collect taxes is a necessary incident of every government — essential to its very existence, and is never presumed to have been surrendered or abandoned except by clear words, and for what is deemed, at the time, by the law-making power, an adequate consideration. The surrender cannot be extended by implication, and if one tax is expressed it cannot be presumed to extend to others. No power to tax need be reserved; it exists and remains unless expressly yielded. Besides, if the release had been general, and not merely a particular tax, it would not bind a succeeding legislature, as this charter was granted since the amendment of the Constitution, in 1857, which gives full power over' such instruments.

L. 218, for individuals are included in the persons taxed, who neither pay nor declare dividends. A manufacturing company, not paying a tax to the state upon dividends under existing laws, pays a tax upon its annual net earnings or income, and this description includes the plaintiffs in error. The fourth section of their charter provides: “ That the company shall pay into the treasury of the state a bonus of two and a half per cent, on the capital stock, hereby authorized, or any increase of the same, in three equal annual instalments, in lieu of any tax on dividends. Net earnings or income are the products of the business, deducting the expenses only,” (Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Penn Gas Coal Co., 12 P. F. Smith 242); and the tax upon them is not a tax of dividends; and if it were, and if they were exempted by the fourth sectión as contended, still, under the decisions of this court in The Iron City Bank <em>v. </em>The City of Pittsburg, <a href="/wright/1/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Wright 340" data-case-ids="626169" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0346-01">1 Wright 340</a>, and in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Fayette County Railroad Co., 5 P. F. Smith 452, it is impossible to hold that the tax is not a legal charge. The learned judge’s charge is perfectly correct.</p>
