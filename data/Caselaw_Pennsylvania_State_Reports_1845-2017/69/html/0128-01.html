In 1794 a tract of 400 acres in Woodberry township was warranted in the name of “Daniel Kritler/' and surveyed as 461 acres. It was assessed in Frankstown (cut off from Woodberry) till 1846 (from 1838 in the name of “Daniel Kladder”) and the taxes paid by the owner. Blair township was afterwards erected from Frankstown, and the tract continued to be assessed in Blair in the name of “Kritler,” the owner still paying the taxes. After 1846 a tract of 230 acres was assessed in Frankstown in the name of “ Klad~ der,” and another of 230 acres in the same name in Huston, which had been cut off from Woodberry. The 230 acre tract in Frankstown was sold for taxes: the purchaser entered on the tract in Blair, claiming that it was the tract he had bought. <em>Held, </em>as matter of law, that there was no evidence of the identity of the Frankstown 230 acres with Blair tract.</p>

If it was the same land, the land upon which the cutting was done, that was assessed and sold under the other name, and that made apparent by sufficient evidence, then the'sale would vest the title in the defendant. [It is the land that is taxed and sold; but the land cannot be correctly taxed and sold under any name or designation.

Daniel Kladder is an entirely different name from Daniel Kritler. Some difference in the spelling of a name is of but little consequence ; and there are some variations in the assessment of this" Kritler traced in Huntingdon county down to 1837, where it occurs sometimes Kritler, and once Krydler, and again Kritler. These variations do not materially change the name, it being still <em>idem sonans. </em>• But Kladder and Kritler are as essentially different names as any other words of two syllables beginning and ending with the same letters. They are not <em>idem sonans. </em>There is nothing in the sound of one that could suggest the other. They are different names. Then again, while it is a different name, the assessment was of a tract of different quantity, and as lying in another township. Now, in all this, there is an entire absence of every element of identification.</p>

But a previous assessment of a tract, properly or improperly made, does not do away with the necessity of a proper designation of it at the time it is sold; some designation that indicates in the assessment itself to the owner or purchaser what tract it is; either from its own name or the name of some owner.

Their mistake, if it was a mistake, evidently was in supposing that there were two tracts represented by these different names, as of the different quantities and in the different localities. For, in 1847, the first year after the erection of this county, they assessed Daniel Kritler, 400 acres in Blair township, where it belongs. * * * That the commissioners or assessor should have stumbled by chance upon a correct name in this way, so as to get it letter for letter, is not supposable.

This mark of <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>identity is most convincing. Besides it is in the same township where it is represented to be, and there continues to be assessed from 1847 down to 1854, and as the books show the taxes all the time paid for seven years after the erection of the county, the first seven years of the existence of the county as a county. * * *</p>

Now, could this be accounted for on any other hypothesis than that the commissioners understood, believed, and treated Daniel Kladder as a different tract from Daniel Kritler ? Is it not plain, taking all the facts together, can there be a doubt that the commissioners were led into the error, if it was an error, and acted under it all through, of supposing that they had two tracts at least, represented by these names, to deal with, if not more ? * * * * * *</p>

It had been assessed in that name for many years in Blair township and taxes paid upon it by Dr. Shoenberger, and after his death by those who succeeded to his title. It was therefore a well-known tract situate in that township, and the same land without dispute upon which the alleged trespass was committed. The defendant attempted to show title in himself, by proving a sale for taxes of an unseated tract of land assessed in the name of Daniel Kladder, containing 230 acres, in Frankstown township. The burthen of proof was on the defendant to show the identity of the tract sold — that it was the same as the well-known tract in the warrant name of Daniel Kritler of 461 acres 97 perches lying in Blair township. The judge below held that there was nothing in the names which could identify them as one and the same tract on the principle of <em>idem sonans, </em>and therefore identification must be derived from other sources. The quantity of land in each, and the townships, afforded no means of identification, and that there was no other evidence which under the circumstances of the cause could warrant the conclusion, that the Daniel Kladder tract of 230 acres in Frankstown township was the Daniel Kritler tract of 461 acres in Blair township. In such a case it would require very clear and satisfactory evidence that they were the same. The tract owned by Dr. Shoenberger was assessed in its true name in Blair township for many years before the sale, and he had paid .taxes always for it there. The division of the township had taken place in 1846, and his land was assessed in Blair township ever afterward. But the defendant relied on the fact that the land had been assessed in the name of Daniel Kladder in Frankstown township before 1847, and in and after that year that 230 acres were assessed in the same name in Frankstown township, and 230 acres assessed in that name in Huston township which had been cut off from Woodberry township in 1846, making up the whole of the Daniel Kritler tract. Had not the whole of the Daniel Kritler warrant been taxed in its true name in Blair township where it actually lies, and the owner of it been accustomed to pay the taxes of the tract as in that township, there might be a color for the argument that the tract sold was the same tract as the Kritler tract. But the commissioners cannot thus tax the whole tract in <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>its proper name and quantity in its proper township, and tax it also in two parts in two other townships, where it does not lie. This would mislead everybody — owner,, treasurer and purchaser. Now when the tract is found assessed in its proper township for years and taxes paid for it as there, to hold that a former misnomer of the tract which had dropped out of memory for many years, would justify a sale of one half of it by that misnomer in a different township, and of the other half by the same misnomer in a third township, is monstrous. If such loose proceedings can strip a man of his property, there is no safety. This case is governed by the principles laid down in the case of The City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20440" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Wright 440">13 Wright 440</a>, reaffirmed in Lyman <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 6 P. F. Smith 488, and also in Glass <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 8 Id. 266. We agree with the court below that under the circumstances of this case there was no sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that the sale of the Daniel Kladder tract of 230 acres in Frankstown township, could carry the title of the Daniel Kritler tract of 461 acres in Blair township.</p>
