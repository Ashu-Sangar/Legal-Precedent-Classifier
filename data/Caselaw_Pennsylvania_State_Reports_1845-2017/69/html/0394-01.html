All this or more is expressed or implied in the fine-print stipulations and conditions of their receipt. If full force and effect were given to these fine-print conditions, it would be as to them an entire exemption from the laws and liabilities of common carriers, and their offers to serve the community in that capacity would be a mockery, a delusion and a snare. While holding themselves out as such, they cannot thus escape the liabilities that attach to their occupation. Their undertaking is larger than their receipt and appended conditions. Receiving such a package marked for a certain destination, they are bound to forward it on its way with care and diligence, and are liable for any loss or damage that accrues through any negligence of theirs, or their agents or employees. That they may limit their liability for accidents beyond their control by special contract may be true, but they cannot exonerate themselves from the duties which the law imposes upon a party thus assuming the custody of another’s property and the obligations of a carrier respecting it. * * * It is clear to my mind that the loss of goods in the hands of a carrier unaccounted for, is presumptive evidence of negligence, and throws the burden of proof on him as to the manner of the loss. Peradventure he may show that the loss so happened as not to make him liable. But showing nothing as to how, when and by what means the loss occurs, the liability falls on him with or without a special contract. When the law presumes negligence, the burden of showing its absence necessarily devolves upon the party implicated.

It was not delivered to him. The defendant was not to blame for that, for he would not take it. What, then, was to he done ? It should have remained at the place of consignment until the further order of the consignor was received. But this was not done. Those put in charge of it by the defendants undertook, of their own motion, to bring it back.] It came back into the hands of defendants. They claim to have received it as a package of $1900, agreed to pay those from whom they received it the full price for transporting that amount back from Lancaster. They then brought it to Titusville, charging for its transportation over their route at the full rate for $1900, and collected the expressage on that amount both to and from Lancaster. What was this but an assertion on their part that they had faithfully, diligently and carefully discharged their undertaking, and now returned undamaged the money intrusted to them? They did not return what they had received by $1300, and gave no account of its loss. But on whom should it fall, supposing both parties equally innocent of any intentional wrong ? Should the plaintiff, who has been guilty of no negligence, who had no possession of or control over it, be the victim ? * * * Whose duty is it to show how the loss occurred ? The plaintiff has no means of showing it. The defendants have, or ought to have. If the defendants have dishonest employees, that would be negligence. If they delivered the package into the hands of thieves, that was negligence. [If they received it from others on its return-trip and re-delivered it to plaintiffs as $1900, charging and receiving full price for the transmission, care and incidental responsibility of that amount, and there was not that amount there, that was negligence — not criminal, but technical.]</p>

[The burden of proof, then, was on the defendants to show their entire innocence of any agency in producing this loss. This could only be done by showing how it did happen. It was implied, if not expressed, in the contract of the defendants in taking charge of this money, that they would take or send it to its destination or return it to its owner. They have done neither. Therefore the presumption of negligence arises against them. They fail to show that it was the negligence of any other express company for whose carelessness they stipulated not to be responsible.

He instructed the jury more than once that the express company had agreed to carry or send the package in question safely to Lancaster and' deliver it to Mr. Funk, to whom it was directed. He entirely put aside, as of no validity, the special contract contained in the receipt, actually filled up.by the bank, and accepted by them, undoubtedly with full knowledge of its stipulations. Pie put this, it would seem, on two grounds, both of which are unquestionably true, but have no application to the case, viz.: first, that common carriers cannot so limit their liability, by special notice or contract, as to exempt themselves from the consequences of their own or their servants’ negligence; and second, that if property is received by a common carrier, and he fails to deliver it safely at its place of destination, the burden is on him to prove that it was not lost or injured while in his custody; and in general, the only way in which he can do this satisfactorily, is by proving when, where, and how the loss did actually occur. There was, however, in this case, no attempt to relieve the common carrier from the necessity of proving to the satisfaction of the jury that the package, after its delivery to the express company, was not broken open and rifled of part of its <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>contents while in the possession and custody of any of their officers or agents. The learned judge thought, and so charged, that it was incumbent on them to prove affirmatively where, when, and by whose negligence, or otherwise, the loss had actually happened. We think, however, that this rule is not applicable to the case. By the express terms of the contract contained in the receipt, the express company undertook only to forward to the nearest point of destination reached by them, and upon this, among other conditions, that they were not to be liable for any default or negligence of any person or corporation to whom they might deliver it at any point off their own established route or line. If they were carriers at all, it was only to the nearest point of destination ; beyond that they were forwarders only. There was nothing unreasonable, unusual or unlawful in such a contract. It is very well settled that forwarders are not insurers as common carriers. They are liable only as ordinary bailees to carry for hire. <em>“A </em>person,” says Mr. Justice Story, “who receives and forwards goods, taking upon himself the expenses of transportation, for which he receives a compensation from the owners, but who has no concern in the vessels or wagons by which they are transported, and no interest in the freight, is not to be deemed a common carrier, but a mere warehouseman or agent: ” Story on Bailees, § 502; Chitty on Carriers 18; Hoop <em>v. </em>Wells, 5 Am. Law Reg., N. S., 16; Jenneson <em>v. </em>The Camden and Amboy Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Am.%20Law%20Reg.%20234" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Am. Law Reg. 234">4 Am.

    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[327,1502,1152,719]]]'>To hold that a forwarder merely is bound not merely to clear his own skirts of negligence, but to prove when, where and how the loss occurred, would be to impose upon him an obligation which attaches only to a carrier, and not to an ordinary bailee for hire. A carrier, who is bound at all events to deliver safely, must bring himself, by positive evidence, within the exceptions, the act of Grod, or public enemies. Not so an ordinary bailee. It is enough for him to satisfy a jury, by the best evidence in his power, that he has performed his duty with care and fidelity, and that the loss has not arisen from any default of himself or his servants. The jury then should have been instructed that if the evidence satisfied them that the loss had not occurred between Titusville and Corry, either in going or returning, but on some other part of the route, and that in the performance of their duties as forwarders they had used all usual and reasonable care and diligence in the selection of proper carriers, their verdict should be for the defendants.</p>
