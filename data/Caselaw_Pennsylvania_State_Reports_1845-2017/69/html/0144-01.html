In the present ease the fact that the plaintiff with his whole family moved into the house of Peter Schoch about the year 1855, immediately after the death of Schoch’s wife, and remained there during his whole lifetime, Garrett receiving his support and that of his family mainly from the farm of Mr. Schoch, under a contract to that effect, is relied on to repel the presumption that Garrett was to have compensation for nursing, waiting upon and taking care of the decedent. The jury must judge whether under these circumstances it was understood that Garrett was to be compensated for his trouble with Schoch in addition to the advantages enumerated, or was to perform the labor, or bestow the attention gratuitously, and was to have nothing more than those advantages therefor. If such was the original contract or understanding there can be no compensation, unless there was a new bargain. You will carefully consider all that was said from time to time, as proved by the different witnesses, not merely to establish <em>k </em>contract from that time, <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>but also to rebut any presumption arising from the method of living, and manner of coming together, as the law would imply a contract to pay unless repelled by circumstances. [It appears to be conceded in the argument, and is perhaps satisfactorily proved, that Mr. Schoch invited and urged his daughter and son-in-law to come and live with and keep house for him, the other daughters and sons having declined to come. Was there a contract then made for payment-? The only witness who speaks of it is Elizabeth Zeller, a daughter of the plaintiff, who says that when her grandfather asked her mother to come and keep house for him he said she should he well paid.’ ‘ He asked the other girls first, said whichever one did it should be well paid for it, and then mother promised.’ She states that this was on the day her grandmother died. Can you rely upon this as sufficient evidence of a contract ? You will bear in mind that this lady was then a young girl only about eleven years old, a daughter of the plaintiff. Nothing is said against her general veracity, hut persons of that age have but little judgment, or knowledge of dealings, may readily misunderstand or misremember. Her correctness on this subject is submitted to your careful consideration. It is an important point in the case, as on it the plaintiff relies to show a bargain for payment before he entered on the duty. He also contends that the bargain being so made and carried into full effect on his part by remaining there and keeping house for Schoch during his whole life, it was an entire contract, not completed on part of the plaintiff until the death of the intestate, and therefore the statute of limitation does not bar any part of that claim. Such, we say, is the legal effect of an entire contract. If it is of a character requiring many years to consummate, it is not barred until six years after completion. As if a man should undertake to clear off a large body of land for another under a contract to be paid on completion of the work, and he necessarily spent seven or eight years in its performance, the law would not bar his claim, until six years after it was finished. In like manner if a contract be made to keep house during the lifetime of another, the bargain would not be completed until his death, whilst if compensation was claimed on an implied contract for work and services, all of older date than six years would be barred. The jury must judge whether the .parties meant in this case that the housekeeping should continue during life.’] That you must collect from all of their acts and declarations; leaving out of view what was said as to an original contract, does the evidence of the different witnesses repel the presumption attempted to be raised; that there was to be no other compensation to Garrett than the advantage to himself and family of living on and drawing their subsistence from Schoch’s property. * * * It is very possible that the advantages derived by Mr.</p>

Besides these declarations, the testimony of Elizabeth Zeller, already referred to, which need not be -repeated here, has a direct bearing on the question. If the jury were satisfied from her testimony that there was an express contract for the payment of the services, could they have any doubt it was understood and intended to be entire, and that it was to continue until it was dissolved by the decedent’s death ? The court rightly instructed the jury that if they found the contract was entire, then the Statute of Limitations did not form any bar to the plaintiff’s claim.</p>

Whether the <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>compensation should he limited and restricted to the support of the plaintiff and his family, or whether it should exceed the support drawn from the decedent’s farm, was left to the determination of the jury, under all the evidence in the cause, with the instruction, that if it was understood between the parties, that there was to be no compensation beyond the advantages derived from the farm, the jury could allow nothing, and their verdict must be in favor of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[187,754,1162,688]]]'>From what we have already said, it is manifest that the evidence given by the plaintiff, was sufficient to justify the court in submitting to the jury the questions: whether there was an express contract for the payment of the services rendered by the plaintiff’s wife; whether it was understood and intended to be a continuing contract, dissolvable only by the decedent’s death; and whether the compensation was limited by, or was to exceed the support derived from the decedent’s farm ? If the wife was not to receive extra compensation for the very disagreeable services she performed for the decedent in his sickness, as the plaintiff in error contends, what mean his repeated declarations and assurances that he “would pay her for this ” — that “ she should be well satisfied,” &amp;e. ? If the plaintiff was to receive only a.living for himself and family, then the obligation to make compensation for the wife’s services was discharged as soon as it was incurred, and her services were paid for as soon as they were rendered.</p>
    <p id="b151-7" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[187,1441,1162,302]]]'>There was no error in admitting the testimony embraced in the 1st, 2d, 3d and 4th bills of exception, for the purposes for which it was received; and we discover no such error in rejecting the offer contained in the 5th bill of exception as calls for a reversal of' the judgment. The case was carefully tried by the learned judge'who presided at the trial, and for the reasons given the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
