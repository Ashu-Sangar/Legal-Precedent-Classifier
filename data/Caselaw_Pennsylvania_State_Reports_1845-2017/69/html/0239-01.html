Lloyd said that the understanding was that Lloyd was to take the land — the Farrell title — at his own risk.. They talked the matter over and both agreed to this. It was executed with that distinct understanding, Farrell all the time refusing to sign it. I said it was a distipct understanding of the parties, and not mine, that Lloyd was to take it at his own risk. I had told Farrell not to sell unless he got that agreement. Other parties wanted to buy the land at the same time, and I told Farrell not to sell the land except at the purchaser’s risk, because there was a good deal of litigation about lands on the mountain, and they had been comparatively worthless before that, and that there was no use in him selling the tract of coal-land at that price, that persons were wanting it that would guaranty the title. The Portage and Central Railroads were then making and opening up this country and making land valuable. This was the understanding of the parties at the time they signed the deed. The same understanding was had in regard' to the title at the signing of the deed as at the signing of the article of agreement; that is at the execution of the deed. I was there then and witnessed the deed. This understanding was the understanding of the parties, Gilbert Lloyd and Thomas Farrell.

It would seem from this that Thomas had first gone to Canoe Furnace (Spang’s) sometime in 1839, and that shortly afterwards the old man came; that he lived with the old man, the family living together, and that both worked at the furnace. It seems that their accounts were kept together; first opened in the name of Thomas, because he was first there, and so kept after the old man came. A balance in their favor seemed to have been accumulating, until, about the time they quit, two notes, as the books show, were given to the old man, amounting to about $300. It would seem, probable that these notes were for the surplus earnings of both. The notes were given to the old man. [According to the testimony of old Mr. Farrell, Thomas was born sometime in 1819. He could not fix the time of the year. Consequently, what yas earned by Thomas at the furnace previous to 1841, while he was under age, and living with his father, according to the general rule of law, would belong to his father. It seems that, on the settlement, the notes for the balance due on their account, were given to his father; and the money was due from the furnace on the notes to him, though earned principally, it is probable, by Thomas; and this is the money, it is likely, which the old man referred to at the time of the purchase,.as coming to him at Spang’s furnace.

It will be noted that the reversal was because the evidence went to prove another agreement going to contradict and change entirely the agreement of the parties at the time, without any allegation of mistake or fraud; and, secondly, and more especially, because there was a concealment by Thomas Farrell of the relation sustained by him to his sisters, or of the fact that he held the title for himself and in trust for his sisters; that he was really and only the owner of the one-third, while he undertook to sell the whole land. * * * Mr. Lloyd says there was not a word said about that subject; and it was upon this ground mainly, that it was ruled and held by the Supreme Court that the proof of that agreement by Mr. Lloyd should not have been submitted to the jury, and for that reason mainly the judgment was reversed; and the case is the same now, upon that vital point, that it was then. * * * The question <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>would still be, whether <em>this </em>defect in the title was plainly included in this alleged agreement.

Mr. Chief Justice Lewis said: “ The mere declaration of a vendee that he intends to buy for another, with<a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>out evidence of a previous agreement to do so, or of any advance of money for the purpose, raises no trust which can be supported.” On this record, however, there is evidence which if believed is sufficient to supply that deficiency. There is the testimony of Jonathan Zerbe, who was the book-keeper at the Canoe Furnace, from which it may fairly be inferred that Thomas was able to save money out of his earnings, and had, at the very time of the purchase, money just then due and paid him, but that it was highly improbable that Barnabas had anything. But more directly in point is the testimony of William Yon. He said that in 1841 he went to the house where the Farrells lived to haul some wood for them. He found Barnabas before the door in his good clothes as about to go away on some business. He (the old man) “ said he was going to the mountain to buy a piece of land. He said that Thomas had got a little money, and said he wanted to put it into land. He said he was going to buy a tract adjoining Burgoon’s lands on the mountain. I told him I knew near about where Burgoon’s lands were; that I had hauled coal from there. While we were talking, Thomas came out of the house and handed over some money to his father.” Now here is evidence of a previous agreement by Barnabas to buy the land for Thomas, and of an actual advance of money by Thomas to do so — it matters not what the amount was, great or small. Coupled with the declaration by Barnabas to Collins at the time of the purchase that he was buying for Thomas, we think it should have been submitted to the jury to say whether the purchase had not actually been made at the time with money advanced by Thomas for that purpose, which would have created a valid resulting trust in his favor within the exception of the Statute of • Frauds.</p>

Lloyd upon this trial, in regard to the agreement by Gilbert L. Lloyd on his purchase from Thomas Farrell to take all the risk of the title, was materially different from what it was on the former trial, when the ease was under review in this court in Lloyd <em>v. </em>Farrell, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%2073" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 Wright 73">12 Wright 73</a>. The witness then said nothing of what took place when the deed was delivered or after the article of agreement was made. His testimony as to what took place at the time of the agreement was indefinite. <em>“ </em>We are n-ot even informed,” said Mr. Justice Strong, “ whose understanding it was of which the witness spoke. Was it his own or that of the parties? Was it the witness’s construction of the written agreement or of the conversation of Farrell and Lloyd ? If, as is probable, the witness referred to the understanding of the parties, how did he gather it — from their negotiation or their written contract?” It is not disputed that in all these respects the testimony is now clear and definite. <em>“ </em>On the day it (the article) was executed,” says the witness, “ Gilbert Lloyd came out from Hollidaysburg with the article prepared. <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>He brought it into our office prepared. Farrell was present before the execution of the article and refused to sign it, alleging that it was not a conveyance of the tract, not in accordance with the agreement. Gilbert L. Lloyd said that the understanding of the parties was that Lloyd was to take the land — the Farrell title — at his own risk. They talked the matter over and both agreed to this. It was executed with that distinct understanding.” “ This was the understanding of the parties at the time they signed the deed. The same understanding was had in regard to the title at the signing of the deed as at the signing of the article of agreement : that is at the execution of the deed. I was there then and witnessed the deed. This understanding was the understanding of the parties, Gilbert Lloyd and Thomas Farrell. Farrell refused to sign on any other conditions.” It is certainly true that if Thomas Farrell knew that there was a secret trust in favor of his sisters and fraudulently concealed that fact, he could not avail -himself of this agreement, either at law or in equity. It would be void so far as their title was concerned. But that clearly was a question for the jury, and would depend very much upon the fact whether the land was bought with his, Thomas’s, money. If he knew that to be so, he was not bound to disclose the fact that he had given a bond of indemnity against his sister’s title to his vendors, Collins &amp; Ross. If Farrell knew he had paid for the land though the original agreement was in his father’s name, good faith did not require him to state to his vendee facts connected with it which he deemed of no importance. If, however, the fact was not so, and of course he must have known it — “ that with such knowledge concealed in his own bosom,” as Mr. Justice Strong well remarked in Lloyd <em>v. </em>Farrell, “ he could have bound his ignorant vendee by an agreement to assume all the risk of a title, would be grossly inequitable. It is idle to say that any court of equity would enforce such a contract.” It is evident, then, that whether there was a fraudulent concealment by Farrell of his sister’s claim or title, was a question of fact which ought to have been submitted to the jury.</p>
