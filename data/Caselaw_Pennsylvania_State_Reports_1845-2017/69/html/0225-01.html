Her evidence, the defendant’s counsel contend, is not reliable, and ought not to be credited, because it is in conflict with the declarations of her father to Mr. Baker and Mr. Lehman. Mr. Lehman states that in a conversation with Mr. Plank about the note, he asked him if there was any witness, and Plank said there was not, nobody when he, Burkholder, gave it. Mr. Baker states that he asked Plank whether he had a witness to the signature of Burkholder. He said he had not. Witness told him that would be a trouble in his way, and asked him was anybody present or in the room at the time, and Plank said there was no person present. Said he wished there had been some person. Witness repeated it would be a trouble in his way, and Plank replied, the old man wanted no one in. This is certainly in conflict with the evidence of Mrs. Meixel, who said she was in the room when the note was signed, and detailed the conversation between her father and Mr. Burkholder. But plaintiff’s counsel contend that this apparent discrepancy is reconcilable without impugning the truth of Mrs. Meixel or her father. That the first inquiry by Mr. Baker was, have you a witness to the signature of Mr. Burkholder ? to which Plank replied he had not. That he was next asked, was there anybody present in the room at the time ? And the question of inquiry being the proof of the note either by a witness to the note or the presence of a witness at the time it was signed, who could prove its execution, Plank replied there was no person present — meaning there was no person present who would be a witness. The impression being, as plaintiff’s counsel allege, with many not conversant with the rules of evidence, that a child cannot be a witness for its parent. This solution of this apparent contradiction between the evidence of Mrs. Meixel and the declarations of her father, is submitted to you, and you will give it such consideration as you may deem it entitled to.]</p>

[And although you may consider $3500 a large sum for the services rendered, if decedent intended to repay these services with that sum, and gave his son-in-law, Mr. Plank, a note for that amount as a remuneration for the kindness, attention and unpleasant duties it appears from the evidence Mr. and Mrs. Plank were occasionally required to perform, he had a right to contract and agree for the payment of such sum as he considered right and proper, and to give his note to Mr. Plank as evidence of the debt.]</p>

But if you are satisfied from the evidence, that the note in suit was signed by Burkholder, then a further inquiry arises. The defendant alleges that although the signature may be genuine, it was procured by fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. If the note was signed by Jacob Burkholder, the legal presumption is that it was fairly and honestly obtained, and the party alleging fraud must prove it. * * * If the evidence satisfies you that fraud or deceit was practised on Burk-holder in obtaining the note, there can be no recovery upon it. [On the contrary, if the evidence fails to satisfy you, that the note was procured fraudulently, and if you are. satisfied that Burkholder signed the note for services which he considered worth the amount he promised to pay, then, as we have before said, the plaintiff may recover the amount of the note and interest.] But should you find that there can be no recovery on the note either for want of proof of its genuineness, or because you believe from the evidence that it was fraudulently obtained, then you may find such sum as you may believe to be a fair and proper compensation for services rendered which have not been paid for.”</p>

The late Chief Justice Lewis very clearly draws the distinction between want and failure of consideration in Candor &amp; Henderson’s Appeal, 3 Casey 119. If fraud or imposition on the obligor or maker is set up as a defence, then not merely whether there was any consideration, but its adequacy, may be very material as an element in that question. If Jacob Burk-holder in the exercise of a capable will — freely and without fraud or duress — sealed and delivered to Jacob B. Plank, the instrument of writing sued upon, it was a gift of the money mentioned in it, and may be enforced against him or his estate after his death.</p>

We think it was an error, which ran through the whole case, which was tried in all respeGts, so far as this question is concerned, as if it had been on a parol promise. The fact, if the fact was, that no services had been rendered which had not been fully paid for by Burkholder, had a very important bearing upon the questions whether Burkholder had executed the note, and whether it was with a correct knowledge of its contents. If so, he had a right to give it for services however insignificant — even the common office of humanity by the most entiré <em>stranger </em>— monstrare <em>viarn erranti. </em>To show to the jury, in corroboration of the note, that he had no intention to make a gift — that his relations with and expressed opinions in regard to Plank, precluded any such idea — would lead to the inference of fraud if in point of fact there were no services <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>rendered; or services insignificant compared with the compensation contracted to be paid; or that there had been a settlement in full shortly before the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b234-4" data-blocks='[["BL_234.4",234,[287,529,1157,1412]]]'>The plaintiff had given evidence of the services rendered, not as a claim in addition to and independent of the note, but, in case it should not be sustained, to lay ground for a recovery under the common counts of the declaration. He also showed declarations of kind and grateful feelings of Burkholder towards Plank and his wife. The defendants proved that the entire body of the note was in Plank’s handwriting; that Burkholder was very old; had in a great measure lost his eyesight, so as not to be able to read writing; that there was a contract or contracts between the parties by which Plank undertook to furnish boarding, washing and mending for Burkholder, at $3.25 for each and every week; and that there had been a settlement and payment of all that was due on this account. All this was relevant so far as the note was concerned, as tending to sustain the defence of fraud, and only relevant in that aspect. Whether Burkholder intended to give Plank $3500 as a mere gratuity or present, as a grateful return for kind offices performed under no contract expressed or implied to be paid for them, or, besides providing a fair and reasonable compensation, he meant to add a further sum as a present — this certainly was one of the points which fairly arose in the case. The defendants had a right to introduce any competent testimony which bore upon that point. We think the evidence offered by them, the rejection of which is complained of in the first and second assignments of error, did bear upon that point, and ought to have been received. Had the question been under the common counts alone, the ruling of the learned judge would have been correct; for when a case is made out by the admissions of the defendant, it is not competent for him to show other declarations at different times in contradiction of them. But, regarding it as a question of fraud in the plaintiff in obtaining Burkholder’s signature to the note in suit, everything which threw light upon the relation between the parties ought to have been admitted and gone to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[287,1939,1156,471]],["BL_235.1",235,[201,387,1165,777]]]'>Nor can it be said that this rejection did the defendants no injury, although the learned judge instructed the jury in the end that if there was no consideration for the note — no services rendered except those which had been settled and paid for — the plaintiff could not recover. The question of whether Burk-holder meant to give $3500 to Plank as a present or gratuity, was not submitted to the jury. Yet the refusal of this offer threw the defendants off their track. The learned judge instructed the jury in answer to a point presented by them — that if Burkholder estimated Plank’s services at $3500, and gave his note to Plank for that sum, which was his, Burkholder’s, estimate of the value of <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>the services rendered, and the note was executed with a full knowledge and consciousness of what he was doing, the plaintiff might recover the amount of the note, though more than the jury would estimate the service worth. This was undoubtedly correct. If Burkholder by his bond or sealed note could, as we have seen, give Plank $3500 for nothing, <em>d fortiori </em>he could give him that sum for one day’s service. The real question in the cause was as the learned judge properly stated it — Did Burkholder execute the note with a full knowledge and consciousness of what he was doing ? To enable the jury to weigh the credibility of the statement testified to by Mrs. Meixel of the circumstances attending the execution of the note, it was quite important that the jury should be able to form a sound opinion as to the true state of Burk-holder’s feelings towards Plank, and whether he would be likely to make either so large a gift, or so handsome a remuneration for his services. We are of the opinion, therefore, that there was error in the rejection of the evidence complained of in the first and second assignments.</p>
