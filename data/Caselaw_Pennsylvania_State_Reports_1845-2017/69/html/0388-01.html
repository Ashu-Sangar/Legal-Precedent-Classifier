Such declarations do not come within any of the recognised exceptions to the general rule, which rejects all hearsay reports of transactions, whether verbal or written, given by persons not produced as witnesses. The utmost extent to which the exceptions have gone, is the admission of the declarations of a deceased subscribing witness' to a deed or will: Harden <em>v. </em>Hays, 9 Barr 151; and the declarations, in a lucid interval, of a subscribing witness to a note, who was insane at the time of the trial (Neely <em>v. </em>Neely, 5 Harris 227), in disparagement of the evidence afforded by their signatures.

The defendants purchased and took possession of the goods in controversy on the 26th of February, and there is not a particle of evidence that the plaintiff knew that the defendants did not pay for the goods at the time of the purchase, if such was the fact, nor is there any evidence that they have paid anything on account of the price of the goods since the plaintiff had notice of their purchase. How then is she estopped, by her failure to notify the defendants of her claims, from asserting title to the goods ? If the defendants have not been prejudiced by her silence, why should they be allowed to set it up as a bar to her claim ? It is by no means clear that the plaintiff would be estopped from claiming the goods if the defendants had shown that they paid for them after she had notice of the sale. If there is a recovery by the plaintiff on the ground of ownership, the defendants may have recourse to The Howe Sewing Machine Company, on the implied warranty of title in the sale of the goods. And if so, what right have they to complain of the plaintiff’s silence? But however this may be, it is clear that the plaintiff is not estopped from asserting her claim, unless it is shown that she has done or omitted something to the prejudice of the defendants.</p>
