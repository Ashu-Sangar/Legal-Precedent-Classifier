Kern, for a lot of land on Race street, Philadelphia. Jean M. Soullier became the owner of the premises in 1809, and died in 1821. After his death F. A. Raybold, Esc]., as the agent for his heirs, who resided in France, leased the premises. Upon Mr. Raybold’s death W. E. Whitman, Esq., became the agent, and on the 26th of December leased to W. B. Wolfe and S. P. Willbank; these lessees put <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>Patrick Kereven into possession of the lot as their tenant. On the 13th of October 1860, the city of Philadelphia filed a claim in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for $10.44, for paving, against the lot, in the name of “ Patrick Curvan, owner, or reputed owner, or whoever may be owner.” On the 14th of February 1863, a <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the claim; to this writ the sheriff returned “ Made known by posting and publishing <em>see. leg.” </em>On the 30th of May judgment was entered for the city for want of an affidavit of defence for $12.32.

Soullier, and of his death, as above stated; that plaintiffs were his heirs at law; that Henri Edmund Soullier, one of them, had been born September 17th 1843; and rested.</p>

It is true that the judgment on which the sale was made was a judgment <em>in rem. </em>But it does not follow that if the sale did not divest the title of the minor, that it did not pass the title of his co-tenants who were <em>sui juris. </em>It would have divested the title of all the owners, whether adults or minors, if it were not for the proviso in the Act of April 16th 1840, § 10, Pamph. L. 413, which declares “ that no property owned by minors shall be sold under the provisions of this act, until the expiration of two years from the time the said minor shall come of age.” The argument that because the judgment is <em>in rem </em>nothing but the whole property bound by it could be sold, and as the minor’s interest therein could not be sold under the provisions of the act, therefore the interest of the adult owners could not be sold, is more specious than sound. If the proceeding is <em>in rem </em>it is wholly statutory and may be moulded and changed by the legislature at their will, and there is nothing in the provision, forbidding the sale of the property of a minor <em>“ </em>until the expiration of two years from the time he shall come of age,” which forbids, by implication, the sale of the undivided interest of an adult owner in the property bound by the lien. The object of the legislature in passing the act, was to protect the estates of minors, and to prevent their sacrifice at judicial sales — not to hinder and embarrass the city in the collection of its municipal claims against the property of adult owners. There is no more reason for exempting from sale during the minority of one of the co-tenants, the interest of an adult co-tenant, than there would be in exempting for the same period the property of such adult if he were the sole tenant or owner; nor would any injustice necessarily be done by allowing the sale of the adult owner’s interest-before any sale could be made of the minor’s interest under the provisions of the act. As the act forbids the sale of the minor’s interest, the court would doubtless, on the applica<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>tion of the adult co-tenant, enjoin the sale on the payment of his proportion of the lien or claim, leaving the residue a charge upon the minor’s interest and to be paid out of it. But whether so or not, there is nothing in the language of the proviso in question which countenances the doctrine contended for by the learned counsel of the plaintiffs, that there can be no sale of any interest in the property bound by the lien, so long as the sale of the minor’s interest is forbidden. The court below was therefore right in refusing to charge as requested in the plaintiffs’ first point.</p>
    <p id="b20-6" data-blocks='[["BL_20.4",20,[283,793,1163,430]]]'>Nor was there any error in declining to charge as requested in the plaintiffs’ second point. If the Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction of the claim on which the sale was made, as it unquestionably had, under the express provisions of the Paving Act, then the judgment, until reversed or set aside, is conclusive that the paving for which the claim was filed, was authorized by the city of Philadelphia; and the judgment, if irregular or erroneous, cannot be collaterally questioned or impeached. The court, therefore, rightly refused to submit to the jury the question whether the paving for which the claim was filed was authorized by the city.</p>
