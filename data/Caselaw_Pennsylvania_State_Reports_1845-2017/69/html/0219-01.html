On the 13th of April 1867, C. S. Gerber was appointed guardian, &amp;c., of Sarah, and Wendell Gross guardian, &amp;c., of William. The decedent having died seised of certain real estate, upon the petition of the widow and the guardians, the Orphans’ Court, on the 15th of June 1867, appointed commissioners to make partition. On the 23d of the same month the commissioners reported, that the land could not be parted without prejudice, &amp;c., and valued it at $3826. On the same day the heirs having refused to accept the land at the valuation, an order was issued to the administrator of the decedent to sell the same on the following conditions: One-third of the purchase-money to be paid on the’ 1st of April 1868, one-third on the 1st of April 1869, and the remaining third to be secured on the land for the use of the widow and to be paid at her death to the parties entitled. On the 2d of September 1867, the administrator returned that he had sold the land for $3998.61, and the sale was confirmed. On the 1st of April 1868, the purchaser paid all the purchase-money, except the widow’s share. On the 4th of April, the administrator filed his account showing in his hands a balance of $2023.44; about the same time he paid to Gerber as guardian of Sarah, $1011.72, being the whole amount of the purchase-money of the real estate due to her before the death of the widow. Afterwards on the 27th of August 1868, she married George Lefever, and died on the 8th of November 1868, a minor and without issue. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband, George Lefever. The guardian filed his account on the 9th of December 1868, showing in his hands a balance of $997.98, which was referred to D. J. Williams, Estp, as auditor for distribution.</p>

It is converted completely into personal property.”</p>
    <p id="b222-8" data-blocks='[["BL_222.8",222,[301,1167,1162,1113]]]'>The injustice of such a state of the law was strongly depicted by the revisers, and they reported what now forms the 48th section of the Act of the 29th March 1832, then a step in advance, but which would now be a retrograde one in the present condition of married women in relation to their personal property. This section provides, <em>“ </em>when, upon any proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, a sum of money shall be awarded by the court, for the share or portion to which a married woman may be entitled, such money shall not be paid to her husband, until he shall have given security to the satisfaction of the court, that the amount thereof, or so much thereof as the court shall deem proper, be paid after his death to his wife, or if she shall not survive him, to her heirs, as if the same were real estate.” The remaining portion of this section is not material for our present purpose. At that day, the object was to prevent its becoming the property of the husband 'entirely, by making the payment to him conditional, giving him only the same interest as if it had remained real estate. It is a question whether the Married Woman’s Act, and all our present legislation, have not virtually abrogated this provision. To-day the money would not be the property of the husband and to be paid to him, but the property of the wife and to be paid to her. If this entire change of policy has not affected this section it should be repealed by the legislature, as inconsistent with our present rules as to the property of married women. Be this as it may, it is clear the provision should not be carried beyond its express letter.</p>

The money now in dispute was in the hands of C. S. Gerber, guardian of Sarah Kann, in April 1868, and of course in her hands really as money and not real estate. If she had been of age it would have been paid directly to her. Several months afterwards, on the 27th August 1868, she was married to George Lefever, and this personal property continued to be her property as fully after her marriage as before, and upon her death without issue on the 8th November 1868 her husband became entitled to it absolutely.</p>

The 19th section of the Act of 24th February 1834;, was originally reported by the revisers as the 20th section of their bill relating to executors, administrators, &amp;e., and was passed with a modification. “ The 20th section,” say the revisers, “is new to our jurisprudence, and we are not aware that a similar provision exists in any other code, although inconvenience, have been experienced from the present situation of the law, which seem to require some legislative interposition.</p>
    <p id="b223-7" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[178,1555,1158,774]]]'>“ It is a rule in equity which has been recognised and adopted in this state (see Grant <em>v. </em>Hook, 13 S. &amp; R. 269), that the purchaser of real estate from an executor or other trustee, is bound under certain circumstances to look to the application of the purchase-money ; consequently a vendee who has paid the money to such trustee, may, unless he has attended to this rule, be compelled to pay the money a second time to the parties interested in the trust. The result is often injurious to all parties, since the risk of liability for the improper application of the money tends to lessen the number of purchasers, and to reduce the value of the property. Yet we think it would not be safe to abolish the rule altogether, as it might endanger the security of infants and other beneficiaries, and we have suggested the payment of the money into the Orphans’ Court, as a means of relief to the purchaser, while it sufficiently provides for the safety of the fund, and its due application according to the directions of the court, who will have the power to require the necessary security from the executor or administrator before authorizing him to receive the money.”</p>
