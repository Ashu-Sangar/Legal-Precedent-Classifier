Booser, for plaintiff, testified: “In 1867 and. 1868 I was a school director. School-house No. 4 was under my particular care. Jesse Laverty taught in the winter of 1867. Promised him; knew him ten years; he has been teaching all that time. There was no objection at that time. It was left to me by the board to nominate for that house. No complaint was brought to me while he was teaching for 1867. Joseph Yanarsdale’s son handed the request to me at Banks’ store. I opened the paper, looked at it, and put it in my pocket. Mr. Banks and myself went to the school-house where the examination of teachers was. After the examination had been in session awhile, William Sadler asked me if I had an applicant for my school-house, No. 4. I told him that Eshleman and Laverty had made application. Sadler said, ‘Booser, you can’t give it.’ Banks, William Sadler, Swartz, Jacob Bashore, and myself were the members of the Board present. * * * I had control of school No. 4 as far as the nomination of a teacher was concerned. I appointed Laverty in 1867. There was no action taken on his partin 1868. After presenting the paper and hearing the expression on it, I put it in my pocket, and made no nomination; I made no nomination for the school that day. Simon Shumbarger got the school. * * * I think Laverty received forty dollars a month. The county superintendent was present to examine teachers. The day was August 8th 1868. * * * Simon Pratz didn’t live in No. 4 district at the time. Had a few words in the latter end of May or beginning of June 1868, with Simon Pratz concerning Laverty. He said he didn’t hope I would give that school, No. 4, to Laverty again. He said he had met Laverty on the road, and they had an altercation ; Pratz said Laverty wasn’t fit to teach, or something to that effect. Something about the talk in this altercation on the road, was why he wasn’t fit to teach. He told me they disputed something about the passing, that Laverty didn’t give him the road. None of the signers of the paper came to the meeting of the school board on August 8th. Pratz said that he and Laverty had fell out, and L. wasn’t fit to teach. * * * I told Laverty to be down at Eairview at the school-house where the examination was to be held; he told me he would if he could. * * * <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>No certificate from the proper quarter was laid before the board, in reference to Laverty, that day.

I shook my head at it, and told him I thought not. He says, 4 John, one good favor deserves another.’ He said then, 4 if you knew how Laverty used your boy, you would sign this paper.’ I told him the boy stopped off going to school, and the reason we never asked him. He told me that Laverty abused my boy severely, and caught him by the hair of the head and threw him down on the floor. I said then, if Laverty used my boy that way, he should put my name down too.

    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[174,475,1167,1411]]]'>A careful examination of the charge and answers discovers no error. The instruction to the jury appears to be clear, consistent, and correct. The paper signed by the defendants was a request to the school directors not to employ the plaintiff, under any circumstances, as a teacher in school No. 4 for the coming term. It preferred no charges and gave no reasons, and was a simple expression only of the wishes of the signers. It was the right of these citizens of the district thus to declare their desire. They had a right to express a preference or to declare their objection to any one applying for appointment. They were deeply interested, and had therefore a-right to speak out. But we cannot recognise the position to which the argument of the plaintiffs in error leads, that such a right of expression can be made a channel through which men may'gratify their malice and enmity. This would be the actual result of the argument that the right of petition is so sacred that the private purposes and motives of the actors cannot be inquired into. If they cannot, and if the real purpose of the .petition be the gratification of ill-will and malice without cause, then men may be borne down by the power of their enemies, especially in numbers and by combination, and their efforts in life to earn bread, and support those dependent on them, may be frustrated merely for the gratification of base and malevolent feelings. The inference drawn by the judge from the awarding of a <em>venire facias de novo </em>by this court on the former writ of error, is not erroneous. The request or petition to the directors was the only ground of the action, and a <em>venire de novo </em>would not have been awarded had this court thought that the right of petition was so sacred no inquiry could be had into the motives and purposes of the defendants. A groundless petition instigated only by malice cannot surely be the right of any citizen where it actually results in harm to the object of its malicious purpose. The third, fourth and fifth assignments of error are therefore not sustained.</p>

Had that been the ground of his rejection, he could not recover. But the testimony of Booser, one of the directors, on that point required the case to be submitted to the jury. School No. 4 was under his particular charge, and it was' left to him to nominate the teacher for it. The plaintiff had been appointed for 1867 on his nomination, and had taught without complaint. Booser promised- the school to him again. He gave his application to Booser to be presented to the board; but after it had been presented and after hearing the discussion of the board upon it, Booser put the paper in his pocket and made no <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>nomination. No objection was made on the score of the certificate. It is evident that it was the objection to the plaintiff himself, and not to his want of a certificate, which prevented his employment. Had he been appointed he might have renewed his certificate and qualified himself to accept of the appointment. We see no error, therefore, in refusing a point requiring the court to charge that no damage arose from the remonstrance by reason of the plaintiff’s not getting the school. Nor do we think it was error to refuse to charge that the plaintiff could not recover because he afterwards got a school at Marysville, at a higher salary. This went in mitigation of damages, but was no bar to recovery. The wrong was complete when the plaintiff lost his place by the malice of the defendants, and it is no small injury to be compelled to change one’s residence, break up his plans for the year, seek employment elsewhere, and remove to a different district to reside among strangers. The other assignments of error need no notice but to say we perceive no error to be corrected.</p>
