The mortgage to be sold and the proceeds applied to the_ payment in full of the Wells judgment, and a balance of the purchase-money on the property due McGonigle’s heirs; fifty per cent, in full of the claims of the creditors that agreed to accept, and the balance to Selden for his services. Kramer &amp; Rahm, with whom negotiations had been entered into to buy the mortgage, declined purchasing it, and Cyrus Black then proposed, if the creditor’s would take the mortgage as payment, in the same proportion, in full of their claims, he would have it assigned to them. The proposition was accepted, and Marcus Black, mortgagee, at the instance of Cyrus Black, on the 8th August 1853 assigned the mortgage to George S. Selden in trust for said creditors. Selden failed to sell it, and brought suit in trust for creditors, obtained judgment, and on the 24th July 1854 had the property sold on a levari facias, and purchased it for $7000 at the sheriffs sale for the benefit of creditors, and a sheriff’s deed was executed and delivered to him.

Kramer &amp; Rahm’s interest in it consisted of the moneys lent Selden to pay off the two preferences. In March 1855 Selden leased the property to James Mills for one year, and afterwards tried to sell it, and Mills’s offer of $10,500, $500 cash and $1000 per year, he declined, because he required a cash payment sufficient to pay Kramer &amp; Rahm the money they had advanced and interest. In 1857, Kramer &amp; Rahm notified him they must have their money, and in the spring of that year Selden, with the consent of creditors, offered the property for sale at public auction, and M. B. Thompson, the defendant in <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>error, was present, but the bidding was not satisfactory, and it was again advertised for sale by order of trustee (Selden), on Tuesday evening, May 19th, at public auction, in pursuance of adjournment. M. B. Thompson bid $4000, and wanted Selden to let him have it at that price, but Selden refused, and informed him that he could not let the property be sacrificed at that, and that he could not, in justice to the creditors, let it be knocked down for less than $7000, unless some arrangement could be made by which he, Selden, could have the privilege of paying him his money with interest within a year, and receive a conveyance of the property. With that understanding the property was knocked down to Thompson for $4000.</p>

The sum of $4897, mentioned in the agreement to be paid in one year, with interest, was made up of cash advanced to pay Kramer &amp; Rahm with 10 per cent, interest'for one year, and of Thompson’s claim in full, and the three notes amounting to $559.88, which were never paid by Thompson.</p>

I was not living here, and could not attend to it myself, and was therefore desirous of transferring the trust to other hands.” Being cross-examined, he said: “ It was my understanding and agreement with McClurkan to substitute him in my stead, in that property <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>in the Diamond, of which the paper of May 28th is the evidence;” and being recalled, he said: “The paper of May 28th 1857, I regarded as the evidence of my title as trustee of that property.” McClurkan was the owner of Pennock Mitchell &amp; Co.’s claim.</p>

The deed and defeasance make in fact but one instrument, and the general rule undoubtedly is that it is a mortgage. “Whenever there is' in fact an advance of money to be returned within a specified time, upon the security of an absolute conveyance, the law converts it into a mortgage, whatever may be the form adopted, or whatever may be the understanding of the parties.
