Lane, assignee of George Heckert.’ On the 13th of April 1855, he made a further deposit to the same account of $28,233.48, thus making the entire amount of the deposit to the credit of the trust, $48,121.70, which, beside the amount due to the assignor, included a sum of $2886.80, that was payable either to creditors or to the assignee. Upon this deposit checks were drawn by Mr. Lane upon written orders of Mr. Heckert, * * * amounting to $2957.68, leaving due him a balance of $42,277.32. * * * The Lancaster Bank, at the time that this deposit was made, was, and up to the day its doors were closed, continued to he in good credit, and to do a very large business. Mr. Lane deposited with it in various capacities, and at the time of its failure the firm of James B. &amp; G. Taylor Lane, of which he was the leading member, had a balance in their favor of $1110.68. At the time of the final decree Heckert was living in Northumberland county. His counsel was the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens. William B. Eordney, who was counsel for Mr. Lane, * * * shortly after the decree called upon Mr. Stevens, and requested him to come and draw the money as Heckert’s counsel. He declined, stating that he would write to him to come on and draw it himself. Mr. Heckert was in Lancaster on the 29th of October 1855, on which day a release was prepared by William Carpenter, Esq., for him to sign on receiving his money. Mr. Heckert was in Lancaster also on the 27th of November 1855, and on the 2d of January 1856, but no further step toward the transfer to him of this deposit appears to have been taken, either on the part of Mr. Lane or himself, and there is no evidence that he at any time demanded such a transfer from Mr. Lane. One witness testifies that about this time Heckert told him that he had not received the balance coming to him out of the estate, and would not take it or touch it. On the 15th and 28th of December 1855, checks were drawn by Mr. Lane on this deposit, on written orders of Mr. Heckert in favor of attorneys for creditors of Heckert. Subsequently to this no part of the deposit appears to have been drawn out by Mr. Lane or any one else, and the balance remained standing on the hooks of the bank to the credit of James B. Lane as assignee of George Heckert at the time of the failure of the hank, which occurred in the month of November 1856. At some time during the fall of 1855 or winter of 1855 and 1856, Mr. Heckert entered into an arrangement with the president of the Lancaster Bank, as to which the president, <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>B. C. Bachman, testifies as follows: 41 was notified by Mr. James B. Lane that Heckert was in Lancaster and would want his money, and that he had already prepared checks for him to draw the amount standing to his credit as assignee, on the following morning. The bank being seriously embarrassed at that time, I was anxious to retain the deposit for its benefit; I deemed it important to call upon Mr. Heckert in reference thereto. I found him, and ascertaining that that was his business, I requested him to come to the bank, as I desired to see him privately. He called in the evening as per agreement. When there, after some conversation, Mr. Longenecker being present, an arrangement was entered into with the said Heckert that he should receive a certain sum of money as interest on the deposit then standing to the credit of James B. Lane, assignee of George Heckert, and that he should receive interest on said deposit so long as it remained in the Lancaster Bank to the credit of James B. Lane, assignee. In pursuance of this arrangement the said Heckert was paid by me different sums of money at various times. I cannot recollect the amounts. The last sum having been paid to him by me a few days or a short time before the failure of the bank.’ This statement is corroborated by the testimony of David Longenecker and other officers of the bank, as well as by its books, and may therefore be taken as absolutely correct.” * * *</p>

Finally, and in addition to his positive acts indicative of acquiescence in the continuance of the deposit in the Lancaster Bank in the name of his assignee, there is no evidence that on that particular point he in any reasonable time expressed his dissatisfaction with the conduct of his assignee. He has, on' the contrary, as far as appears from the testimony, on this subject preserved a profound silence, which has been broken, now only, after the lapse of fourteen years, when the bank has long since been ascertained to be wholly insolvent, and his assignee and his counsel have both died, and the estate of the former been entirely settled and the balance of it distributed among his heirs. In fine the conclusion of the auditor is, that the plaintiff by his long-contin'ued silence, as well as by positive acts of acquiescence, is now estopped from questioning the propriety of his agent’s conduct in permitting the balance of the estate to remain on deposit in the Lancaster Bank subsequently to the decree of the Supreme Court.</p>

      <em>“ </em>In the opinion of the auditor, then, Mr. Lane was not bound to seek out Mr. Heckert as soon as the decree of the Supreme Court was announced, and tender to him the balance which by that decree was ascertained to be due to him, but was justified in waiting to receive his directions as to its disposal. While waiting for such directions, which might be expected at any time subsequently to the decree, his natural and proper course would be to leave the money in the bank on deposit. The Lancaster Bank, in which the money was deposited, was at that time in good credit, and so continued up to the time its doors were closed. Mr. Lane himself deposited with it, and the firm, of which he was a member, lost by its failure some $1100, which was the amount of the bal<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>anee in their favor on the hooks of the hank at that time.

    <p class="summary" id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[197,575,1159,763]]]'>“ Finally; in the general management of the business of the trust, and also in his conduct with reference to the balance payable to Mr. Heekert, Mr. Lane appears to have acted in absolute good faith, and carefully, skilfully, diligently, and with results most advantageous to the interests of his cestui que trust. That those results were not fully realized and enjoyed by Mr. Heekert, seems to be attributable entirely to himself. The evidence shows that Mr. Lane was ready to pay over his money to him when it became due, and that he actually proposed to pay it to his counsel. And there is no evidence that Mr. Heekert, though in Lancaster repeatedly during the three or four months immediately subsequent to the time of the final decree of the Supreme Court, ever demanded his money from Mr. Lane, or gave him any instructions as to its disposal. In the opinion of the auditor, therefore, there was on the part of Mr. Lane no such failure in the performance of his duty as assignee of George Heekert, as would sufiice to make him responsible for the loss of the fund of the trust on deposit in the Lancaster Bank.”</p>

If Heckert, knowing that Lane as his assignee had deposited in the bank a sum equal to the whole trust funds remaining in his hands, and which he had offered and was ready to transfer, agreed with the bank that he would not demand the money of the assignee but that it might remain in the bank for its use on the payment of interest thereon to him, it is clear that whether he made the arrangement known to the assignee ‘ or not’ he assumed such dominion and control over the fund, as in equity would discharge the assignee from all responsibility for the loss arising from the failure of the bank. He could not by a secret contract agree that the bank should retain and use the deposit on paying him interest thereon, and yet hold the assignee responsible for the solvency of the bank and its safe keeping of the fund. The auditor found in substance that Heckert did make such an arrangement with the bank after the assignee had offered to transfer to him the money, and that he received the fruits of it down to the time of its failure; and he rightly held that he was chargeable with the loss. The appeal must therefore be dismissed and the decree of the court below affirmed.</p>
