The first question presented to the court relates to the validity and binding effect of this writing. It is certainly void at law, and cannot be sustained as a legal instrument against a feme covert. She cannot bind herself in law by any such method. She had no one with whom to contract: not with her husband, for they are, legally speaking, one person; besides she is presumed to be under his control and coercion. She would have no protection whatever if an instrument of this kind could be enforced against her. She could always be controlled by love or fear, overawed by threats, or cajoled by promises. She certainly did not contract with the legatees; they were not parties. The will was not binding on the husband; he could change it the next day: why then should she alone be bound, and her husband loose ? If she could thus release her interest in his goods she could in his lands, aud thereby the safeguard of a separate examination by a competent and disinterested officer be dispensed with and set at nought. Is this arrangement binding in equity? Would it be enforced by a chancellor ? We answer no, unless it could be shown that it was made by the feme covert with full knowledge of all the facts — the value of the property she was receiving, and the interests she was giving up. Besides, if there was any inequality equity would not bind her. Being under legal disability, the bargain must be clearly for her benefit — at least not to her disadvantage, or chancery would leave the other parties in interest to their remedy at law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b198-6" data-blocks='[["BL_198.4",198,[313,1775,1155,675]],["BL_199.1",199,[225,414,1155,463]]]'>“ The inequality in the bequests is not very glaring, yet there are some features in those to the wife which render them unequal. She is given an, estate in both the land and goods during widowhood only, has not even an untrammelled life estate. She is by law entitled to the absolute ownership in one-third of the personal property, after deducting three hundred dollars for her own use, which the devisees claim she has waived by her agreement, and also to the use of one-third of the real estate during life, whether she marries again or not. It is said that the land will rent for $150 a year, and the effects appraised for the widow under the will amount to $483, whilst the other part of the personalty as shown by the settlement is $4255.46. It is also in proof that the land would not support this woman and her child, either by her occupancy and cultivation, or renting it out. The Act of Assembly gives the widow a clear right of choice whether to take under the will or claim her distributive share. The effort <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>here is to restrict her by the writing on the will, signed during coverture. Equity would leave her to the choice conferred by law, and the rights given up are the most desirable. It is said, however, that she obtains an advantage to her child by this arrangement of the will. We cannot look to that in adjusting her equities. Chancery will not oblige her to sacrifice her interest to promote that of her child. The land cannot come into possession until after her death or marriage, and in the meantime if she declines to accept the testamentary provisions, the heirs and herself will hold it together, she taking one-third, they two-thirds of the rent.</p>

We are aware that equity lends its aid to carry out and enforce such arrangements when entered into for the peace of families where contests have arisen or are likely to arise; but we look upon this as an ordinary contract between husband and wife,' in which the one party, who is presumed to be under coercion, agrees to bind herself, whilst the other remains free — can revoke the will at pleasure. There is no equality, and consequently no equity in such a postnuptial settlement, which after all is nothing more or less than a bargain between husband and wife. Our books of reports present many cases of obligations given to the wife by the husband being enforced against his representatives after his «death, and also of loans of money by her to-him, but we are not aware of any case where the wife’s agreement to pay money to the husband, or borrow it from him, has been enforced in Pennsylvania, either in the lifetime, or after the death of the parties, or either of them. The doctrine of estoppel is invoked in the present case, and it is shown that both infants and feme coverts may be estopped by their acts, or silence when it was their duty to speak. Lord Coke says estoppels are odious in law, because they stop the mouth from speaking the truth. But we know that they are often used and sustained in equity — as where a feme covert knows that the property in which she is interested is under sale and encourages an innocent person to buy it, or stands by whilst it is being improved <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>or sold, and gives no notice of her claim. But to constitute such estoppel, there must be wilful silence, or misrepresentations by one having knowledge of the fact. The other party must not have the means of information, and be induced by the acts or omissions to do what he otherwise could not have done; and an injury must ensue from giving the party permission to speak the truth. It must be such an act as operates as a fraud on the purchaser, and that cannot be the case where he. was acquainted with all the facts: See 10 Barr 531-2; 17 S. &amp; R. 383. There must be an injury of which some one can properly complain. If none arises from the act or omission, there can be no estoppel: <a href="/mass/15/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 Mass. 152" data-case-ids="2055391" data-case-paths="/mass/15/0140-01">15 Mass. 152</a>; <a href="/mass/23/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Pick. 455" data-case-ids="2011516" data-case-paths="/mass/23/0456-01">6 Pick. 455</a>; <a href="/wend/8/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wend. 480" data-case-ids="2147334" data-case-paths="/wend/8/0480-01">8 Wend. 480</a>; <a href="/watts-serg/5/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 284" data-case-ids="478533" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0284-01">5 W. &amp; S. 284</a>. Nothing is shown here to have been done or omitted by Jacob Kreiser in consequence of his wife signing the paper. It has been suggested that <em>possibly </em>he might otherwise have given the bonds referred to in the account to the other children during his lifetime, and have thus cut his wife out; but there is no evidence that he so threatened or attempted, and if he had it would have been an endeavor to "deprive her of her distributive share without consideration. We have no right to infer that the husband intended to deprive the wife of that secured to her by the law of the land by giving away his property. Did Elizabeth Kreiser ratify her release as endorsed on the will since her husband’s death ? The evidence shows that the will was read the evening after the funeral, and the widow then made no objection to its provisions. A few days after an appraisement of the personal effects intended for her was made, and the articles left with her on the premises where she was living. Eight days after that time she gave notice in writing that she would not accept under the will, but claimed her dower and distributive share under the law. So careful have been the statutes of this state of the widow’s rights that she cannot be called on to elect between a devise or a bequest and her dower or distributive share until after the expiration of one year from the death of the testator, when she may, by the 35th section of the Act of 1832, be cited to come into the Orphans’ Court and make an election. This gives her ample time to make herself acquainted with the situation of the estate. She may even compel an exhibition of the account to enable her to choose intelligently. The general rule is that the party is not bound to make an election until all the circumstances are known, and the state, condition and value of the funds are clearly ascertained; for until that is known it is impossible to make a discriminating and deliberate choice, such as ought to be binding in reasoir and justice: Story Eq. Jur. § 1098. To bind the widow she must have full knowledge of the facts: 1 Yes. Jr. 335; Id. 171, 172. As a general rule a receipt for part of a legacy will not bar dower without a full know<a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>ledge of the situation of the estate : 1 Swanston 381. Our own books are to the same effect. The election must be evidenced by plain and unequivocal acts, with full knowledge of the situation of the estate: <a href="/yeates/2/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Yeates 302" data-case-ids="812737" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0302-01">2 Yeates 302</a> ;|5 Harris 454. In Anderson’s Appeal, 12 Oasey 476, the testator died June 1st 1858. An inventory and appraisement was filed on the 21st of August following, the account was settled on the 17th of March 1859. On the 19th of January 1859, a notice of non-acceptance was served on the executor. On the 6th of October 1858, the widow receipted for over $2100 on account of her legacies, on the 23d of the same month she gave another receipt for $100. She also joined in leasing some of the devised lands, yet all of these acts were decided not to be binding, because the full situation of the estate was unknown to her. She was a woman of intelligence and business capacity; the acts of confirmation were numerous and pretty decided. There was ample time for examination. In this case we have an ignorant woman who cannot write her own name. She did nothing decided, merely handed the executor the bonds, and afterwards permitted' them to appraise the property and leave it on the premises. Within eight days thereafter, and long before the situation of the estate was known, she gave notice that she would not acquiesce in the provisions of the will, but claim under the intestate laws. The principles of Anderson’s Appeal are reiterated and approved in 11 P. F. Smith 405. The acceptance of a legacy and agreement to stand by a will when done in mistake of her rights were held not to be binding in 1 Oasey 468. It is true this court decided in Light <em>v. </em>Light, reported in 9 Harris 407, affirming the judgment that an election might be made <em>in pais, </em>need not be in the method prescribed in the statute, but would be binding when the widow acted with full knowledge of the facts. But that case differed from this. The widow there gave a receipt for the personal effects, as taken under the will, with a declaration in the paper: <em>‘ </em>I hereby accept under the said will.’ Prior to that she had been informed of her rights —told she had a right to renounce, and that she could probably get more, but was advised to accept. That case was on the very verge of the law, was barely sustained in the action of dower, and possibly might have been decided otherwise had Anderson’s Appeal been in existence as a governing example. The case of Light <em>v. </em>Light has never been overruled, and may still be considered sound, but is on the outside boundary. The widow in the present case was extremely illiterate, conferred with no one, received no advice, and did no act so decidedly confirmatory of the will as in that case. Although the auditor has found that the will is binding on the widow, yet. we cannot help thinking that it was not so much from her subsequent acts of confirmation, as on the endorsement on the will during coverture, which we look upon as <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>utterly void, and of no effect in law. We also consider that the verdict of a jury should he set aside by the court if the facts relied on as evidence of an election had been proved as here, and none other; -and they had been found to be binding. We therefore feel ourselves constrained to set aside the report of the auditor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b202-6" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[303,665,1161,727]]]'>“It might look like a verbal criticism, and not carrying out the intention of the writing, were we to decide that there is nothing in the endorsement on this will which would preclude the widow from claiming her distributive share out of the notes and bonds belonging to the estate of the decedent. She only relinquishes her <em>dower at common law, </em>unless we give more weight to the ‘&amp;c.,’ than is even given by Lord Coke. Dower at common law issued out of land alone. The distributive share of personal effects was conferred by a Pennsylvania statute of comparatively recent date. Before the Act of 1848 the husband could by his will deprive his wife of all interest in his personalty and she had no claim thereon. We prefer, however, deciding this case on the broader principles as already indicated. The report must be set aside, and the account referred back to the same auditor to make distribution according to the principles contained in this opinion, unless new evidence of acts of confirmation by the widow are introduced, so as materially to change the aspect of the case.”</p>
