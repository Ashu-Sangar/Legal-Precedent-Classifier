Christian Lintner, under legal pressure, paid these debts for which he and Henry Hess were bound, and took transfers thereof from the creditors. The auditor gave a dividend only on one-half the amount paid, which the court reversed and gave a dividend orí the whole amount.

The consequence was that each was liable <em>singuli in solidum ; </em>and that there was not in law any obligation or ground of action to the several cautioners against each other, but on any one of them paying the debt it was extinguished, and all the rest of the cautioners discharged. Two remedies in equity were afterwards introduced: the <em>Benefioium JDivisionis, </em>by which any one might insist on the others being called on to pay their share; and the <em>Benefioium Gedendarum Actionum, </em>by which anyone cautioner on paying the debt, was entitled to require the creditor to assign his right to him: Shaw’s Edition of Bell’s Principles of the Law of Scotland, p. 97, § 268; Oumius’ Manual of Civil Law, p. 204-5.</p>
