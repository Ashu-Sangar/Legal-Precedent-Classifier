The affidavit of defence averred that the transactions were with C. and not with the plaintiffs, and that C. had been paid, except a sum admitted. By agreement, the affidavit of defence was withdrawn, all transactions between plaintiffs and O. and defendant to be “ considered in the action,” and defendant to file another affidavit of defence, with the items of his set-off. The affidavit admitted the <em>“ </em>dealings and business transactions” in plaintiffs’ claim and set out defendant’s claim; but did not deny the charges of interest.

Independent of the 5th rule, this evidence was clearly pertinent, and should have been admitted. It will be recollected that the plaintiffs’ affidavits and bill of particulars were on file and before counsel when the agreement was framed, and that the affidavit of defence was only required as to disputed item in defendant’s account rendered, and not one step beyond; and it is agreed “ that all claims, <em>defences </em>and business transactions” between all these parties “ are to be <em>considered, </em>respected and <em>admitted, </em>as one and identical, touching the matters in this action for which suit is brought.” If there is any meaning in this language, it is certainly intended to dispense with the 5th rule and all technicalities, and to allow <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>all defences to be made which are legal or equitable.
