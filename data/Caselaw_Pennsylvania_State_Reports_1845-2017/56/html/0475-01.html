By the death of Samuel in 1840 without issue this estate became vested in his three surviving brothers upon the same conditions.

James Swisshelm accordingly called on George S.

At the sale on the 28th December 1857, Mr. Swisshelm became the purchaser for $580, the exact sum which would cover the four judgments. Mr. Mellon did not attend this last sale, nor was he present at the intended sale on his own judgment, which was stayed by his order.</p>

Is it not clear that at the solicitation and request of James Swisshelm, Mr. Mellon became the purchaser of the Kramer &amp; Rahm judgments because they were prior in date to the conveyance ? ■ Of this there can be no doubt, and that the proceedings on those judgments were carried on at the instance and request of James Swisshelm, to enable him to become the purchaser at sheriff’s sale. The 6th paragraph of the answer of the defendant, James Swisshelm, is therefore distinctly disproved, for he did purchase the estate and interest of William Swisshelm at the sheriff’s sale, with a knowledge of the title of the plaintiff, and for the purpose of defeating the same, as has been shown by his whole conduct, including his defence to the present suit.</p>

Mr. Shinn attended the sale, which was postponed, and found that the judgment on which the execution was issued, was subsequent to the deed, and concluded he would pay no more attention to it as' it could not affect her interest. The sale under the Kramer &amp; Rahm judgment he did not hear of until after the sheriff’s deed was executed. His opinion was that Mr. Swisshelm held it in trust for his wife.</p>

The husband, without notice to the wife and under the cover of another’s name, virtually possesses himself of the control and practical, ownership of three judgments of small amount, sells out his wife’s property, and for the pitiful sum of $580 becomes the owner of a very valuable interest in an improving tract of land.

In a subsequent clause he says: “And if one or more of my sons, James, Samuel, William or Henry, should die before they are entitled to receive their shares, and not leave lawful issue, the share or shares of the ones so dying shall be equally divided among the survivor or survivors of those four last-mentioned sons.”</p>

This happened in the case of Samuel, who died in his mother’s lifetime, without leaving lawful issue. (See In re Smith’s Trusts, V. <em>C. </em>Wood, Weekly Notes, No. 9, p. 78, March 2d 1867.)

Upon prior judgments William’s interest was sold by regular process of law, on the 28th December 1857, to James Swisshelm, the husband of Jane G. Swisshelm. The appellant claims that the purchase of William’s interest by Jane was with the knowledge and consent of her husband, and that the husband’s subsequent purchase at sheriff’s sale was for the benefit of her title. It is true they have since been divorced, but this she disputes, and insists her title is still subsisting.</p>
