The court thought not, and so decidedly think we. The defendant could not be.compelled to take a partly filled barge when he had contracted for full ones, any more than if he had contracted for a barrel of oil could he have been compelled to accept one half of quarter full. This would hardly be contended for, yet the principle is the same: Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Leonard, 12 Harris 14; Story on Sales, §§ 296, 299. Under the finding of the jury there is little room for argument against the ruling complained of. Nor do we see any error in rejecting the offers of testimony.
