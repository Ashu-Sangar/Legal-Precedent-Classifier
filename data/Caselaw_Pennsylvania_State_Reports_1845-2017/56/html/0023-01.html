If they were, the borough was responsible for the bounties paid or agreed to be paid, and was entitled to have the men credited on its quota. Then the transfer of the men to the township of Girard was a wrong done to the borough, for which it may obtain redress in this action. But if the defendants were not the authorized agents of the borough, and yet undertook to act as such agents, the borough was not bound by their acts, and certainly was under no obligation to refund the $2100 which they paid as bounties or their other expenses. It is true that when one without authority undertakes to act for another, that other may afterwards ratify the act, and thereby avail himself of its benefits, assuming at the same time its attendant burdens. Prior to such ratification, however, the agent is at liberty to retrace his steps. He is not obliged to wait an indefinite time to see whether the person for whom he has acted without authority will adopt his act. Clearly is this so when in acting he has made expenditures or assumed personal obligations. Such being the law, if the defendants were not authorized by the borough to enlist men and have them placed to the credit of the borough, if they could not therefore have recovered from the borough the money paid by them and the necessary expenses to which they had been subjected in procuring the men, they had a right to protect themselves and obtain reimbursement of their expenditure by causing the men to be credited to the township at any time before the borough ratified their agency, unless, perhaps, the credit to the borough had been actually consummated.</p>

It was not for the court to answer it or give to the jury instructions how it should be answered. And we are not without our suspicions that the court intended to submit it to the jury.

Other parts of the charge may well have produced the same impression upon the minds of the jury. The learned judge declared there was no conflict of evidence on the point whether the borough had undertaken to supply the quota for that draft, and whether the burgess and councilmen had agreed each to do all they could for that pur pose. He added : “ If so (that is if there was no conflict of evi dence), did the defendants, in pursuance'of that resolution, and by virtue of their official relation to the borough, engage these seven men to enlist for it, or to its credit, and had them put in and credited accordingly ? If so, it was all right and proper, exhibiting a commendable fidelity to the interests of their constituents.
