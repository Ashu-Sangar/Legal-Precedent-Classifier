The language of the deed, unexplained, appeared to be a conveyance of the whole of Martin’s share, although it was certain Stamm got his 200 acres, leaving the Martins in possession of 72 acres, within the line run off and settled in 1806, and after the commencement of this suit, Stamm’s representatives released and conveyed the same to Martin’s heirs. Between them there was no mistake, for both recognised the fact that the 72 acres were never conveyed, nor intended to be conveyed, by the deed of the 19th March 1836.</p>
    <p id="b314-7" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[257,1038,1164,203]]]'>On the trial, the plaintiff produced this deed to show that the whole of Martin’s title and land had been conveyed to Stamm, and to introduce another deed from the executors of Benjamin Chew to Stamm, executed twenty-eight days after Stamm’s release to Mai'tin’s heirs.</p>
    <p id="b314-8" data-blocks='[["BL_314.6",314,[255,1251,1166,383]]]'>The question, therefore, became a material one, Were the 72 acres included in the deed from Martin’s heirs to Stamm ? and parol evidence was offered to prove what took place at the execution of it, showing the real intention of the parties, and that by a clear mistake of the scrivener at the very least, he entirely omitted so to describe the premises as to leave the 72 acres unconveyed and the property of Martin’s heirs, which mistake was afterwards corrected by Stamm’s representatives. The court properly admitted the evidence, which was clear and distinct.</p>
    <p id="b314-9" data-blocks='[["BL_314.7",314,[252,1635,1164,428]]]'>In Chalfant <em>v. </em>Williams, 11 Casey 215, the late Chief Justice said: <em>“ </em>If we had held to the rule that is laid down in Starkie’s Evidence, part 4, p. 1009, that parol evidence is inadmissible for the purpose of altering the legal operation of an instrument, we should be obliged to reverse the ruling in this case. But we have got far away from that rule. -We permit a deed absolute on its face to be proved a mortgage ; we receive parol evidence to rebut a presumption or an equity — to supply deficiencies in the written agreement — to explain ambiguities in the subject-matter of writings — to prevent frauds and correct mistakes.”</p>
    <p id="b314-10" data-blocks='[["BL_314.8",314,[253,2064,1161,86]]]'>The court wore right in admitting the evidence, and in their answer to the plaintiffs’ points.</p>
    <p id="b314-11" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[1033,2149,336,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
