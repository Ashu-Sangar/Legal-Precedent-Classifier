The inquest returned that the land could not be divided, and valued it at $980. A rule on the heirs to accept or refuse was served on all the parties. On the 27th of August 1866, Charles McLaughlin refused to accept, and Sarah McLaughlin bid $10 above the appraisement.

The 46th section prescribes the like proceedings on the application of the persons in whom the estate vests in possession where the decedent leaves no lineal descendants. In either case, if there be a widow, she becomes a party and may make the application to the Orphans’ Court to make partition.</p>

The widow is clearly embraced by the terms of the law. The revisers, in consolidating the provisions of'the former acts, threw all that related to the descent and distribution of the estates of intestates into a separate bill, which became a law on the 8th of April 1833. The revisers say in their report: “The 1st section, which is divided into three articles or paragraphs, is intended to provide for the widow' and surviving husband, as the case- may be, of an intestate, and is derived from the 3d and 4th sections of the Act of 1794, and from the 5th section of the Act of 1797, there being no other substantial alteration than in the last clause, which gives to the surviving husband an estate for life in the real property of the wife, although there should be no issue of the marriage.” The 2d article of the 1st section provides, “ where such intestate shall leave a widow and collateral heirs or other kindred, but ño issue, the widow shall be entitled to one-half part of the real estate, including the mansion-house and buildings appurtenant thereto, for the term of her life, and to one-half part of the personal estate absolutely.”</p>
