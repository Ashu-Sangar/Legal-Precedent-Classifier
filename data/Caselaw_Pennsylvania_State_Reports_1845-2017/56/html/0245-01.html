    <p class="summary" id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[292,570,1155,593]]]'>* * * “ It seems that whether he intended this as a valid and binding bid, depends upon the intention with which he made it, and the impression and understanding which he had when he left the ground. If, when he made the offer, he was told by the auctioneer, or some one of the plaintiff’s agents, that the property would not be knocked down for a less sum than the minimum price demanded, and he understood it as a rejection of his offer, and with this impression left the ground, then the auctioneer had no right or authority to knock it down to him in his absence. It would be taking an undue advantage of him, under the circumstances, to knock down the property to him, in his absence, upon such an offer; because, if he had remained, he would have had the right to withdraw his bid at any time before the falling of the auctioneer’s hammer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b247-7" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[296,1171,1155,1152]]]'>* * * “ The next question is, what was the property for which he bid ? Did he bid for that mentioned and described in the deed subsequently tendered to him by the plaintiff, or did he bid for the half-acre, or <em>‘ </em>stable-lot,’ in addition to the property mentioned and described in the deed tendered by the plaintiff? If, when the defendant made the bid, he was under the impression and belief that the whole of the property, including <em>‘ </em>the stable-lot,’ was offered together, and he intended his bid for the whole of; the property, then he would not be bound by it, if only that part' of the property mentioned and described in the deed was actually offered for sale. What the understanding of the defendant was, is a question of fact for the jury. The bare allegation of the defendant, that such was his understanding when he made the bid, is not sufficient to justify the jury in finding the fact to be as alleged. But if, owing to any confusion, or indistinctness in describing the property actually offered for sale, some of the bystanders were under the impression and belief, from what they saw and heard, that the whole of the property was offered together, then the defendant, for the like reason, may have been under the same impression, and the jury might be justified in so finding. If the jury are satisfied that only the property mentioned in the deed was in point of fact intended to be offered by the auctioneer, and that no other property was actually offered by him, then the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that when he made the bid, he was under the impression that all the property, including ‘ the stable-lot,’ was offered for sale, and that he bid with this understanding.</p>

If the defendant absolutely refused to perform the contract, the plaintiff was not bound to tender a deed in order to maintain this action. When it was tendered the defendant did not object to it for want of a stamp. If he had objected to the deed for want of a stamp, the plaintiff might, and doubtless would, have had the proper stamp placed upon it. <em>As </em>he did not make the objection when the deed was tendered, he ought not to be permitted to make it now.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[253,966,1154,755]]]'>“ But the defendant also objects to the deed on account of the exception or reservation therein. It does not appear to the court, and there is no evidence in the case showing that the deed does not embrace and convey the property actually offered for sale, and knocked down by the auctioneer to the defendant. On the contrary, Mr. McGrowin, the surveyor, who made the plan of the lots, testifies expressly that the deed correctly describes the property offered for sale by the auctioneer and struck down by him to the defendant. His evidence is uncontradicted, and, therefore, the court decline to charge that the defendant was not bound to accept the deed on account of the reservation or exception. But whether this be so or not, is immaterial, if the jury believe the testimony of Mr. Robb as to the defendant’s declarations when he called upon him a day or two after the sale. If the defendant told the plaintiff’s agent that he need not prepare a deed, as he would not take the property, or have anything to do with it, the plaintiff was not bound to tender any deed before bringing suit, in order to maintain the action.</p>

If he had made the objection wrhen called upon to perform his contract, the plaintiff might have procured a release or satisfaction of the mortgage by having it shifted upon other property, or by discharging it in some other way. And in any event, the deferred payment, amounting to a sum larger than the mortgage, would have been an ample security and protection against it.”</p>

It may be, and undoubtedly is, true that the deed tendered to Millingar did correctly describe the property offered for sale by the auctioneer and knocked down to the defendant. But the effect of the reservation was to take the portion reserved out of the description, and to make the property sold that much less. It was then as if the description had in terms excluded the part reserved. If the fact stated in the reservation be true, then Millingar would get that much less than he bid for. The reservation reads thus: “ Excepting, however, from <em>the premises hereinbefore described, </em>a narrow strip of ground lying on the west side of the second and third pieces hereinbefore described, which was appropriated by the Pittsburg and Coal Hill Coal Company under proceedings in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county.”</p>

The testimony is clear that the auctioneer offered to sell the lots described in the deed, and also testified to by McGowin and that Millingar bid off that identical property. But there is no evidence that the bidders were informed or that Millingar knew that a portion of two of the lots had been appropriated by the coal company, and that his bid was made on this <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>footing. He bid for the property as a whole, in the lump, as it is said, and was entitled therefore to the whole. His bid was a single gross sum, and the contract an entire one. The case, therefore, did not rest on the waiver of the tender, hut upon the defect in the plaintiff’s title to the property sold. But the deed was itself the evidence of this defect. The plaintiff proved the tender and produced the deed.</p>
    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[270,696,1154,375]]]'>The exception in the deed states that this portion was appropriated by the coal company through legal proceedings. This was, therefore, a direct admission of the fact that the plaintiff had no title to the part appropriated, and indicated the measure of her ability to perform. The defendant had the right, then, to refuse to take the property struck off to him on the ground that to a part of it the plaintiff had no title, or that it was subject to such an easement in it on part of the coal company as diminished its value.</p>
