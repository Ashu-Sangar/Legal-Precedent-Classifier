The instance before us illustrates this idea perfectly. The testator, Alexander Leckey, was, in 1829, declared an habitual drunkard; but his committee neither gave bond nor took charge of his property, and from that day until the day of his death, a period of thirty-five years, he managed his own affairs in his own way. This was sufficient and more than sufficient to raise a presumption of abandonment of the proceedings, and that they were discharged. They were primá facie evidence of nothing. Thirteen years, in Bixler <em>v. </em>Gilleland, 4 Barr 156, in which nothing had been done under the decree that the party was an habitual drunkard, was thought by the judge who delivered the opinion of this court, to be sufficient <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>to raise the presumption that his family and friends were satisfied that no committee was needed. It is a proceeding for their protection ; and if they do nothing under the inquest, the fair presumption, especially after the lapse of more than twenty years, is, that the lunatic is restored, or the drunkard reformed.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[281,623,1162,514]]]'>But even if this were not so, there is no case in which the finding of the inquest has ever been held to be more than primá facie evidence of want of testamentary capacity. The effect of the inquest is to shift the burthen of proof to the party asserting capacity, instead of where it would otherwise lie, on the party alleging incapacity. There is a great difference in allowing its ejfect on a contract which the law holds void by reason of it, while it exists in force, and where its operation is simply to establish a condition of mind. It seems to me it may well have more force in the one case than the other. Be this as it may, however, the learned judge gave all the effect that the inquisition was entitled to in any circumstances.</p>

He was not a party to any case pending to test the validity of this will, until the 8th of September 1865, when the issue was ordered in the form it stood at the trial, by the Common Pleas. The precipe of the register directed the issue to be joined between Elizabeth Baird and Mary Fogle, on the one part, and Alexander Leckey <em>et al. </em>on the other.
