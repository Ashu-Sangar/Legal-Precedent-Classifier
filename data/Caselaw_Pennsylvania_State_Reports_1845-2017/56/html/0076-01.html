Under these executions the property of the Olmsteads was advertised to be sold on the 12th of November 1866, and the sale continued until the 14th. At November court C. H.

Dick &amp; Co. To save it and under the pressure of this circumstance, they advanced money to pay off these executions. This was done not only with the knowledge of the defendants, but they were very solicitous that the Dicks should do so, as they believed that the sale of the property in detail, that is, by a sale of an undivided interest at a time, would in a measure sacrifice it. It is very obvious that connected property, as it was, would not sell as well in undivided interests as <em>in solido; </em>and as the whole would be required to be sold to pay the liens upon it against the defendants, it is not apparent why such an order was made. But the fact that it was so made, left the Messrs. Dick no alternative but to do as they did, or lose their judgments.</p>

Dick, was applied for and resisted; not by new lien creditors, but by those existing when. <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>the money was paid. It is true the appellants claim that there was an intervening judgment in favor of Gr. Hosier and O. Derrickson <em>v. </em>C. H. Olmstead for $25,000 entered. Why this judgment should have been made the foundation of objection, I do not see, for it was marked' satisfied in full on the docket, and at the time of the decree its nature was understood to be merely cautionary with nothing due on it. The case stood solely as it did between the creditors when the money was paid, and when the decree in this case was entered. Their liens were, in legal contemplation, in no way impaired by the acts of the appellees. They were not postponed in any of their legal rights or remedies. Any of those whose judgments were ripe for execution, might have proceeded to put the property to sale the next day after it was stopped by the payment of the executions if they had chosen. The entry of satisfaction on the judgments by the plaintiffs did not extinguish them, excepting in favor of intervening liens, of which, as we have seen, there were none ; and equity would not allow its principles to be set aside by an act against equity, which the satisfaction entered would result in. The right of sub - rogation having been found to exist, it was certainly proper, on part of the court, to decree that the entry of satisfaction should be cancelled, and that the judgments should stand for the use of the plaintiffs in the bill.</p>

Olmstead, for the money advanced, did not destroy their equity, unless it could have been shown that it was in effect so intended. Nothing of this was shown. The appellants were not prejudiced by the act, and it would be hard to hold that the appellees were, if the former were not.</p>
