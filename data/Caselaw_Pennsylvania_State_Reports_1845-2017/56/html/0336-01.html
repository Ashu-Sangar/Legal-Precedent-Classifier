My brother Strong stated the power of the court to direct what should be tried, the form of the issues and who should be parties, and whether the parties, and of course all interested persons, should be examined. These suggestions were carried out to the fullest extent in framing the issues in Cochran <em>v. </em>Eldridge, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20365" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Wright 365">13 Wright 365</a>, although they $0 not appear in the printed report. The Chief Justice there said, &lt;£ Creditors have often been admitted to show that a judgment was fraudulent as between the original parties; and it would be strange if the defendants might not show the fraud.” Ferree <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 P. F. Smith 353, was a writ of error to a judgment in a feigned issue to try whether a judgment was boná fide and entitled according to date to a priority over subsequent judgment-creditors.</p>
    <p id="b342-8" data-blocks='[["BL_342.6",342,[278,1779,1162,298]]]'>Springer, Admr., <em>v. </em>Springer, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20518" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Wright 518">7 Wright 518</a>, holds that where there is a decree of subrogation to a judgment a writ of error is not proper. Subrogation is an equitable remedy, and can properly be reviewed only by appeal. So in Horton <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20256" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Wright 256">8 Wright 256</a>, it was held that on application to the equitable powers of the court to set off one judgment against another, the remedy of the party aggrieved is by appeal, and not by writ of error.</p>
    <p id="b342-9" data-blocks='[["BL_342.7",342,[278,2076,1161,87]]]'>It is clear, then, that in the present case no error occurred on the trial of the feigned issue nor in the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b342-10" data-blocks='[["BL_342.8",342,[943,2164,451,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b342-11" data-blocks='[["BL_342.9",342,[323,2247,388,41]]]'>Strong, J., dissented.</p>
