Cases, p. 230, Mr. Justice Blackburn said : “ The common law enabled any owner to dedicate land as a highway, and then at common law followed the consequence that it became repairable by the inhabitants of the parish or district.” In Re Milford, 4 Barr 305, the court said: “ The authority of the owner of a town plot to dedicate his ground to public use is as effective as that of the legislature and in The. Borough of Birmingham <em>v. </em>Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20258" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="12 Wright 258">12 Wright 258</a>, it is said: “It has been the practice in this country in laying out towns to have the plat surveyed and a plan made in accordance with the survey designating the streets, public squares and open spaces left for commons, wharves or any other public purpose. Those streets, squares and open spaces are thus dedicated to the public by the proprietors of the soil, whether they be the state or private individuals. When a town is situated on a navigable river, it is generally the custom to leave an open space between the line of the lots next the river and the river itself. This was done by William Penn in 1682 in the original plan of the city of Philadelphia on the Delaware front, and he called it a top-common, and in 1784, his descendants, the former proprietaries, in their plan of Pitts-burg, adopted a similar measure of leaving such an open space, and they called it Water Street. In 1789 the proprietors of the land on which the city of Cincinnati is built pursued the same policy, and in their plan the ground lying between Front Street and the Ohio river was set apart as a common for the use and benefit of the town for ever.” In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Cole, 2 Casey 189, Knox, J., speaking of a road in Carbon county, said: “ To prevent any future controversy, it is prope'r for us to add that the use of the ground by the public as a highway for more than twenty-one years made it a public road just as effectually as though it had been originally laid out and opened by the proper authorities.” In Schenley <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Casey 29, a peculiarly strong case, my brother Strong said (p. 59) : “ Wherever there is an actual giving of land for a public highway accepted by the public,'though there be no deed, the dedication is complete.”</p>
