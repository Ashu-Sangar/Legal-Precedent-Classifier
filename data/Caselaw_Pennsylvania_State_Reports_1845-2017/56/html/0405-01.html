There were debts and funeral expenses to be paid; and whether we treat the interest as real or personal estate, it was undoubtedly assets for their payment. If it was personal estate, and of this there can be no doubt, it vested in his personal representative, as trustee for the creditors and heirs; and it was the duty of the administrator to embrace it in his inventory. But whether returned or not, the omission to do so, in no way aifected its character as personal <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>assets, or impaired the right of the administrator to realize its value. It was his duty to proceed at once, and dispose of it upon terms most advantageous to the parties interested ; and to enable him to do so the law clothed him with the fullest authority. So long as he acted in good faith, his title to the property, as to sale and transfer, was as ample and absolute as that of the decedent in his lifetime ; and neither creditor nor. heir could lawfully interfere with any disposition he might make of it — all they could do was to hold him to an account for the proceeds of the sale. There was nothing in the nature of the interest to prevent a sale. The value at the time of sale was somewhat conjectural, it is true, owing to the uncertain period of enjoyment. But the sale of an estate <em>per autre </em>vie, is liable to the same objections, and that and similar estates and interests pass to the personal representative by the express direction of the Act of Assembly.</p>

This being the principle, it would be against equity, and contrary to its own maxim which looks at the substance of things, to view the’ conveyance of the administrator of William Erwin, Jr., contrary'to-its-manifest intention— which'was to convey whatever interest-the-intestate had-in the estate of his father the testator. Wiliam Erwin, Jr., owed debts ; these debts were a lien upon his estate real and personal. Whether his interest in the real estate, which his father, the testator, directed to be sold, were real or personal, it was bound for the payment of his debts. It was the intention of his administrator to dispose of this interest for that purpose. He became-the actor, and moved the court towards the' end he would himself accomplish. It was not an adversary proceeding in which he wras acted upon by others who must proceed at their own peril; but he himself became the petitioner, and his prayer was that the interest of his intestate might be sold to pay the debts. If we consult his intention, therefore, what matters it that-he mistook the nature of the property, called it real estate,«.and invoked the Orphans’ Court to supply that defect in his own power which the supposed nature of the estate denoted. Nevertheless, he was moving, though supported as he thought by the strong arm of the Orphans’ Court, to the same end to which his own powers were adequate, to wit, the sale of his intestate’s interest in the testator’s estate ; and in consummation of this purpose he conveyed to the purchaser such <em>interest </em>and share as were devised or <em>bequeathed </em>to him the said William Erwin, Jr., by the last will and testament of William Erwin, Sr. This being the clear intention and purpose of the administrator, and having himself, aside from the authority of the Orphans’ Court, the power to sell this interest as personalty, and the proceeding not being adversary, but at his own instance, and intended to effectuate the very end he had in view; equity, looking at the substance and true intent of the <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>transaction, steps in and treats his act as efficient to the purpose. His deed is therefore an equitable assignment at least, if it may not indeed be an actual assignment at law, of the personal .interest of the intestate in the proceeds of the testator’s realty when it should be converted ; and this the more so, when we consider that in fact there was no conversion, the real estate yet standing as the existing source from which the interest in the proceeds was to spring, and was viewed as personalty only through the medium of equity. The cases of Hays <em>v. </em>Mayer, <a href="/watts/8/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Watts 212" data-case-ids="1848433" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0212-01">8 Watts 212</a>, Rice <em>v. </em>Bixler, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 445" data-case-ids="1852623" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0445-01">1 W. &amp; S. 445</a>, and Costen’s Appeal, 1 Harris 292, fully support this position. Hess <em>v. </em>Short, 7 Barr 231, does not militate against it. That case was decided on the ground that the executor not having executed the power of sale, and the contingency not having happened on which the power was to be executed, the effect of the judgment would he to fix the executor prematurely for the money; and he was therefore not liable as garnishee in an execution-attachment.</p>
