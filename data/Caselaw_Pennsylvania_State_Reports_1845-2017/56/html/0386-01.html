In regard to the second query, your auditor is of opinion that no more than the amount actually paid, with lawful interest, should he allowed. It is no difference what phraseology the parties saw fit to use, the courts will look beyond the forms in which the agreement is clothed, and regard the substance of the contract: Fitzsimmons <em>v. </em>Baum, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2032" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 32">8 Wright 32</a>. The agreement which was some days in being consummated, commenced in an attempt to borrow money, and it is difficult to conceive, that it was in reality anything but a loan on the one part, and a borrowing on the other. The ultimate effect of allowing the whole. judgment, would be to secure more than the legal rate of interest for the loan of money. This would be subversive of the statute against usury, and cannot prevail. The amount to be paid for the note was $4000, but Dr. Crawford says that he kept back of his part, the sum of $285.39, out of which his account against Mr. Bachdell was to be deducted. On producing his book account, it appeared that at this time he had an account against defendant of $65. Defendant produced an order of witness, or more properly a receipt of witness, which is attached hereto, which it was admitted entitled defendant to a credit of $70, and which shows that this account had been more than paid <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>nearly a year before — the receipt being dated August 29th 1865.
