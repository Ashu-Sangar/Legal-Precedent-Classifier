Witness further testified: — “ The parties agreed to compromise for certain oil, to be delivered; lubricating oil, of Maute’s own manufacture; no particular quality of lubricating oil; there were conversations about the House of Refuge, Lake Superior Iron Works, and the several establishments Maute had been accustomed to deliver oil to; Maute said the oil was worth $60 to $65 per barrel; I was not present when the matter was closed up; Maute was engaged in the manufacture of oils; his works were down at Wood’s run; * * * it was the understanding all around, that it was to be Maute’s own manufacture ; it was understood that it was to be of the value of $65; I asked Maute what his oil was worth, and he said it was worth from $1.25 to $2 a gallon; I have a distinct recollection that the oil was to be an equivalent for the judgment, $900 to $1000.”</p>

Mr. Brown wrote out the confession of judgment, and commenced writing the article of agreement. After writing a portion of it, he asked how the oil was to be described. I told him to call it good lubricating oil, and think I added of Maute’s own manufacture. Maute said, there may some question or difficulty arise as to the quality of the oil to be delivered, and I would rather have a sample. Mr. Gross said there need be no difficulty; just give me such as you gave the House of Refuge.’ Mr. Brown, I think, suggested that it would be better to have the sample. I objected, that Mr. Maute could not get the sample in time ; that the matter must be closed that evening, in order that we should know whether to bring back our witnesses or not. Mr. Maute said there was a man down town to whom he had given some of that oil, and he thought he could get it in a few minutes; started away, and said he would be back in a few minutes. He returned in a short time with this vial of oil. In the mean time Mr. Brown had written the agreement, which was afterwards signed. Maute said, the man I went to see was not in, but I found some at another place of a little better quality.’ Mr. Gross took the bottle and looked at it, and remarked, I don’t think that is very good.’ Maute replied, there, that is what I told you ; if he (Gross) would not be satisfied with that, he would not be satisfied with anything.’ Maute said, this (referring to the sample) is the best oil I make, and is worth $1.80 per gallon’; to which Mr. Gross replied, may be it is right, and I will take it.’ The article was then signed, and Maute said he would deliver it as soon as he could get it ready. Mr. Brown advised him to do it at once. The article was drawn up, referring to sample before the sample was brought in. The agreement was drawn up and signed on the 9th. It was dated the 10th, so as to correspond with the judgment, which was to be entered in open court on the next day, the 10th. The agreement for confession of the judgment, and agreement for delivery of the oil in satisfaction of the judgment, were executed at the same time— were regarded as one transaction. It was understood that the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>standard was to bo the sample. The sample was placed in my care,. Eefore we left the court-house, the arrangement as to the number of barrels of oil, time of delivering, quality and kind of oil, was made. It was agreed that the oil should be delivered at Maute’s place in two weeks. The parties were brought together by Mr. Ott. Maute said he would deliver the oil as soon as he could manufacture it.”</p>

This was proper. Fraud in a contract could never be proved, if its terms were held to preclude all other evidence in regard to it. A fraudulent scrivener might, if such a rule prevailed, write a very different contract from that agreed upon by the parties; and if they affixed their signatures to it, the fraud would be an accomplished fact. It is too well settled that this is not the rule to justify any reference to authorities.</p>
    <p id="b255-10" data-blocks='[["BL_255.12",255,[259,1537,1159,213]]]'>The fact seems undisputed, that the oil which the plaintiff agreed to deliver to the defendant in payment of the judgment, was to be oil of his own manufacture, of the kind that had been furnished by him on former occasions to the House of Refuge] and to the Lake Superior Iron Works in this city.</p>

After some conversation, the plaintiff proposed to procure a sample from a party who he alleged had some of his oil, and left for that purpose. He returned in a short time with a bottle containing oil, which the defendant remarked didmot look like the oil he had seen of his manufacture. The plaintiff replied it was, and referring to the sample said it was the best he made, and worth $1.80 per gallon. The agreement had been written, referring to the sample, while plaintiff was absent. After this conversation the parties signed the agreement. The testimony objected to showed all this ; and that the sample was not of manufactured, but of crude oil, worth not over 16 cents per gallon, instead of $1.80, as represented. Supposing that the writing closed the door against inquiry, the plaintiff, within the time stipulated, delivered the number of Darrels of oil agreed upon according to the sample, and claimed a <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>satisfaction of the judgment which was to he paid in oil. If these facts were true, and the jury have found, they were, it would be a very deficient system of jurisprudence which would forbid them, to be proved.
