It was the case that defendants, trusting that the bridge would last some months longer, neglected, 1, the duty of repairing; and 2, the imperative duty of closing it until its dangerous condition was removed.- Whilst it was passed over every day by the public, there could not be on the part of any one, by simply using the bridge in the ordinary way, such a contributory negligence as would, prevent the plaintiff’s recovery <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>for an injury which he never would knowingly have been a party in causing.</p>

A railroad company with high tre.stle bridges, with the same force might say to a passenger, <em>“ </em>You knew our road was very dangerous, why did you run the risk of an accident and consequent injury ?”</p>
