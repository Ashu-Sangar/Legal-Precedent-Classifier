It was testified by another witness that, on a prosecution against the overseers for neglecting to maintain the pauper, both defendants, who were witnesses, admitted the names to the bond to be their signatures.

There is no evidence of any misrepresentations of facts, but if any mistake existed, it was in reference to the contents of the written paper.] But it is said the bond was not read ; the law presumes it was, and the evidence ought to be clear that it was not. Still if it was not read to John,, and he could not read, and the. contents were misrepresented, it would not bind him, and plaintiffs cannot recover. [We do not think the evidence in this case sufficient to alter the terms of the written agreement. The case is then to be decided on the legal construction of the bond. By that they were bound to maintain her and to indemnify the township.] It is said, however, by the condition of the bond that they were to furnish her in a house, &amp;e.; that the covenant required the defendants to provide her with necessaries, and it was their duty under that bond to bring her home and provide according to the bond. Notice was not necessary by the overseers ; it follows therefore that if there was a breach by failing to maintain her, by which plaintiffs have been compelled to pay, then the plaintiff ought to recover.

There was no evidence of any false statement of facts as an inducement to the execution of the bond. The court were therefore right in saying they saw no evidence of fraud and no sufficient evidence to alter the terms of the written paper. But the court instructed the jury that if the bond was not read to John, and he could not read and the contents were misrepresented, it would not bind him, and as consequence told the jury the plaintiff could not recover in that event. This was all the evidence justified the court in saying. The argument of the plaintiff in error overlooks the palpable distinction between a defence resting upon facts which are misstated in order to induce a party to enter into a bond, the contents of which he knows, and one resting on a misrepresentation of the contents of the instrument itself to an illiterate person. In the former case the bond is the obligation of the party who seals it, but it is avoided by the false inducement to enter into it, and in the latter the instrument is not his deed or bond at all. It is this distinction which the court bore in mind in charging in what is alleged to be a contradictory manner. The only fraud alleged was in the asserted misrepresentation of the contents of the paper, and this the court fairly submitted.</p>
