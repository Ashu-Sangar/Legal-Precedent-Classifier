In order to understand the points, it is necessary carefully to examine and consider what the contract was, because we are not here to make contracts; but it is only the duty of courts and juries to carry out the contracts of parties according to the spirit and meaning of the agreement. The contract in this instance was, that the vendors, in consideration of $1375, agreed to sell and convey to Herrod, the defendant, all their right, title and claim in a tract of land in Fairfield township, containing 500 acres, &amp;c. This contract did not agree to convey a good title, nor is it mentioned what kind of a title the vendors had. All they were bound to convey was their right, title and claim, and that was all they were bound to convey, and all that was contemplated by the contract and assented to by the parties. A title to land is one thing, a claim is another, and an agreement to sell a claim does not require the vendor to convey more than his right, title and claim.</p>

When the subject of th.e contract is the land itself, the purchaser has a right to a title to it clear of all defects and encumbrances, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, and hence when called upon for the price, he may defend by showing that the title offered is defective. In such a case he does not get what he bargained for, and what the vendor covenanted to give. There is a failure in whole or in part of the consideration for his own engagements. But when, as in this ease, a vendor has bound himself to convey, not the land, but his right, title and claim to the land, there is no implication of a covenant that he has a good title. When, therefore, he conveys all his claim whatever it may be, he gives to the vendee the subject of the contract, and there is no failure of consideration for the vendee’s promise to pay. It would be absurd to hold that there is no difference in legal effect between a cove nant to convey a tract of land and a covenant to convey the covenantor’s right, title and claim to it. The difference is too well understood to be denied. Imperfect titles everywhere abound, and they are the subject of sale. We have equitable titles, conflicting equities, tax titles not consummate and many others. It would be a novelty were we to decide that a contract to convey one of these is an engagement to assure to the vendee whatever titles, legal or .equitable, there may be outstanding in others, equivalent to a warranty against the world. A vendee may certainly bargain for a title to be at his own risk, and this he does when he buys, not the land, but a title or claim to it.</p>
