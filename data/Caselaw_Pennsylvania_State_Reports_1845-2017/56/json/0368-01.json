        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 21st 1867, by\nAgnew, J.\nIt is a mistake to suppose that the plaintiff\u2019s claim fell within the Statute of Frauds. The defendant was not charged upon any special promise to answer the debt or default of another. He did not assume to pay the debt of another to the plaintiff', but he requested the plaintiff to pay a debt wrhieh he himself owed to another. Whether he .owed it individually or as a partner matters not, as he has not pleaded in abatement, and the proof shows no recognition of the debt as a partner merely. Before the arbitrators, Oliphant distinctly admitted that the note was a debt coming to Patterson from him; that this amount was due Mr. Patterson. The account also was claimed by Patterson, as paid at Oliphant\u2019s request, and Oliphant admitted that this sum ($483.02) was correct. The court submitted the recognition of these debts to the jury, -with the instruction that the subsequent recognition of the obligation to pay the plaintiff, was equal to proof of payment at the defendant\u2019s own request. The jury found the fact, and this distinguishes it from a mere promise to pay the debt of another.\nWe discover no error, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Oliphant versus Patterson.\n1. The defendant requested the plaintiff to pay a debt which he (defendant) owed to another. Held, whether the defendant owed it individually or as partner, that it was not within the Act of April 26th 1855 (Frauds).\n2. The plaintiff gave in evidence an account and a note between other parties, claiming that he had paid it at the defendant\u2019s request, and gave evidence that the defendant said the amount of the account was correct, and that the note was a debt due from him. The court submitted to the jury the question whether the defendant had recognised them as his debts, and if he had, the recognition was equivalent to previous authority to pay. Held, this was not a promise to pay the debt of another and that the instruction was correct.\nNovember 19th 1867.\nBefore Thompson, Strong, Read and Agnew, JJ. Woodward, C. J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette county: No. 30, to October and November Term 1867.\nAlfred Patterson, on the 9th of April 1866, brought an action of assumpsit against Fidelio IT. Oliphant, and declared on a promissory note made by John Oliphant & Co. to John and George Evans for $259, payable in 90 days, endorsed to the plaintiff;\u2014 also on the common counts. The plaintiff offered in evidence the note declared on, to wit:\u2014\n\u201c $259.00 \u201c Fairchance Iron Works,\n\u201c November 26th 1860.\n\u201c Ninety days after date, we promise to pay to the order of John and George Evans, two hundred and fifty-nine dollars, without defalcation, for value received, payable at Fairchance Iron Works, in currency.\n\u201c John Oliphant & Co.\u201d\nEndorsed:\n\u201c John Evans,\n\u201c George Evans,\n\u201c Alfred Stewart.\u201d\nHe then called Isaac Skiles, who testified:\u2014\n\u201c This note was before us as referees, in a parol submission by the parties to settle their differences. Mr. Oliphant admitted this was a debt coming to Mr. Patterson, from him (Mr. Oliphant) ; that this amount was due to Mr. Patterson.\u201d\nThe note was then read in evidence.\nHe then offered this account, viz.:\u2014\n\u201c Fayette county Railroad Co.,\n\u201c In account with John Oliphant & Co.\nBy balance, ........ $483.02\nLess this amount, Robinson, ..... 50.00\n$433.02\n\u201c Fairchance Iron Works, June 27th 1862,\u201d alleging, as stated in the judge\u2019s certified notes of trial, that the defendant got him to pay it for John Oliphant & Co.; he further examined the witness, who said : \u201c In reference to this account, Mr. Oliphant (defendant) said, that $483.02 was correct.\u201d\nThe court (G-ilmore, P. J.) charged:\u2014\n\u201c The defendant claims that under the 1st section of the Act of Assembly of the 26th April 1855, the plaintiff cannot recover the first two items claimed. The act requires any special promise to answer for the debt or default of another to be in writing. We do not look upon the alleged liability of the defendant under the proof in the case, to be merely a special promise to pay the debt or undertaking of another. It is an acknowledgment to pay plaintiff money which he had already paid. The recognition-of the obligation.to pay is equal to proof that the money was paid, laid out, &c., at the defendant\u2019s own instance and request. This subsequent recognition, if believed, is ' equivalent to previous authority to pay.\u201d * * * * *' '* \u2018 *\nThe verdict was for the plaintiff for $987.79.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned the charge for error.\nD. Kaine, for plaintiff in error,\nreferred to Tucker v. Bitting, 8 Casey 430; Shoemaker v. King, 4 Wright 110; Miller v. Long, 9 Id. 350; Maul\u00e9 v. Bueknell, 14 Id. 39; Paul v.
