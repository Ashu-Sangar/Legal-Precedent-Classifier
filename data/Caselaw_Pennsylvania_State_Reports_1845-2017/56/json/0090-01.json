        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 14th 1867, by\nAgnew, J.\nThe offer of the receipt and books set forth in the 1st assignment of error, was for the purpose of showing that the note in suit had been given for a previous indebtedness; but what bearing this fact had on the recovery of the note, the bill does not inform us. It was of no consequence what had been the consideration of the note without an offer of some evidence which would exhibit a defence growing out of the fact that the note had been given for a former debt. As the offer stood before the court it seemed to be irrelevant, and we cannot say the court committed a positive error in its rejection. It is the duty of a party in making an offer of evidence to state its purpose in such manner that the court may perceive its relevancy.\nThe admission of the entries in the plaintiff\u2019s books was for the purpose of explaining, by the production of the whole account, the relation of the items in it read by the defendant. The defendant having shown the balance resulting from these items, and a receipt for the balance of the account, there was no error in permitting the plaintiff to read the whole account in the same books as a matter of explanation. The admission of the evidence extended no further. This disposes of the 2d, 3d and 4th errors.\nThe 5th assignment of error is not sustained. There was some tendency in the vouchers from the auditor-general\u2019s office to rebut the order for wood given by Piper to the Whites by showing that he had received the money himself from the Commonwealth for the wood furnished by him. Whether the bills rendered were for the same wood upon which Piper drew his order in favor of the Whites, was a fact which the court was not bound to determine, but might submit to the jui\u2019y.\nWe perceive no error in receiving the deposition of J. O\u2019Friel, taken before George B. Bowers, Esq. The justice certified that the witness was duly qualified and examined, and that he subscribed the deposition in his presence. It must be presumed the deposition was correctly taken and reduced to writing by the justice or by his authority. The mere fact that the handwriting in the body of the deposition does not appear to be that of the justice, without some proof to rebut the presumption of regularity arising from the certificate, was insufficient to exclude it.\nThe writ of error in this case was taken to the original judgment, and not to the scire facias.\n. If the writ operated as a supersedeas, which we do not determine, though the probability arising from lapse of time is against it, the plaintiff in error could have moved the court below to arrest the proceedings upon the scire facias. Without any step so taken, we will not now inquire into the regularity of the proceedings upon the scire facias. The judgment is affirmed.",

He gave evidence of a sale to plaintiffs, January 24th 1855, of wood, amounting to $2202.75 ; June 28th 1855, of mules and harness, amounting to $800 ; also an order on the wood inspector on the Portage Railroad, as follows:\u2014\n\u201c Ebensburg, January 24th 1855.\n\u201c William Bolsinger, Esq.:\u2014\n\u201c Please make out a certificate for my wood in my name, and give to A.

April 1. By William K. Piper, . . $800\u201d\n\u201c It being contended that the entries in the books are sufficient to warrant the jury in inferring that the note in suit is a renewed note and for a previous indebtedness.\u201d The offer was rejected and a bill was sealed by the judge.\nDefendant further gave some evidence that the note in suit was given for wood; also cash account in plaintiffs\u2019 books, \u201c showing that this note is not charged with any of the proceeds of the note of April 10th 1854.\u201d *\nIn rebuttal the plaintiffs offered the books of A. M. & R. White & Co., the same books given in evidence by defendant. The books show that defendant is credited there with the mules, and the note of A. M. & R. White for $155, which are included in the balance of $37.26.\nThe offer was objected to, but the evidence was received and a bill sealed by the judge.\nThe plaintiffs further offered the following certificates from the auditor-general\u2019s office, dated August 22d 1855 :\u2014\n1. Bill in favor of the defendant against the Commonwealth, dated June 2d 1854, for 1000 cords of wood delivered at Station No. 6, on Portage Railroad, in March, at $1.65 per cord, with receipt of defendant for $1650, \u201c the amount of the above bill in full.\u201d\n2.

White, one of them, had delivered all the wood for one year, 1854 or 1855, at Station No. 6 on the Portage Road ; and was taking wood to No. 4 \u201c all the time ;\u201d that the defendant got out wood there ; that White owned land there; that at an investigation before the canal commissioners A. White, at the request of the defendant, testified that he had got 2000 cords of wood from White.\nThe plaintiffs offered the deposition of J. O\u2019Eriel.\nThe notice of the rule was, that the.deposition would be \u201c taken at the house of Margery O\u2019Eriel, * * * before John Gorley, Esq., a justice, &c., or before some other competent authority.\u201d\nThe certificate was: \u2014 \u25a0\n\u201c I certify that the above witness was duly qualified and examined at the time and place stated in the caption, and subscribed his deposition in my presence, having remained at the house of Margery O\u2019Eriel, from 6 until 9 o\u2019clock p. M.\n\u201c Geo. B. Bowers, Justice of the Peace.\u201d\nThe defendant objected to its reception because of insufficient notice; because not in the handwriting of the justice, and because he had not certified that the witness was examined in his presence.\nThe objections were overruled, the deposition admitted and a bill sealed by the judge.\nOn the 11th of December the jury found for the plaintiffs. $2967.64.
