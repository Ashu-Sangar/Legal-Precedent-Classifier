        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 11th 1867, by\nStrong, J.\nHad it been determined, immediately after the passage of the Act of April 9th 1849, that a debtor could not deprive himself of that exemption from execution of a portion of his property allowed by the statute, by any agreement made at the time the debt was created, the object of the legislature would doubtless have been better secured. But it having been ruled that the exemption is a\u2019 mere personal privilege which the debtor can at any time waive, and that a waiver once made cannot be retracted, the whole force of the statute is eluded by simply a change in the form of the contract. Hence, if the privilege accorded to debtors is to be anything more than a shadow, it ought to be ruled that an agreement to waive the exemption made when a debt is incurred shall be expressed in clear and unequivocal language. It is not to rest upon inference or conjecture. The plaintiff, in this case, took a note in which his debtor promised to pay to him \u201c the sum of thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents, for value received, or the Homestead Exemption Law, without defalcation.\u201d We cannot say the note contained an agreement not to claim the benefit of the exemption allowed by the statute. We may conjecture that such was the debtor\u2019s intention, but that is not enough. When, therefore, judgment was recovered for the debt, and an execution was issued, the debtor had a right to the exemption of his personal goods, not exceeding in value $300, a right which the constable was not at liberty to disregard. Nor could the mistake of the magistrate, in endorsing upon the executions \u201c exemption note,\u201d deprive him of that right.\nThe justice had no authority to make such an endorsement. Moreover, it did not even purport to be an adjudication concluding the debtor. The charge of the court to which exception is taken, was in all respects correct.\nJudgment affirmed.",

A note promised to pay \u00a737.50 \u201c for value received, or the Homestead Exemption Lawheld, not to be a waiver of the exemption.\n3. The justice endorsed on an execution on a judgment recovered on the note, \u201c exemption notethis did not deprive the debtor of his right.\nNovember 2d 1867.\nBefore Thompson, Strong, Read and Agnew, JJ.- Woodward, C. J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Indiana 'county: No. 132, to October and November Term 1867.\nThis was a scire facias, by John O\u2019Nail against Jacob Craig, a constable of Indiana county, for an insufficient return.\nThe writ was issued April 4th 1864, under the Act of March 20th 1810, \u00a7 12 (Purd. 184, pi. 19, 5 Sm. L. 167), by Thomas Stophel, a justice of the peace, and brought into the Court of Common Pleas by appeal.\nOn the 12th of June 1862, John McAnulty gave to O\u2019Nail the plaintiff in error the following note :\u2014\n\u201c June 12th 1862, thirty days after date I promise to pay to John O\u2019Nail the sum of thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents for value received \u2014 or the Homestead Exemption Law, without defalcation.\u201d\nO\u2019Nail brought suit on the note before Esquire Stophel and recovered judgment for $25.64. On the 18th of January 1864, an execution endorsed \u201cExemption note\u201d was issued and placed in the hands of Craig. To this execution he returned February 12th 1864 : \u201c No money made. Defendant claims exemption, $300 Act. Defendant has his property appraised by J. T. Paterson, &c., sworn appraisers. Returned amount of property, $95.33.\u201d\nThe justice then issued the scire facias against Craig for an insufficient return, and on the 11th of April 1864 gave judgment against him for $22.96. From this judgment he appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.\nThe court (Campbell, P. J., of the 18th district) charged, amongst other things: \u201c that the awkward expression embodied in the note \u2018 or the Homestead Exemption Law\u2019 is no waiver of the provisions of the Act of 1849, and that McAnulty had a right to have his property appraised on an execution issued on that note.\u201d\nAlso, \u201c the plaintiff must stand on his rights as they actually existed, and not as they appeared from the execution, and that if he really had not an exemption note, he cannot recover from the constable for disregarding an erroneous entry on the execution by the justice, and therefore your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the defendant; the plaintiff took out a writ of error, assigning for error the charge of the court.\nJ. M. Thompson, for plaintiff m error,\ncited Act of March 20th 1810, \u00a7 12, supra.\nStewart OlarJc, for defendant in error,\ncited Freeman v. Smith, 6 Casey 264."
