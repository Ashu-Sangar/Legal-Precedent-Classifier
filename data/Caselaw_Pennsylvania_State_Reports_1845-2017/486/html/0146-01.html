Appellant JoAnne Marie Sinn lived with her husband and two minor children in Elizabeth Township, Allegheny County. On June 12, 1975, at approximately 5:53 p. m., the deceased, Lisa Sinn, and her sister, Deborah, were standing by the Sinn’s mail box located along side the Greenock-Buena Vista Road, approximately 36 feet from the nearest intersection. An automobile operated by the appellee struck Lisa and hurled her through the air, causing injuries which resulted in her death. Deborah was not struck by the vehicle, although it narrowly missed her. Appellant witnessed the accident from a position near the front door of her home. The Sinns filed a four-count trespass complaint against appellee on June 3, 1976. The first and second counts were brought under the Wrongful Death and Survival acts, respectively.

These actions were dismissed by the trial court and the Superior Court affirmed, citing the failure of the complaint to allege that the wife was herself in danger of physical impact or that she feared such impact. The Superior Court recognized that our <em>Niederman </em>decision required such a possibility of fear of physical impact as a predicate to successful recovery on the part of the wife’s estate.

In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice ROBERTS inaccurately accuses this Court of subverting the Wrongful Death Act, Act of April 26, 1855, P.L. 309, § 1, as amended, 12 P.S. §§ 1601-04 (1953), and characterizes the present suit as one seeking <em>solatium. </em>The Wrongful Death Act compensates the decedent’s survivors for the pecuniary losses they sustained as a result of the decedent’s death. The measure of damages for the death of a minor in such an action consists of funeral and medical expenses, plus the total earnings which would have been earned by the child up to the age of 21, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>minus the cost of maintaining the child during this period, with the resulting amount reduced to its present worth. <em>Swartz </em>v. <em>Smokowitz, </em><a href="/pa/400/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="400 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="1292522" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0109-01">400 Pa. 109</a>, 112-13, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20330" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="161 A.2d 330">161 A.2d 330</a> (1960). In the Fourth Count of her complaint, Mrs. Sinn does not seek such damages, rather she seeks damages for the emotional injuries she sustained as a result of witnessing the accident. These damages are not to be confused with the concept of <em>solatium. </em>Solatium, or solace, describes a type of monetary damages awarded the decedent’s survivors to recompense them for their feelings of anguish, bereavement, and grief caused by the fact of the decedent’s death. Although most civil law nations provide such damages for the bereaved relatives, it has been steadfastly rejected by the common law. <em>See </em>Speiser &amp; Malawér, An American Tragedy: Damages for Mental Anguish of Bereaved Relatives in Wrongful Death Actions, 51 Tulane L.Rev. 1 (1976). Mrs. Sinn is not seeking damages to soothe her grief resulting from the loss of her child; instead, she seeks damages for the mental distress caused by the shock of actually witnessing her child being struck and killed. These damages are independent of her grief and bereavement. Both <em>solatium </em>and wrongful death actions are intended to compensate the decedent’s survivors for the loss — affectional and pecuniary, respectively — they incurred as a result of the death. By contrast, in the present action Mrs. Sinn seeks recompense for an independent injury inflicted upon her by the defendant: the negligent infliction of mental distress.</p>

The issue before the <em>Tobin </em>court was whether a mother could recover for her own mental and physical injuries caused by shock and fear for her two-year-old child who suffered serious injuries when he was struck by a negligently operated automobile.

This is not explained, as Mr. Justice Nix would suggest, by a national judicial indifference to the emotional distress caused either by the death of a loved one or the shock, for anyone, of immediately perceiving a violent death. It is explained, rather, by the foundational jurisprudential wisdom that recovery justified only by arbitrary rules and distinctions must be avoided. This is true not only because arbitrary distinctions are fundamentally unfair, but also because, of course, they defy rational application in future cases, the cornerstone of the law. Because Mr. Justice Nix’s opinion can rest only on arbitrary distinctions, I must dissent.</p>

This test, ostensibly simple, will produce monumental problems both of application and fair limitation. If recovery is extended in the present case, can the law close its eyes to the emotional distress of bystanders who recently witnessed the traumatic amputation of a young woman’s hand by a subway car? Does the majority’s “rule” give us any principle at all in the following situation? Three siblings get off a bus. Two attempt to cross the street. The third begins to walk away from them down the block. A moment later he hears screeching car brakes, screams and one of his siblings yelling, “My God, Jim is dead.” Does the brother have a foreseeable injury? Is there any way to judge whether his emotional distress “resulted from a direct emotional impact upon the plaintiff from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident” or from “learning of the accident from others after its occurrence?” How many steps down the street distinguish immediate observation from indirect learning?
