Weisser, Edward 0. Weisser, Violet Weisser and Geraldine M. Weisser, be disqualified from providing representation because of violations of various canons of the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.7",406,[304,808,1149,682]]]'>In early 1977, shortly after enactment of the Mobile Home Park Rights Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> several complaints against the owners and operators of Eastern Dawn Mobile Home Park were filed with the Bucks County District Attorney’s Office. The Bucks County District Attorney assigned deputy district attorney John B. Lampi and a county detective to investigate the complaints. Throughout the investigation Eastern Dawn Mobile Home Park was represented by Donald B. McCoy, Esquire. Following the investigation, Attorney Lampi effected a compromise with Eastern Dawn and through the district attorney’s office, issued a formal report concluding that Eastern Dawn’s practices did not violate the Mobile Home Park Rights Act.</p>
    <p id="b406-7" data-blocks='[["BL_406.8",406,[304,1515,1148,675]]]'>Approximately one year after investigating Eastern Dawn, Lampi resigned from the district attorney’s office and took a job with Donald B. McCoy and Associates. During this one year period, numerous complaints against Eastern Dawn similar to those previously lodged with the Bucks County officials were filed with the State Bureau of Consumer Protection. Pursuant to those complaints, the Bureau investigated the practices of the owners and operators of Eastern Dawn and of Weisser Mobile Homes, Inc. As a result of that investigation, the Bureau filed a complaint alleging all appellants were engaging in practices which prevented residents of Eastern Dawn from selling their mobile homes.</p>

Kelly immediately informed Lampi that because of his prior involvement with the matter as a prosecutor, the Commonwealth would file a motion to disqualify Lampi or any members of his firm from representing appellants. McCoy then went to the phone and informed Kelly that he alone would represent appellants. Kelly stated that nonetheless the Commonwealth would file its motion to disqualify.</p>
    <p id="b407-4" data-blocks='[["BL_407.5",407,[176,865,1149,561]]]'>On January 23, 1979, the Commonwealth filed its motion to disqualify McCoy or any member of his firm from representing appellants in this suit. Following oral argument before Judge Wilkinson of the Commonwealth Court, an order was entered disqualifying McCoy and his associates from representing appellants. Believing the question to be a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for differences of opinion, Judge Wilkinson certified the case for immediate appellate review. This court granted appellants’ permission to immediately appeal from the order of Commonwealth Court.</p>

While a public prosecutor, Lampi was responsible for investigating complaints against Eastern Dawn. Further, Lampi effectuated a compromise with Eastern Dawn whereby Eastern Dawn agreed to certain practices which would allegedly make it easier for residents of the trailer park to sell their mobile homes. After effectuating the compromise, Lampi issued a formal report finding that Eastern Dawn did not violate the Mobile Home Park Rights Act. Thus, by now attempting to represent appellants in a matter almost identical to that which he investigated while a public employee, Lampi would be accepting private employment on a matter in which he had substantial responsibility as a public employee, thereby violating the mandate of DR 9-101(B).</p>

But Lampi in no respect was acquainted with the present charges against. appellants. Rather, Lampi, a former deputy district attorney of Bucks County, “investigated” past complaints, filed over a year before the present claims, against only one of the appellants, Eastern Dawn.
