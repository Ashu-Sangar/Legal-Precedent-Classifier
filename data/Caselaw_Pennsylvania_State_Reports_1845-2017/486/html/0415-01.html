    <p id="b496-11" data-blocks='[["BL_496.11",496,[252,1289,1146,417]]]'>This appeal flows from the shooting death of Bernard Petti and the shooting of Jessie Wallace in a Philadelphia bar on October 25, 1975. As a result of these incidents, appellant was arrested and tried before a jury and convicted of involuntary manslaughter, aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime. This is a direct appeal from the imposition of the judgments of sentence after the denial of post verdict motions.</p>
    <p id="b496-12" data-blocks='[["BL_496.12",496,[251,1729,1148,576]],["BL_497.1",497,[156,274,1149,455]]]'>The first contention to be considered is appellant’s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdicts. The first witness called by the prosecution was Michael Frazier who testified that at or about 7 o’clock on the evening of the shootings, he observed appellant, appellant’s brother and the deceased with a shotgun. This witness watched as the three men sawed off the barrel of the weapon. One of the victims, Jessie Wallace, testified that at or about 11 p. m., he was in the Hunt Room South Bar when two men entered and walked to the men’s room in the rear of the establishment. He recognized one of the two men as <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>being appellant, as he had seen him on previous occasions in the area. The second man entering with appellant was Petti, the decedent. Petti and appellant emerged from the restroom and appellant grabbed the witness — Wallace— from behind by his collar, placed a gun to his head, and announced that it was a “stickup.” In the ensuing commotion, Petti attempted to run out of the bar and was shot by appellant as he reached the door. Appellant then shot Wallace in the neck.</p>
    <p id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[157,757,1150,572]]]'>A subsequent search of appellant’s home revealed a .38 spent cartridge, blood-stained clothing and an empty box of .38 caliber ammunition. Additionally, when appellant was taken into custody at approximately 1:30 a. m. on October 26, 1975, he admitted going to the bar with Petti and being present when Petti was shot, but denied being responsible for either the shooting of Petti or Wallace. At the time of his apprehension, appellant was suffering from a gunshot wound to his left hand, which a Commonwealth expert medical witness theorized could have occurred when he shot Wallace while holding him by the collar.</p>
    <p id="b497-6" data-blocks='[["BL_497.6",497,[157,1350,1149,511]]]'>The thrust of appellant’s sufficiency challenge is that Wallace’s testimony should be discredited as a matter of law. It is argued that no other witness present at the scene could verify or corroborate Wallace’s testimony, that it was replete with contradictions and omissions, and that it was contradicted by the testimony of other witnesses present during the occurrence. Appellant implicitly concedes that if Wallace’s testimony is legally competent and if believed by the jury, as it apparently was, it would clearly support the verdicts returned in this case.</p>

The detectives were admitted by appellant’s father and appellant now argues that the officers’ entry had not been consensual. It is further contended that the prosecution’s failure to advise the defense of this event prior to trial precluded litigating the legality of this evidence at a pre-trial suppression hearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The fact that the defense was not aware of this evidence until trial is of no legal consequence since the provisions of former Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(b) allowed for the possibility of an evidentiary hearing at the time when the Commonwealth first attempted to introduce this evidence where “the opportunity did not previously exist.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> No request for an evidentiary hearing was made for the purpose of determining whether this “search” was consensual.</p>

Pursuant to <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>that warrant, certain incriminating items were secured which were introduced at trial.

Appellant points to the fact that Wallace could not recall whether the picture of appellant Wallace identified showed appellant wearing a mustache. While these instances might reflect upon the quality of the witness’ powers of observation, they are certainly not contradictions nor do they suggest that this witness’ testimony is so unreliable as to require us as a matter of law to reject it.</p>

This fact in no way detracts from the credit to be given to Wallace’s identification. Both of the witnesses heard the shooting and witnessed the commotion. One of them saw someone holding a man to the floor just before he heard the second shot. This testimony is in conformity with Wallace’s version as to the position he and the appellant were in immediately prior to his being shot. The other witness heard someone refer to a “stickup” which also corroborates Wallace’s testimony. Moreover, even accepting the presence of factual discrepancies in the Commonwealth evidence, would not mandate the result appellant would have us reach, since that fact reflects upon the weight of the evidence not its admissibility. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellee’s argument is premised upon the assumption that the <em>Polimeni-Garcia-Ford </em>trilogy changed prior law. This, we believe, is a false premise.
