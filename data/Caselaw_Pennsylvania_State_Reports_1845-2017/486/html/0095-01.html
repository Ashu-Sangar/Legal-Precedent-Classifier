Not a particle of evidence suggests the retirees improperly induced the overpayments. Indeed, the overpayments were made solely because the Commonwealth mistakenly interpreted the Code.

The class of annuitants is composed of former public school employes and contributors to the Public School Employes’ Retirement System who retired between the years 1968 through 1973 and who had purchased credit for prior out-of-state employment before retiring. The petition stated that the Board had provided the annuitants with a statement of their monthly retirement allowance under the Public School Employes’ Retirement Code of 1959<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> before their retirement, and that the annuitants had received the stated retirement allowance after retirement but only until February of 1974. At that time, the Board notified the annuitants that their compensation for out-of-state employment had erroneously been included in the “final average salary” component of the benefit formula, and that this had resulted in a greater monthly retirement allowance than that to which <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>they were legally entitled. The annuitants were told that their future allowances would be based on a proper computation of benefits. Additionally, the annuitants were asked to contact the Board and make arrangements for the repayment of those funds which had been mistakenly disbursed to them in the past.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.5",177,[167,592,1149,788]]]'>The petition for declaratory judgment requested 1) a determination of whether or not the Board erred as a matter of law in recomputing annuitants’ benefits, and 2) the granting of such relief as may be appropriate. After stipulations to the material facts and cross motions for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court entered an order holding: 1) compensation for out-of-state employment is not a part of the “final average salary” component of the benefit formula; 2) the Board is not estopped from recomputing annuitants’ benefits and correcting its error in the future; and 3) the Board is estopped from taking any action to recover the prior overpayments. Both parties now appeal from this decision; the annuitants challenging the first two portions of the court’s order, and the Board challenging the final portion.</p>

Sections 102(6) and (7) of this Code (24 P.S. §§ 3102(6) and (7)) limit the meaning of the phrase “school employe” to those persons employed by schools which are within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and under the supervision of its Department of Public Instruction and an elected or appointed board<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>.
