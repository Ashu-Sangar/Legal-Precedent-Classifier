Appellants Faust and Brightwell were charged with various offenses including the crimes of murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, and robbery arising out of a robbery of a gas station in the City of Chester in July of 1975. As a result of gunshot wounds sustained during the incident, Stephen Snyder, an attendant at the gas station, died. The preliminary hearing was held on February 14, 1975, and Brightwell was scheduled for trial to commence on June 16, 1975, and Faust’s trial date was set for June 30, 1975. In June of 1974, a petition, filed by the Commonwealth for an extension under Rule 1100(c), was granted and a 90 day extension was given. The trial for both appellants was set for September 22,1975.

On June 7, 1976, appellants petitioned for the dismissal of the charges asserting that Rule 1100 had not been complied with. Judges McGovern and Toal, sitting <em>en bane, </em>heard argument and entered separate orders denying the petitions in their respectively assigned cases. Both judges certified pursuant to Section 501(b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction, Act of 1970,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that the orders involved a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).

Hunt was convicted of murder of the second degree, robbery and other lesser charges for his participation and had agreed to testify as to the involvement of Brightwell and Faust. He did in fact testify against appellants at the preliminary hearing in these matters. At the hearing on the request to remove the <em>nolle prosequi, </em>the Commonwealth produced testimony to establish that Bright-well and Faust had intimidated and threatened Hunt, promising harm to him and his family if he continued to cooperate with the prosecution in the case against appellants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The testimony also indicated that appellants had not only the ability, but also the disposition to accomplish these threats and that the witness’s withdrawal of his cooperation <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>was as a direct result of the fear engendered by these threats.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court had granted two extensions under Rule 1100 whereby the period was finally determined to expire on March 21, 1976. Since the propriety of these extensions are not before us, we must accept that date as the time within which trial was required to be commenced. The testimony also established that the effects of the intimidation first became manifest during a suppression hearing held in August, 1975. <em>See </em>n. 4, <em>supra. </em>The effect of the intimidation caused by appellants continued until March of 1976, n. 4, <em>supra. </em>Thus, the period of delay chargeable to appellants’ acts of intimidation extended from August, 1975 through March, 1976. If this period is deemed not to be chargeable to the Commonwealth, the court’s decision denying the motions to dismiss was clearly correct.</p>

It is asserted that since (d) is silent as to circumstances such as those presented in this case, there is no basis for excluding the challenged period from the time in which trial should have been commenced. An acceptance of such a construction of the Rule would permit a result completely at odds with the purposes sought to be achieved by the promulgation of that Rule.</p>

Paragraph (c) provides for a hearing at which the defendant, as well as the prosecution, can be heard. It also provides that if a continuance is granted, a specific date is to be set before which date trial must commence. In this way, Rule 1100(c) seeks to prevent indefinite postponements.

From this record, it is clear that the Commonwealth requested the entry of the <em>nolle prosequi </em>because it had concluded that a successful prosecution was impossible without the testimony of the prosecution’s main witness. Thus, there was no attempt to gain time but rather the election to apply for the <em>nolle prosequi </em>reflected a determination that further prosecution would be fruitless. The evil addressed in <em>Whitaker, </em>a prosecutor’s attempt to unjustifiably delay trial to enhance its position, is not present where the Commonwealth had no expectation of ever being able to successfully try the appellant at the time that the order of <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered.
