Although at the time it appointed Mr. Levy to represent Ayala and Rodriguez the court was acting under the representation that the dilemma confronting Mr. Ayala was also facing Mr. Rodriguez, this representation was born out both by Mr. Levy’s statement to the court that Mr. Rodriguez faced a substantial likelihood of self-incrimination if he testified, and by Mr. Rodriguez’s subsequent testimony that he would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The trial court is in an awkward position in such a situation. It is forbidden by the state and federal constitutions to inquire too deeply into the basis for the witnesses’ invocation of the privilege for fear that such an inquiry would subvert the very protection sought to be provided. That is, an in-depth inquiry into the basis for the privilege might result in opening the door and thereby waiving the privilege. <em>U. S. v.
