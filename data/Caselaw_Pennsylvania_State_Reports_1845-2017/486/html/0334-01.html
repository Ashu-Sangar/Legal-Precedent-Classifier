    <p id="b416-12" data-blocks='[["BL_416.12",416,[296,1408,1148,898]]]'>Appellant’s first contention is that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain his conviction of first degree murder. This contention is without merit. Although there were no eyewitnesses to the actual killing in question, the circumstantial evidence reveals the following facts: On the evening of October 12, 1975, Ms. Billie Ann Morris was stabbed to death in a vacant lot across the street from 5973 North Lambert Street in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia medical examiner determined upon conducting a post mortem examination of the victim that death resulted from a single stab wound to the left chest area and that the manner of death was homicide. In the absence of actual eyewitness testimony, the Commonwealth presented testimony of three women who were in the company of Ms. Morris immediately before the killing, and testimony of two neighbors who witnessed relevant occurrences in the vacant lot at about the time of the stabbing.</p>

On the evening of October 12, 1975, these four women were present in Ms. Young’s home when appellant arrived and asked to see Ms. Morris. Ms. Young testified that she knew the appellant before that night and that he was a former lover of Ms. Morris. Appellant and Morris conversed briefly, the appellant departed and returned shortly thereafter. After another brief conversation, Ms. Morris and appellant left the house. At that time, the victim was wearing a white shawl. A telephone call from a neighbor caused Ms. Young to venture outside where she observed a pool of blood in the lot. She then proceeded immediately to Germantown Hospital.</p>

Doris Dingle’s testimony corroborated Ms. Young’s testimony; however, Ms. Dingle observed that keys to the victim’s car were found in the puddle of blood. Ms. Dingle testified that she had warned Ms. Morris against leaving with the appellant, and that she had answered her warning by saying, “He will not do anything else to me, he will not hurt me anymore.” Ms. Dingle also testified that on the day before the killing she heard the appellant state: “Women do what I say do, if not I kill them.” This statement was made in the presence of a few women and was apparently directed at Ms. Morris.</p>

She also saw “two silhouettes, one male and one female. The female had a white shawl and got in the car and it drove off.” Ms. Abdulmalik went outside immediately, saw blood on. the lot and then telephoned Ms. Young.</p>

      <p id="b424-7" data-blocks='[["BL_424.7",424,[268,1534,1151,776]]]'>. There is some dispute as to the actual words used by the prosecutor in his closing argument. The Commonwealth contends that the prosecutor said: “made up out of whole cloth” instead of referring to appellant’s denial as a “cold lie”. Following its examination of the trial transcript the Commonwealth filed a motion to correct the written notes of testimony. The trial court granted this motion, ordering a deletion of the term “cold lie” and a substitution of the “whole cloth” language. Appellant challenges the procedure implemented by the Commonwealth to amend the notes of testimony and argues that the action by the trial judge was not in accordance with the Act of May 11, 1911, P.L. 279, 12 P.S. § 1199. Appellant contends that the correction was prejudicial because the words, “cold lie” as they were allegedly spoken, were prejudicial to him. In our view, it makes no difference whether prosecutor referred to appellant’s denial as a cold lie or as made up out of whole cloth. Both versions convey the thought that the denial was a fabrication. However, to insure that appellant will not feel prejudiced by whatever subtle difference he perceives between the two versions, we will proceed as though the words “cold lie” were actually used, as they appear in the original, uncorrected transcript.</p>
