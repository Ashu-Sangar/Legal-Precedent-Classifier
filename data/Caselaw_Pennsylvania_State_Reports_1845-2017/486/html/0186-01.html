The original complaint in this case was filed in the Commonwealth Court by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, appellee and hereinafter “Commonwealth” on January 30, 1975, against Bethlehem Steel Corporation and Sanders and <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>Thomas, Inc., appellant. Both defendants filed preliminary objections and Bethlehem Steel Corporation filed complaints against additional defendants, No. 1 Contracting Corporation and Tensorex Company, Inc. Numerous other papers were subsequently filed by all parties but are not germane to this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[291,593,1148,755]]]'>The underlying facts which gave rise to the initial complaint are as follows. On March 31, 1967, the Commonwealth and Bethlehem Steel entered into a written agreement whereby Bethlehem Steel was to engage the services of a consulting engineer to furnish design plans and drawings for the improvement of the New Street Bridge. Accordingly, Bethlehem retained appellant. The contract for the construction of the bridge was awarded by the Commonwealth to No. 1 Contracting Corporation. Tensorex Company, Inc., then contracted with Bethlehem Steel to submit detail drawings for use by Bethlehem Steel in fabricating the steel members of the bridge. Work commenced and the bridge was opened for traffic on May 29, 1970. The bridge was closed on June 27, 1970, when it was discovered that one of the steel members had buckled.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[292,1376,1146,291]]]'>The sole issue before this Court at this time is whether the Commonwealth Court abused its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for leave to amend its answer with new matter.

On July 24,1978, appellant filed a petition for leave to amend this answer in order to raise the statute of limitations as a defense against the Commonwealth. Appellant based its petition, as it does this appeal, on the fact that the case of <em>Mayle v. Department of Highways, </em><a href="/pa/479/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="479 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1742235" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0384-01">479 Pa. 384</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="479 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1742235" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0384-01">388 A.2d 709</a> (1978) (abolishing sovereign immunity) implicitly removed from the Commonwealth its immunity to the running of the statute of limitations. Appellant contended <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>in its petition to amend, as it does now, that since <em>Mayle </em>was decided on July 14, 1978 and appellant filed the petition to amend on July 21, 1978 to raise an affirmative defense implied by <em>Mayle, </em>the amendment should have been permitted. The Commonwealth Court denied the petition for leave to amend but found it to be a controlling question of law and that an immediate appeal would advance the termination of the matter. Appellant filed for permission to appeal from an interlocutory order and we granted that petition, hence this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[166,795,1148,662]]]'>I note initially that the issue before us is whether appellant should have been permitted to amend its answer by raising a defense and <em>not </em>whether the defense has merit. The two issues are not the .same. It may be that an amendment should be properly denied when it is obvious that the new defense proposed to be raised is frivolous. When, however, the proposed amendment raises a defense which has arguable merit, the merits of the defense should not be decided before the granting of the motion to amend. When a court makes a determination that a particular defense has no merit <em>before </em>it allows the defense to be pleaded, the court is simply giving an advisory opinion on a matter that is not yet in the case.</p>

Appellant’s amendment is not based on a frivolous argument and cannot be called merely a delaying tactic. In its order denying the motion to amend, the Commonwealth Court itself called the question one “to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion.” Appellant seeks to amend to include a new defense which it feels did not exist prior to our decision in <em>Mayle. </em>There is arguable merit to the contention, that <em>Mayle, </em>by stripping away sovereign immunity, affected the sovereign’s immunity to the running of the statute of limitations.</p>

Neither the Commonwealth Court nor any other court has explored in any opinion the constitutionality of immunizing the Commonwealth from a statute <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>of limitation’s defense since this Court’s decision in <em>Mayle. </em>The Commonwealth Court’s order in this case simply states that <em>Mayle </em>did not affect the Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>31 Pa.Cmwlth. 212, <a href="/citations/?q=375%20A.2d%20890" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="375 A.2d 890">375 A.2d 890</a> (1977), hereinafter <em>ARCO. </em>A reading of the <em>ARCO </em>case, however, is of no help whatsoever on the important issue of whether the Commonwealth remains immunized from a statute of limitation’s defense. All that <em>ARCO </em>did was decide that since the Turnpike Commission was <em>not </em>a part of the sovereign, it was subject to a statute of limitation’s defense. The issue in <em>ARCO </em>was entirely different than the issue of whether <em>Mayle </em>still permits the immunization of the Commonwealth from a statute of limitation’s defense.</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[273,987,1146,556]]]'>I most emphatically dissent from (1) the Commonwealth Court’s deciding of a serious constitutional issue when the only issue before it was much simpler — whether to permit an amendment to an answer; (2) the Commonwealth Court’s deciding of the constitutional issue without a plausible rationale except the citation of a case which has nothing to do with whether the Commonwealth, after <em>Mayle, </em>remains immune to a statute of limitation’s defense; (3) this Court’s dismissal of this appeal; and (4) this Court’s refusal to reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order which fails to recognize that <em>Mayle </em>meant what it said — the king is dead.</p>
