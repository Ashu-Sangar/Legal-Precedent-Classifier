The theft occurred in July, 1974. At sentencing, Dean volunteered information implicating appellant as an accomplice. A state trooper who was in the courtroom at the time of sentencing overheard this colloquy between the court and Dean. Later, upon further questioning, Dean advised the trooper that appellant had participated in the theft, that he had split the stolen property and money with Dean, and that he was living with Dean’s sister, Vellora Short, at 535 Rife Street, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Dean described appellant’s automobile as “a white Hornet with the rear end or trunk lid smashed in.”</p>

Mrs. Short, the owner of the premises, then came to the door and in response to the trooper’s request stated that appellant was not there.

Appellant ordered the trooper to “put up his hands” and stated that he was not being taken, that he would not go with the trooper, and that he wanted to see a search warrant. Lingenfelter urged appellant to give up the gun, and ultimately, with Trooper Burke’s assistance secured the revolver.</p>

Indeed, Veloris Dean testified that appellant lived with his (Dean’s) sister, Vellora Short. When called to testify, however, appellant gave as his address a post office box in Rouzerville, Pennsylvania.

The initial inquiry concerns the validity of the arrest warrant. The Commonwealth concedes in its brief that there is not a sufficient showing of probable cause on the face of the affidavit and hence, that the warrant is invalid. We agree, for the reason that the affidavit did not contain sufficient information for the issuing magistrate to independently conclude that probable cause existed for the arrest. <em>Whiteley v.

    <p id="b633-6" data-blocks='[["BL_633.7",633,[174,1170,1151,954]]]'>Given that the warrant is insufficient, we must determine whether there exist any grounds to support a warrant-less arrest. In approaching this question, it is necessary to note 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3904, which gives the police “the same right of arrest without a warrant for any grade of theft as exists or may hereafter exist in the case of the commission of a felony”. It is well established that a warrantless arrest for a felony will be upheld where the police have probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed and that the person to be arrested is the felon. <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em><a href="/pa/450/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="450 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1947071" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0113-01">450 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20213" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="299 A.2d 213">299 A.2d 213</a> (1973). The same rule applies to theft offenses by virtue of 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 3904. However, the right to execute a warrantless arrest within a private dwelling has been strictly curtailed by our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/483/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="483 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1751172" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0293-01">483 Pa. 293</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="483 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1751172" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0293-01">396 A.2d 1177</a> (1978).

    <p id="b635-9" data-blocks='[["BL_635.7",635,[170,1399,1151,683]]]'>In the instant case, the following factors would weigh in favor of upholding the warrantless intrusion. First, the police had a very strong showing of probable cause to arrest appellant. Second, the police had good reason to believe appellant was in the premises, as he was described as living there by Veloris Dean. Also, Dean advised the police that appellant drove a white Hornet with the trunk lid smashed in. A car fitting this description was parked in front of the home at the time the police entered. Moreover, the young child who originally answered the door repeatedly asserted that appellant was in the home. Third, the intrusion at 8:00 p. m. is to be considered a daytime entry.

Even more importantly, there was little need of swift apprehension. The theft had occurred some six months earlier and there was no indication that appellant would escape if not apprehended immediately. Moreover, the entry was forcible; Mrs. Short strongly objected to the trooper’s entry into her home. It is clear that these four factors heavily outweigh the factors supporting the warrantless intrusion and militate against our finding the arrest lawful.

Although appellant was indicted for and the jury instructed as to the charge of recklessly endangering another person, the trial judge further instructed the jury to disregard the recklessly endangering charge in the event that it found appellant, guilty of aggravated assault. Such charge was apparently based on the presumption that recklessly endangering another person is a lesser offense included within aggravated assault. Thus, the jury, upon finding appellant guilty of aggravated assault did not proceed to consider appellant’s guilt or innocence on the recklessly endangering charge. This being the case, we must discharge the appellant. To do otherwise, i. e., remand for resentencing on the recklessly endangering charge, would be to usurp the traditionally sacred function of the jury. Accordingly, appellant is discharged.</p>
