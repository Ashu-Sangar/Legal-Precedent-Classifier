Appellant entered the living room of the house and propped his rifle up against the inside door frame. At this time, Witta was in the living room seated on a love seat, and Ms. Egnatosky. was in the kitchen. Appellant testified that Witta asked him if he had brought the money that appellant owed him, and when appellant replied that he was unemployed, Witta ordered Ms. Egnatosky to get a gun, and he himself pulled a carbine out from under his seat, operated the bolt, and aimed it at appellant. At or about the same time, appellant testified, Ms. Egnatosky entered the living room armed with a sawed-off shotgun. Appellant then started firing his rifle at Witta and Egnatosky. Appellant also testified that he then ransacked the house to give the appearances of a burglary or robbery, because he did not think anyone would believe his self-defense story. On cross-<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>examination, appellant had some difficulty explaining how he turned and retrieved his rifle, which was by the door, and then fired at the victims, who were then supposedly both armed. Expert medical testimony established that Egnatosky died as a result of two bullet wounds to the head, one of which was in the back of her head. Similarly, it was established that Witta was wounded in four places, once in the chest and four times in the head; two of the latter wounds were in the back of the victim’s head. Although the medical expert could not specify the order in which the wounds were sustained, the expert stated that death was caused by chest and brain hemorrhage.</p>

    <p id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.7",601,[168,1517,1151,787]]]'>Appellant called a psychiatrist, who testified that on the day of the shooting, appellant had a schizoid personality and was paranoid; he further stated that on that day, appellant believed he was in danger, acted in panic, and was not able to form a conscious intent to kill.

The <em>Santiago </em>decision is clearly inapposite. First, in <em>Santiago </em>it was clear that the extraneous communication contained highly prejudicial and inflammatory information which would not have been otherwise before the jury. Here there is nothing to suggest that any inflammatory or improper information was conveyed to the jurors during these discussions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Second, in <em>Santiago </em>the information was conveyed to the actual jurors hearing the case during the middle of trial, whereas, here the discussions occurred prior to the selection of the jury, and counsel, during voir dire, had the opportunity to question prospective jurors and determine what, if any, prejudice had been occasioned by the discussions. Additionally, each of the prospective jurors who disclosed on voir dire that they had participated or heard the discussion of the case in the jury room was removed; one for cause by the defense, one by a defense peremptory challenge, and one by a Commonwealth peremptory challenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> It is to be remembered <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>that the constitutional “mandate for a fair and impartial jury does not require that the prospective jurors be free of all knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident which forms the basis of the trial.

Those persons selected for the petit jury stated-that they had not been influenced by the discussions. Accordingly, we believe that this situation does not warrant the creation of a <em>per se </em>rule.

When appellant sought to question a prospective juror, who had admitted to hearing discussion of the case in the jury room, concerning the substance of the discussion, the prosecution objected and that objection was sustained by the court. In so ruling, the court made it clear that counsel could not question the present witness as to what <em>other </em>jurors had said.

Viewing the evidence in light of this standard, the facts are as follows: When appellant was arrested by the State Police, he was given his <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> warnings, and he requested a lawyer. The State Police then turned appellant over to the sheriff, who, early in the booking process, said to appellant, “Hi, Harry. Apparently we have a little problem, and I need to take your photograph.” Appellant replied, “Yeah, I shot those two people.” The sheriff then readvised appellant of his constitutional rights. It is the admissibility of this statement which appellant challenges. There is little doubt that inculpatory statements obtained by police interrogation which are not preceded by proper constitutional warnings are subject to suppression. However, in the instant case, the sheriff’s greeting cannot be characterized as “interrogation,” as we have defined that word. “Interrogation” is police conduct “calculated to, expected to, or likely to evoke admission.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The statement by the sheriff was not of an inquisitive nature; it simply alluded to a “problem” and informed appellant of the need for a photograph. No response was called for, and appellant’s reply was gratuitous.

The trial court’s refusal to declare a mistrial when the jury received a fifteen foot piece of string from the <em>tipstaff </em>during its deliberations <em>without the knowledge of the court or counsel </em>was reversible error. The majority in affirming the trial court’s decision ignores the language of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114 and prior cases of this Court.</p>
    <p id="b606-7" data-blocks='[["BL_606.10",606,[289,926,1150,418]]]'>The majority employs a hindsight test and concludes that the string was “in the jury’s presence for only five minutes and that no demonstration was ever conducted; [the foreman] also stated that the string was not a factor in the jury’s deliberations.” Rather, the guide to be used in determining whether the admission of the fifteen foot piece of string during the jury’s deliberations was reversible error is Pa.R.Crim.P. 1114. Rule 1114 provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="b606-8" data-blocks='[["BL_606.11",606,[333,1366,1108,312]]]'>“Upon retiring for deliberations, the jury shall not be permitted to have a transcript of any trial testimony, nor a copy of any written confession by the defendant, nor a copy of the information or indictment. <em>Otherwise, upon retiring, the jury may take with it such exhibits as the trial judge deems proper.” </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
    <p id="b606-9" data-blocks='[["BL_606.12",606,[290,1703,1150,471]],["BL_607.1",607,[157,282,1149,319]]]'>In the case before us, the provisions of Rule 1114 were ignored. First of all, the <em>trial judge </em>did not decide that the jury could have taken the string with it “upon retiring.” Instead, the decision was made by an employee of the court, a tipstaff, after the jury had retired. The Rule does not delegate the judge’s decision to anyone else, and the timing of the decision should occur before the jury retires. Second, the piece of string was not an “exhibit” properly introduced into evidence during the trial. Neither defense counsel nor <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>the prosecution had the opportunity to examine the accuracy, authenticity, or relevancy of the string. Third, neither defense nor the prosecution had the opportunity to challenge the admissibility of the piece of string into evidence. These factors outlined above are protections afforded to the defendant when the provisions of Rule 1114 are followed.</p>
    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.5",607,[156,627,1155,713]]]'>Additionally, this Court has said that the better procedure is “not to allow exhibits into the jury room which would require expert interpretation.” <em>Commonwealth v. Pitts, </em><a href="/pa/450/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="450 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1947070" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0359-01">450 Pa. 359</a>, 363, n.1, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20646" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="301 A.2d 646">301 A.2d 646</a>, 650 n.1 (1973). Appellant argued at trial that the direction and angle of the shots supported the defendant’s version of the facts, and if the string was to be used to establish the direction and angle of the shots, appellant’s counsel could have presented an expert opinion on this issue. Even if we accept the foreman’s statement that no demonstration was conducted, how can it be said that some juror was not affected by seeing the string. After all, the jury asked for a <em>fifteen foot piece of string. </em>Why?</p>
    <p id="b607-6" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[151,1379,1154,541]]]'>This Court has said that the propriety of the trial court’s decision to allow the jury to have exhibits with them during deliberations should be examined in relationship to the issues raised during trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Riggins, </em><a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">478 Pa. 222</a>, 233, <a href="/pa/478/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="478 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1740538" data-case-paths="/pa/478/0222-01">386 A.2d 520</a>, 525 (1978). When applying this standard, it is obvious that the piece of string could have affected a juror’s resolution of an important issue in the case. Accordingly, I must dissent from the trial court’s refusal to declare a mistrial. Judgment of sentence should be reversed and appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>
