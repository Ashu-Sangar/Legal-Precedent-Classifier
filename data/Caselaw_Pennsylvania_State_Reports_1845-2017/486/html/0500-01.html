Petitioner Helen Babula Kartorie applied for admission to our Bar on motion under Pa.B.A.R. 204. The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners denied the application because Ms. Kartorie did not satisfy Rule 204’s requirement of graduation from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The record reveals that petitioner attend<a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>ed an unaccredited law school in Ohio from September 1934 to June 1938. The law school was not accredited by the A.B.A. until 1957, nineteen years after petitioner’s graduation. Petitioner has appealed to this Court requesting admission to the Bar without examination, although she did not graduate from an A.B.A. accredited law school as required by Rule 204.

A state board of bar examiners could hardly perform this important function. The first set of standards for law school accreditation was adopted at the A.B.A.’s 1918 Annual Meeting, and in 1921 the A.B.A. commenced the accreditation program. Today the A.B.A. draws upon the time and experience of law school teachers and deans, practitioners, and judges in its inspection, evaluation, and accreditation of the nation’s institutions of legal learning. Law schools which have been provisionally accredited are inspected annually, and accredited schools are regularly reinspected. The standards by which the law schools are accredited are comprehensive, thorough, and contemporary.
