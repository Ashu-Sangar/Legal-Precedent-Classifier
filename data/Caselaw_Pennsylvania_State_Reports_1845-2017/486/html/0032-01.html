Death was caused by a single gunshot wound to the back of the head, fired from a distance of no greater than eighteen inches. The victim had been shot by a .25 caliber pistol. A pathologist was unable to set an exact time of death, but estimated that death occurred between 6:15 p. m. and 1:04 a. m. on the evening of February 11 and the early morning hours of February 12, 1976. The pathologist did opine that death appeared to be closer to 6:15 p. m. rather than the later time. The victim had been shot near the door between the garage and the downstairs gameroom and then was dragged about fifteen feet in a series of movements to a spot between the rear of his car and the garage door. A recent bloodstain consistent with the trail of the victim’s blood was found on the lip of the trunk of the victim’s car, indicating that someone had tried to place the body in the trunk of the car. A sliding glass door to the outside, off the downstairs gameroom, was open approximately eight to eighteen inches with no signs of forcible entry. No footprints were found on the ground outside the open door. According to appellant, the only items missing from the home were $40 or $50 in poker money and a .25 caliber automatic pistol. The <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>victim’s ring, watch and wallet, containing $46, were found untouched on his person.</p>

Appellant had a luncheon date with John Lindemulder, a Pittsburgh area radio personality, at the Sewickley Holiday Inn. Appellant’s two children, Dawn, age twelve, and “Cricket,” age nine, had been waiting outside the locked home approximately fifteen minutes when appellant arrived home from her lunch date at 4:00 p. m. Appellant told her daughters that Lindemulder was a man from the parking garage who drove her home because her car had broken down. Appellant later admitted that she left her car at Allegheny Center, in the northside of Pittsburgh, where she had met Lindemulder, and returned home without her car because she knew the girls would be locked out of the house.</p>

She also testified that the victim told her that he had a business meeting, after which he would return home so that the family could go to dinner to celebrate appellant’s birthday. According to appellant, her husband told her that should he be late, he would meet her and the girls at the HuKeLau Restaurant. Gilmore Wheeler, the other party to the business meeting, testified that he was unaware of the late night meeting. According to appellant, when her husband had not returned by 7:00 p. m., she called a cab and left for the restaurant with her daughters. The trio returned home at 9:40 p. m. Appellant stated that Mr. DeJohn’s absence did not worry her, as he had been late in the past because of business meetings.

Telephone company records indicated that the neighbor’s telephone was in use between 6:07 p. m. and 6:11 p. m. Further, a parking ticket was found on the victim’s body which indicated he had left the airport parking lot at 5:23 p. m. An Allegheny County Detective later made the same drive from the airport to the DeJohn residence, leaving at 5:23 p. m., and arriving at 6:05 p. m.</p>

As it turned out, appellant was doing a poor job, having missed the last two house mortgage payments, with other indebtedness of $9,000 to $10,000. To obtain money, appellant had signed her husband’s name on a loan application at a local bank, to obtain money to pay back $3,000 she owed to an employee of their home builder. The employee testified that he threatened to go to Mr. DeJohn before appellant repaid the loan. Further, appellant admitted attempting to extort $5,000 from a neighbor. Moreover, Mr. DeJohn had submitted a letter of resignation from his job and appellant knew of this.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It was stipulated that Mr. DeJohn was insured for $201,000, with appellant being the primary beneficiary.</p>

After having been away all day and intending to go out to dinner to celebrate a birthday, the jury could find it incredulous that Mr. DeJohn would remain in the garage almost an hour while his wife and two children left for dinner. Further, witnesses testified that because of DeJohn’s background in the military, a stranger would not have been able to shoot DeJohn from pointblank range in the back of the head.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[178,807,1148,361]]]'>While the defense argued that DeJohn possibly confronted a burglar or a robber, the jury may have rejected this theory as implausible for three reasons. First, there was no sign of forced entry anywhere in the house. Second, it is unlikely a burglar or robber would delay his flight after killing DeJohn to drag his body across the garage floor. Third, the victim’s watch, ring and wallet, containing $46, were untouched.</p>

The pathologist testified that DeJohn died between 6:00 p. m. and 1:00 a. m., but in his opinion closer to 6:00 p. m. Appellant had a motive, as she had mismanaged the financial affairs of the family. In an attempt to raise some money, appellant had attempted to extort money from a neighbor and had signed her husband’s signature on a bank loan application. Appellant also knew her husband was thinking of quitting his job. As the victim’s life was insured in appellant’s favor for $201,000, appellant certainly had a motive to kill her husband.</p>

Eventually, appellant became a prime suspect. On February 25, 1976, officials of the McKnight Road Office of Mellon Bank were served with a “court subpoena,” which demanded “copies of all information pertaining to accounts, or application for account, made by Jill and/or Michael DeJohn of 492 Woodland Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237 (Ross Township)”. The document further provided that “copies of records ... be turned over to County Detectives.” On February 27, 1976, a second “subpoena” was issued on the same parties, demanding “all original records pertaining to personal cash reserve account application, and original new account card for Michael and Jil DeJohn. . . .” The subpoena ordered “These records ... be turned over to Lt. Guthrie, Ross Township Police Department.” Each “subpoena” bore the signature of Wayne Kelly, Clerk of Courts, and contained an admonition that “Failure to [comply with the subpoena] may subject you to fine and/or imprisonment.” Pursuant to these two documents, police obtained the cancelled check used to purchase the typewriter on which the extortion note had been typed and other evidence which indicated that appellant had signed her husband’s signature on a loan application.</p>

On this theory, only unsuccessful attempts to raise funds would provide appellant with a motive for murder; successful attempts would be irrelevant. And yet, arguing that it fell within the “motive exception,” the prosecution introduced evidence meant to show that three months before DeJohn’s death, appellant successfully obtained a bank loan by forging her husband’s signature on the loan application. The evidence of deceit in the bank transaction could serve only to impeach appellant’s character and improperly prejudice the jury against appellant. Given the inapplicability of the Commonwealth’s theory of motive to this successful attempt at raising funds, it is clear that the prejudicial effect of the evidence of forgery significantly outweighed its probative value. The evidence of forgery was not relevant and its introduction constituted reversible. error.</p>

The Commonwealth argues that the failure of this attempt to raise funds provoked the killing. But the Commonwealth has failed to <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>present any evidence that the victim’s expected response to disclosure of his financial situation would have been in any way so extraordinary as to provoke his wife to murder him to avoid it. Evidence of prior crimes is only admissible where there is a logical connection between the two crimes such that knowledge of the perpetrator of the former establishes the perpetrator of the latter. E.g., <em>Stanley, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em><a href="/pa/484/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="484 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1753711" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0374-01">484 Pa. 374</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="484 Pa. 374" data-case-ids="1753711" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0374-01">399 A.2d 123</a> (1979). The record does not establish that appellant and her husband had an unsuccessful marriage, or that the debts of the DeJohns were caused by appellant alone. Rather, it appears from the record that the difficult financial position of appellant and her husband arose from the relatively extravagant spending habits shared by husband and wife. On this record there is no logical connection between the two crimes of which appellant was accused. Thus the extremely prejudicial evidence of attempted extortion is not relevant to determining the identity of the murderer of Michael DeJohn and its admission also was reversible error.</p>

Because the majority addresses this question, however, I wish to note my disagreement with the majority’s analysis. Certainly bank customers have standing to challenge the introduction of bank records into evidence against them. The nature of the commercial relationship between banks and their customers is such that a customer’s interest in the integrity of his bank account is in my view something less than a constitutional right of privacy and something more than a confidential relationship. What is necessary to protect the interests of all involved is a rule not only in harmony with the economic and commercial necessities of today, but one which is sensitive, as well, to the legitimate needs of those charged with enforcing the laws for access to commercial banking records.

In <em>Mapp, </em>several police officers went to Miss Mapp’s residence, allegedly searching for a bombing suspect, and demanded entrance. On the advice of her attorney, she refused to let them in without a warrant. Several hours later, seven police officers forcibly broke into the residence over the objections of the attorney who was present by that time (and who the officers would not permit to see his client), ransacked the entire residence, physically man-handled Miss Mapp, and seized evidence totally unrelated to the bombing incident. While one of the officers held up a paper claimed to be a warrant, no warrant was ever introduced at trial and there was “serious doubts” whether one ever existed.

DeJohn, was convicted of fatally shooting her husband, Michael DeJohn in the garage of their home on February 11, 1976. Yet, there is no evidence that she was even present in the garage at the time the shooting took place. The prosecution and the majority of this Court conclude that the evidence was sufficient on a theory that the defendant had to be the guilty party because she was <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>the only adult in the home at the time the victim was shot. That theory, however, in this case, is riddled with holes. The evidence in this case establishes that the shooting <em>could have </em>taken place when only the victim and the defendant were in the home, but it also establishes that the shooting <em>could have </em>taken place when the defendant was not at home. The evidence does not even establish that the victim <em>entered the garage </em>while the defendant was in the home. It is true that witnesses saw the victim’s car enter the driveway at about 6:10 p. m., but no one saw the car enter the garage at that time. It is sheer speculation to conclude that the victim’s automobile was driven into the garage immediately after he pulled into the driveway. The two witnesses who saw the car did not know whether the car had been driven into the garage. One of the witnesses, a neighbor, stated that from his vantage point, he lost sight of the car after it entered the driveway and he could not testify whether the car entered the garage. The other witness, a newsboy, did not testify that he saw the car go into the garage. The car may have been driven into the garage at that time, or the driver of the car may have parked the car outside at that time, or the driver of the car may have left the scene after having driven into the driveway, and returned later. Any one of these events could have happened and there is absolutely no evidence from which it can be inferred that one event rather than any of the other two actually happened. Nor can we assume from the evidence or our common experience that the car being driven into the garage immediately after it enters a driveway is more highly probable than not. Our common knowledge would probably indicate otherwise. It may be that more cars are left outside of garages rather than put into garages when one arrives at home. The majority’s entire case rests on the conclusion that the victim’s car was driven into the garage immediately after his entry into the driveway. No evidence points to this fact. It is sheer speculation. Yet, that speculative fact is essential to the prosecution’s theory that if two people are in the same room at the same time when one of them is shot, it may be inferred that the survivor shot the victim.</p>

    <p id="b157-9" data-blocks='[["BL_157.10",157,[146,1676,1148,410]]]'>In the majority opinion, this Court held that although appellant had a legitimate expectation of privacy in her bank records and thus had standing to challenge their admissibility, appellant had waived her rights to challenge this same evidence and the fruits thereof as to her attempted evidence conviction. <em>Commonwealth v. DeJohn, </em>486 Pa. 32, 403 A.2d 1283 (1979). However, this issue was not waived.</p>
    <p id="b157-10" data-blocks='[["BL_157.11",157,[148,2118,1145,194]],["BL_158.1",158,[304,281,1146,687]]]'>While the bank check used to purchase the typewriter was not introduced at appellant’s trial for attempted extortion, appellant did file a motion to suppress this evidence and the other evidence obtained from the information on the check— <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>the fruits of the illegal subpoena. This motion was denied. Although at trial appellant did not object to the reference to the check used to purchase the typewriter, appellant continues to preserve the issue by objecting to the introduction of the typewriter and the bill of sale for the typewriter — the fruits obtained illegally. In this Court, appellant, as she had done at every stage of the proceeding, argued that the typewriter and bill of sale for the typwriter were “fruits of the poisonous tree” — the check — and were not admissible. Under these circumstances the issue of the use of the inadmissible evidence to obtain the conviction should be reconsidered. Appellant’s petition for reargument as to this issue should be granted.</p>
