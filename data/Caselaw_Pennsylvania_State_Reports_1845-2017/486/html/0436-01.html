On September 30, 1978, a vacancy was created on the Allentown City Council when one of its members resigned. Two weeks later, on October 16, 1978, the remaining six members of the seven member council convened to elect a person to the vacancy. Appellant was nominated for the vacancy. A resolution proposing appellant as a member of city council was voted upon with three votes for appellant, two against him, and one abstention. One of the appellees, Alton W. Frey, as the president of city council, refused to certify that appellant had been elected. Frey ruled that, four affirmative votes, a majority of the total membership of city council, were necessary for election — not three votes.</p>

This is true even if more than the quorum number is present at the meeting. For example, if there are seven members of a body and four of those members constitute a quorum and attend a meeting, a majority of the four, which would be three, is necessary to take official action of any kind. Even if all seven members, more than the necessary quorum of four, attend the meeting, the same number of votes, namely three, is all that is necessary to take official action if that is the highest number of votes cast (plurality) in a given matter. Thus, if the minimum quorum of four is present, and the vote on a particular proposal is 3 in favor and 1 against, the proposal is adopted. If all seven members of the body attend and the vote on a particular proposal is 3 in favor, 1 against and 3 abstentions, the proposal is likewise adopted by the plurality vote. Cf. <em>United States v. Ballin, </em><a href="/us/144/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="144 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3560279" data-case-paths="/us/144/0001-01">144 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/144/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="144 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3560279" data-case-paths="/us/144/0001-01">12 S.Ct. 507</a>, <a href="/us/144/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="144 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="3560279" data-case-paths="/us/144/0001-01">36 L.Ed. 321</a> (1892) (statute lawfully enacted where vote in House of Representatives was 138 yeas, 0 nays, and 189 not voting). Under this common law rule, in a seven-person body, the highest number of votes necessary to take official action is not dependent upon the fortuity of whether 4, 5, 6, or 7 members choose to attend the meeting so long as the minimum quorum number is present. If the rule were otherwise, a member could attend <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>the meeting and abstain from voting and have a different effect than if that person were absent from the meeting. The common law rule does not permit a member to attend and abstain from voting and yet demand that the highest number of votes required to take official action be more than if that member had been absent. This Court has previously observed that a member who attends a meeting and abstains can have the same paralytic effect as one who is absent:</p>

We do not agree. In addition to the language <em>“fill such vacancy” </em>there appears the language <em>“by electing a qualified person.” </em>If the legislature intended that the words <em>“majority of its remaining members </em>” shall <em>“fill such vacancy </em>” to mean the number of votes required rather than a reference to the collective group which has the authority to fill the vacancy, there would have been no need to add the words <em>“by electing a qualified person.” </em>Read in context, the reference to <em>a majority of the remaining members </em>appears to be a quorum requirement. At least a majority of the remaining members must be in attendance for a quorum to conduct business.</p>

In the second paragraph when there remains only one, two, or three members of council, vacancies are filled in a specified manner “until a bare majority of the members of council have been qualified,” which is four members. The paragraph then states that the four members must be present at the meeting to fill the. remaining three vacancies but significantly only a majority of the four members, which would be three, is necessary to fill the remaining three vacancies.</p>

We can <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>perceive of no reason to justify such a different result under paragraph one and paragraph two.</p>
