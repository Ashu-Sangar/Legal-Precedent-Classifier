Instead, it is the nature of the office, the powers wielded, and the responsibilities carried out that are the key considerations. Thus, although a county solicitor was not a public officer within the meaning of the constitutional provision involved in <em>Foreman, </em>we had earlier held that district attorneys were public officers within the meaning of that section. <em>Lennox v.

He cannot assay the likelihood that the frustration of a client’s cause may lead to recriminations and, ultimately, litigation; he cannot weigh the threat to his own energies and assets posed by the likelihood of suit; he cannot analyze the litigious propensities of his client; he cannot even consider the merits of his client’s case, and if these assessments are not favorable, tell him to find another lawyer.</p>
