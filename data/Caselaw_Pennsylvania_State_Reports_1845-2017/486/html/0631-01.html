The decree ordered the payment of a family exemption pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3121 to Marjorie A.

Otteni.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The facts as found by the orphans’ court support the granting of the exemption and, accordingly, the decree is affirmed.</p>

The only issue concerning the mother’s entitlement to the exemption, therefore, was whether decedent and his mother were members of the same household at the time of decedent’s death.</p>
    <p id="b711-5" data-blocks='[["BL_711.6",711,[174,803,1151,779]]]'>The orphans’ court judge heard extensive testimony on this question and originally refused to grant the exemption. Written exceptions were filed and the same judge, upon reconsideration, sustained the exceptions. Competent evidence showed that during the last months of his life the decedent had his own room in his mother’s house, took most of his meals there and slept there most nights. The judge found that during this period the decedent “spent the vast majority of his time with his mother and her husband in a family relationship,” and concluded that they “were members of the same household at the time of the decedent’s death . . ..” Because the orphans’ court judge’s findings are supported by adequate and competent evidence they are controlling on our review. <em>McCrea Estate, </em><a href="/pa/475/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="475 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1734079" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0383-01">475 Pa. 383</a>, 386-87, <a href="/pa/475/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="475 Pa. 383" data-case-ids="1734079" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0383-01">380 A.2d 773</a>, 775 (1977).</p>
