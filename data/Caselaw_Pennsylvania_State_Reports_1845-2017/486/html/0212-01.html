The jury found appellant guilty of murder of the third degree and possessing instruments of crime. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison for the conviction of murder of the third degree and two and one-half to five years on the instruments of crime conviction, both sentences to be concurrent.

On December 23, 1975, appellant and decedent, Edward Carter, were drinking alcoholic beverages during the day. The testimony indicates a quantity of wine and large quantities of whiskey were consumed by appellant, decedent and a mutual friend, “Mr. Lumpkin.” At approximately 6:00 p. m., Roberta Johnson, decedent’s paramour, helped decedent upstairs to the bedroom. Johnson’s assistance was necessary as Carter was intoxicated. Both Carter and Johnson lie on the bed, Johnson watching television and Carter sleeping. Appellant entered the room, attempted to wake up Carter, <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>and complained that Carter was involved with “his woman.” During this argument, Johnson left the bedroom, but asked Lumpkin to go up to the bedroom to watch decedent and appellant. Upon .her return to the bedroom, Johnson was asked by Lumpkin to call the police. She entered the room and saw Carter on the couch. He had sustained stab wounds of the stomach and leg, which caused his death.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As Johnson went to the house next door to call police, she noticed appellant leaving the house where the stabbing had occurred. She saw him drop a kitchen knife and then retrieve it. Subsequently, when the police arrived at the scene of the Carter slaying appellant returned to the house and attempted to conceal the knife in a flower pot. The knife was found by the police and it was later determined the knife had human blood on it. Appellant was then arrested. The arresting and interrogating officers both testified that although appellant’s breath did smell of alcohol, his reflexes and ability to understand and discuss events surrounding the stabbing appeared unimpaired.</p>

Suppose again the only explanation he has to offer is that he was voluntarily drunk at the time and did not know what he was doing, the evidence indicating that he staggered away from the bar where he had been over-indulging and walked out into the street still clutching the glass from which he had been drinking, but too befuddled by liquor to know he was holding anything in his hand, — and when the glass was taken from him by the apprehending officer D stared at it blankly with no idea where it came from. The actus reus of larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another. D has done this and his voluntary intoxication is no excuse, but the facts stated fail to establish larceny.’ (Footnotes omitted). Perkins, Criminal Law, ch. 8, § 3 at 788 (1957).</p>

    <p id="b298-13" data-blocks='[["BL_298.13",298,[288,1618,1148,362]]]'>The trial court’s instruction on voluntary manslaughter erroneously precluded the jury from even considering evidence of appellant’s intoxication. The majority holds that this instruction misstated the law but nevertheless denies relief on the spurious theory that because appellant was convicted of murder of the third degree the trial court’s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I dissent.</p>
    <p id="b298-14" data-blocks='[["BL_298.14",298,[288,2001,1147,309]],["BL_299.1",299,[170,266,1149,410]]]'>The trial court instructed the jury that as to the charge of involuntary manslaughter evidence of appellant’s intoxication “would be no party [sic] whatever of your reasoning, and you must as to that determination dismiss all evidence of his intoxication from your consideration.” This erroneous instruction incorrectly and improperly circumscribed the <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>jury’s consideration. That the jury returned a verdict of murder of the third degree in no way lessens the possibility that the court’s error diverted the jury from a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. But for the trial court’s error, the jury might have found that the intoxication evidence justified a compromise verdict, of voluntary manslaughter even if the jury believed that evidence insufficient to justify acquittal.</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[172,709,1148,462]]]'>Appellant clearly was entitled to a charge on voluntary manslaughter which correctly and completely expressed the law. E. g., <em>Commonwealth v. Musselman, </em><a href="/pa/483/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="483 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1751298" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0245-01">483 Pa. 245</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="483 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1751298" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0245-01">396 A.2d 625</a> (1979). Having found the trial court’s instructions on voluntary manslaughter to be defective, this Court may not overlook a recognized possibility of harm which could arise from that error. The trial court’s acknowledged error in this case was far from harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>
