I concede that this Court’s decision in <em>McNair’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/324/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="324 Pa. 48" data-case-ids="1171378" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0048-01">324 Pa. 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.%20496" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="187 A. 496">187 A. 496</a> (1936), does give some support to the view that judicial immunity in this jurisdiction may immunize the judicial officer from criminal conduct, so long as the officer was acting in good faith. However, this decision offers no authority for extending that protection to quasi-judicial officers. Further, the validity of the <em>McNair </em>holding is in question in light of our recent decision in <em>Dubree v. Commonwealth, </em>supra.</p>

It should be noted that petitioners at this point have not had a preliminary hearing, or an indictment or information issued against them. Remedies such as habeas corpus and motions to quash or dismiss were clearly available to allow this objection to be raised and considered <em>before the petitioners would have been exposed to trial. </em>Following the normal proceeding would have insured that if the question was ultimately brought to this Court for resolution, then we would have had the benefit of the thinking of the court below and the <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>refinement of the issues that the traditional appellate process is designed to provide.</p>
