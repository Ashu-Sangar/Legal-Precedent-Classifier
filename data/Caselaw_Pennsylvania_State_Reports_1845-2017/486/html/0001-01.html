What is in dispute is the proper disposition of trust income unlawfully accumulated between the dates Holdeen created the trusts and entry of the orphans’ court decree. The orphans’ court, in accordance with Holdeen’s express direction to pay “all other net income hereunder which is not lawfully subject to accumulation” to the UUA, instructed the trustees to pay all accumulated income to the UUA. In directing disposition of unlawfully accumulated income in harmony with Holdeen’s express wishes, the orphans’ court observed:</p>

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>We conclude that the orphans’ court’s declaration invalidating the accumulation provisions as of inception of the trusts is proper. The mere fact that the adjudication of invalidity comes years after existence of circumstances justifying termination is simply the result of the failure of an interested party to bring the matter before the court. That failure, however, does not make an otherwise invalid accumulation somehow permissible. In <em>James Estate, </em>supra, this Court expressly held an adjudication of invalidity need await only the existence of circumstances making invalidity “readily apparent.” <a href="/pa/414/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="414 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1890361" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0080-01">414 Pa. at 85</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="199 A.2d 275">199 A.2d at 277</a>. As Judge Pawalec fully explained here, “[a]n accumulation scheme cannot ‘become’ unreasonable in duration; its duration either is or is not reasonable per se.” It follows from <em>James </em>that just as a court can anticipate the inevitable unlawfulness of a provision for accumulation, so too the court may declare the provision invalid as of the time invalidity was “readily apparent.” The Commonwealth does not claim that UUA, to the Commonwealth’s prejudice, caused postponement of the court’s declaration of invalidity and accompanying instructions concerning unlawful accumulations. Compare e. g., <em>Rose v. Rose, </em><a href="/pa/385/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="385 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="1267059" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0427-01">385 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20693" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="123 A.2d 693">123 A.2d 693</a> (1956) (laches argued as defense in proceedings for declaratory relief).

Underlying the Commonwealth’s contention is the assumption that the Holdeen charitable accumulation schemes are governed by statutory limitations upon accumulation of income. See Act of April 18, 1853, P.L’ 503, § 9; Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, § 6. <em>James </em>made clear, however, that judicial inquiry into the reasonableness of charitable accumulations is of common law dimension. See <em>James, </em><a href="/pa/414/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="414 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1890361" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0080-01">414 Pa. at 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="199 A.2d 275">199 A.2d at 280</a> (disposition of released income <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>guided but not governed by Estates Act of 1947). Though <em>James </em>scrutinized provisions for accumulation contained in a testamentary charitable trust, its common law principle of judicial intervention once invalidity is “readily apparent,” <em>James, </em><a href="/pa/414/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="414 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1890361" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0080-01">414 Pa. at 85</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="199 A.2d 275">199 A.2d at 277</a>, supports the orphans’ court declaration of invalidity from inception of the trusts. Accord, Restatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers §§ 2.2(1) &amp; 2.2(2) (Tent. Draft No. 2, March 15, 1979) (accumulation provisions of non-charitable trusts to be measured with reference to rule against perpetuities; charitable trusts subject to standard of reasonableness “in the light of the purposes, facts and circumstances of the particular trust”). This claim of the Commonwealth, too, must be rejected.</p>

Nothing in <em>James </em>would justify disturbing Holdeen’s express direction. It is true that in <em>James </em>this. Court fashioned the relief .of income payments on a current basis to the single beneficiary on whose behalf the settlor directed accumulation. <em>James </em>did so, however, solely • because this relief most closely effectuated the settlor’s overall charitable plan. <a href="/pa/414/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="414 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1890361" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0080-01">414 Pa. at 90-91</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20275" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="199 A.2d 275">199 A.2d at 279-80</a>. Here, Holdeen’s charitable plan is clearly stated. His primary goal, of course, was to prove to governments of the world the viability of “cumulative endowments.” Indeed, he selected Pennsylvania, rather than his home state, as the forum for his experiment in the hope of obtaining more ready judicial sanction of his primary plan. But Holdeen realistically recognized the possibility that his experiment would not be favorably received and planned accordingly. He expressly directed payment of income “not lawfully subject to accumulation” to the UUA. The Commonwealth now respects Holdeen’s expressly manifested alternative charitable plan and does not claim future trust income. We are offered no persuasive reason why Holdeen’s <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>express alternative plan should not be given full effect.
