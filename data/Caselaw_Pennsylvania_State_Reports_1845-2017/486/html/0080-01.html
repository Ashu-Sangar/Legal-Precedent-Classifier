It is <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>clear that the legislative language of Act 223 provides a salary increase and is not in any respect designed to create a “cost-of-living” adjustment. Indeed, the express terms of Act 223 establish with unmistakable clarity an increase in salaries to be effective October 7,1976 “when permitted,” in the words of the Legislature, “by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” This clear and specific language articulates the Legislature’s respect for the boundaries of its own authority, including the limitation of article III, § 27 on the power to increase salaries. Moreover, had the Legislature in Act 223 intended anything other than a salary increase, it would not have utilized a single, specific dollar increase, the traditional legislative means of increasing salaries. Act 223, if presently applied to plaintiffs, would provide a single salary increase of $3,000 in October, 1976, with no increase thereafter during the remaining three and one-fourth years of plaintiffs’ terms. This increase of $3,000 is applicable to each row officeholder without relation to existing salaries. For example, the Coroner of Lehigh County receives a salary of $13,000, while the other plaintiffs receive $17,500. Yet Act 223, if applied to plaintiffs, would provide each officeholder the same $3,000 increase. Unlike other plaintiffs, who receive a seventeen per cent increase, the Coroner would receive an increase greater than twenty-three per cent. This fixed increase of $3,000, for officers receiving salaries of $13,000 or $17,500, directly refutes any suggestion that the Legislature in Act 223 sought to establish, as plaintiffs claim, a “cost-of-living” adjustment.</p>

On this record, we need not address whether Act 223 or the Charter governs plaintiffs’ salaries as of January, 1978. For the reasons already set forth, Act 223 <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>does not grant plaintiffs a salary increase during their terms of office, and the Charter expressly prohibits plaintiffs’ request. See Charter, § 203(d); see also, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20800" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="122 A.2d 800">id.,</a> § 205 (“[a]ny change in salary shall not become applicable to any incumbent elected officer until the commencement of a new term of office”).</p>

In reality, plaintiffs are asking this Court to fashion what this Court, rather than the Legislature, views to be a proper salary for county officers, a judgment this Court is without authority to make and one wholly within the exclusive constitutional province of the General Assembly. “There is no question but that the determining of such compensation for such officers is a legislative matter, and one the legislature cannot delegate.” <em>Potter County Commissioners’ Salary Case, </em><a href="/pa/350/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="350 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="461123" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0141-01">350 Pa. 141</a>, 144, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%2075" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="38 A.2d 75">38 A.2d 75</a>, 77 (1944) (voiding under Pa.Const. art. XIV, § 5 (1874) act authorizing court of common pleas of any county reduced in classification to fix salaries of county commissioners). See Pa.Const. art. IX, § 4, ¶ 3 (1968). The Legislature has expressly admonished that Act 223 applies “when permitted by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” thus emphasizing the traditional presumption that the Legislature does not intend an unconstitutional result. 1 Pa.C. S.A. § 1922(3) (Supp.1978). Proper recognition of legislative and judicial functions requires this Court to reject plaintiffs’ invitation to increase, on any theory, county officers’ salaries fixed by the Legislature.</p>
