First, the Commonwealth contends that the court’s failure to use the standard language “feloniously and with malice aforethought” should not render an otherwise valid colloquy improper. The error of the Commonwealth’s argument is that the colloquy was not otherwise valid. The court was free to conduct the colloquy in language of its choice. Whatever words the court chose, however, it had to tell appellant that malice was an element of a crime for <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>which his plea would make him liable and ensure that appellant understood the meaning of malice.

These admissions cannot serve to relieve the trial court of its obligation to inform appellant of the nature of the charges. The admissions establish only the factual basis necessary for a valid guilty plea. See Comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319; <em>Commonwealth v. Chumley, </em>supra. They do not reveal that appellant understood the concept of malice. <em>Commonwealth v. Ingram, </em>supra.</p>

The Commonwealth’s position both contradicts the law and misses the essence of appellant’s contention. Inquiry into the existence of malice is necessary whenever an accused pleads guilty to murder, in order to establish a factual basis for the plea. See Comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319. Moreover, appellant’s point is that, regardless of the propriety of an inquiry into the existence of malice, the court did not provide the required explanation of the element of malice.</p>
