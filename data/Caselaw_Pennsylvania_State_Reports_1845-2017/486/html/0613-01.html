The petition alleged that appellant, Amanda’s mother, failed to perform parental duties for a period of time in excess of six months and thus should have her parental rights involuntarily terminated under section 311(1) of the 1970 Adoption Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> After a hearing on the matter, the lower court entered a decree, on August 9, 1978, which terminated appellant’s parental rights and awarded custody of the child to appellee until such time as she is adopted. Appellant, thereupon, filed timely exceptions to the decree of the Orphans’ Court. By order of the court en banc, these exceptions were dismissed, and this direct appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>The record established that Amanda Green was born to appellant and her husband, Carter T. Green, on March 19, 1965. At some period of time during her pregnancy, appellant became a patient at Mayview State Hospital, and she was not released therefrom until some six or seven months after the birth of her daughter. On April 21, 1965, the infant was adjudicated a “dependent” by the Juvenile Court of Allegheny County and, thereupon she was placed in the care of a foster home, supervision of which was transferred to Child Welfare Services, an agency of the appellee, on January 2, 1969. Amanda has lived in this foster home from shortly following her birth until the present time. After appellant was discharged from Mayview State Hospital, she began to visit with her daughter. Her contacts with Amanda were infrequent and sporadic, up to and including the period of time upon which appellee’s petition for involuntary termination of parental rights was predicated.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> According to appellee’s petition: “from March, 1975 until December 14, 1976 [appellant] failed to visit the child or send any gifts, cards or letters to the child. During this time the mother did not financially support the child nor did she perform any parental duties whatsoever.” [Petition, paragraph 6].</p>

This same testimony revealed that appellant neither contributed to Amanda’s support nor did she send cards, gifts, or letters to the child to compensate for her absence. As to the <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>absence of contact with the child during the period set forth in appellee’s petition, appellant justified her failure to visit by testifying that despite persistent efforts by telephone, she was unable to contact a caseworker assigned to her because of the frequent turnover of caseworkers at Child Welfare Services. On the basis of the evidence and testimony presented, the lower court concluded that “for two years<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> the [appellant] made virtually no attempt to perform affirmative parental responsibilities”.</p>

This affirmative performance embraces an aggregate of duties, for example, it requires “ . . . financial obligation; it requires continuing interest in the child and a genuine effort to maintain communication and association with the child . . [and] that a parent ‘exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in the child’s life.’ ” (citations omitted). <em><a href="/pa/474/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="474 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="1732165" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0615-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/474/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="474 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="1732165" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0615-01">474 Pa. at 624-5</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="474 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="1732165" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0615-01">379 A.2d at 540</a>.

Appellant attributed this difficulty to frequent turnover in caseworkers at the agency. In situations of at least analogous frustration and difficulty, this Court has held that we are not willing to “toll a parent’s responsibilities . . . . Rather, we must inquire whether the parent has utilized those resources at his or her command ... in continuing a close relationship with the child. Where the parent does not exercise reasonable firmness ‘in declining to yield to obstacles,’ his other rights may be forfeited.” (citations omitted). <em>Adoption of McCray, </em><a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">460 Pa. 210</a>, 216-217, <a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">331 A.2d 652</a>, 655 (1975). Utilizing this standard of law and on the basis of the testimony presented and all legitimate inferences therefrom, the lower court concluded that “with minimal effort the [appellant] . . . could have learned the whereabouts of her child and the caseworker who was caring for her child.” It is to be noted that the record shows that during the same period of caseworker turnover, appellant had no difficulty whatsoever in reaching a caseworker by telephone in order to arrange for the child’s attendance at her father’s funeral service.</p>

The majority concludes that the involuntary termination of a natural parent’s rights is “permissible” under the Act because appellant, a natural parent, failed to perform her parental duties during a period of more than six months. Contrary to the majority’s notions about involuntary terminations, the question is <em>not </em>whether such a termination of an important right is merely permissible.

    <p id="b698-9" data-blocks='[["BL_698.10",698,[272,1788,1148,208]]]'>A review of the facts presented in this appeal also reveal that the Child Welfare Services (CWS) was less than cooperative when appellant did attempt to perform her parental responsibilities.</p>
    <p id="b698-10" data-blocks='[["BL_698.11",698,[272,2033,1151,317]],["BL_699.1",699,[173,279,1149,934]]]'>Upon appellant’s release from a psychiatric hospital, appellant began visiting her daughter, who was under the supervision of CWS. These visits occurred continuously until March 1975. The visits, however, appeared to fluctuate with the changes in the caseworker. At trial appellant testified that she made persistent efforts to arrange visits <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>from March, 1975, through January, 1976, but because of the frequent turnover in CWS caseworkers, appellant’s efforts were frustrated. Appellant’s testimony was corroborated by a witness who listened by extension to a conversation between appellant and an employee of CWS. During the alleged time during which appellant failed to perform her parental duties, appellant had ten different caseworkers. It was acknowledged that when caseworkers are transferred, there was a lapse of time when nobody was in touch with appellant. The trial court dismissed the testimony on this matter and concluded that the location of the agency was well established. The trial court also concluded that it did not believe her testimony “in refuting the contention of the agency that she did not discharge her parental duties.” The trial court also said that even if it believed appellant’s testimony, her actions were not sufficient to show the “care” that the law requires for a child.</p>
    <p id="b699-5" data-blocks='[["BL_699.5",699,[173,1253,1149,376]]]'>In this case, the agency’s “breakdown” frustrated appellant’s attempt to perform her parental duties, and the burden of proof was not on appellant to disprove a failure to perform parental rights. The burden of proof was on the Child Welfare Services to prove that appellant either failed to perform parental duties or has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing her parental claim.</p>
    <p id="b699-6" data-blocks='[["BL_699.6",699,[173,1668,1148,96]]]'>Because CWS did not meet its burden of proof, appellant’s rights should not be terminated.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b699-7" data-blocks='[["BL_699.7",699,[217,1846,764,42]]]'>NIX, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>
