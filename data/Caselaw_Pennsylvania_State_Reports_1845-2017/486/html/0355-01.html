First, this claim has been waived because it has not been properly preserved for appellate review. Trial counsel objected on the basis that the question was highly prejudicial rather than challenging its form. “It is a fundamental principle of appellate review that we will not reverse a judgment or decree on a theory that was not presented to the trial court.” See <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">464 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/pa/464/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="464 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1710349" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0117-01">346 A.2d 48</a> (1975). Second, I do not accept the premise that an objection based upon the prosecutor’s questioning of a character witness would have been meritorious and if pursued would have justified the reversal of the judgment. The character witness was asked if she was “aware that in May of 1974 there had been an altercation between George and Mary Garner in which it is alleged that she shot her husband”? The answer given by the witness in response was “No. . . . ” Therefore, this question was harmless. It is a fundamental rule of evidence that the questions of counsel do not supply the facts in the case. To the contrary, it is the witness’ answer. Cf. Wigmore on Evidence §§ 771, 780 (3d edition, 1940), <em>Pittman v. U. S., </em><a href="/f2d/42/0793-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="42 F.2d 793" data-case-ids="1786650" data-case-paths="/f2d/42/0793-01">42 F.2d 793</a> (8 Cir. <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>1930). Here, the answer did not confirm the offensive fact suggested in the question.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[278,404,1150,631]]]'>While the question may have been improper, it did not reach the degree of offensiveness that would have required reversal. If the answer to the question had tended to confirm the happening of the objectional event, I might be persuaded to reach a contrary result. Here, at best, the answer was neutral and in fact did not provide evidence to this jury of prior unlawful conduct on the part of appellant. Moreover, if the prosecutor had repeatedly attempted to utilize this type of questioning to create an impression that appellant possessed a bad reputation, I would distinguish such a situation from the instant complaint and consider it to be a far more serious allegation.</p>
