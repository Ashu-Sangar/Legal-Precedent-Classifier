About three weeks later, on December 22, 1975, appellee, School District of Pittsburgh, filed a complaint in equity requesting that a preliminary injunction be issued enjoining appellants, Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers, Local 400, American Federation of Teach<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>ers, AFL-CIO, and its officers and members from continuing the strike. Public Employe Relations Act, Act of July 23,1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, art. X, § 1003, 43 P.S. § 1101.1003. Hearings were conducted and on Saturday, January 3, 1976, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction. On Monday, January 5, 1976, the next scheduled school day after the issuance of the preliminary injunction, the School District filed a petition requesting that appellants be held in contempt for failure to report to work that day. Two days later, on Wednesday, January 7, 1976, a hearing on the contempt petition was held and appellants were found to be in civil contempt of the court’s preliminary injunction order. The court ordered that appellants cease their strike activities and report to work on the next scheduled school day and imposed fines to be paid for each scheduled school day that appellants continued their strike activities and did not report for work. The next scheduled school day after the court issued its contempt order was Monday, January 12. (The Commonwealth Court erroneously suggested that the next scheduled school day was Thursday, January 8.)</p>

The Commonwealth Court held that the appeal from the issuance of the preliminary injunction was moot because the strike was settled on Monday, January 26, 1976, and a new collective bargaining agreement had been executed. In the appeal from the trial court’s order imposing fines for contempt, appellants were denied relief; the Commonwealth Court affirming the trial court’s order imposing the fines. <em>Sch.

    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[281,713,1149,558]]]'>The pivotal factor in the determination of this appeal is the trial court’s denial, prior to Monday, January 12, of appellants’ request that the trial court hold a final hearing on the propriety of injunctive relief. On Wednesday, January 7, 1976, at the hearing scheduled to determine whether appellants should be held in contempt, appellants submitted to the trial court a request for a final hearing pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1531(f)(1).

Those holdings require state procedures insuring a prompt and final judicial determination when injunctions are sought involving freedom of expression. We noted in <em>Duggan, supra, </em>that a procedure is flawed if “it does not show ‘the necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression.’ ” <a href="/pa/447/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="447 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1942940" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0281-01">447 Pa. at 290</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20750" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="288 A.2d 750">288 A.2d at 754</a>. When the trial court denied appellant’s request for a final hearing, it in effect ruled that no hearing would be held as required by 1531(f)(1). The only determination consistent with the necessity to limit restraints involving freedom of expression to the “shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution” is to conclude that a denial of a request for final hearing under 1531(f)(1) results in a dissolution of an injunction. <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em><a href="/us/380/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="380 U.S. 51" data-case-ids="1525226" data-case-paths="/us/380/0051-01">380 U.

It is, of course, conceivable that a trial court could change its mind after denying a request for a final hearing and later grant it. However, to permit such a possibility to cause an injunction to remain in effect for a time period after a final hearing has been denied lacks “the necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression.” To hold that the preliminary injunction remains in effect on the improbable basis that a trial judge might change his mind after he has entered a denial would give Rule 1531(f)(1) an interpretation which would raise serious doubts concerning its constitutionality under <em>Duggan, supra </em>and <em>Freedman, <a href="/us/380/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="380 U.S. 51" data-case-ids="1525226" data-case-paths="/us/380/0051-01">supra.</a></em>

The final hearing, which must be promptly held under Rule <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>1531(f)(1), is for the purpose of determining the very issue which appellee contends can be determined <em>without </em>a final hearing. Under appellee’s reasoning a final hearing is required under Rule 1531(f)(1), only when the preliminary injunction is known, in advance of the final hearing, to be illegal. If in advance of the final hearing, the preliminary injunction is known to be illegal, no final hearing would be necessary. Until a final hearing is held, it is not known finally whether the prohibitions of the preliminary injunction prohibit constitutionally protected freedom of expression. If the preliminary injunction, on its face involves freedom of expression, a final hearing is required. In <em>Duggan, supra, </em>the decision of this Court which resulted in the later adoption of Rule 1531(f)(1), a preliminary injunction involving freedom of expression was reversed <em>without </em>any consideration of whether the expression enjoined was constitutionally protected precisely because there was no procedure for a prompt final hearing. To deny a final hearing by deciding in advance of such a hearing that the preliminarily enjoining of the “expression” was proper is to put the proverbial cart before the horse.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[166,1431,1149,681]]]'>In the alternative, appellee contends that the injunction issued by the trial court was a final injunction and therefore no final hearing was required under 1531(f)(1). Although the hearing which took place prior to issuance of the preliminary injunction was a lengthy hearing, that fact is totally irrelevant in determining whether appellants are entitled to a final hearing. Appellants <em>were never given notice </em>that the hearing being conducted was to be a final hearing. There was no agreement between the parties that it was to be a final hearing. Without proper notice and in the absence of an agreement a hearing scheduled to consider the propriety of issuing a preliminary injunction cannot be considered later to have been a final hearing.</p>

The complaint filed in this case by the School District requested a preliminary injunction. The decree entered by the trial court was specifically desig<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>nated as a preliminary injunction. Throughout the entire hearing references were always to a preliminary injunction! The record is totally absent of any indication or suggestion that the hearing held was to consider anything except the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Under these circumstances, serious due process issues would result if we were to conclude that the first hearing held was a final hearing. We rejected this same argument in <em>Duggan, supra, </em>where it was argued that “the adversary hearing on the preliminary injunction was full and complete, and hence the hearing on the permanent injunction would be little more than a formality.” That argument was answered by pointing out that “the fact that there was an adversary hearing at the preliminary injunctive stage does not vitiate the need for a requirement of a specific guarantee of prompt and final adjudication.” <a href="/pa/447/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="447 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1942940" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0281-01">447 Pa. at 291</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20750" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="288 A.2d 750">288 A.2d at 755</a>.</p>
    <p id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[290,1165,1147,460]]]'>Since a final hearing was required, upon demand, by Rule 1531(f)(1) after the issuance of the preliminary injunction involving freedom of expression and since appellant’s demand was denied on January 8, 1976, the injunction was deemed dissolved on that date under Rule 1531(f)(1). Appellants were therefore not in contempt when they failed to report for work on Monday, January 12, 1976, the next scheduled school day. The order imposing fines is therefore reversed.</p>
    <p id="b452-5" data-blocks='[["BL_452.6",452,[290,1654,1148,677]]]'>Appellants have also appealed from the Commonwealth Court’s order dismissing, as moot, appellants’ appeal from the trial court’s order granting a preliminary injunction. Appellants contend that the Commonwealth Court’s order was in error because even though the parties had settled their differences and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement, the appeal from the grant of the preliminary injunction should not have been considered moot so long as fines for violation of the preliminary injunction remained outstanding. In view of our reversal of the orders of the trial court and the Commonwealth Court as to the fines, appellants’ appeal to this Court challenging the order of the Commonwealth Court is moot.</p>
