We disagree with appellant and affirm the order of the PCHA Court.</p>
    <p id="b554-6" data-blocks='[["BL_554.7",554,[280,978,1150,1212]]]'>On October 26, 1976 appellant and Randy Lee Toner, shot and killed one Jack Pritt and subsequently stole certain items of his personal property. Appellant made a voluntary statement to the Pennsylvania State Police admitting his involvement two days after the crime was committed. There was some dispute as to who actually fired the shots. Newell testified on behalf of the Commonwealth at the trial of Toner. His testimony clearly indicated that both he and Toner committed the crimes with which they were charged. On March 8, 1977 Newell entered a plea of guilty to murder in the third degree. Newell had been charged with first degree murder. The Commonwealth agreed to accept a plea of guilty to third degree murder, and not to process the related prosecution for theft. Newell was sentenced on April 13, 1977, to a term of not less than five (5) nor more than fifteen (15) years in a state correctional institution. Newell did not appeal within the required thirty (30) day period. On August 15, 1977, appellant filed a pro se PCHA Petition. Counsel was appointed and on September 28, 1977 an amended PCHA Petition was filed along with a petition to withdraw the guilty plea nunc pro tunc. The petitions were denied after hearing and appeal was taken to this court.</p>

    <p id="b555-6" data-blocks='[["BL_555.7",555,[187,932,1150,686]]]'>Defense trial counsel, Mr. Campbell, testified that he had many discussions with the appellant prior to the entering of the guilty plea, and that appellant knew what the alternatives were before he entered his plea. Appellant knew there was a possibility of receiving first degree murder, and he also knew the theft charges would be dropped by pleading guilty to third degree murder. Mr. Campbell had no reason to appeal and challenge the guilty plea as the right to appeal was explained to appellant during sentencing, and, appellant indicated his satisfaction with the sentence, and the first letter Mr. Campbell received regarding an alleged violation of rights was on August 1, 1977, well beyond the thirty (30) day statute of limitations required for appeal.</p>

    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[284,344,1149,414]]]'>I agree with the majority that appellant has not established his entitlement to post-conviction relief. The record supports the PCHA court’s conclusion that appellant knowingly decided to enter a guilty plea and, satisfied with the result, elected not to appeal. The order of the PCHA court must therefore be affirmed. See Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, § 4, 19 P.S. § 1180-4 (Supp.1979).</p>

    <p id="b556-8" data-blocks='[["BL_556.10",556,[285,938,1149,740]]]'>The issue presented is not whether appellant was aware of his right to appeal or whether or not he was satisfied with his sentence. The majority does not question the fact that the colloquy was constitutionally infirm. It is also not disputed that counsel failed to advise appellant of this inadequacy during the period of time that an appeal could have been timely filed. Regardless of how advantageous a negotiated plea may be, the decision to enter it and to waive the right to appeal is a decision of the client and not counsel. Moreover, the decision to waive the right of appeal in this case could only be a knowing one if appellant had first been apprised of the constitutional deficiency in the colloquy and the legal effect of that deficiency. This did not occur and thus occasions my dissent.</p>

    <p id="b556-10" data-blocks='[["BL_556.13",556,[285,1792,1149,524]]]'>I must dissent. Appellant argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to recognize and advise him of the inadequacy of the guilty plea colloquy. I agree. In the colloquy the elements of the crime of murder of the third degree were not discussed and as such the plea cannot have been said to be voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly made. <em>Commonwealth v.
