    <p class="author" id="Afa" data-blocks='[["BL_609.9",609,[215,937,346,40]]]'>O’BRIEN, Justice.</p>
    <p id="b609-8" data-blocks='[["BL_609.10",609,[170,999,1150,254]]]'>Appellant, Donald L. Starr, Jr., was tried by a judge sitting without a jury and convicted of murder of the second degree for the stabbing death of Wilbur Grim during a robbery. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b609-9" data-blocks='[["BL_609.11",609,[170,1271,1149,145]]]'>Appellant raises only one issue in this appeal. He alleges the trial court erred in refusing his pretrial motion to suppress his confession. The facts are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b609-10" data-blocks='[["BL_609.12",609,[170,1437,1150,360]]]'>Once appellant became suspect in the instant homicide, he was asked to go to the state police barracks for purposes of taking a polygraph examination. Once at the barracks, appellant met with Trooper John B. Kelly, the polygraph examiner. Trooper Kelly explained how the test would be administered, and then fully informed appellant of his applicable constitutional rights. As Trooper Kelly testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="A7F" data-blocks='[["BL_609.13",609,[211,1811,1108,510]]]'>“ . . . When I give the rights form, I get into the third paragraph there that deals with the polygraph instrument specifically. I reiterate there. I read him those rights. And, by the way, when I read those rights, I interject the fact that anything he says can and will be used against him. Polygraph charts in all cases are not used in court. But I didn’t want to mislead him, and I did relate to him that there are some circumstances where polygraphs have been admitted in court either by stipulation or court order or as an issue. . . . ”</blockquote>

      <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>Appellant was then asked if he would be willing to take the examination. He originally was somewhat reluctant to take the test. When Trooper Kelly questioned him as to why he was reluctant, appellant agreed to take the examination.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[284,507,1148,305]]]'>Following the examination, Kelly indicated to appellant that the results indicated deception on appellant’s part when he denied participation in the Grim stabbing. Shortly thereafter, appellant was again informed of his constitutional rights, which he waived. He then admitted killing the victim in the course of a robbery.</p>
    <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[329,833,553,41]]]'>However, appellant testified:</p>
    <blockquote id="b610-7" data-blocks='[["BL_610.7",610,[328,889,1121,1257]]]'>“ . . . Well, he started talking to me about the case, the seriousness of it. And then he brought up — he said, T noticed on your test you reacted strongly to some of the questions.’ I said, ‘Well, yeah, I’m kind of upset about it.' And we kept talking a little bit. Then Kelly came into the room and laid the results of the test in front of me and said, T know you’re lying, I could see you’re lying right here.’ He says, ‘Do you notice any differences on the test with the paper?’ And I showed him what I could see, and I don’t know anything about how they read it. And then he pointed and said, ‘Well, here’s your strong points right here,’ and showed me what the questions were, where they had them numbered on the paper. Then he told me, ‘Look, actually,’ he says, ‘as far as me being involved in this case, this is all I was involved in, is giving the test.’ ‘But,’ he said, T don’t really care, you don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to, but the thing is I can point it out right here; now, I’m a pro at this, and I can tell you that you’re lying.’ And he told me that whether I said anything or not, it didn’t really matter, that he’d be showing it to the district attorney and the judge. ‘And,’ he said, ‘when I show it to them, they’re going to listen to what I have to say, because they know I’m a pro at this.’ So, right there, I figured, well, they got me. . . . ”</blockquote>
