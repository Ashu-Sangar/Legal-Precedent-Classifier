During the evening appellant became involved in several arguments with his wife and at one point when he saw her speaking to one of his co-workers, James Bushey, appellant physically assaulted Bushey. Appellant apparently believed that his wife was having an affair with Bushey. Appellant was overheard telling his wife that she should not return home that night because he was going to go home and load his rifle. The bartender then saw appellant strike his wife and ordered him to leave. Appellant went to his apartment which was nearby, sent the babysitter home and took his children across the hall to his sister’s apartment. Appellant then loaded his rifle and returned to the bar approximately fifteen minutes after being ejected. Appellant shot his wife and was knocked unconscious in the scuffle which ensued. The wife died as a result of the wounds inflicted and appellant was charged with murder.</p>

Trial counsel had two relevant reports concerning appellant’s state of mind. One was a psychological report by Dr. Don W. Brian, D.Ed., which stated that appellant was “a seriously, emotionally disturbed individual and possibly a borderline psychotic . who is . consumed with hostility, assaultive ideations, unstable moods. . . .” Under his specific findings, this expert reported that “the subject perceives reality inaccurately, is typically disoriented, and experiences psychotic episodes” and he portrays “assaultive tendencies and impulsive aggressiveness.” The second report was made by Dr. James Markham, M.D., and while not as strongly worded, this psychiatrist did state that appellant had “some paranoid, flavoring regarding the considerable difficulty centering around his wife.” Dr. Markham further reported “[i]t would appear that whatever areas of weakness or difficulty he has, even if normal in degree under ordinary circumstances, would become exaggerated and more problem to him under times of stress and perhaps particularly under the influence of alcohol with stress and alcohol perhaps combining to form the worst of all possible conditions.”</p>

Although in <em>McCusker </em>it was the trial court which excluded the psychiatric testimony from the factfinder, we find it no less prejudicial to an accused when trial counsel fails to introduce evidence relevant to a crucial issue unless the failure is based upon reasonable trial strategy. In cases such as appellant’s, the factfinder is required to determine a complex and crucial question concerning the accused’s state of mind. Before the factfinder makes such a decision, the accused is entitled to have all relevant information before the factfinder. Factfinders today, be they judge or jury, are sufficiently sophisticated to evaluate psychiatric and psychological testimony and determine the extent to which such testimony contributes, in a particular case, to the object of all trials — the quest for truth and justice. In the interest of reaching a just decision, the factfinder should have such relevant information before it.</p>

They were intended, not to establish the fact that Jacobs, when he committed the homicide, was constrained by an insane impulse which for the time destroyed his free agency, but only to show that he was of an excitable • temperament; . But a rule which would allow the justification of crime on such pretext would utterly pervert and subvert the moral order of things. . . . The phlegmatic man may be moved to anger as well as the most nervous; the only difference is that it requires more to affect the one than the other; but when passion is once aroused in either, it is the same unreasoning and unreasonable power. Why, then, should it not excuse crime in the one as well as in the other? If the murder of the latter may thus be reduced in degree, why not that of the former? Questions, such as these, at once show the utter inapplicability of the rule contended for, hence it must be rejected.

    <p id="b595-7" data-blocks='[["BL_595.7",595,[165,665,1151,571]]]'>The present case is similar to the <em>Collins </em>case decided just nine years ago. <em>Commonwealth v. Collins, supra. </em>There this Court unanimously held that there was insufficient objective evidence of provocation to raise the issue of voluntary manslaughter where the testimony indicated that the defendant was mad at his wife and suspected her of having an affair with another man. We then affirmed his conviction for murder of the first degree. I therefore believe that action of the majority today in abandoning the objective standard and replacing it with a subjective determination of provocation, is without legal or logical support.</p>

An intoxication defense, on the other hand, is based upon the belief that the defendant’s drunkenness robbed him of the ability to form the required intent to commit first degree murder. Thus heat of passion has intent to kill as a constituent element whereas an intoxication defense requires the negation of that intent.</p>
