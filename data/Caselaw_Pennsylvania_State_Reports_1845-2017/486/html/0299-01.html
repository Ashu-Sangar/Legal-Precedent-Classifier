It avoids interruptions of a trial in progress with auxiliary inquiries which break the continuity of the jury’s attention, and likewise avoids the serious personal inconvenience to jurors and witnesses which would result from interruptions at the trial. It also prevents having to declare a mistrial because the jury has been exposed to unconstitutional evidence. Moreover, it is to the advantage of both the prosecution and defense to know in advance of the time set for trial whether certain items will or will not be admitted into evidence. If the pretrial motion is granted, this may result in abandonment of the prosecution, thus avoiding the waste of prosecutorial and judicial resources occasioned by preparation for a trial which otherwise would have to begin only to be terminated at some point thereafter. Also, ‘[a]n adverse ruling on a pretrial motion will permit the government to change the theory of its case, to develop or place greater reliance upon untainted evidence or otherwise to modify its trial strategy.’ If the pretrial motion is denied, then the defendant is in a position at that time to either plead guilty and gain whatever concessions might be obtained by so pleading without causing the commencement of a trial, or to go to trial with a somewhat different defense strategy. Finally, in those jurisdictions where <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>interlocutory appeal by the prosecution is permitted, the requirement of a pretrial motion to suppress protects that right of immediate appeal, which would be rendered meaningless if a request for suppression could be postponed until mid-trial.”</blockquote>

There is broad language in <em>Harmon </em>which would suggest that a suppression hearing is not part of a trial and, hence, not part of a new trial. This language, however, is dictum. <em>Harmon, </em>as pointed out in the text, concerns only “trial de novo” in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Any reliance of the plurality on this dictum, therefore, is misplaced. In any event, by so relying on the dictum of Harmon, the plurality certainly sweeps beyond the perceived inadequacy in appellant’s motion to suppress before his first trial. For even if appellant had moved to suppress the physical evidence he now challenges on retrial, still under the dictum of Harmon, as extended to this case, he would be precluded from obtaining a new suppression hearing.</p>

Perhaps the plurality seeks to recognize the possibility that a motion to suppress on retrial may be predicated on a change in law when it observes that “[n]o excuse is offered, nor does any exist, for [appellant’s] failure to [seek to suppress the physical evidence].” Assuming the plurality has this possibility in mind, still the plurality offers no authority for placing the burden of “excuse” on the accused. Indeed, no authority exists. To the contrary, our Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly place the burden of establishing the <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>legality of evidence on the Commonwealth.

To accept this argument would permit the police to engage in separate unlawful conduct as to each of two or more citizens and use the fruits, all illegally obtained, to convict all of the citizens.
