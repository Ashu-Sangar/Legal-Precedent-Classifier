Her landlord, appellant J. C. Pugh, instituted two separate landlord-tenant actions against appellee before a justice of the peace, the first resulting in a judgment for unpaid rent (for the period from September, 1975 through June, 1976) and the second resulting in a judgment for unpaid rent (for the period from June, 1976 through August, 1976) and for possession of the premises. Following Mrs. Holmes’ appeals to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County, appellant filed separate complaints, the first seeking unpaid rent and the second <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>seeking both unpaid rent and possession. In both actions, appellee filed answers asserting a defense of the landlord’s alleged* breach of an implied warranty of habitability. Additionally, in the second action, appellee asserted a setoff due in an amount which she claimed she had spent to repair a broken lock after having given appellant notice and a reasonable opportunity to repair the lock. Appellee also filed a counterclaim for the cost of repairing other allegedly defective conditions of which she had given appellant notice. Appellant filed preliminary objections to the answer and counterclaim which the Court of Common Pleas sustained finding that appellee’s answer failed to set forth a legal defense to the landlord’s actions, and that the counterclaim failed to set forth a legal cause of action.</p>

However, we find that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>has outlived its usefulness and must be abolished, and that, in order to keep in step with the realities of modern day leasing, it is appropriate to adopt an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases. The rule of <em>caveat emptor, </em>as applied to landlord-tenant relationships, developed in England in the sixteenth century and was adopted in the nineteenth century as the law of this Commonwealth in <em>Moore v. Weber, </em><a href="/pa/71/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="71 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1031220" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0429-01">71 Pa. 429</a> (1872). <em>Moore </em>held “The rule here, as in other cases, is <em>caveat emptor. </em>The lessee’s eyes are his bargain.

In the primarily agrarian society in which the doctrine developed, fhe law viewed the lease transaction as a conveyance of land for a term, and the focal interest in the conveyance was the land — any shelters or structures existing on the land were “incidental” concerns. The rent was viewed as “coming out of the land” itself, not from the dwelling or the dweller. The feudal landlord</p>

The doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>was fully applicable. The tenant’s only protections were to inspect the premises before taking possession or to extract express warranties from the landlord. It was assumed that landlords and tenants held equal bargaining power in arranging their rental agreements, and that the agrarian tenant had the ability to inspect the dwelling adequately and to make simple repairs in the buildings which possessed no modern conveniences such as indoor plumbing or electrical wiring. As agrarian society declined and population centers shifted from rural to urban areas, the common law concepts of landlord-tenant relationships did not change. Despite the facts that the primary purpose of the urban leasing arrangement was housing and not land and that the tenant could neither adequately inspect nor repair urban dwelling units, landlords still were not held to any implied warranties in the places they rented and tenants leased dwellings at their own risk.”</blockquote>

In light of the overwhelming authority in favor of the warrant, he would be hard pressed to do so. Rather, the thrust of appellant’s argument is that the establishment of an implied warranty of habitability is the setting of social policy, which is a function of the legislature. Specifically, appellant maintains that, because the legislature has acted in the field via the Rent Withholding Act, Act of January 24, 1966, P.L. 1534, as <em>amended, </em>35 P.S. § 1700-1 (1977), the courts are prohibited from further development of common law solutions to landlord-tenant/habitability problems.

We have held that, where a landlord fails to perform a lease covenant, the tenant may perform it at his own expense (if reasonable) and deduct the cost of his performance from the amount of rent due and payable. <em>McDanel v.

Section 11.2 provides “[i]f a tenant is entitled to apply his rent to eliminate the landlord’s default, the tenant, after proper notice to the landlord, may deduct from his rent reasonable costs incurred in eliminating the default.” “Proper notice” in this instance is one that describes the default and specifies what steps will be taken by the tenant to correct it if the landlord has not eliminated the defective condition within a reasonable time. <em>See </em>comment a. to § 11.2. The use of the repair and deduct remedy is not, of course, unlimited. Repairs must be reasonably priced and cannot exceed the amount of the rent available to apply against the cost, i. e. the amount of rent <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>owed for the term of the lease. <em>Merilh </em>v. <em>Pan American Films, </em><a href="/so2d/200/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="104" data-cite="200 So. 2d 398" data-case-ids="9802146" data-case-paths="/so2d/200/0398-01">200 So.2d 398</a> (La.App.1967). <em>See </em>comment c. to § 11.2. Further the tenant runs the risk of an adverse court finding on the necessity of the repairs — if the court finds that the repairs were not needed to render the premises habitable, the court must find the rent deduction unreasonable. In such event, the landlord could obtain a judgment for the amount of rent deducted. Or if the repairs were needed but the cost was excessive, the landlord could recover the difference between the actual cost and what would have been the reasonable cost of repairs.</p>

In principle, we see little difference between the counterclaim for repairs and the “repair and deduct” remedy. The counterclaim can be utilized to recover damages from already paid rents based upon expenses incurred in making repairs of defective conditions after failure of the landlord to repair within a reasonable time following proper notice. <em>See Marini v.

The limitations applicable to the repair and deduct remedy are applicable here as well — the cost of the repairs must be reasonable and the maximum amount which the tenant may expend is the amount of rent owed for the term of the lease. However the counterclaim is not available where the tenant has not paid his rent for the period in which the repairs are made and the cost of the repairs do not exceed the rent owed for that period. In that case, there are no damages as the tenant has already been compensated for the cost of repairs by not paying rent.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

And, according to Brief for Amicus Curiae, Central Pennsylvania Legal Services, p. 15, only six of seventy-two municipalities in York County, eleven of the fifty-nine municipalities in Lancaster County, and twelve out of seventy-five in Berks County have housing codes. In Perry County there are no municipalities with housing codes.</p>

From the pleadings, it appears that some of appellee’s counterclaims were for recovery of the cost of repairs from <em>already </em>paid rents while some of the counterclaims were for repairs made during periods in which no rent was paid. If such is the case, the latter claims would fail as the appellee would have suffered no damages.</p>
