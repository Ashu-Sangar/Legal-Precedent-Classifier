Although this Court has not imposed a legal obligation on a child welfare agency such as appellee, to assist parents to maintain the parent-child relationship, we have recognized that they should “offer education, training and encouragement,” <em>In re W. M. III, </em><a href="/pa/482/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="482 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1749592" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0123-01">482 Pa. 123</a>, <a href="/pa/482/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="482 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="1749592" data-case-paths="/pa/482/0123-01">393 A.2d 410</a>, 412 (1978). Appellee did not merely fail to encourage the parent in this case. Can it be that we will now permit <em>concealment </em>by an agency to expedite a termination of parental rights?</p>
    <p id="b691-5" data-blocks='[["BL_691.5",691,[181,839,1149,310]]]'>Today’s termination means that the child is “dead” so far as appellant is concerned. I cannot agree with the majority’s value judgment that this child will grow up to be a better adult by being cut off forever from any ties with the natural mother. <em>In re William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, 369, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a>, 1252 (1978) (Manderino, J., dissenting).</p>
