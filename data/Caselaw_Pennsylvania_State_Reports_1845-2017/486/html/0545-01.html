We disagree with appellant and affirm the lower court’s decision.</p>

Appellant and his co-defendants pled guilty to murder generally in June, 1969 and following an extensive and thorough colloquy by the court, Commonwealth and defense attorneys, the trial court accepted the plea. The court then held a degree of guilt hearing, found appellant guilty of murder of the first degree and subsequently imposed life sentences.</p>
