The Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County appointed plaintiff, Douglas Ferguson, to serve until January, 1980, the remainder of Smith’s unexpired term. On September 1, 1976, plaintiff took office. Since taking office, plaintiff has served as the part-time district attorney and has received the annual salary for his office fixed by Act No. 113 of November 1, 1971.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Before the court of common pleas ruled on defendants’ preliminary objections, plaintiff petitioned this Court to assume plenary jurisdiction and in December, 1978, this Court granted the petition.

      <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>Section 2 of Act 223 provides that the salaries fixed therein take effect as of October 7,1976 “when permitted by the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” Article III, § 27 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania (1968) expressly provides that “[n]o law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.” In <em>Bakes v. Snyder, </em><a href="/pa/486/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="486 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1757547" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0080-01">supra,</a> this Court concluded that article III, § 27 (1968) precludes the Lehigh County Sheriff, Recorder of Deeds, Register of Wills, Prothonotary, Clerk of Courts, and Coroner, in office as of the effective date of Act 223, from receiving the salaries set forth in that Act. Plaintiff, also in office when Act 223 became effective, also claims a right to the increased salary fixed by Act 223. He makes arguments substantially identical to those presented and rejected in <em>Bakes. </em>The established constitutional principles adhered to in <em>Bakes </em>control our disposition here. Plaintiff, just as the plaintiffs in <em>Bakes, </em>must be denied the requested relief.</p>
