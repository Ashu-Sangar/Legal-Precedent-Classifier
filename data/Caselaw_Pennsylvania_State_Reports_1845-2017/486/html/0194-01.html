Here a police officer, an agent of the Commonwealth and a prosecution witness, gave prejudicial and unsolicited testimony that appellant failed a lie detector test. The witness’ inexcusable and prejudicial remark followed the trial court’s clear ruling, delivered in the presence of the police officer, indeed while the police officer was on the witness stand, expressly directing all concerned that the jury was not to be informed of the results of appellant’s polygraph examination.</p>

Even if the first trial is not completed, a second prosecution may be grossly unfair. It increases the financial and emotional burden on the accused, prolongs the period in which he is stigmatized by an unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and may even enhance the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted. The danger of such unfairness to the defendant exists whenever a trial is aborted before it is completed. Consequently, as a general rule, the prosecutor is entitled to one, and only one, opportunity to require an accused to stand trial.”</blockquote>

This clause acts as a prohibition upon the Commonwealth and does not permit the unjustified distinction drawn by the majority between the prosecutor and the prosecuting police witness. Surely the prejudicial statement made after the court’s express admonition which produced a mistrial here was no less damaging to the appellant’s rights and no less the act of the Commonwealth than if it had been uttered by the prosecuting attorney himself. By subjecting appellant to retrial despite the misconduct of the police witness, the Commonwealth deprived appellant, in the words of the Supreme Court of the United States, of his “valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,” multiplied the burdens which the appellant was compelled to endure, and improperly enhanced the risk of conviction.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/372/0734-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="372 U.S. 734" data-case-ids="1765418" data-case-paths="/us/372/0734-01">372 U.S. 734</a>, <a href="/us/372/0734-01" class="citation" data-index="129" data-cite="372 U.S. 734" data-case-ids="1765418" data-case-paths="/us/372/0734-01">83 S.Ct. 1033</a>, <a href="/us/372/0734-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="372 U.S. 734" data-case-ids="1765418" data-case-paths="/us/372/0734-01">10 L.Ed.2d 100</a> (1963). Unless <em>governmental action </em>includes the type of conduct by an agent of the government such as occurred in this case, as well as bad faith conduct by a judge or prosecutor, appellant’s constitutional rights are greatly abused.</p>
    <p id="b289-8" data-blocks='[["BL_289.9",289,[174,1735,1148,417]]]'>In the case before us, the witness was a police detective with over nineteen years experience on the police force. It is inconceivable that he was lacking in the knowledge that testimony concerning polygraph tests is inadmissible. The detective’s precise statement “he had flunked the polygraph exam” does constitute the type of declaration which is intended to provoke a mistrial. Therefore, appellant is protected by the double jeopardy clause.</p>
    <p id="b289-9" data-blocks='[["BL_289.10",289,[174,2174,1147,142]],["BL_290.1",290,[282,288,1148,846]]]'>It is always difficult to prove intent, and the intent of this witness is equally difficult to determine. Yet, one must note that the witness did not blurt out his statement on <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>direct examination but waited until cross-examination to embellish his testimony with the prejudicial statement. Further, this witness was present when the judge ruled concerning the inadmissibility of the polygraph test and cautioned the jury concerning it. Finally, the statement occurred after a recess. While we cannot say the statement was deliberately made, it is obvious that a grave potential for abuse exists in this area. The statement was not accidentally made by one totally unconnected with the government and who had no reason to know of the inadmissibility of such a statement. Under the circumstances of this case, if we are to adequately safeguard this appellant’s constitutional rights and protect future defendants from similar conduct, we must hold the prosecution responsible for its witnesses. Appellant’s conviction should be reversed and he is entitled to be discharged.</p>
