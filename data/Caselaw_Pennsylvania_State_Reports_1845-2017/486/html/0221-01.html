The detective then asked “why . . . was someone else involved with you in this killing.” Bussey replied: “Yes, but I don’t know if I would testify against him, I would fear for my life.” Bussey then incriminated one Dwight Tools and advised the detective that he had not thrown the guns involved over a bridge, and that Tools had one gun and the other was in New Jersey.

In <em>Millhouse </em>the defendant purposefully abused the judicial system by causing a four-month delay through his dilatory efforts to retain private counsel. Millhouse was arraigned and apparently let out on bail on February 6, and appeared unrepresented by counsel at preliminary proceedings scheduled for March 12 and 20; April 15, 18, and 25; and May 1 and 3. It was not until May <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>28 that private counsel entered his appearance for Millhouse.

In addition, Bussey was incarcerated during the week between arraignment and bail while Millhouse was free on bail. Appellant Bussey did successfully retain private counsel and was represented at the continued preliminary hearing while Millhouse failed to retain private counsel despite several admonitions by the court. Appellant Bussey’s failure to be represented at the December 21 hearing caused only a 28-day delay, much of which must be charged against the prosecution and the court for suggesting and setting the second hearing as late as January 18; while Millhouse caused a delay of over three months. Additionally, except for the initial postponement of the preliminary hearing, there is no delay of judicial proceedings attributable to Bussey’s lack of representation; Millhouse’s disinclination to retain counsel caused the postponement or cancellation of judicial proceedings seven separate times. Because Millhouse purposefully stymied the orderly functioning of the judicial process, it was appropriate to charge the attendant delay against him for Rule 1100 purposes and find that the delay was caused by the unavailability of counsel. This same conclusion is not appropriate in the instant case because Bussey merely exercised his sixth amendment right to retain counsel in an expeditious fashion.</p>

Appellant was merely asked if he was “all right”; if “he was under the influence [of] drugs or alcohol”; and if “he knew why he had been picked up”. Such questions do no more than inform the police of whether a defendant is suffering discomfort and in control of his faculties, and whether he has been advised of the charges against him. They are preliminary to determining whether a defendant is able to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his rights and answer questions concerning the crime charged; they are not “likely to or expected to elicit a confession.”<a class="footnotemark">1</a> Accordingly, I would hold that appellant’s statement was not the product of custodial “interrogation” and did not, therefore, require a waiver of constitutional rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">2</a>

Butler, </em><a href="/us/441/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="441 U.S. 369" data-case-ids="1780286" data-case-paths="/us/441/0369-01">441 U.S. 369</a>, <a href="/us/441/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="441 U.S. 369" data-case-ids="1780286" data-case-paths="/us/441/0369-01">99 S.Ct. 1755</a>, <a href="/us/441/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="441 U.S. 369" data-case-ids="1780286" data-case-paths="/us/441/0369-01">60 L.Ed.2d 286</a> (1979), a defendant’s responses to questioning can support a finding that he has waived his constitutional rights notwithstanding the absence of an express waiver. The majority, however, declines to follow this precedent and holds that an express waiver is required because it “will promote certainty in knowing an accused has waived his rights and will avoid a mountain of litigation which might otherwise result . . .</p>

Further, I believe that society’s interests in justice and effective law enforcement outweigh judicial convenience. The question of waiver should be addressed in terms of substance, and not in terms of “which of its forms are thé most judicially manageable.” And, finally, I note that every other court which has considered the inflexible <em>per se </em>rule adopted by the majority has rejected it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">3</a>
