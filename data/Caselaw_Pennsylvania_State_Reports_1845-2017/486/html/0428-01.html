S.A. § 4105 (1973) of the charge of passing a “bad check” in the amount of $3,269.44 drawn on the corporate account of the M &amp; M Construction Company, of which he is an officer. The check was made payable to Thomas Roper as part payment of an existing past-due account owed by the company to Roper. Appellant admitted at trial that he had issued the check, that he had been informed by Roper that it had been returned for insufficient funds, and that he never made a deposit to cover the check after receiving notice that it had not been honored by the bank. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam without opinion, although Judge Hoffman wrote a dissenting statement. <em>Commonwealth v.

In defining the crime as a passing of a bad check knowing that it would be dishonored, regardless of consideration, the legislature did not evolve or proclaim indebtedness as a crime, but rather proclaimed it a crime for anyone to issue a bad check regardless of whether present consideration flows. The purpose of this statute is not to imprison debtors but to protect against impairment of commercial transactions. Most business today is conducted by the use of checks and, as such, checks have assumed virtually the same value as governmental currency. As such, the legislature has declared it a crime for anyone to impugn or impair such a document regardless of the nature of the transaction in which it is passed.

The early statute books of this Commonwealth are replete with examples of attempts to ameliorate the plight of persons imprisoned for debt. <em>E. g., </em>Act of April 4, 1792, P.L. 78, 3 Smith Laws of Pennsylvania 1791-1802. The earliest such law was passed by the General Assembly during its 1729-1730 Session and had a quaint provision that allowed the debtor’s creditors to keep the debtor imprisoned if they agreed to pay the costs of maintaining the debtor in jail. Act of February 14, 1730, P.L. 181 § 11, 1 Smith Laws of Pennsylvania 1700-1781.</p>

In all civil actions, it can be said that <em>someone </em>intentionally disrupted the flow of <em>something </em>and undermined the soundness of <em>something. </em>What is sacred about checks that they deserve special protection in the world of private commerce?</p>

The majority opinion says that you cannot be imprisoned for debt only if you voluntarily show up at the courthouse and hand over your assets. That is not the meaning of Article I, § 16. In the civil law, there is an entire system in existence for reaching the assets of debtors including judgment, levy, execution, and sale. A citizen must deliver his assets for the benefit of creditors, under the constitutional provision, <em>in such manner as shall he prescribed by law. </em>This means he must not conceal nor assign assets from the process of judgment, levy, execution, and sale. Even in the case of concealment or the assignment of assets to a third party there must be a <em>strong presumption of fraud. See In Re Young’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/327/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="327 Pa. 267" data-case-ids="1176711" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0267-01">327 Pa. 267</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=192%20A.%20911" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="192 A. 911">192 A. 911</a> (1937).
