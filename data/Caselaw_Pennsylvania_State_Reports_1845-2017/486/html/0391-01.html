The charges against appellant included murder, assault with intent to kill, aggravated assault and battery, assault and battery with intent to kill, conspiracy, burglary, aggravated robbery, indecent assault, and various, weapons offenses. After the presentation of the testimony, appellant was adjudged guilty of murder of the first degree. Appellant received a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder indictment, and a total minimum sentence of forty-five (45) and one-half years imprisonment and a total maximum sentence of ninety-one (91) years imprisonment on nine (9) other indictments to follow consecutively the life sentence. Sentence was suspended on the remaining indictments. Appellant failed to file post-trial motions or take an appeal from these judgments of sentence.</p>

While the proper procedure for attacking a guilty plea in 1975 (the time of the P.C.H.A. hearing) may have been by filing a petition for withdrawal of a guilty plea or by post-trial motions, see <em>Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth argues that only a few of the forty (40) bills of indictment were before the P.C.H.A. court and that not all of the forty (40) indictments are properly before us as well. We disagree. In his pro se P.C.H.A. petition appellant included all of the indictments upon which he was sentenced. Although the referral letter to the P.C.H.A. judge mentioned by number only the six (6) bills of indictment relating to the murder, it is clear that the denial of appellant’s <em>Douglas </em>rights occurred during a proceeding in which all of the judgments of sentence were entered.

      <p id="b473-11" data-blocks='[["BL_473.12",473,[207,2004,1115,306]]]'>Equally as frivolous is the Commonwealth’s contention that the present appeal was from the Post-Conviction courts denial of collateral relief on the grounds of ineffective assistance and not pursuant to that court’s order allowing appellant to pursue his direct appeal remedy. Although the notice of appeal is admittedly ambiguous, the brief filed on appellant’s behalf makes no reference to the earlier claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and is obviously addressed to appellant’s direct appeal contentions.</p>
