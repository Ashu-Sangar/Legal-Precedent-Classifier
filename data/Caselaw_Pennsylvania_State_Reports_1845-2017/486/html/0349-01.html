Approximately eight months later, on September 23, 1964, the Kesters entered into a written postnuptial agreement prepared by Wilson’s attorney and executed in the attorney’s presence. In the agreement each agreed to waive the right to elect against the other’s will. Myrtle Kester also agreed that she would devise whatever assets she received from Wilson’s estate to his son by an earlier- marriage. Similarly, Wilson agreed that if he survived Myrtle, he would bequeath and devise whatever he received from her estate to her brothers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the same time the postnuptial <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>agreement was signed, the Kesters executed wills.

A hearing was held before the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County. The court ruled that appellant was barred from testifying about the circumstances bearing on the postnuptial agreement by virtue of the Dead Man’s Statute, Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, § 5(e), 28 P.S. § 322,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> that her testimony would be disregarded and that therefore, she had failed to meet her burden of proving that the <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>postnuptial agreement was invalid.

        <em>gass </em>and that proof of either the absence of a reasonable provision or the absence of full and fair disclosure is sufficient to meet appellant’s burden of proof. First it should be noted that the language quoted by appellant in support of her position appears in an opinion announcing the judgment of the Court which only expresses the views of former Chief Justice Bell and of one other justice. Moreover, while it appears that the passage appellant quotes in her brief diverges from the <em>Hillegass </em>language, it is clear that the <em>Ratony </em>language does not represent the <em>Ratony </em>rationale nor affect a substantive change in the law. In another passage the <em>Ratony </em>opinion directly quotes the same language from <em>Hillegass </em>as is quoted here. <em>Ratony, </em>supra, <a href="/pa/443/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="443 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1936908" data-case-paths="/pa/443/0454-01">443 Pa. at 461</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=277%20A.2d%20791" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="277 A.2d 791">277 A.2d at 795</a>. The controlling language of <em>Hillegass </em>and <em>Ratony </em>clearly requires that both absence of a reasonable provision and absence of full and fair disclosure be proven by the party seeking to void the agreement. Additionally, even were the passage from <em>Ratony </em>quoted by appellant deemed controlling, appellant has misinterpreted it. The passage states that the appellant’s'burden of proof can be met by proving only the absence of a reasonable provision at the time of the agreement. Proof of only the absence of full and fair disclosure, however, would have been insufficient to shift the burden of proof.</p>
