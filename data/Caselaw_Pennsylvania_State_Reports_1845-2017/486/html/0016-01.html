    <p id="b96-8" data-blocks='[["BL_96.9",96,[280,971,1152,1332]]]'>The facts presented in this appeal are undisputed.- The appellant owns a parcel of land in Harmar and Indiana Townships, Allegheny County which is used as a truck terminal. The property does not abut on any public thoroughfare, except the Pennsylvania Turnpike, to which there is no access along appellant’s frontage. The only access to this parcel is by means of a right-of-way over abutting lands to Legislative Route 679. The Commonwealth filed a declaration of taking by which it condemned a portion of appellant’s right-of-way and raised the grade of Route 679. It is conceded that appellant is entitled to be compensated for the damages resulting from the* changing of the grade of the road. The dispute arises because appellant does not assert as its principal damage the taking of a part of the right-of-way or the elevation of the road grade. To the contrary, appellant seeks compensation for the impediment to its access during the construction period. As a result of the construction, access to the portion of Route 679 south of appellant’s right-of-way, required vehicles entering and leaving appellant’s parcel to travel 14 miles farther in each direction to reach the main highway system. It is asserted that this temporary inconvenience imposed upon appellant caused additional out-of-pocket costs in the form of salaries, gas, oil and additional wear and tear on the vehicles involved.</p>

The Court of Common Pleas accepted appellant’s interpretation of the statute, modified the Board of Viewers’ report in the instant case, and ordered that, at trial, the impact upon appellant’s property of the physical closing of Route 679 during the construction period should be an element to be considered, together with all other proper elements, in determining the <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>fair market value of appellant’s property immediately after the condemnation.

In this case the majority has concluded that the damages sought by appellant are damages which affect the entire community and are not damages <em>specially affecting </em>the appellant. I fail to understand how this legal conclusion can be reached since there has not been as yet a hearing. Appellant has not had the opportunity to prove whether damages <em>specially affecting </em>appellant as distinguished from damages generally affecting the entire community.

Because of that closing, vehicles seeking to leave and enter plaintiff’s property from a southerly direction were required to travel 14 additional miles in each direction.

The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argues that the effect upon the property of the temporary closing of L.R. 679 is not an element of damage in this condemnation case.</p>

    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[285,535,1149,770]]]'>If the Joint State Government Commission’s Comment does not apply to the facts in this case, it would be difficult to envision a factual matrix to which it would apply. Certainly the denial of access to the road while construction activity was in progress is part of the necessary time discount, inconvenience and other effects of the construction period. The Comment’s further statement that the after value of the property is the price which the condemnee would pay if he were to sell the remaining property to a third party immediately after the day of condemnation but before the completion of the improvement reflects the intent of the drafters that consideration be given to what would normally occur between the day of the condemnation and completion of the improvement; namely, construction activity to effectuate the purposes of the condemnation.</p>
    <p id="b106-5" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[282,1324,1149,966]]]'>Under § 602 of the Eminent Domain Code, the damages are the difference between the fair market value of the condemnee’s property immediately before the condemnation and as unaffected thereby and the fair market value of his remaining interest after the condemnation and as affected thereby. The trier of facts is mandated by this provision to determine the price which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the property immediately after the condemnation. It is obvious that if the property were placed on the market for sale immediately after the condemnation, a prospective purchaser would give consideration to the fact that for a certain period of time following the condemnation, the use of the property would be impeded by the Commonwealth’s construction activity. If the property would be affected thereby, the price would reflect the impaired use. Since that is a factor which a prospective purchaser would consider in determining the price to pay, it is a factor which similarly should be considered by the trier of facts.</p>

The Comment note must be taken with some reservation. § 606 refers to <em>(‘damages . . . </em>affecting the remaining property. . . . ’) It is not expected that this language alters cases prohibiting loss from diversion of traffic, (§ 606-1.217) remote or speculative possibilities, (§ 606-1.211) or negligent operation of the improvement.

During the construction period the property owner suffered a loss of rentals as a result of the construction activity. In an eminent domain action to recover damages, our Supreme Court held that the property owner was entitled to introduce evidence of the loss of rents as affecting market value:</p>
    <blockquote id="b107-7" data-blocks='[["BL_107.7",107,[222,2044,1104,256]],["BL_108.1",108,[328,263,1105,139]]]'>“Here is a piece of land formerly level with the street.

    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[285,431,1148,944]]]'>In the <em>Westinghouse </em>case, the Court did not hold that the property owner was entitled to recover the amount of the lost rentals as a separate and distinct item of damage. It specifically held that the loss of rents could not be shown as an independent item of damage. The Court did, however, allow consideration of the lost rentals to be considered in determining the market value. Similarly, in the instant case, the property owner should be permitted to prove the effect on its property of the road closing south of its right-of-way. It may show the amount of its increased costs resulting from the need of its vehicles to travel the greater distance. The increased costs, however, are not to be considered as a separate and independent item of damage but merely as an element in determining the market value of the property after the condemnation. Stated somewhat differently, plaintiff is not entitled to be compensated for the impairment of its business; it is entitled to be compensated for the impairment of its real estate.</p>

In <em>Wolf </em>it was held that the construction of a medial barrier, which made it impossible for a vehicle to make left turns onto and off of the subject property, was an exercise of the police power and did not give rise to a claim for damages. In <em>Hession, </em>the property owner was foreclosed from recovery of damages arising from the conversion of a full cross intersection into a T-intersection with the result that in one of four directions it was necessary to travel a short additional distance. Other cases which have reached similar results under varying factual situations are: <em>Commonwealth v.

In the case before me, however, the construction activity which brought a denial of the road access was the direct consequence of the exercise of the power of eminent domain, since the power of eminent domain was exercised for the very purpose of bringing about the construction of a widened and improved road.</p>

Although these cases arose in the context of whether the claim for damages is one properly asserted in an eminent domain action as distinguished from a negligence action, the policy of the law is therein clearly expressed: The property owner has a right to compensation in an eminent domain action for the damages which directly and immediately flow from the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
