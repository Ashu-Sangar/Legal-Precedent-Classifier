        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant, fifteen years old at the time of arrest, asserts that an inculpatory statement he gave to police during custodial interrogation should have been suppressed. Appellant\u2019s claim is based on this Court\u2019s requirement that before waiving Miranda rights a juvenile must be afforded an opportunity to consult with an attorney, parent or other \u201cinterested adult.\u201d The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that the prison counselor it made available to appellant and with whom appellant spoke is an \u201cinterested adult\u201d for purposes of this rule. We agree with appellant, reverse judgment of sentence and grant appellant a new trial.\nOn October 30, 1976, police arrested appellant and took him to the juvenile section of the Dauphin County Prison. The following day, after two unsuccessful attempts to contact appellant\u2019s mother, police sought to question appellant. In an attempt to provide appellant the required access to an interested adult, the police called upon Ralph Reed, a counselor of adult prisoners at the prison. Before becoming a prison counselor Reed had served as a county detective, a probation officer and a police officer. During their brief conference of five minutes, Reed advised appellant to \u201ccooperate with the police and tell them what happened.\u201d Following the conversation with Reed, appellant gave police an incriminating statement.\nAfter transfer to the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, appellant unsuccessfully moved to suppress the statement. In a non-jury trial, appellant was convicted of aggravated assault. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced. A divided Superior Court affirmed the conviction and this Court granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nThe Commonwealth has the burden of establishing that, prior to waiving fifth amendment rights, a juvenile had the opportunity to consult with an \u201cinterested adult.\u201d This individual must be both interested in the juvenile\u2019s welfare and informed and aware of the juvenile\u2019s fifth and sixth amendment rights. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Barnes, 482 Pa. 555, 394 A.2d 461 (1978). This Court\u2019s \u201cinterested adult\u201d cases rest upon a concern that juvenile immaturity may preclude self-protection from overbearing police interrogation. The rule intends that overbearance may be avoided by consultation with individuals such as a \u201clawyer, adult relative or friend,\u201d who can provide a juvenile with \u201cthe protection which his own immaturity could not.\u201d Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 54, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 1213, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962). Accord, Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948).\nThe Commonwealth contends that Reed was an \u201cinterested adult\u201d based on his past employment as a youth counselor. Reed, however, must exhibit a concern for the juvenile similar to that of either lawyer or parent. As Judge Spaeth, joined by Judge Cercone, dissenting in the Superior Court, observed\n\u201cAny other interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s requirement of an \u2018interested adult\u2019 would make no sense, for it would read the Court as saying that its requirement could be satisfied in either of two, mutually inconsistent, ways: either by affording the juvenile access to one of two persons vitally interested in his welfare \u2014 an attorney or parent \u2014 or by affording him access to a person only casually interested.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Thomas, 258 Pa.Super. 332, 392 A.2d 820 (1978). The record reflects that Reed\u2019s concern cannot be equated with that of an attorney, professionally representing the juvenile\u2019s interest. Nor can Reed\u2019s concern be equated with that of a parent. The Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide appellant the required opportunity to consult with an \u201cinterested adult\u201d as our case law mandates, compels the suppression of appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and a new trial granted.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J., dissent.\n. The consultation took place in the interrogation room where police officers assigned to question appellant were at all times either in the room or just outside, but able to overhear the conversation.\n. This case was reassigned to the writer on September 21, 1979, for the purpose of preparing an opinion expressing the views of a majority of this Court.\n. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Walker, 477 Pa. 370, 383 A.2d 1253 (1978); Commonwealth v. Smith, 472 Pa. 492, 372 A.2d 797 (1977); Commonwealth v. Lee, 470 Pa. 401, 368 A.2d 690 (1977); Commonwealth v. Logan, 468 Pa. 424, 364 A.2d 266 (1976); Commonwealth v. Stanton, 466 Pa. 143, 351 A.2d 663 (1976); Commonwealth v. Smith, 465 Pa. 310, 350 A.2d 410 (1976); Commonwealth v. Chaney, 465 Pa. 407, 350 A.2d 829 (1975); Commonwealth v. Starkes, 461 Pa. 178, 335 A.2d 698 (1975); Commonwealth v. McCutchen, 463 Pa. 90, 343 A.2d 669, cert. denied, 424 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 1147, 47 L.Ed.2d 341 (1975) and Commonwealth v. Roane, 459 Pa. 389, 329 A.2d 286 (1974).\n. This Court has been unwilling to permit dilution of the informed interested adult requirement. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Hackett, 484 Pa. 43, 398 A.2d 651 (1979); Commonwealth v. Barnes, 482 Pa. 555, 394 A.2d 461 (1978); Commonwealth v. Walker, 477 Pa. 370, 383 A.2d 1253 (1978); Commonwealth v. Hailey, 470 Pa. 488, 368 A.2d 1261 (1977). In Commonwealth v. Smith, 472 Pa. 492, 372 A.2d 797 (1977), the Court emphasized the importance of ensuring that juvenile waiver rules do not become merely a technical ritual of police practice. The Court held that the father\u2019s unwillingness to afford his son the counsel of an \u201cinterested adult\u201d in no way negated the Commonwealth\u2019s obligation to provide\u00b0such a consultation. Id., 472 Pa. at 502-03, 372 A.2d at 802.\n. Although a substantial question exists as to whether appellant was provided a private consultation with the adult, see Commonwealth v. Hailey, 470 Pa. 488, 368 A.2d 1261 (1977), we need not reach that issue since our decision today grants appellant a new trial. Nor do we decide whether police attempts to contact appellant\u2019s mother were sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the Commonwealth make reasonable efforts to secure an accused juvenile access to parental advice. See Commonwealth v. Webster, 466 Pa. 314, 353 A.2d 372 (1976).",

        "text": "FLAHERTY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI cannot agree with the majority\u2019s failure to characterize prison counselor Reed as an \u201cinterested adult.\u201d We should not require that the intensity of interest as an \u201cinterested adult\u201d equal that of a parent, as one is a blood relationship while the other is that of a trained professional. Rather, the proper test for determining whether one qualifies as an interested adult is whether that person holds the accused\u2019s interest and welfare, as opposed to the prosecution\u2019s interest, as his primary concern.\nI believe Mr. Reed met this test. He was a professional counselor, concerned with the problems of troubled youths. He was in no way connected with the prosecution, so there was no risk that his interest would be swayed from the side of the appellant to the side of the prosecution. It cannot be said, as a matter of law, that a prison counselor is so connected with the interests of the prosecution as to render him uninterested in the welfare of the prisoner. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of sentence.",
