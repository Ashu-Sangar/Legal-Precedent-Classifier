Thereafter, Cheryl Keefer, a purported friend of Decedent, filed a petition with the Register for the grant of letters of administration which listed the heirs and personal assets of Decedent as “unknown” and indicated that there was no real estate. The Register refused to grant letters to Keefer because she did not have Decedent’s death certifícate, was not his next of kin, and, therefore, was not a person entitled to letters under the PEF Code. 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3155(b). In response, Keefer, through her attorney, filed a petition on February 1, 2006 to authorize the Register to issue letters to her without producing a death certificate and further directing the Mon Valley Hospital (“Hospital”) to release the remains of Decedent for a funeral and burial. Attached to this petition was a copy of a purported power of attorney executed by Decedent to her on January 10, 2006. In this petition, Keefer asserted that she had been a friend of the Decedent for 30 years and that he was unmarried at the time of his death, had no children or relatives, and that his parents had predeceased him. Keefer further reported that the Hospital would not release the body to her for burial because she was not a relative and that Decedent’s remains would only be released to her if she were appointed to handle Decedent’s estate. Furthermore, Keefer contended that she could not have funeral and burial services without estate assets to pay for these expenses, as well as other financial obligations of the estate.</p>

In compliance with this order, the Register issued letters to Keefer, but did not secure a bond from her.

The orphan’s court granted Appellee’s petition, issued an order (“Dorsey Order”) removing Keefer as administratrix, and required Keefer to deliver to Appellee the custody and possession of Decedent’s estate’s assets. The court also authorized and directed the Register to grant letters to Appellee upon presentation of an appropriate petition for the grant of letters.

Specifically, the Commonwealth Court reviewed the duties of a register under the PEF Code and its provisions holding a register accountable for Pennsylvania’s bonding requirements, in the event a bond was not secured when “required by law.” 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3172. The court went on to trace the evolution of governmental and official immunity, focusing on the Tort Claims Act’s general provision granting immunity from liability for claims against a local agency for damages, and the exceptions provided therein. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8541, 8542. The Commonwealth Court also surveyed the exceptions to government immunity contained in Section 8542, determining that none of the exceptions were applicable to the matter before it. The court then considered our Court’s recent determination in <em>Meyer v. Comty. Coll, of Beaver Cnty., </em><a href="/pa/606/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="606 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="4199033" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0539-01">606 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/pa/606/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.3d 499" data-case-ids="4199033,7288097" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0539-01,/a3d/2/0499-01">2 A.3d 499</a> (2010). The Commonwealth Court explained that, in <em>Meyer, </em>our Court rejected the Commonwealth Court’s broad construe<a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>tion of immunity, reasoned that the language of the Tort Claims Act conferring immunity reflected traditional tort jurisprudence, and ultimately concluded that immunity “does not extend to all statutory causes of action,” but only to those sounding in tort. <em>Meyer, <a href="/pa/606/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 A.3d 499" data-case-ids="4199033,7288097" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0539-01,/a3d/2/0499-01">2 </a></em><a href="/pa/606/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 A.3d 499" data-case-ids="4199033,7288097" data-case-paths="/pa/606/0539-01,/a3d/2/0499-01">A.3d at </a>503 &amp; n. 6. Thus, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that, after <em>Meyer, </em>it could not engage in a mechanical approach to governmental immunity whereby a local agency is found to be immune unless the claim falls within one of the eight exceptions found in Section 8542 of the Act. Additionally, the court distinguished <em>Antonis </em>on the grounds that, in that case, the statute upon which the claim was based spoke of “neglect,” a tort concept, and no such requirement was present in the PEF Code. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Register as a matter of law pursuant to Section 8541.</p>

The Commonwealth Court, focusing on the orphan’s court’s directive to issue letters to Keefer, found the question of whether the Register’s actions were authorized by the court’s order regarding Keefer was a question of material fact for the fact-finder, and, thus, concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate. Similarly, the court denied Appellee’s cross-motion for summary judgment, as it determined that the amount of the bond required by the PEF Code was a factual issue for determination at trial. Thus, the Commonwealth Court found the Register was permitted to raise the defense of official immunity, but that this was a fact issue for trial, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.

Acknowledging our decision in <em>Meyer </em>and our Court’s determination therein that governmental immunity does not extend to all statutory causes of action but only to tort claims, Appellants maintain that the first step in an immunity analysis, one which the Commonwealth Court failed to perform, is to determine whether the statutory claim at issue sounds in contract or tort.

While recognizing Appellee’s claim does not speak of negligence, Appellants offer that neither do intentional torts or strict liability claims; thus, according to Appellants, the lack of proof of negligence is not dispositive.

Appellants first note that the statute at issue in that case required the recorder of deeds to index every recorded deed and mortgage “in its appropriate place and manner[,] ... and in case he neglects to do so[,] he and his sureties shall be liable in damages to any person aggrieved by such neglect.” <em>Antonis, </em><a href="/a2d/821/0666-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="821 A.2d 666" data-case-ids="9133525" data-case-paths="/a2d/821/0666-01">821 A.2d at 668</a> (quoting Section 2 of the County Code, 16 P.S. § 9852). The plaintiff in <em>Antonis </em>filed a claim against the recorder of deeds for failing to perform the official duty of indexing a mortgage and note, which failure left the plaintiff unable to recover a debt owed on the note. The <em>Antonis </em>court explained that the note constituted property and that the improper indexing caused economic injury, but concluded none of the eight exceptions to immunity in Section 8542 of the Tort Claims Act applied and so found the recorder of deeds immune from liability. Appellants develop that the presence of the term “neglect” in the statute at issue in <em>Antonis, </em>and its absence in 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3172, is a distinction without a difference, as the duty in both statutes is stated in mandatory terms (the indexing of mortgages and bond requirement), and, given that a recorder must index every mortgage, “neglect” is not synonymous with negligence, but must mean a failure to record. Thus, according to Appellants, the Commonwealth <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>Court’s analysis of the applicability of the Tort Claims Act in <em>Antonis </em>is not founded on the presence (or absence) of negligence.</p>

The parties and lower tribunals have directed their argument to Section 8541 of the Tort Claims Act, which speaks to “governmental immunity,” and the liability of a “local agency.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8541. “Local agency” is defined as “[a] government unit other than the Commonwealth government.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8501. Thus, by its terms, Section 8541 does not directly apply to individuals. Section 8545, however, concerning “official liability,” speaks to the liability of an employee of a local agency. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8545. Specifically, Section 8545 provides that “[a]n employee of a local agency is liable for civil damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by acts of the employee which are within the scope of his office or duties only to the same extent as his employing local agency and subject to the limitations imposed by this subchapter.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20562" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="104 A. 562">Id.</a> </em>Thus, in limiting the liability of the employee of a local agency to the liability of the local agency for which he or she is acting, the Tort Claims Act links concepts of official liability to concepts of governmental immunity.</p>

As a general proposition, Section 1933 of the SCA provides that, in the event of a conflict, a specific provision (Section 3172 imposing liability on the register specifically) governs over the more general provision (Section 8545 providing immunity from damages generally). 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1933. Thus, the proposition of liability on the register would seemingly trump the immunity of the Tort Claims Act under principles of statutory construction. Yet, an additional complication concerning the application of relevant cannons of statutory construction is at play. Section 1936 of the SCA provides that later enacted statutes should generally control over earlier, conflicting statutes. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1936. As the Tort Claims Act was enacted later than Section 3172 and the PEF Code, Section 1933 would suggest the general immunity of the later statute was intended by the legislature to control over the specific, earlier enacted provision imposing liability on the register. <em>See generally </em>Karl N.

Specifically, this section grants official immunity for such employees when, <em>inter alia, </em>“the conduct of the employee which gave rise to the claim was authorized or required by law, or that he in good faith reasonably believed the conduct was authorized or required by law.” <em><a href="/pa/481/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="481 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1747293" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0540-01">Id.</a></em>

As noted above, Appellee contends that Section 3172 imposes absolute liability on a register who not does secure a bond, <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>and, thus, the question of official immunity is a legal question to be decided by the court. The Register asserts that there exists material questions of fact regarding whether his failure to require a bond from Keefer was an exercise of judgment, and, therefore, discretionary, or whether it was the breach of an absolute duty. According to the Register, this issue of material fact is in dispute and, as such, is a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[283,754,1156,1269]]]'>The Commonwealth Court, focusing on the orphan’s court’s directive to issue letters to Keefer, found the question of official immunity with respect to whether the Register’s actions were authorized by the court’s order involved determining whether the Register’s conduct in not requiring a bond from Keefer was authorized or required by law; or, even if not lawful, whether he in good faith reasonably believed that his conduct was authorized or required by law. These determinations, according to the court, involved the exercise of judgment by the Register in the context of the Register’s initial refusal to grant the letters to Keefer, the orphan’s court’s immediate directive to issue the letters to Keefer, and the court’s subsequent order to issue letters to Dorsey upon presentation of an appropriate petition. In these circumstances, and in the context of a motion for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court opined that there existed a genuine issue of material fact which was for resolution by the fact-finder. Therefore, the court found summary judgment to be inappropriate. Moreover, the court determined that the amount of the bond required by the PEF Code was a factual issue for determination at trial. Thus, the Commonwealth Court found the Register was permitted to raise the defense of official immunity, but that this was an issue for the fact-finder, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>

In addition, the circumstances surrounding the issu<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>anee of the orders must also be considered, including that the orphan’s court’s Keefer Order, directing the issuance of letters, which would facilitate the funeral and burial of the Decedent, came on the heels of the Register refusing to issue letters to Keefer only the day before, at least suggesting an urgency to issuing the letters.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[276,624,1153,1375]]]'>First, we note that the standard in determining official immunity is objective — whether the public official’s conduct was authorized or required by law, or that he in good faith reasonably believed the conduct was authorized or required by law. Further, a question of official immunity is a preliminary matter requiring determination before trial. As noted by the Register, while this issue is one of first impression, by analogy to good faith qualified immunity in federal claims, “[t]he entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.” Appellant’s Brief at 21 (quoting <em>Hunter v. Bryant, </em><a href="/us/502/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="502 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6223326" data-case-paths="/us/502/0224-01">502 U.S. 224</a>, 227, <a href="/us/502/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="502 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6223326" data-case-paths="/us/502/0224-01">112 S.Ct. 534</a>, <a href="/us/502/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="502 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6223326" data-case-paths="/us/502/0224-01">116 L.Ed.2d 589</a> (1991)). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court suggested that “immunity ordinarily should be decided by the court long before trial.” <em>Hunter, </em><a href="/us/502/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="502 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6223326" data-case-paths="/us/502/0224-01">502 U.S. at 228</a>, <a href="/us/502/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="502 U.S. 224" data-case-ids="6223326" data-case-paths="/us/502/0224-01">112 S.Ct. 534</a>. Viewed as an immunity from suit, we believe it prudent that a trial court undertake this analysis prior to trial, possibly obviating the need for trial. Additionally, we find that a court is more suited to analyze the applicable law, interpret relevant court orders, and to discern the reasonable beliefs of a public official — a register of wills — in the performance of his official duties. Finally, we note that, to the extent necessary, a court may as a preliminary matter make necessary findings of fact (and ultimately conclusions of law) through a preliminary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, based upon these considerations, we hold that the issue of official immunity is a preliminary question for resolution by the court.</p>

However, we deem it prudent that this matter be remanded to the orphan’s court for reconsideration of the issue of official immunity, consistent with our decision today.</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[168,529,1151,1320]]]'>Finally, and related to our grant of allocatur on the issue of whether a court or jury determines questions of official immunity, even if the Register was not entitled to official immunity, we do not believe that Appellee is entitled to relief as a matter of law, as there is a material fact as to what damages accrued to Appellee as a result of the Register’s failure to require a bond. 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 3172 (“If any register shall grant letters without having taken such bond as required by law, he and his surety shall be liable to pay all damages which shall accrue to any person by reason thereof.”). The requirement of “such bond as required by law,” might have been nominal in light of the circumstances of this case. To the extent this would impact damages owed to Appellee as a result of the Register’s failure to require a bond, the matter should be resolved on a developed factual record with Appellants bearing the burden of proof. Indeed, the fact that the Register had refused to issue the letters in the first instance upon the attestation of a non-relative who was unable to present a death certification brings into question whether the Register either would have, or could reasonably have, required only nominal security, once he was directed by the orphan’s court to issue the letters. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court properly vacated the trial court’s order in this regard and remanded the matter to the orphan’s court for further proceedings.</p>
