In response, the federal and state governments implemented various pricing reforms and cost-containment measures within reimbursement systems.

To enable the government to calculate those rebates, manufacturers must submit Average Manufacturer Prices (“AMPs”) and “best prices” to the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) on a regular basis. <em>See id. </em>§ 1396r-8(b)(3). AMPs are defined as “the average price paid to the manufacturer for the drug in the United States by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade [after deducting] customary prompt pay discounts.” <em>Id. </em>§ 1396r-8(k)(l). “Best price” generally means the lowest price available from the manufacturer during the rebate period, inclusive of discounts and other rebates. <em>Id. </em>§ 1396r-8(c)(l)(C)(ii). The main rebate is calculated by multiplying the total units of a drug purchased under a state program in the rebate period by the greater of: 1) the difference between AMP and best price for the drug, or 2) a minimum rebate percentage of the AMP, currently 23.1 percent. <em>See id. </em>§ 1396r-8(c)(1). Additional rebates are provided, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>1396r-8(c)(2), and states have the ability to impose others.

As further discussed below, in the relevant passage of Mr. WarrenBoulton’s testimony, he did not say that rebates are unrelated in an economic sense to the asserted overpayments. In point of fact, he likened rebates to “backwash” relative to payments, and merely indicated that he intended to focus exclusively on the agencies’ reimbursement payments to pharmacists to the exclusion of the rebates in his damages estimates. <em>See </em>N.T., August 25, 2010, at 2168.</p>

While offering apologia to the effect that it was understandable ”[t]hat the same detailed testimony was not offered to a jury” at the BMS trial, the Commonwealth Court cited no authority which would permit it to rely on evidence adduced at a distinct trial where the relevant witness was not subject to cross-examination by BMS’s counsel.</p>
      <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[206,1969,1115,386]]]'>Compounding such irregularities, the Commonwealth Court also expressly relied on a report from Mr. Warren-Boulton which had not been introduced or admitted into evidence at trial. <em>See, e.g., TAP, </em><a href="/a3d/36/1197-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="36 A.3d 1197" data-case-ids="7300145" data-case-paths="/a3d/36/1197-01">36 A.3d at 1267</a> ("Here, the trial judge relied on the Commonwealth’s damage expert, Dr. Warren-Bouto’s Revised Expert Report, dated August 9, 2010[,] ... to determine the amount of restoration.”); <em>see also </em>Letter of William F.

There can be no dispute that, per express statutory command, DOA was provided with BMS's AMP data throughout the relevant time period, <em>see, e.g., </em>72 P.S. § 3761— 704(c), and that DOA had actual purchase data from audited pharmacies. With such information in hand, it is not clear why the Commonwealth Court did not believe Mr. Snedden when he said that he was not deceived by BMS or any other drug manufacturer providing its average manufacturer prices per the statute. Indeed, as BMS stresses, the informational aspect of the revised injunction imposed by the Commonwealth Court requires only that BMS provide DPW and DOA with the same AMP data which it has been providing to DOA for the last twenty years, so that it does not appear that, per the injunction, Mr. Snedden would gain any additional information in any event.</p>

To the extent the Commonwealth suggests that DPW and DOA should always have had both a pure AMP or WAC-based pricing system and the substantial rebates required per federal and state law, it ignores its own failure to address the political hurdles involved in altering ■ reimbursement formulas, <em>see, </em>e.g., N.T., August 25, 2010, at 2321 <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>(reflecting Mr. Warren-Boulton's affirmation that he was not considering “the political process, the political donations, the lobbying, the industry lobbying,” but, rather, was merely addressing what might have been paid to pharmacies to ensure access in the abstract, free of any political considerations), and the fact that remedial measures including discounts from AWP and rebates were implemented in response to the drawbacks of industry conventions in the first instance.</p>

By failing to respond substantively to BMS’s evidence that rebates greatly exceeded the "restorative” damages fashioned by the Commonwealth Court, however, the Commonwealth proved nothing injurious to its agencies resulting from the governing reimbursement/rebate regimes and the price reporting which occurred thereunder.</p>

The OAJC, based upon its reasoning that the Commonwealth inappropriately disregarded the rebate issue and the lower court erred in addressing the question, would simply reverse the case for entry of judgment in favor of Bristol Myers Squibb Company (BMS), thus ending the case. I am not certain, however, that the errors articulated by the OAJC with regard to the rebate issue necessarily nullify the judgment upon liability or conclude this case entirely concerning alleged violations of consumer protection and trade practices in terms of damages, counsel fees or cost. For this reason, I believe a remand to the Commonwealth Court for further consideration of the case in light of the OAJC’s analysis of the rebate issue would be appropriate so that the lower court, in the first instance, may decide if the rebate issue as discussed in the OAJC puts an end to the litigation. A remand will provide the parties and the court with a full opportunity for hearing in order to consider how the rebate issue affects the verdict and all aspects of this complex litigation.</p>
