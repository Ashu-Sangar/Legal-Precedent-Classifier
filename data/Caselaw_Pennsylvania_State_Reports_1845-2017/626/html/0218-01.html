The court agreed with the referee that Section 221.21 operates to relieve Reliance of all liability to indemnify Warrantech under the service contracts for claims arising from product breakdowns that occurred after November 2, 2001. The court observed that based on the plain language of Section 221.21 <em>(see supra </em>note 7), all insurance policies with “risks in effect” at the time a liquidation order is issued are subject to the statutory provision, and that coverage under these policies continues for, at most, a period of thirty days following entry of liquidation. The court reasoned that Section 221.21 applies to the Reliance Policies because, pursuant to the cancellation of coverage provision, Reliance remained at risk for liability. The court concluded that the “risks in effect” at the time of Reliance’s liquidation consisted of the possibility that Warrantech would pay for a claim arising from a product breakdown under one if its service contracts issued in either 1999 or 2000, which, in turn, would trigger Reliance’s obligation to indemnify Warrantech for the sums paid.</p>

Warrantech contends that the Commonwealth Court misapplied Section 221.21 when it assigned a zero value to Warrantech’s claims against the Reliance estate for reimbursement of sums that it paid under service contracts as a result of claims arising from product breakdowns that occurred after November 2, 2001.

Thus, Warrantech avers that the contractual liability assumed by Reliance under the Reliance Policies “vested” when Warrantech issued service contracts to consumers in 1999 and 2000, and that neither cancellation of the policies nor application of Section 221.21 can relieve Reliance of its obligation to indemnify Warrantech for claims arising under the service contracts as a result of product breakdowns.

Essentially, Warrantech argues that Section 221.21 exclusively applies to claims-made policies.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Because the Reliance Policies were terminated in 2000, Warrantech posits that Section 221.21 does not apply to these policies given that they were not “insurance [policies] in effect” at the time of liquidation, notwithstanding that Reliance remained obligated to pay benefits thereunder.</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[275,890,1152,1203]]]'>Moreover, Warrantech contends that even if Section 221.21 applied to the Reliance Policies so that coverage for all “risks in effect” at the time of liquidation are terminated no later than thirty days after liquidation, Reliance nonetheless remains liable for consumer claims arising from product breakdowns that occurred after November 2, 2001, because coverage for these claims was triggered prior to liquidation. Citing to case law from other jurisdictions, as well as to 45 C.J.S. Insurance § 640, n.l (2012), Warrantech maintains that coverage under an insurance policy must be “triggered” by an event that occurs during the applicable policy period. <em>See Montrose Chem.

Warrantech surmises that under a service contract reimbursement insurance policy, the event triggering coverage is the issuance of the service contracts by the insured. Warrantech rejects the referee’s conclusion that the triggering event is the occurrence of product breakdowns covered by the service contracts or the resulting consumer claims because these breakdowns and corresponding claims can occur both during and after the service contract reimbursement insurance policy period ends, as was the case with the Reliance Policies.</p>

Warrantech alludes to the “multiple trigger” theory of liability adopted in this line of cases where an insurer is obligated to indemnify for asbestosis related injuries if any of the following occurs while the insurer is at risk: exposure to asbestos, development of the pathology, or manifestation of the disease. <em>Id. </em>at 506. Warrantech likens the issuance of the service contracts to asbestos exposure, and likens consumer claims for product breakdowns under the service contracts to the manifestation of bodily injury from asbestos exposure. Just as coverage under the liability insurance policies in the asbestosis cases is triggered by the exposure to asbestos (and not only its manifestation), Warrantech contends that coverage under service contract reimbursement insurance policies, like the Reliance Policies, is triggered by the issuance of service contracts during the applicable policy period (and not the eventual claims for product breakdowns).</p>

Rather, Warrantech asserts that coverage under the Reliance Policies was triggered before liquidation when Warrantech issued the service contracts in 1999 and 2000. Thus, according to Warrantech, the language in Section 221.21 terminating coverage for all “risks in effect” thirty days after the entry of a liquidation order has no bearing on Warrantech’s claims against the Reliance estate.</p>

Warrantech maintains that the purpose of Section 221.21, entitled “Continuance of Cover<a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>age,” is to give policyholders time to learn of their insurance carrier’s insolvency and to seek replacement insurance. Warrantech avers that pursuant to the Commonwealth Court’s construction of Section 221.21, companies, like itself, will be unable to secure replacement insurance for service contracts issued prior to the date of their insurer’s liquidation. Moreover, Warrantech points to the injustice of requiring policyholders to purchase replacement insurance when their previous policies, purchased at great cost, guaranteed coverage in perpetuity.</p>

The Liquidator maintains that a plain language reading of Section 221.21 establishes that all potential liabilities and claims against an insolvent insurer’s estate are terminated no later than thirty days after the entry of a liquidation order with respect to “risks in effect” at the time of liquidation. The Liquidator reasons that if there were “risks in effect” under the, albeit cancelled, Reliance Policies at the time Reliance entered liquidation, then coverage for those risks did not continue past November 2, 2001.</p>

The Liquidator therefore concludes that the “risks in effect” imposed by the Reliance Policies is the potential for consumer claims arising from product breakdowns under any one of Warrantech’s service contracts issued in 1999 and 2000. Accordingly, the Liquidator contends that Section 221.21, which statutorily discontinues insurance coverage with respect to “risks in effect” at the time of liquidation, when applied to the Reliance Policies, precludes Warrantech from seeking reimbursement for consumer claims arising from product breakdowns which occurred subsequent to November <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>2, 2001, thirty days after the Commonwealth Court issued its order of liquidation.</p>

The Liquidator observes that the plain language of Section 221.21 says “risks in effect,” not “policy periods in effect.” Accordingly, the Liquidator argues that the “Effect of Cancellation” provision in the Reliance Policies does not trump the statutory cutoff of “risks in effect” mandated by Section 221.21.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[176,1026,1153,849]]]'>Finally, while recognizing that the termination of coverage mandated by Section 221.21 might work some hardships, the Liquidator contends that the provision is reasonable and necessary to facilitate the equitable and uniform handling of claims in an insolvent insurer’s estate.

Given the interplay between Sections 221.20(d) and 221.21, it is apparent that the General Assembly adopted Section 221.21 to allow insureds the opportunity to avoid gaps in coverage when their insurers unexpectedly enter liquidation. Tellingly, Section 221.21 is titled “Continuance of Coverage.” But for Section 221.21 providing policyholders of insurers entering liquidation a thirty-day window to acquire replacement insurance, Section 221.20(d) would cut off coverage to every policyholder whose insurer enters liquidation as of the date the petition for liquidation is filed, without notice and an opportunity to seek replacement coverage.</p>

The fact that Warrantech cannot benefit from the Section 221.21 legislatively created exception does not justify the formation of a new exclusion for Warrantech which the legislature did not provide.

It follows that the liquidator believed there was some chance, however small, that the POCs might ultimately have a non-zero value. When, however, the Commonwealth Court ordered that the claims be elevated to level (b), the liquidator assigned them an automatic value of zero based on Section 521.</p>
