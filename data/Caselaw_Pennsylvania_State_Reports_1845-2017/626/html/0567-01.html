    <p id="b622-5" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[276,531,1151,946]]]'>The Commonwealth charged Appellee with first-degree murder, conspiracy, and related offenses and notified him of its intent to seek the death penalty in connection with the 1986 death of sixteen-year old Maureen Dunne, who was brutally stabbed while she lay sleeping in bed with her boyfriend, Gregory Ogrod.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> At Appellee’s 1988 trial, the Commonwealth presented evidence that Appellee orchestrated a conspiracy to kill the victims with Marvin Spence, James Gray, and Keith Barrett. In the early morning hours of July 31, 1986, three men entered Ogrod’s home and repeatedly stabbed the couple and clubbed them with crowbars. Despite this unforeseen attack, Ogrod got up and fought off his assailants. Nevertheless, Dunne died from a stab wound to the heart. As the perpetrators fled, Ogrod recognized Spence as one of his attackers. Appellee, who lived in Ogrod’s home, knew Ogrod and Dunne were sleeping in the basement and was the only person, aside from Ogrod and his brother, who had a key to the home.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.7",622,[275,1512,1148,420]],["BL_623.1",623,[169,297,1148,413]]]'>Although evidence showed Appellee and Spence directed the conspiracy, the men wanted Ogrod killed for different reasons. Appellee’s aversion towards Ogrod developed in the spring of 1986 after Ogrod’s brother invited Appellee to live in the home he and Ogrod shared. Even though Appellee managed to live there rent free and stored equipment for his landscaping and snow removal business in Ogrod’s garage, Appellee did not get along with Ogrod. When Ogrod asked Appellee to move out <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>in July 1986, Appellee threatened to throw Ogrod out of his own home if he did not “cool out.” Several days later, Appellee moved all of Ogrod’s belongings from his bedroom to the basement "without his permission. In contrast, Spence wanted Ogrod killed as a result of a drug-related dispute. Once Appellee and Spence discovered their shared hatred for Ogrod, they worked together to bring their plan to have Ogrod killed to fruition.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[171,733,1148,673]]]'>Appellee initially sought to hire an assassin to murder Ogrod. Appellee first contacted Edgar Torres to find a hitman “to bump someone off for money.” When Torres asserted this task would cost him considerable money, Appellee assured Torres he would pay. Appellee subsequently gave Torres photographs of the victims and met with alleged assassins. Eventually, Torres told Appellee he could not find an individual for the job and refused to participate in Appellee’s plan. Appellee and Spence offered another potential hitman named David Carter $5,000 to kill Ogrod and Dunne. While Carter initially agreed to this plan, Appellee and Spence’s contract with Carter fell through as the men could not agree on the manner in which Carter would kill the victims.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[170,1439,1149,628]]]'>At trial, several witnesses connected Appellee to the attack on Ogrod and Dunne, which occurred at 4:00 a.m. on July 31, 1986. Jeffrey Horoschak stated that when he called Ogrod’s home at 1:45 a.m. that morning, Appellee told him Ogrod was asleep. Edward May testified that at 3:30 a.m., he gave a ride to Spence, Barrett, and Gray to a location near Ogrod’s home, where the men met with a fourth individual who resembled Appellee and drove a truck similar to the one Appellee owned. Appellee’s girlfriend, Wendy Rosenblum, testified that, at 5:00 a.m., Appellee called to tell her Ogrod was dead and came to her apartment through the basement, visibly shaking and sweating.</p>

Rosenblum claimed Appellee asked her to tell police he had been at her apartment all night and ordered her to obtain and destroy the photographs of the victims he had given to Torres to identify the individuals he wanted killed. <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>Rosenblum stated that, a week after the murders occurred, she saw Appellee take a crowbar out of the basement of her apartment, conceal it in his pants, and throw it in a nearby dumpster.</p>
    <p id="b624-4" data-blocks='[["BL_624.4",624,[283,529,1152,782]]]'>At the conclusion of the trial, the jury convicted Appellee of murder, conspiracy, aggravated assault, and possession of an instrument of crime. At the penalty hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances as Appellee conspired to pay another person to kill the victims and created a grave risk to Ogrod during the attack. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(2),(5). Finding no mitigating circumstances, the jury sentenced Appellee to death on July 17, 1988, which this Court affirmed on June 30, 1993. <em>Commonwealth v.

The first witness Appellee chose to call was Ms. Judy Pezola, who taught Appellee at the Ashbourne School for children with special needs in her first year of teaching in 1974 after being certified in special education. Remembering back thirty years, Ms. Pezola recalled that ten-year-old Appellee worked at a first or second grade level and “needed structure and individualized attention to stay focused on his assignments and to work independently.” As Appellee was labeled “brain injured,” Ms. Pezola claimed “as far as [she] knew, kids who were labeled brain injured were educably mentally retarded.” N.T., <em>Atkins </em>Hearing, 5/11/11, at 9-10, 15, 22; Pezola Aff. at 1-2.</p>

When confronted with a report in which she indicated Appellee was “very capable of attending to a task until completion” and “able to structure his time well when <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>working independently,” Ms. Pezola claimed she wrote reports in a positive light. In other reports, she stated Appellee “takes great pride in helping other children read” and “acquires new math concepts easily if he’s provided with the opportunity to practice and review the material.” When asked about developmental delays Appellee claimed to have, Ms. Pezola denied Appellee had issues tying his shoes or going to the bathroom. N.T., <em>Atkins </em>Hearing, 5/11/11, at 22-24, 29-30, 32, 35-36, 42.</p>
    <p id="b626-5" data-blocks='[["BL_626.4",626,[272,786,1148,734]]]'>Next, Appellee presented the testimony of four mental health experts. Appellee’s first expert, Dr. Barry Crown, a neuropsychologist practicing clinical and forensic psychology, opined that Appellee fits within the category of “mild mental retardation.” Dr. Crown gave the Wexler adult intelligence scale to Appellee in 2009 after this Court remanded the case for an <em>Atkins </em>hearing more than seven years after Appellee filed his petition. Recognizing individuals with mild mental retardation typically have scores between 50 and 70, Dr. Crown reported Appellee’s I.Q. score to be 57. Dr. Crown admitted this score was significantly lower than Appellee’s previous I.Q. scores; Appellee received an I.Q. score of 80 in 1972 (age 8), a score of 85 in 1979 (age 15), and a score of 82 in 1988 (age 23).

In contrast, Dr. Crown attempted to discredit Appellee’s prior scores as “not necessarily as reliable.” Dr. Crown criticized the use of the Beta-2 test given to Appellee in prison in 1988, as the test was developed by the army in World War I to approximate I.Q. to screen for “illiterate recruits.” Dr. Crown claimed the reliability of Appellee’s 1979 score on the Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children — Revised (WISC-R) and his 1972 score on a test given by CORA Services could not be assessed without raw <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>data or supporting information on the tests’ administration. Although Dr. Crown observed the WISC-R report was signed by one individual with a Ph.D. and another with a master’s degree, he felt it was unclear who gave the test. Moreover, as this test was stamped “obsolete” for unknown reasons, Dr. Crown opined that perhaps this test would have to be repeated to account for developmental changes.

    <p id="b627-5" data-blocks='[["BL_627.4",627,[173,756,1149,903]]]'>Although he did not personally evaluate Appellee, Dr. Crown found Appellee had adaptive limitations based on the reports of Appellee’s other experts, affidavits from Appellee’s family members, the affidavit of Appellee’s trial counsel, Atty. Thomas Bergstrom, and the fact that Appellee repeated the first grade three times before enrolled in the Ashbourne School. Dr. Crown relied on the report of Dr. Jethro Toomer, who administered the SIB-R scale which measures adaptive functioning, but did not score this test or testify at trial. Dr. Crown cited to the affidavit of trial expert Albert Levitt who found Appellee functioned at a nine or ten year old level based on a test in which he required Appellee to draw a house, a tree, and a person. As Dr. Levitt felt Appellee’s drawing could be produced by an eight to ten year old child, he opined that his maturity level was consistent with a child of the same age.

    <p id="b627-6" data-blocks='[["BL_627.5",627,[172,1703,1152,633]]]'>On cross-examination, Dr. Crown admitted Appellee’s first three I.Q. scores were consistent and significantly different than his recent score, but asserted it was mere speculation that this discrepancy was caused by lack of motivation on the recent test. The prosecutor also compared the tests Dr. Crown and Dr. Armstrong administered and noticed Appellee incorrectly answered word problems involving subtraction of single digit numbers but somehow was able to correctly multiply 809 by 47. Dr. Crown found these questions test different skills as word problems involve abstract processing whereas arithmetic does not.

The prosecutor asked if Dr. Crown had considered that Appellee ran his own business, paid off loans on two trucks, purchased a boat, was the part owner of a beach house, plotted a murder, and sent handwritten grievances to prison officials. Dr. Crown felt Appellee’s family helped him run his business, could not confirm Appellee wrote the grievances, and was not persuaded Appellee showed direction in planning the murder.</p>
    <p id="b628-5" data-blocks='[["BL_628.4",628,[280,899,1149,896]]]'>In a further attempt to cast doubt on Dr. Crown’s opinion, the prosecutor presented two of Appellee’s recorded phone conversations from prison. In the first, Appellee explained to his mother the concept of short-selling on the stock market and claimed he had used this technique in the past. Dr. Crown felt Appellee’s intellectual disability did not prevent him from engaging in financial transactions.

Additionally, the Commonwealth points to Appellee’s manipulation of the “loopholes of life,” where Appellee lived at the Ogrod home and stored his business equipment there without paying any rent, used his business to target homes he later burglarized, and deceived authorities to believe he had contracts in New Jersey so that he could travel to the shore on weekends while on work release.</p>

In my view, and notwithstanding my joinder in the Court’s primary <em>Atkins </em>analysis, several factors weigh in favor of considering the Commonwealth’s second claim in tandem with any review of the propriety of the decision below: (1) this Court’s central role in capital cases; (2) the Court’s particularly central role in establishing both the substantive and procedural framework for <em>Atkins </em>claims, a circumstance forced upon us by the inaction of the General Assembly in the wake of <em>Atkins; </em>(3) the dynamic nature of this area where, for example, our most recent teaching in <em>Commonwealth v. Dejesus, </em><a href="/pa/619/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="619 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="4234140" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0070-01">619 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/pa/619/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="58 A.3d 62" data-case-ids="4234140,7309187" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0070-01,/a3d/58/0062-01">58 A.3d 62</a> (2012) was issued after the hearing and decision below; (4) the fact that the PCRA court had no authority to follow a different standard than what existed when its decision was rendered; and (5) our duty not to turn a blind eye to fraudulent claims.

      <em>Atkins </em>is a one-way exception to the High Court’s otherwise core insistence upon individualized assessments in the penalty phase of capital trials. Under the scheme dictated by the High Court, a capital defendant’s mental condition — including a variety of intellectual impairments — was, and after <em>Atkins </em>remains — a relevant circumstance in mitigation. That is because, the High Court teaches, all capital defendants are constitutionally entitled to an individualized assessment, irrespective of the enormity of their crime, the gravity of additional aggravators, or the judgment of the states. Thus, the states are constitutionally forbidden to identify a single factor — say mass murders, or a murder committed by a prisoner already serving life imprisonment for murder — as solely deter<a id="p612" href="#p612" data-label="612" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*612</a>minative of penalty. <em>Atkins </em>eliminated the individualized assessment paradigm — but only in favor of defendants, and only for those murderers with a specifically proven intellectual condition: mental retardation under the DSM-IV, renamed intellectual disability under the DSM-V.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> Despite the wide variety of possible intellectual impairments attending those with the condition, the Court has dictated that all are to be treated as if they were the same.</p>

When <em>Atkins </em>was decided there were death-sentenced defendants, in Pennsylvania (such as mass murderer Harrison “Marty” Graham<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>) and elsewhere, who were removed from death row with no opposition or appeal from the government, since there was never any serious dispute that they were “mentally retarded” under the DSM-IV standard, and were so diagnosed in their minority. But, there are other defendants, such as appellee, who scored well above the cut-off range on multiple IQ tests in their minority and/or were never diagnosed with intellectual disability. The retroactive effect of <em>Atkins </em>obviously creates a powerful incentive for these defendants, their families, compliant mental health experts, and defense counsel (in Pennsylvania, invariably the same institutional and well-heeled federal counsel) to pursue retrospective collateral claims of impairment premised upon slanted, exaggerated, or simply false evidence of disqualifying “intellectual disability.”</p>

Pennsylvania is obliged to implement <em>Atkins; </em>but, this Court is also obliged not to encourage or approve dubious or fraudulent claims, constitutional or otherwise. Unlike trial court judges in Pennsylvania, who may see a single retrospective <em>Atkins </em>claim in a career, this Court, with direct appeal responsibilities in all capital cases, is positioned to see a bigger picture. And, it has become apparent that the “science” surrounding a diagnosis of intellectual disability is highly subjective even in the best of circumstances. A retrospective claim of intellectual disability forwarded in order to defeat a sentence of death under <em>Atkins </em>does not involve reliable circumstances, much less the best of circumstances; the claim is susceptible to manipulation and bias, and trial courts must be attuned to that fact. Thus, I agree with the Commonwealth that PCRA courts should not so cavalierly dismiss actual childhood evidence respecting intellectual disability just because a team of the usual defense experts, hired specifically in an effort to negate a final judgment of death, predictably hold a different view and prove intellectually very agile in dismissing all contrary evidence from the defendant’s minority. Nothing in <em>Atkins </em>obliges states to vest in experts the power to remake the defendant’s mental health history. This case presents a prime example of how a trial court, passing upon a single <em>Atkins </em>claim and <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>either insufficiently appreciative of the full picture or predisposed to grant relief irrespective of the actual merit of the claim,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> can easily be misled by slanted “expert” testimony.</p>

The stakes are as high as it gets; and the defendant, as here, knows full well that low test scores advance his prospects. This is another one-way ratchet: As the Commonwealth’s expert explained: “it’s very easy to lower an IQ. You can be depressed, just not motivated.... But you can’t be dull and actually pretend to be intelligent.” N.T., 11/17/2011, at 52. This obvious fact raises a question whether appellee’s defense-produced IQ score of 57 should even be considered in light of two childhood tests that placed his IQ in the 80-85 range, tests that were supported by a third test of appellee in his early adulthood, where he scored an 82. Thus, the Majority is correct to find that the PCRA court erred when it determined that appellee met the intellectual functioning prong of the <em>Miller </em>test.</p>

Yet, in this case, this seemingly basic “cause” and age of onset played no role in the defense case or the PCRA judge’s conclusion. Instead, appellee presented testimony from two different experts who testified that his exposure to toxins and the extracurricular activity of boxing in his teens factored into their retrospective diagnosis of mental retardation. Employing factors like exposure to toxins or voluntary participation in activities potentially harmful to the brain in one’s teens is incompatible with the testimony in <em>Williams </em>that the brain injury causing intellectual disability is organic and occurs very early in life.

Again, returning to the examples discussed above, appellee ran his own landscaping business and established a plan to hire a hitman to kill Gregory Ogrod— plain indications that he was a leader. Testimony from the receptionist for his business established that he hired her as a favor, because she needed the money, suggesting that he was able to control and organize his business. Similarly, testimony from the PCRA hearing also showed that appellee had taught himself about short-selling stocks while he was in prison. Even though his understanding and explanation of short-selling might have been basic, taking the initiative to learn about such a concept shows leadership. And, finally, there was testimony concerning appellee’s ability to manipulate others, securing for himself free lodging, and misleading his probation officer so he could visit his beach home.</p>

In this case, it was clear that appellee wanted to kill Gregory Ogrod because the two men did not get along. Appellee moved into a house with Ogrod and Ogrod’s brother (who was also appellee’s employee). Ogrod did not like that appellee was not paying rent and the living arrangement “went bad.” <em>Hackett, </em><a href="/pa/534/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="130" data-cite="534 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1839652" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0210-01">627 A.2d at 721</a>.

Again, turning to the circumstances surrounding the crime, it is clear that appellee knew what evidence could be used against him; he made sure that the photographs he had given to his friend for purposes of hiring a hitman were destroyed; he asked his girlfriend to lie on his behalf; and he also discarded the crowbar used in the murder in a dumpster a week after the crime. <em>Hackett, </em><a href="/pa/534/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="131" data-cite="534 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1839652" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0210-01">627 A.2d at 722</a>.

Wfiien that alternative fell through, appellee, who had a key to the house, armed Spence (and two other co-conspirators) with knives and a crowbar to attack Ogrod and Dunne while they were sleeping. The circumstances amply demonstrated forethought and planning; indeed, appellee approached his friend regarding a hitman in the spring of 1986, yet the killing occurred much later, on July 31, 1986. Furthermore, the circumstances of the actual crime show that appellee armed his co-conspirators prior to going to the murder scene, let the co-conspirators into the house, and intentionally approached the victims at a time they knew the victims were sleeping. <em>Hackett, </em><a href="/pa/534/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="132" data-cite="534 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1839652" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0210-01">627 A.2d at 722</a>.

Because the court accepted Appellee’s <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>evidence, and rejected the contrary evidence proffered by the Commonwealth, it found that Appellee met the appropriate definitions of mental retardation set forth in <em>Miller </em>and, therefore, is ineligible for the death penalty. The Majority reverses, concluding that the record does not support the lower court’s factual findings. Respectfully, its conclusion is simply unsupportable under the appropriate standard of review on appeal. The PCRA court heard from five experts. Four of them offered their opinions that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, Appellee is mentally retarded. One opined that he was not. This evidence was accompanied by other testimony that, to varying degrees, supported or undermined their expert opinions. After listening for six days, the PCRA court docketed a thoughtful nineteen page opinion replete with careful citations to the record concluding that Appellee’s experts and other testimony were more credible than that presented by the Commonwealth. The PCRA court could have reached the opposite conclusion because, as recognized by the Majority, there was evidence of record to support either a finding of mental retardation or “dull normal” functioning. However, once the PCRA court, after listening to the five experts and six days of testimony, adjudged credibility and reached its decision, this case, at least on this issue, was over.

The AAMR defines mental retardation as a "disability characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in the conceptual, social, and practical adaptive skills.” Mental Retardation at 1. The American Psychiatric Association defines mental retardation as "significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (an I.Q. of approximately 70 or below) with onset before age 18 years and concurrent deficits or impairments in adaptive functioning.” DSM-IV at 37.
