Like our General Assembly, the Louisiana legislature has enacted a statute that bars a person from possessing a firearm if he or she has been convicted of any crime included in a long, specifically enumerated list of felonies. In <em>Ball, </em>the defendant-appellant, who was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, had offered to stipulate that he had a prior predicate conviction, without naming the offense, the date thereof, or the sentence imposed. The stipulation was not accepted, and at trial, the State introduced the bill of information and guilty plea transcript from his prior conviction. After he was convicted of the firearm charge, the defendant-appellant sought appellate relief, arguing, based on <em>Old Chief, </em>that he had been unfairly prejudiced because the name and nature of his previous felony conviction had been revealed to the jury. <em><a href="/so2d/756/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="756 So. 2d 275" data-case-ids="11519043" data-case-paths="/so2d/756/0275-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/so2d/756/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="756 So. 2d 275" data-case-ids="11519043" data-case-paths="/so2d/756/0275-01">at 275-77</a>.

To the contrary, under the Louisiana statute, “the statutory language in which the prior conviction requirement is couched” <em>does </em>show “concern with the specific name or nature of the prior offense” and the name of the prior offense <em>does </em>address a “detail in the definition of the prior conviction element that would not have been covered by the stipulation.” Because proof of one of the enumerated felonies is an essential element of the crime under [the Louisiana statute], the probative value of the name and nature of the prior conviction is' greater than the “generic” felony required by the federal statute.</blockquote>

However, as both the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Old Chief </em>and the Kansas Supreme Court in <em>Lee </em>recognized, these considerations have “virtually no application when the point at issue is a defendant’s legal status.” <em>Old Chief, </em><a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">519 U.S. at 190</a>, <a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">117 S.Ct. 644</a>; <em>see also Lee, </em><a href="/kan/266/0804-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="266 Kan. 804" data-case-ids="534191" data-case-paths="/kan/266/0804-01">977 P.2d at 269-70</a>. In these circumstances, if the defendant offers to stipulate to his status, the exclusion of certain other facts, such as the details of a prior criminal conviction, is appropriate because the probative value of the evidence is maintained, but the danger of unfair prejudicial effect is reduced or eliminated. <em>See </em>Roger Park <em>&amp; </em>Tom Lininger, <em>The New Wigmore.

I would further conclude that the General Assembly’s enumeration of the specific disqualifying offenses in Section 6105(b) is of no moment to the analysis. Appellant’s admission that he, at one time in the <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>past, was convicted of a disqualifying offense satisfies that element of Section 6105(a); the Commonwealth needs nothing more. Put differently, it establishes his legal status as a disqualified, convicted felon, thus preserving the probative value of the evidence while reducing the danger of unfair prejudice that inherently is associated with the prosecutor informing the jury that Appellant had previously been convicted of robbery, the circumstances of the robbery, and if Appellant served any time in prison. <em>Accord Old Chief, </em><a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">519 U.S. at 190-92</a>, <a href="/us/519/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="519 U.S. 172" data-case-ids="11595223" data-case-paths="/us/519/0172-01">117 S.Ct. 644</a>.

Indeed, similar to the appeal at bar, the defendant in <em>Stanley </em>attempted to stipulate that he had previously been convicted of a crime of violence (which was the disqualifying standard of a previous iteration of Section 6105), the Commonwealth refused to so stipulate, and the appellate courts affirmed the Commonwealth's right to decline the admission.</p>
