      <em>Cheeseman </em>clarified the factors on which a trial court may rely when ruling on a <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion, holding a petition to transfer venue should be granted only if the defendant “demonstrates], with detailed information on the record, that the plaintiffs chosen forum is oppressive or vexatious to the defendant.” <em>Cheeseman, </em>at 162. So called “public interest” factors affecting the court’s own concerns are not controlling because Rule 1006(d)(1) speaks only in terms of convenience to the parties and witnesses, not the courts. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62. By way of example, Justice Cappy noted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[216,1282,1108,573]]]'>[T]he defendant may meet its burden of showing that the plaintiffs choice of forum is vexatious to him by establishing ... the plaintiffs choice of forum was designed to harass the defendant, even at some inconvenience to the plaintiff himself. Alternatively, the defendant may meet his burden by establishing ... trial in the chosen forum is oppressive to him; for instance, that trial in another county would provide easier access to witnesses or other sources of proof, or to the ability to conduct a view of premises involved in the dispute. But, we stress that the defendant must show more than that the chosen forum is merely inconvenient to him.</blockquote>

      <em>Id. </em>at 162 (footnote and internal citation omitted). Thus, <em>Cheeseman </em>was not intended to increase the level of oppressiveness or vexatiousness a defendant must show; rather, understood in its articulated context, <em>Cheeseman </em>merely corrected the practice that developed in the lower courts of giving excessive weight to “public interest” factors when ruling on a <em>forum non conveniens </em>motion. Whatever public interest factors exist, they are not determinative; they are only a factor insofar as they bear directly on the ultimate test. And while <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>Rule 1006(d)(1) on its face allows transfer based on “the convenience of the parties[,]” Pa.R.C.P. 1006(d)(1), convenience or the lack thereof is not the test our case law has established: the moving party must show the chosen forum is either oppressive or vexatious.</p>

Trial courts are vested with considerable discretion when ruling on such a motion, and “[i]f there exists any proper basis for the trial court’s decision to transfer venue, the decision must stand.” <em>Zappala, </em>at 1284 (citation omitted). The Superior Court’s stringent examination in isolation of each individual fact mentioned by the trial court was inconsistent with the applicable standard of review; a ruling on a motion to transfer must be affirmed on appeal “[i]f there exists any proper basis for the trial court’s decision[.]” <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>
    <p id="b612-5" data-blocks='[["BL_612.5",612,[280,1257,1150,840]]]'>The trial court expressly noted it did not consider its own interest in court congestion. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 10/09/09, at 3. This is not to say court congestion is never a consideration — access to justice is certainly a significant concern of our judicial system, which means not only the ability to get into court, but to have the court expeditiously address the matter — but congestion is not sufficient in itself to justify a change of venue. Ergo, if efficient resolution is precluded by uniquely disruptive court volume, it cannot be impermissible for the court to so note, but only insofar as it bears on the ultimate consideration of venue as oppressive or vexatious. That is, if the congestion contributes to the oppressiveness of the chosen venue, it may be considered, though we reiterate it is not a factor sufficient by itself to warrant transfer, as was the holding of cases before <em>Cheeseman. </em>Here, as noted, it was not considered at all.</p>

Appellees’ <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>arguments pointing out the cost of their counsel traveling to Dauphin County is subject to the same logic — by itself, it will not determine the issue. The trial court’s mere mention of these facts does not constitute an abuse of discretion or misapplication of the law, however, as it is evident from the court’s opinion that transfer was based on other enumerated factors, not the residences of appellees or counsel, nor on congestion of the courts. As with other factors not sufficient for transfer themselves, if residence is probative of oppressiveness, it is not error to reflect upon it, so long as it is not the sole reason for the judge’s decision.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">9</a> Indeed, in <em>Cheese-man </em>itself, Justice Cappy pointed out that “access to witnesses or other sources of proof’ was an entirely legitimate factor when determining oppressiveness, <em>Cheeseman, </em>at 162, and the plaintiffs are certainly “sources of proof.”</p>

We are unsure what extra detail must be enumerated — the interference with one’s business and personal life caused by the participatory demands of a distant lawsuit is patent. The witnesses need not detail what clients or tasks will be postponed or opportunities lost in order for the judge to exercise common sense in evaluating their worth; indeed, no one can foretell such detail.

While typically the “fact that the site of the precipitating event was outside of plaintiffs choice of forum is not dispositive[,]” <em>Walls, </em>at 852 (citations omitted), it is axiomatic that “when the case involves a transfer from Philadelphia to a more distant county ..., factors such as the burden of travel, time out of the office, disruption to business operations, and the greater difficulty involved in obtaining witnesses and sources of proof are more significante,]” <em>Bratic, </em>at 505 (Gantman, J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">10</a>

The <em>Cheeseman </em>decision actually involved two cases, both filed in Philadelphia County and transferred to neighboring Bucks County because of court congestion in the former. Dauphin County, however, is not a neighbor of Philadelphia, and one needs no detailed affidavit to understand the difference in logistics necessitated by a separation of 100 miles. It is not necessary to articulate to a jurist the inherently empirical concept that distance and expedience are inversely proportional. The Superior Court speculated upon the eight witnesses, be they employees or professionals, and the economic consequences as to each is not of record, but it may be presumed without fear of contradiction that to each of these people, time indeed is money, and days of participating in trial in Philadelphia would impact their “duties/operations[.]” <em>Bratic, </em>at 503.</p>

The trial judge need not be told like a child how the distance in and of itself makes things more disagreeable and disruptive to the persons obliged to travel. Nor is it a secret requiring iteration that trial in Dauphin County would provide easier access to local appellants and their local witnesses, as well as the relevant court documents on which the very case is based. Further, given the witnesses’ respective job titles, we cannot agree with the Superior Court that the affidavits were insufficient to enable the trial court to intuit the professional oppressiveness, more than inconvenience, that is patent therein. Indeed, if a reviewing court may surmise upon no record evidence at all that some witnesses will be paid, it should not be heard to criticize the trial court’s crediting actual affidavits from witnesses that would have their businesses interrupted for days at a time, to their obvious personal and financial detriment.</p>

Further, being paid may mitigate hardship, but it does not eliminate oppressiveness or the disruption of other duties and home life — the physical toll from significant travel or of living from a suitcase. Hardship and oppression are not the same thing, and mitigating the former may ease the latter, but it does not affect the other concerns necessary .for consideration.</p>

As between Philadelphia and adjoining Bucks County, the situation in <em>Cheeseman, </em>we speak of mere inconvenience; as between Philadelphia and counties 100 miles away, simple inconvenience fades in the mirror and we near oppressiveness with every milepost of the turnpike and Schuylkill Expressway.</p>

Mere inconvenience remains insufficient, but there is no burden to show near-draconian consequences. Although the Superior Court may have reached a conclusion different than the trial court, this does not justify disturbing the ruling; the Superior Court effectively substituted its judgment for that of the trial court, which it may not do. The facts of record allow the finding that trial in Philadelphia would be more than merely inconvenient. As there was clearly a proper evidentiary basis for this conclusion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion transferring the case to Dauphin County.</p>
