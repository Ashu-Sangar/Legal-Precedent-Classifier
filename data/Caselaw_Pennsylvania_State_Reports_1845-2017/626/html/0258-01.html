In August, 2010, Appellants, Raymond and Donna Mantia, residents of Avella, Washington County, engaged Appellee, Shafer Electric &amp; Construction, a registered West Virginia contractor, to build a 34 foot by 24 foot, two-car garage addition onto their house. The initial proposal by Appellee, <em>found at </em>Reproduced Record (R.R.) 24a, was extremely detailed in the work to be completed, including the dimensions of the addition, type of roof to be installed, size of skylights to be placed in the roof, and brand and type of soffit/fascia to be used. An addendum to the initial proposal, <em>found at </em>R.R. 25a, further elaborated upon details, specifications, and upgrades to portions of the project. Between the two proposals, Appellee agreed to furnish materials and labor in consideration of $102,000.00.</p>

During the subsequent months, Appellants eventually reexcavated the foundation area for the addition and, in the process (according to Appellee), changed the design of the addition several times. Negotiations into these design changes and other necessary alterations as a result of the excavation problems occurred, but ultimately failed when Appellants apparently refused to enter into a new contract with Appellee. Upon the breakdown of the negotiations, the parties mutually agreed that Appellee would invoice Appellants for the work completed, and that Appellee would discontinue efforts on the project. On February 23, 2011, Appellee sent a final invoice to Appellants in the amount of $37,874.20, which included the cost of materials, architect fees, and labor. <em>See </em>Invoice, <em>found at </em>R.R. 26a.</p>

To conclude otherwise renders the type of recovery contemplated by the [legislature in subsection (g) impossible.” <em>Shafer Elec. &amp; Const. v.

Given these failures, Appellants contend that the plain language of Section 517.7(g) precludes any recovery by Appellee either under the express agreement or <em>quantum meruit, </em>noting that the language of subsection (g) mandates compliance with the thirteen clauses before a contractor can recover “for work performed based on the reasonable value of services which were requested by the owner.” 73 P.S. § 517.7(g).</p>

For this same reason, Appellants contend that we should overrule <em>Durst, </em>because the Superior Court in that case allegedly misapprehended the Act “by finding that it was silent as to situations in which the parties did not have a written home improvement contract.” <em>Id. </em>at 25. Rather, in accord with Appellants’ argument, all thirteen provisions of Section 517.7(a) must be adhered to before a contractor will have a right to any cause of action stemming from a home improvement contract.</p>

Without much analysis, Appellee contends that a latent ambiguity exists merely because different parties have proffered different applications of subsection (g): Appellants and the trial court on one hand view the provision as precluding the <em>quantum meruit </em>claim, and Appellee and the Superior Court on the other hand contend that the cause of action should be permitted. With that preface, Appellee avers that the General Assembly intended Section 517.7(g) to provide for equitable relief for contractors despite non-compliance with Section 517.7(a) because, to take “Appellants’ argument to its logical conclusion” would be to preclude a perfectly performing contractor from any recourse for a homeowner’s refusal to pay, merely because one of the thirteen provisions of Section 517.7(a) were not followed.

Specifically in regard to expectation interest, the non-breaching party is to be “put in as good a position as he would have been in had the contract been performed,” Restatement (Second) Contracts § 344(a), meaning that the plaintiff would be entitled to receive, above anything else, his expected and built-in profit arising from the contract. In Appellee’s view, this is what Section 517.7(a) and (g) contemplate — permitting a contractor to seek the full panoply of available remedies in exchange for compliance with the thirteen clauses of subsection (a); and limiting recovery to the lesser, equitable remedy of <em>quantum memit </em>when there is a failure to adhere to the dictates of Section 517.7(a).</p>
