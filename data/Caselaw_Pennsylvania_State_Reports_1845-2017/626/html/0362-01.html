The trial court first noted, correctly, that the decision to grant or deny an expungement rests within the discretion of the trial court, which must balance the “individual’s right to be free from the harm attendant to maintenance of the arrest record against the Commonwealth’s interest in preserving such records.” <em>Commonwealth v.

The trial court based its denial of Appellee’s expungement petitions by balancing the Commonwealth’s reasons for seeking to retain the records (factor 2), Appellee’s extensive criminal record (factor 3), and the lack of specific adverse consequences Appellee would encounter if expungement were denied (factor 5).</p>

One of the underlying principles behind the law of expungement is the protection of an individual’s reputation. <em>Carlacci v. Mazaleski, </em><a href="/pa/568/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="568 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="163566" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0471-01">568 Pa. 471</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="798 A.2d 186" data-case-ids="163566,9428661" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0471-01,/a2d/798/0186-01">798 A.2d 186</a>, 189 (2002). The Commonwealth argues that during an inmate’s time in prison, his reputation has already been tarnished, and <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>therefore expungement of past arrests would not aid in protecting the inmate’s reputation. Expungement is also used as a tool to prevent undue hardships of loss of employment, housing or education that may accompany one’s criminal record. <em>Commonwealth v. Armstrong, </em><a href="/pa/495/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="495 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1770777" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0506-01">495 Pa. 506</a>, <a href="/pa/495/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="495 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="1770777" data-case-paths="/pa/495/0506-01">434 A.2d 1205</a>, 1207 (1981).

    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[184,836,1147,515]]]'>Third, the Commonwealth argues that both judicial and penal authorities have a vital interest in retaining access to prisoner’s criminal history information. The Commonwealth asserts that if an inmate needed to be disciplined for misconduct while incarcerated, a complete and accurate criminal record would assist penal authorities in fashioning an appropriate punishment. Furthermore, 61 Pa.C.S. § 6135(a)(7) states that a parole board is to consider a prisoner’s “complete criminal record” prior to release on parole. 61 Pa.C.S. § 6135(a)(7).</p>

The Commonwealth asserts that a decision in favor of Appellee will lead to an unreasonable strain on an already overburdened trial court system. The Commonwealth contends that judicial endorsement of inmate petitions will lead to many prisoner requests to be present at the hearing, as Appellee has requested, and that this outcome will inevitably raise security concerns among prison officials.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[183,1917,1146,251]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth argues that any disadvantage that may result from an inmate’s denial of a petition for expungement while still incarcerated is only temporary, as there is nothing to prevent the inmate from petitioning for expungement once released from state or federal custody.</p>

This Court has consistently held that there is a presumption that when a court has a set of facts in its possession, it will apply those facts. <em>Moto, supra </em>at 995 (Pa.2011). Moreover, where the trial court has the record in its possession, we do not require the court to prove that it reviewed the entire record by citing to each and every circumstance it considered in its findings. <em>Id. </em>at 995-996.

The trial court explained the <em>Wexler </em>balancing test, listed each of the five factors of the test, and applied the facts of the current case to these factors. The trial court first found that several of the factors neither supported nor impugned denial of the petition, and were thus afforded little weight (specifically, the Commonwealth’s readiness to try Appellee for the charged offenses, Appellee’s age and employment background, and the period of time between the arrests and the expungement petition).</p>

We disagree. While it is accurate that the Commonwealth’s generalized concern for record-keeping or its reliance on future cases is not a sufficient basis for denying a petition for expungement, the trial court’s findings in this case are based upon more than a generalized concern for record-keeping or reliance on future cases. The Commonwealth’s interests are not generalized, rather they are grounded in the reality of Appellee’s vast criminal history, his status as a prison inmate, his numerous state and federal convictions for crimes of violence and fraud, and his recidivism. The Commonwealth is not merely speculating that Appellee may re-offend while in prison; Appellee has, in fact, already committed violent offenses while incarcerated. Further, the General Assembly <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>has instructed parole boards to consider a prisoner’s “complete criminal record” prior to release. 61 Pa.C.S. § 6135(a)(7).

Appellee argues that incarcerated individuals are among those most in need of expungement’s ameliorative purpose. Specifically, Appellee contends that it would be an injustice to “deny to incarcerated people the hope that they might productively use their time of incarceration in order to begin to repair their reputation and prepare to become a more employable and functional member of society upon reentry.” Appellee’s Brief at 11.</p>
    <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[275,1001,1148,362]]]'>Reputation is a protected private interest in this Commonwealth. Article I Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution reads: “All men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.” Pa.

He urges this Court to consider his petitions for expungement as a diligent attempt to prepare for his release back into society. Although Appellee does not specifically make a claim of the protected private interest of reputation, claims of loss of employment opportunities or housing due to a lengthy criminal record suggest such a claim.</p>
    <p id="b430-8" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[272,1974,1148,365]],["BL_431.1",431,[182,299,1144,96]]]'>Next, we must consider the risk of an erroneous deprivation of Appellee’s private interest in his reputation if he is denied the right to petition for expungement. We find that the risk of such an erroneous deprivation is slim. Appellee asserts that by petitioning for expungement, he is attempting to aid his effort for a successful reentry into society. Appellee asserts that due process requires a hearing to establish a <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>record whereby the Commonwealth may establish facts and Petitioner may respond.</p>

    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[184,747,1150,885]]]'>Moreover, Appellee does not acknowledge other avenues available to him while incarcerated that will aid in repairing his reputation and prepare him to become a more employable and functional member of society. Appellee is serving time in federal prison and has served time in state prison for a reason; he was convicted of crimes. Though an expungement of some of Petitioner’s charges that did not end in convictions would shorten the length of his record, Petitioner will still have these convictions as a part of his criminal history, and an expungement of other charges will not erase the stigma that follows a convicted felon. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has put in place programs to assist inmates with the process of reentering society such as education programs, community reentry programs and release preparation programs that Appellee may participate in if he wishes to prepare to become a more employable and functional member of society upon release.</p>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth’s stated interests for denying such a hearing are well-founded. The Commonwealth has a compelling interest in retaining the records Appellee seeks to expunge, as Appellee is currently incarcerated and these records may be needed for use in penalization if Appellee commits any offenses while in prison (Appellee has, in fact, committed violent offenses while in prison). Moreover, a complete criminal history record may be needed in order to determine an inmate’s eligibility for parole. <em>See, </em>61 Pa.C.S. § 6135(a)(7) (the parole board must consider a prisoner’s “complete criminal record” prior to release).</p>

As the Commonwealth suggests, these concerns are well illustrated by the present case where Petitioner, currently in federal custody in New York, has filed multiple petitions seeking to appear in person to present evidence to the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas. Granting such a request would necessitate the transport of Petitioner across state lines, which would put a strain on already tight prison budgets and add to an already overburdened trial court system. Moreover, any time an inmate is transported out of the prison setting, there exist security concerns, especially when the inmate, like Petitioner, is considered a flight risk.</p>

On July 13, 2010, the trial court filed orders directing Appellee to file a Rule 1925(b) statement within 21 days. The trial court then filed an Order on August 26, 2010, regarding 1894 EDA 2010, and on October 18, 2010, regarding 2850 EDA 2010, each finding that Appellee had waived the issues in these two appeals for failing to timely file Rule 1925(b) statements.

The records indicate, however, that Appellee did not file 1925(b) statements for these two appeals until October 26, 2010, well after the 21 day deadline set in the trial court's July 13, 2010 Order. We therefore find that the Superior Court erred in finding that Appellee had satisfactorily fulfilled the requirements for Pa.R.A.P. 1925 with regards to 2850 EDA 2010 and 1894 EDA 2010, and find that the issues in these two appeals have been waived. Appeal No. 2850 EDA 2010 (318 EAL 2012) is the only appeal at issue where some of the charges resulted in acquittal.</p>

They should not be, as the Majority makes clear. To engage in an expungement procedure in this matter, given appellant’s deplorable criminal history, would be merely an academic exercise.</p>

In <em>DM., </em>I joined a dissent by Madame Justice Newman, who argued against a bright-line view that expungement must be automatic in the instance of acquittals: the dissent in <em>DM. </em>would apply the factor-based approach set forth in <em>Wexler </em>to acquittals in order to ensure the propriety of expungement. Because the offense in <em>DM. </em>involved a schoolteacher's alleged sexual contact with a minor whose testimony was not discredited, Justice Newman did not perceive expungement to be appropriate.</p>

Since, however, we have a very particularized and egregious set of circumstances before us, my approach would be to couch the restraint in terms of a general rule, thus allowing for the <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>possibility for further evaluation in cases presenting exceptional circumstances.</p>
