Recognizing that courts have traditionally required a showing of privity of contract before permitting a party to proceed with a warranty claim, the trial court concluded that the question presented was “one of policy as to who will bear the burden for damages caused by latent defects ...

Determining that the policy considerations advanced by Appellees were persuasive and the rationale set forth in <em>Spivack </em>was compelling, the Superior Court held here that “the implied warranty of habitability extends to a second or subsequent purchaser of a home.” <em>Conway, supra </em>at 161-63. With this holding, the Superior Court rejected Appellant’s contention that extension of the warranty would lead to unlimited liability for home builders, noting that the warranty is strictly limited to the narrow universe of latent construction defects that affect the habitability of a home and is governed by a 12-year statute of repose. <em>Id. </em>at 162-63 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 5536(a)).</p>

With the adoption of this warranty, the <em>Elderkin </em>Court rejected as anachronistic, in the context of residential real estate transactions, the traditional doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>— the rule that “in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation!;,] a vendor is responsible for the quality of the property being sold ... only to the extent ... he expressly agrees to be responsible.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="288 A.2d 771">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="288 A.2d 771">at 774</a>. The <em>Elderkin </em>Court explained that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>was rooted in the view that a vendor and a purchaser were on equal footing, with equal knowledge and bargaining power regarding the transaction at issue. However, residential real estate purchases in the modern era are transactions not just for land, but for a reasonably constructed and habitable home, for which the purchaser “justifiably relies on the skill of the developer,” who not only “hold[s] himself out as having the necessary expertise with which to produce an adequate dwelling, but [also] has by far the better opportunity to examine the suitability of the home site and to determine what measures should be taken to provide a home fit for habitation.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="288 A.2d 771">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=288%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="288 A.2d 771">at 776-77</a>.

The appellants-plaintiffs in <em>Spivack </em>had purchased a yet-to-be-constructed condominium from a developer, which was an entity separate and distinct from the builder/general contractor of the condominium. Alleging that the condominium sold by the developer was deficient in numerous ways, the appellants-plaintiffs sued the builder/general contractor for breach of the warranty of habitability.

The Vermont court reasoned that the existence of the implied warranty of habitability and the rationale underlying it are “founded on a sale.” <em>Id. </em>at 762. Under the facts of <em>Long Trail, </em>condominium owners had purchased their residences from the developer, which was a separate entity from the builder. Because there had been no sale — and no privity of contract — between the builder and the condominium owners, the Vermont court held that the condominium owners had no claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability against the builder. Rather, the Vermont court held, the condominium owners could seek warranty relief against the developer which had sold them the residences. <em>Id. </em>at 762-63. Two justices dissented in <em>Long Trail. </em>Using reasoning similar to that of the Iowa and Rhode Island Supreme Courts, the dissenters in <em>Long Trail </em>determined that, although the implied warranty of habitability “has roots” in the contract of sale, it is in fact a judicial creation designed <a id="p669" href="#p669" data-label="669" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*669</a>to protect home purchasers, and thus it does not require privity of contract. <em>Id. </em>at 764 (Kupersmith, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). In addition, the Vermont dissenters addressed policy considerations, opining that the majority’s adherence to the requirement for contractual privity “perpetuates an arbitrary distinction, promotes poor social policy, and results in economic injustice.” <em>Id. </em>at 763.</p>
