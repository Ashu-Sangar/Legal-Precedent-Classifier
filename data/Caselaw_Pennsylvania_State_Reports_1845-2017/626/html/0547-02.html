    <blockquote id="b598-6" data-blocks='[["BL_598.6",598,[321,664,1103,527]]]'>(1) Where a physician provides emergency treatment at the request of a hospital for a person who was not previously the physician’s patient, and does so negligently thereby causing the patient’s death, may the patient’s estate reach the jury on a claim that the hospital is vicariously liable under a theory of ostensible agency for the negligent conduct of that physician because a reasonably prudent person in the patient’s position would be justified in the belief that the care in question was being rendered by the hospital or its agents?</blockquote>
