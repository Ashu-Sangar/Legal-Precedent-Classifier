The officers approached the men to question their reason for loitering there, as a large number of burglaries had recently been reported in the area. Appellant stated his grandmother lived on the block. One officer asked for appellant’s identification, which appellant gave him. When the officer began writing down the identification information, he saw appellant place his hand in his right pocket and turn his right side away from the officer’s view; the officer told appellant to stop reaching and remove his hand. Appellant again put his hand in his right pocket. Concerned appellant might be reaching for a concealed weapon, the officer instructed him to remove his hand for the second time. When appellant reached into the pocket a third time, the officer placed appellant against the wall of the building to conduct a safety frisk for weapons. Appellant once again put his hand in the pocket, so the officer forcibly removed it, and a plastic bag containing blue packets filled with crack cocaine became visible. The officer handcuffed appellant and seized the plastic bag. The officer then <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>conducted a search incident to arrest and discovered a bag containing marijuana in appellant’s left pocket.</p>

The court determined the issue was whether the officer’s request for identification elevated the interaction from a mere encounter to an investigative detention.

The court pointed out the officer testified at the suppression hearing he believed appellant was not free to leave while he was recording appellant’s information. <em>Id., </em>at 4 (citing N.T. Suppression Hearing, 3/15/11, at 13). Notwithstanding its understanding that an officer’s subjective beliefs are immaterial to seizure determinations, the court found “the fact the officer in question did not believe [appellant] was free to leave [was] highly suggestive of the tenor of their encounter.” <em>Id. </em>The court concluded the officer’s request for identification indicated his dissatisfaction with appellant’s explanation for his presence and signified “an intention to investigate further,” leaving appellant “with no option to leave, unless he wished to leave his identification card behind[,]” and a reasonable person would not have felt free to ignore the request and leave the scene. <em>Id. </em>The court relied primarily upon the Superior Court’s holding in <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Lyles, </em>at 82 (“A request for identification does not, by itself, transform a mere encounter into an investigative detention.”). Noting the totality of the circumstances lacked coercion, intimidation, threats, excessive show of force, or any other circumstance indicating appellant was going to be detained, the majority recognized the only demand was for appellant to keep his hand out of his pocket. This did not substantially impair appellant’s freedom of movement and was grounded in the officer’s legitimate safety concerns. The majority also emphasized the suppression court’s reliance on the officer’s subjective belief was improper, as subjective beliefs are immaterial to an objective seizure determination. As a result, the majority concluded the totality of the circumstances failed to support a conclusion appellant had been seized.</p>

No responsible person would walk away from an encounter with a police officer.... [C]ase law does not comport with reality.” <em>Id., </em>at 84 (Strassburger, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). Judge Lazarus filed a dissenting opinion, concluding the officer conducted an unlawful detention unsupported by reasonable suspicion and no reasonable person would have felt free to leave under the totality of the circumstances.
