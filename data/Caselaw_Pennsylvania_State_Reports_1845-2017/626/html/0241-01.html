As the Commonwealth states in its brief, recent changes in the law have expanded the prospect that paroled offenders, including sex offenders, may see increased placement in halfway houses. Commonwealth’s Brief at 12-14. During the 2011-12 session of the General Assembly, two parallel bills were passed unanimously: Senate Bill 100 (Act 122 of 2012), which was signed into law on July 5, 2012, and House Bill 135 (Act 196 of 2012), which was signed into law on October 25, 2012. The Senate bill set forth the substantive aspects of the new legislation, which sought to relieve the DOC budget and reduce the prison population through new approaches to deterrence and expanded alternatives to incarceration. The House bill created funding streams by directing the Pennsylvania Office of the Budget to calculate projected savings from the DOC budget and to transfer these sums to a newly created “Justice Reinvestment Fund” for appropriation to the various entities tasked with implementing reforms, including both the DOC and the PBPP. <em>See </em>71 P.S. § 1190.28a.</p>

For example, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9771.1 endows courts of common pleas with discretion to address and sanction probation violations by nonviolent offenders (violent offenders and those who must register as sexual offenders are excluded from eligibility). Now, courts can work with local law enforcement, probation personnel, prosecutors, and public defenders to devise a viable program that will be punitive without entailing the offender’s automatic return to state prison. Additions to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9804 and 61 Pa.C.S. § 4104 grant local prosecutors and courts modest discretion, in certain limited circumstances, to authorize that in lieu of total confinement in prison, an offender may enter a county intermediate punishment program, such as house arrest, or a state intermediate punishment program, <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>such as a group home, halfway house, or DOC residential drug treatment program. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9804(b)(l)(ii); 61 Pa. C.S. § 4104(a)(l.l). Other provisions increase eligibility for participation in the DOC’s motivational boot camp programs by raising the maximum entry age from 35 to 40 and by granting prosecutors and courts, in certain circumstances, the discretion to waive eligibility requirements. 61 Pa.C.S. §§ 3903, 3904(d).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> And other new provisions allow parole violators whose violation is only “technical,” such as failure to report to one’s parole officer, to be placed in halfway houses and not necessarily returned to full incarceration. 61 Pa.C.S. § 5003.

Whereas the laws in place when appellants sought parole saw the PBPP and DOC operating largely in isolation from each other, the new legislation expressly provides for greater cooperation between the agencies. For example, a new chapter in the Parole Code calls for the creation and administration by both agencies of a joint “Safe Community Reentry Program” to reduce recidivism and ensure successful community reentry. 61 Pa.C.S. §§ 4901-4905. <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>Pursuant to this chapter, both agencies are now empowered to assist offenders in coordinating comprehensive reentry plans including transitional residence, treatment, education, and employment, and the use of available public and private organizations.

The group found that ever-rising prison populations not only drained the public fisc, with the DOC budget having risen to nearly $2 billion a year, but also created: an administrative backlog in review of parole applications; the inability of inmates serving short sentences to take part in rehabilitative treatment programs; and the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>problem of parolees released without supportive treatment and supervision, all of which led to greater recidivism.

Those convicted of violent crimes like rape, sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, all of which entail lifetime registration pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.14 and § 9799.15, are statutorily barred from access to alternatives like county and state intermediate punishment and motivational boot camp because they are expressly excluded from “eligible offender” status, with only extremely narrow exceptions involving victim input and prosecutorial and court discretion, as noted above. But, as noted, sexual offenders in general are not specifically excluded from the class of “offenders” who may be eligible to participate in the new “Safe Community Reentry Program,” which are defined (in the singular) as “An inmate in a correctional institution or a person released from incarceration.

What can be said, however, is that the amended laws demonstrate a new approach to, <em>inter alia, </em>how decisions to grant parole are put into effect. Going forward, cooperation and collaboration among localities, government branches, agencies, and support providers, both public and private, offer the prospect that the circumstances that kept appellants in prison, despite the PBPP’s determination that they posed low or no potential risk to society and were eligible for release, may become more rare and less monolithic.</p>

By contrast, public safety concerns and the unique requirements associated with released sex offenders are not irrational, and the interest of all stakeholders in ensuring placement of such parolees in properly supervised and secure halfway house environments is unquestionably legitimate.
