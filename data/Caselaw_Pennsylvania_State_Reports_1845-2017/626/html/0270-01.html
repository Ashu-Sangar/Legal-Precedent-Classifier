It reasoned that both crimes require the unintentional death of a person caused by an individual operating a vehicle, but homicide by vehicle while DUI requires an additional element of a DUI conviction along with some other violation of the Vehicle Code other than DUI, e.g., failure to yield to a pedestrian, reckless driving, etc., because DUI itself does not cause an accident. <em><a href="/pa/588/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="906 A.2d 1153" data-case-ids="3788185,8469564" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0670-01,/a2d/906/1153-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/a3d/71/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="71 A.3d 1092" data-case-ids="7307638" data-case-paths="/a3d/71/1092-01">71 A.3d at 1097, n. 9</a>.

PennDOT maintains an operating privilege suspension is distinct from a criminal sentencing proceeding, and no statute directs PennDOT to defer to or abide by the sentencing court’s determination, but rather requires it to impose terms of suspension to accord with reports of specific convic<a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>tions. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1532. PennDOT cites to Section 9765 of the Sentencing Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> which requires that crimes must merge for sentencing purposes when they are greater and lesser-included offenses of each other but is silent as to merger of civil penalties. PennDOT posits that had the Legislature intended it to conduct a merger analysis before imposing suspensions for multiple Vehicle Code violations, a statute equivalent thereto would appear in the Vehicle Code, and a review of the Vehicle Code reveals no statute directing that operating privilege suspensions, which are strictly civil penalties, shall be merged where the criminal convictions which led to them have merged. PennDOT notes that where the Legislature wanted it to conduct a review of convictions under the Vehicle Code before assigning a civil penalty, it explicitly directed it to do so. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1535(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> PennDOT also reminds this Court that 75 Pa.C.S. § 1544(b) provides for an additional period of revocation or suspension when an individual’s record shows an additional suspension of the operating privilege assessed during a period of suspension or revocation, and it makes no mention of the necessity of a merger analysis before the existing suspension or revocation is extended. PennDOT also stresses that as it was not a party to the criminal proceeding, it never had an opportunity to dispute the merger of Bell’s convictions for sentencing purposes on behalf of the motoring public.</p>

Bell maintains Section 1532(a.l) of the Vehicle Code requires PennDOT to suspend the operating privileges of a driver for a period of three years for either a violation of Section 3732 or of Section 3735, not for both. Bell opines that while this Court has not previously applied the doctrine of merger or the “single episode rule” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> to Section (a.l), we have applied the single criminal episode rule to Section (c), and the doctrine of merger to Section (b), and the proper application of either herein would result in our sustaining the decision of the Commonwealth Court.

Bell further urges that the <em>Collins </em>decision is not controlling, for it reviewed criminal penalties assessed against a criminal, as opposed to civil sanctions imposed against the operating privileges of a motor vehicle driver, and he asserts that in Section 1532(a) the Legislature did not impose a penalty of suspension for each homicide violation, but rather for each loss of life, as is evident in its use of the term “any” which Bell reads as analogous with “either.” Had the Legislature intended a separate penalty for each conviction, so says Bell, it would have specifically indicated as much by inserting the words “and” or “each” in the text of the statute.</p>

He observed that a single criminal episode analysis is appropriate for criminal prosecutions, which necessarily implicate double jeopardy and other policy considerations, but is unnecessary in license suspension cases wherein a licensee already had been charged and convicted of the underlying offenses and the license suspension is simply a civil consequence of that crimi<a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>nal prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 295-296, <a href="/a2d/883/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="883 A.2d 503" data-case-ids="8908231,988570" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0503-01,/pa/584/0283-01">883 A.2d at 510</a> (Eakin, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>

Conventional statutory interpretation requires us to read a statute’s plain terms, for it is therein that we may discern the best evidence of legislative intent. Sections 1532(a) and (a.l) assign civil consequences for separately numbered criminal acts with no mention of merging those suspensions. Specifically, Section 1532(a) provides PennDOT shall impose a one-year suspension of one’s operating privilege upon receipt of a certified record of a conviction based upon a violation of any listed offenses. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(a). Similarly, Section 1532(a.l) mandates that Penn-DOT shall suspend a driver’s operating privilege for three years when it receives a certified record of his or her conviction based upon a violation of any of two separately designated offenses: (1) 3732 (relating to homicide by vehicle) and (2) 3735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while DUI). 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(a.l). Accordingly, the plain language of these statutory provisions in explicitly targeting “a violation of any of the following offenses” reveals a legislative intent that an individual’s operating privilege shall be suspended when he or she is convicted of one, more than one, or all of the individually listed and enumerated offenses; a suspension does not issue upon receipt of the criminal sentencing report.</p>

In this case, the defendant had been convicted of both DUI and Aggravated Assault by Vehicle while DUI following which two operating privilege suspensions were imposed. Upon finding the crimes involved were greater and lesser included offenses, the Commonwealth Court determined that a conviction for DUI and for aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI merged for sentencing purposes and also for purposes of the collateral civil consequences. <em><a href="/a2d/764/1056-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="764 A.2d 1056" data-case-ids="11169945,1276747" data-case-paths="/a2d/764/1056-01,/pa/564/0144-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/a2d/759/0953-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="759 A.2d 953" data-case-ids="11233844" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/0953-01">759 A.2d at 958</a>.</p>

However, given that the majority’s holding in this regard requires reversal of the Commonwealth Court’s order and fully disposes of the instant matter, its subsequent discussion of the proper interpretation of 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1532 and, more broadly, the application of merger principles to drivers’ license suspensions and other civil sanctions is non-precedential <em>obiter dictum.
