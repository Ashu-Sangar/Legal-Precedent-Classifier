    <p id="b470-8" data-blocks='[["BL_470.8",470,[275,1035,1150,955]]]'>The Commission seeks emergency relief from orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County and the Superior Court which effectively allow the production of allegedly confidential and privileged material sought in discovery requests served upon the Office of Attorney General (the “OAG”) in these criminal cases, scheduled to go to trial on August 18, 2014. The material consists of approximately 12 terabytes of data, estimated to include 30 million documents, copied from Commission hard drives and servers by the OAG during a grand jury investigation that ultimately resulted in criminal charges against the various defendants. The trial court denied the Commission’s motion for a protective order, and upon the Commission’s appeal to the Superior Court, denied the Commission’s motion for a stay pending appeal. The Superior Court initially granted a stay, but then vacated its own stay on July 14, 2014, without explanation, and scheduled briefing in the matter, with the initial brief due in Superior Court on July 29, 2014.</p>

(That grand jury investigation led to these prosecutions.) We ultimately held that, in the specific circumstances presented, and given the role of the OAG, in response to grand jury subpoenas, the Commission was not entitled to a protective order shielding its communications with government lawyers from the OAG. Notably, however, nothing in our decision in <em>Thirty-Third Grand Jm~y </em>remotely suggested that surrender of documents — as stated, approximately 30 million documents here — to the OAG for grand jury purposes means that all privileges are lost, nor did it suggest that the OAG, and the trial court in any ensuing prosecution, are absolved of their duties under discovery rules, including the protection of privileged material. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.Crim. P. 573 (pretrial discovery and inspection).</p>

    <blockquote id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.7",472,[324,1692,1110,419]]]'>[T]o the extent that there is a possibility that the discovery materials may contain confidential or personal information, the parties are directed that any information or material obtained from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and produced by the Commonwealth as part of discovery in this matter shall not be used, or the contents thereof communicated or disclosed to any person or entity, except as is necessary to the criminal trial of this matter.</blockquote>

In my view, this approach is obviously inadequate.</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[185,809,1148,856]]]'>In criminal matters, discovery is governed by specific rules, and the obligation is upon the prosecution to determine what material in its possession is properly discoverable. Our ruling for the distinct purposes of the underlying Grand Jury investigation did nothing to alter that obligation, and consign the determination of the status of protected material to defense counsel. Given the nature of the materials the trial court essentially authorized for unlimited disclosure to defense counsel, the Commission is obviously aggrieved and directly so; it is one thing for a bell that cannot be unrung to sound in the narrow confínes of a confidential, sealed grand jury investigation; it is quite another when it is in the context of a specific criminal prosecution, and the protection of private and privileged information consigned to defense counsel whose primary duty is to their specific clients and not to the Commission or its personnel.</p>
