    <blockquote id="b307-12" data-blocks='[["BL_307.13",307,[217,1213,1104,628]]]'>(1) Whether the Superior Court, in holding that a parent may only be designated a perpetrator of abuse if the child is “in the parent’s care at the time of the injury,” disregarded the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL) 23 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 6301-6386 and departed from established precedent which define “child abuse” to include “acts or omissions” and which permit the dependency court to identify a parent as a perpetrator based on prima facie evidence that the abuse would not have occurred but for the acts or omissions of the parent and clear and convincing evidence that the child was the victim of child abuse?</blockquote>
