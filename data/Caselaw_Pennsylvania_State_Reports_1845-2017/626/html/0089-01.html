The trial court and Commonwealth Court both held that once a child who meets a district’s minimum entrance age is enrolled in a district’s public school kindergarten program, the child is subject to compulsory school attendance, meaning continuous and consistent attendance without excessive unexcused absences. We affirm.</p>

The same article makes clear that school districts are not required to establish kindergarten programs, although they may do so as a matter of discretion, and if a district establishes such a program, it “shall be an integral part of the elementary school system of the district, and be kept open for not less than two and one-half hours each day for the full school term....” <em>Id. </em>§ 5-503.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The absences were reported to the District and in January 2012, appellant was issued summonses for three violations of the School Code’s compulsory school attendance provision at 24 P.S. § 13-1327.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> After a summary trial on February 3, 2012, a magisterial district judge found appellant guilty of all three counts; a fine, costs, and fees were imposed upon appellant for each count.

David Harrison, principal of the elementary school and an administrator with the District, testified that the District followed the Pennsylvania School Code of 1949 and maintained a compliant written policy that set forth lawful excuses for absences and advised that parents/guardians had a three-day grace period after an absence to provide a proper excuse. Harrison testified that appellant had never to his knowledge provided the school with legitimate excuses for her daughters’ absences. Harrison said that a school counselor had spoken with appellant to discuss her difficulty getting her <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>daughters to school, but he was not aware of any concrete reason (such as transportation issues) why the children could not attend school consistently.

    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[292,466,1150,783]]]'>Appellant testified that at the time of the absences in question, she had just regained custody of the girls after a period they spent away from her under supervision of the local Children and Youth Services (“CYS”). The record does not explain the length of time or reason why the children were with CYS. According to appellant, the children “acted out” in the mornings and refused to get dressed; she thought the girls were anxious about school and being away from her, even for the day. Appellant testified that she spoke with a school counselor and asked for help, but was refused. Appellant added that she learned from a “Pennsylvania State Education website” that children in kindergarten were not subject to truancy citations; rather, she understood it to mean that “[ojnly students of compulsory school age, which is first grade, age 8, can be cited.” N.T., 5/8/12, at 13-19.</p>

When proceedings resumed, the prosecutor noted that he found “one thing that’s extremely confusing.” According to the prosecutor, the Unified Judicial System (“UJS”) website’s recitation of Purdon’s Pennsylvania Statutes mirrored the definition of “compulsory school age” in the School Code’s attendance enforcement provisions: “the period of a child’s life from the time the child’s parents elect to have the child enter school, which shall be not later than at the age of eight (8) years, until the age of seventeen (17) years.” 24 P.S. § 13-1326 (“Enforcing Attendance: Definitions”). But, the prosecutor further noted, the entry for “compulsory school age” on the Department of Education’s website, to which appellant had adverted, also included the term “beginner,” which is defined in a different section of Article 13 of the School Code as: “any child that should enter the lowest grade of the primary school or the lowest primary class above the kindergarten level.” 24 P.S. § 13-1304(c) (“Admission: Admission of Beginners”). The prosecutor concluded: “If that’s correct, [appellant] is abso<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>lutely correct, that a child who is enrolled in kindergarten is not of compulsory school age.” N.T., 5/8/12, at 19-20.</p>
    <p id="b145-5" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[175,426,1148,734]]]'>Neither the prosecutor nor Principal Harrison were able to explain the potential discrepancy or relationship between “compulsory school age” and “beginner.” The prosecutor suggested that because providing kindergarten is optional for school districts in Pennsylvania, perhaps districts cannot compel children’s attendance at kindergarten. At that point, the prosecutor stated: “I think that [appellant], in fairness, without me being her attorney, has a colorable argument here.” The court, unable to resolve what it described as a “perplexing question” without further advocacy, continued the matter and appointed the county public defender to represent appellant; the parties were to prepare memoranda addressing “compulsory school age” and “beginner” under the School Code. N.T., 5/8/12, at 20-29.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[172,1186,1151,1166]],["BL_146.1",146,[291,300,1146,402]]]'>At a further hearing on June 29, 2012, the trial court observed that the Department of Education’s regulations commingle the terms “beginner” and “compulsory school age,” despite their evident inconsistency. Reading from the Department’s regulations at 22 Pa.Code § 11.13, the court stated: “[C]ompulsory school age refers to the period of the child’s life from the time the child enters school as a beginner, which may be no later than at the age of 8 years, until the age of 17 or graduation from a high school, whichever first occurs. A beginner is a child who enters a school district’s lowest elementary grade — elementary school grade that is above kindergarten.” According to the court, the Department’s regulation improperly modified the Code’s statutory definition of “compulsory school age” by importing “beginner” into it. As a practical matter, the court added, the Department’s regulation required that school districts enroll children upon a parent or guardian’s election, but then improperly prevented districts from compelling kindergarten attendance, which could result in “kindergarten classes from no one up to the full enrollment or anything in between with no way of structuring an educational program.” The court doubted that the General Assembly intended to create such a practical dilemma for <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>school districts, and concluded that the Department’s regulation was an impermissible modification of legislation, which could not be given legal effect. Thus, under Section 13-1327 of the School Code, the trial court concluded that once appellant enrolled her children in kindergarten, they were <em>de fapto </em>of “compulsory school age,” and therefore subject to the compulsory school attendance requirement. N.T., 6/29/12, at 2-7.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[288,735,1149,843]]]'>Appellant’s counsel orally moved to dismiss the charges. While denying the motion, the trial court recognized that the issue was problematic, and that it could potentially affect school districts across the Commonwealth; the court therefore determined that an interlocutory appeal to the Commonwealth Court would be appropriate. N.T., 6/29/12, at 10-13. In an order on the same date, the court formally denied appellant’s motion to dismiss, but deemed the matter continued in expectation of appellant’s appeal to the Commonwealth Court. Appellant (represented by the same counsel, but in a private capacity and no longer as public defender) timely filed a petition seeking to certify the matter for interlocutory appeal, which the trial court granted in an order dated July 30, 2012. The Commonwealth Court accepted the appeal in an order dated August 21, 2012, and stayed proceedings at the trial court level pending the appeal.</p>
    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[288,1603,1149,734]]]'>In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion on the merits, the trial court noted that the apparent “audiences” of the two School Code sections at issue differed. According to the court, Section 13-1327 (“compulsory school age”) directs and instructs parents and students on compulsory attendance, while Section 13-1304 guides school districts in developing legally compliant admissions policies and programs. The court concluded that despite the confusion wrought by inclusion of the term “beginner” in the Department’s regulation on compulsory school age, the General Assembly clearly intended that once a parent or guardian enrolls a child in public school, including kindergarten if it is available, the child must attend consistently, subject to the Code’s compulsory attendance provisions.

      <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>As a matter of public policy and practicality, the trial court added, this construction is most logical because for districts to voluntarily provide for kindergarten, but then to be unable to enforce the School Code’s compulsory attendance provisions, “would essentially turn our public schools into a free child care situation.” In addition to concluding that appellant’s children were subject to the compulsory attendance requirement, the trial court added that the Department’s regulation suggesting otherwise “should immediately be reversed and corrected to comply with the clear mandate of the statute.” <em>Id.</em>

Appellant added that since the School Code was passed in 1949, no ensuing legislative directive has made kindergarten attendance mandatory: “To put it simply, if the legislature had intended to compel kindergarten students to attend school and be subject to the sanctions of the Compulsory Attendance Laws, then action would have been taken by now.” Appellant’s Brief to Commonwealth Court, at 5-7.</p>

The Commonwealth asserted that <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>“despite an inconsistent regulatory definition to the contrary,” the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, per Section 13-1326’s definition of “compulsory school age,” dictates that once children are enrolled in school, regardless of grade or age, the compulsory attendance requirement is triggered. The Commonwealth added that, as the trial court had explained, the term “beginner” is not used in Section 13-1326’s attendance enforcement provision at all, but rather is found in a distinct School Code provision, Section 13-1304. That Section defines the class of students for whom school districts must provide education (students above six years old through seventeen years old or completion of high school). To the Commonwealth, although Sections 13-1326 and 13-1304 both address the age when children may start school, they do so for different purposes and there was no conflict, impossibility, or absurdity in the trial court’s construction. Furthermore, the Commonwealth added, the statute overrides any inconsistent departmental regulation. Commonwealth’s Brief to Commonwealth Court, at 1-4.</p>

Writing for the panel majority, the Honorable Robert Simpson found the statutory definition of “compulsory school age” at Section 13-1326 to be clear and unambiguous; and the Department of Education’s regulation, 22 Pa.Code § 11.13, with its use of the term “beginner,” to be “clearly inconsistent” with the Code and therefore of no effect under the settled proposition that the governing statute trumps an inconsistent administrative regulation.</p>

The majority recognized that in this case, the Department’s inconsistent regulation may have caused appellant’s erroneous belief that her children were not subject to compulsory attendance at kindergarten. Nevertheless, the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>majority continued: “Although ... parents are not required to enroll their child in kindergarten, once the election to enroll a child in school is made, the child is subject to the Code’s compulsory attendance requirements. In other words, the compulsory school attendance provisions apply to any student enrolled in public school, regardless of whether they are enrolled in kindergarten.” The court thus affirmed the trial court’s denial of appellant’s motion to dismiss the charges and remanded for further proceedings, including consideration of any remaining issues. Additionally, the majority directed that a copy of its opinion and order be forwarded to the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, presumably to address the inconsistency between its regulation and the statutory definition of “compulsory school age.” <a href="/a3d/62/1065-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="62 A.3d 1065" data-case-ids="7309981" data-case-paths="/a3d/62/1065-01">62 A.3d at 1068-71</a>.</p>

Thus, a parent may choose to enroll a student in first grade earlier than, but no later than, age eight.” The dissent posited that the key to Section 13-1326 is enrollment in first grade, not kindergarten:</p>

Thus, appellant argues that since Pennsylvania school districts are not compelled by law to offer kindergarten programs, a student who enrolls in such a program cannot be compelled by law to attend. Appellant initially concedes that a plain reading of Sections 13-1326 and 13-1327 of the School Code undermines her argument, but she argues that the answer differs when the Court considers those provisions in concert with other Code sections. As appellant did below, she relies on the definition of the term “beginner” in Section 13-1304 and the Department’s regulations, which draw a line of distinction between “the kindergarten level” and “the lowest primary class above the kindergarten level” (generally, first grade). Appellant then posits that regular attendance can only be compelled when a child is eligible for first grade, “the lowest primary class above the kindergarten level.”</p>

Rather, <em>amicus </em>believes, the School Code’s compulsory attendance provisions must be read to protect the discretion of responsible parents to make this type of decision: “Parents should not be penalized with truancy charges for simply misreading a five-year-old child’s readiness for institutional education.” <em>Amicus </em>Brief, at 3-6.</p>

To the Commonwealth, the compulsory school attendance provision is clear and unambiguous, and therefore its plain meaning and effect must control. The Commonwealth notes that the statutory definition of “compulsory school age” simply does not distinguish between enrollment in kindergarten and higher grades: the Code does not address which level of school a child is enrolled in, but focuses instead on the very act of enrollment, regardless of age, which includes kindergarten if such a program is offered by a school district and a parent or guardian elects to enroll their of-age child in the program. The Commonwealth also cites 24 P.S. § 5-503, which provides that kindergartens, if established by a district, “shall be an integral part of the elementary school system of the district^]” Put another way, the Commonwealth continues, the plain language of Section 13-1326 entails two different <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>triggers for compulsory school attendance: (1) when a child’s parents or guardians “elect to have the child enter school,” or (2) when a child reaches eight years of age. In this case, appellant’s daughters were under eight years old when she enrolled them in the district’s public kindergarten program; to the Commonwealth, appellant thereby “elected to have the girls enter school” and they were thus subject to the mandatory attendance requirement.

The Commonwealth acknowledges that the regulatory error has been compounded by its inclusion on the Department’s public website and in “Basic Education Circulars” — informational documents the Department produces and offers on its website.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Commonwealth maintains that, despite the Department’s advice that children in kindergarten are not “beginners” and therefore are not subject to mandatory attendance, this is not what Section 13-1326 actually says. The Commonwealth posits that any alleged ambiguity regarding the term “compulsory school age,” as used in the attendance enforcement provisions in Sections 13-1326 and 13-1327, arises only from the presence of the term “beginner” from a separate School Code provision, Section 13-1304. The Commonwealth stresses that Section 13-1304 addresses the manner in which school districts are required to admit students into the lowest grade of primary school, for which purpose the children are termed “beginners.” However, according to the Commonwealth, “[t]he term ‘beginner’ has nothing to do with compulsory school attendance; it defines the class of students <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>that the state is obligated to educate.” To the Commonwealth, because the Department’s regulatory interpretation of “compulsory school age” is plainly inconsistent with the statute itself, and would limit its application, the regulation is invalid.</p>

The correct logic, the Commonwealth offers, is that all children enrolled in school are subject to compulsory attendance; all children enrolled in kindergarten are enrolled in school, as set forth in Section 5-503; and therefore all children enrolled in kindergarten are subject to compulsory attendance. In a footnote, the Commonwealth addresses the arguments forwarded by <em>amicus </em>respecting enrolled children whose parents later determine they are not quite ready for school. The Commonwealth states that it supports the concept of a formal “withdrawal and waiting,” and would not view such children as subject to compulsory attendance. But, the Commonwealth also stresses that the issue here did not involve withdrawal and waiting, but rather, appellant’s inability to get her daughters to school; a fact that <em>amicus </em>essentially conceded.

Unlike Part A of Article XIII, the enforcement provision says nothing about “beginners,” and nothing about the compulsory attendance requirement excluding kindergarten.

Part B addresses various alternative schooling scenarios, such as provisions governing parents or guardians who homeschool and the duties of parents respecting children who are disabled to an extent that makes them unable to attend the local public school; this Part also includes measures intended to ensure that consistent school attendance will not be affected by a child’s lack of transportation, board and lodging, or clothing and food; district authorities and localities are tasked with providing these necessities at public cost in order that children will be able to attend school every day. <em><a href="/pa/603/0374-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="983 A.2d 1231" data-case-ids="4196588,7294633" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0374-01,/a2d/983/1231-01">Id.</a> </em>§§ 13-1327.1, 1328, 1331, 1334 to 13-1337.1.</p>

The question before the Commonwealth Court in <em>O’Leary v.

The dispute in <em>O’Leary </em>was about whether a district, having elected to provide a kindergarten program which set a minimum entrance age, must bend to the different age policy of another district when a child moves from the latter to the former. The <em>O’Leary </em>court’s reference to the term “beginners” — in both Section 13-1304 and the Department’s regulation — was made only in the context of examining the obligations of the school district. <a href="/citations/?q=364%20A.2d%20770" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="364 A.2d 770">364 A.2d at </a>773 &amp; n. 5.

The perceived “hypocrisy” affords no basis in law for failing to enforce the statute as written. And, in any event, as the trial court noted, it is not difficult to imagine why the General Assembly would seek to ensure that, once a school district makes the discretionary decision to offer free public kindergarten, at its taxpayers’ expense, the parents whose children <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>are its beneficiaries, should the parents elect to do so, be required to make use of the program.

However, it is undisputed that appellant did not withdraw her daughters — formally or informally— based upon a judgment that they were not yet ready for formal schooling; she simply had difficulty managing to motivate or convince her children to ready themselves on certain days.</p>

In light of the Commonwealth’s responsive position, however, it is worth noting that it has not been argued to us, nor is it apparent, that the School Code is being enforced in Pennsylvania in a fashion that prevents parents from formally withdrawing their children from kindergarten; nor should this Opinion be read as approving (or disapproving) of such a practice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
