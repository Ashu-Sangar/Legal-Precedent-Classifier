The Commonwealth Court held that the partnership was subject to PIT commensurate with the total debt discharged as a result of the foreclosure, and therefore the nonresident limited partners were liable for PIT in an amount proportionate with their shares in the partnership. In this case that presents several issues of first impression, for the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>

Appellants’ interests in the Partnership ranged from one-quarter of a unit to one unit.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> All Appellants were non-Pennsylvania residents. The sole purpose of the Partnership, which was organized pursuant to Connecticut law, was the purchase and management of the property located at 600 Grant Street in the downtown section of the City of Pittsburgh, commonly known as the U.S. Steel Building (the Property). In all, 735 limited partners, only 25 of whom were Pennsylvania residents, comprised the Part<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>nership. All of the limited partners were passive investors; none took an active role in managing the Property.</p>
    <p id="b185-5" data-blocks='[["BL_185.5",185,[176,424,1150,741]]]'>Investment in the Partnership began when the general partner made a comprehensive “Offering Memorandum” available to potential investors. The memorandum stated that while the Partnership would likely incur economic and tax losses for the first several years of its existence, due to expected growth in the Pittsburgh commercial real estate market, eventually the limited partners would be allocated a substantial gain upon the anticipated sale of the Property. The memorandum further specified that each investor could be subject to negative tax consequences, both under federal and Pennsylvania tax laws. The memorandum also indicated that these tax consequences would be determined primarily based on the financial liquidity of the Property when the mortgage on the Property matured.</p>

Of that, $52 million was paid in cash, and the Partnership pledged the Property as collateral to secure a nonrecourse Purchase Money Mortgage Note (PMM Note), with an initial principal balance of the remaining $308 million.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Interest on the PMM Note was payable on a monthly basis, at a rate of 14.55% per annum. The PMM Note contained an important caveat, however: should the monthly interest amount exceed the Partnership’s net operating income from the Property, the excess did not have to be paid, and instead would defer and compound on an annual basis, subject to the same 14.55% rate. The PMM Note originally delineated the maturity date as November 1, 2001; the parties subsequently extended that date to January 2, 2005.</p>

Relevant to this case, for PIT purposes, the Partnership allocated those losses to Appellants (and all of the other limited partners) and, because Appellants had no Pennsylvania-based income for 1985-2004, they did not file Pennsylvania PIT returns for those years. Moreover, because the net operating income was less than the monthly interest on the PMM Note, the Partnership did not pay the interest and therefore deferred it as noted above. By June 30, 2005, the compounded, accrued interest totaled $2.32 billion, thus making the total liability on the PMM Note more than $2.6 billion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Accordingly, on June 30, 2005, the lender foreclosed, and, because the Partnership no longer owned the Property (which was the sole reason for the Partnership’s existence), the Partnership soon after liquidated. None of the limited partners, including Appellants, received any proceeds from the Property’s foreclosure or the Partnership’s liquidation, and therefore lost their entire investments in the Partnership.</p>

Therefore, and despite their individual investment losses, the Pennsylvania <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>Department of Revenue (the Department) assessed PIT against Appellants, plus interest and penalties, related to the foreclosure on the Property for tax year 2005. The PIT equaled each limited partner’s distributive share of the gain associated with the foreclosure, multiplied by the Pennsylvania PIT rate of 3.07%. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7306.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Appellants unsuccessfully challenged the assessments in the Department’s Board of Appeals and, subsequently, in the Board of Finance and Revenue.

First, the dissent averred that the applicable Pennsylvania Tax Code provisions and Department regulations did not support the finding that PIT could be assessed on the foreclosure, regardless of the <em>Tufts </em>decision. Unlike the IRC, which defines income broadly, the Code is explicit in what is and is not income. The dissent therefore contended that, to the extent the Code is ambiguous regarding whether the foreclosure upon a nonrecourse mortgage is taxable, the Code must be construed strictly in favor of the taxpayers, and therefore absent direction from the General Assembly that situations such as that presented instantly fall within the Code, courts should construe applicable Pennsylvania law against imposing such a tax.</p>

Moreover, and specific to the Uniformity Clause argument, in the Dissent’s view, both resident and non-resident limited partners in the Partnership were all on equal footing in the Partnership, <em>i.e., </em>members of the same class as all were passive investors, each of whom sustained the same loss of their respective investments.

Appellants concede, <em>arguendo, </em>that if any PIT should be assessed to them, it should be their share of $429,600,000, which equals the amount originally mortgaged ($308 million), plus the $121,600,000 in the accrued interest which was used to offset the resulting small amount of income the Partnership generated from the Property.

Department’s Brief at 45. Indeed, in the Department’s view, the tax benefit rule has no application in the instant case at all. Quoting from the Bittker article cited to by Appellants, the Department notes that the tax benefit rule may only be implemented to the extent that previous “deductions or credits failed to reduce the taxpayer’s taxes.” Bittker &amp; Kanner, <em>supra </em>p. 36, at 276. A “taxpayer cannot introduce deductions, however valid, that were not claimed on the earlier return to establish that deducting the recovered item served no tax benefit.” <em>Id. </em>at 278. The Department contends that Appellants fall precisely into this prohibition, because they never took any deductions for PIT purposes in the tax years prior to the foreclosure in light of the Property never accruing any profit or income for the Partnership. In other words, there was no loss that was previously deducted; indeed, Appellants generally did not file Pennsylvania PIT returns for any of the prior tax years, because filing was unnecessary due to the lack of income. <em>Cf. John Hancock, </em><a href="/fed-cl/61/1302-01" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="378 F.3d 1302" data-case-ids="2201717,9216850" data-case-paths="/fed-cl/61/1302-01,/f3d/378/1302-01">378 F.3d at 1305</a> (noting that, <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>for the tax benefit rule to be applicable, “there must be a loss that was deducted but did not result in a tax benefit.”). The Department thus concludes, “[bjecause [Appellants] did not deduct anything at all, there is no corresponding portion of the subsequent income or gain (upon foreclosure) that can be excluded from the amount realized pursuant to the tax benefit rule.” Department’s Brief at 48.</p>

The Department argues that “[t]he most that can be gleaned from Table 16-2 is that, in some situations, ‘Partnerships and Pennsylvania S Corporations’ with an ‘unused PA PIT loss’ may be ‘eligible for tax benefit rule.’ <em>Id. </em>at 49.” Here, the general thrust of the tax benefit rule, as alluded to by the Department, does not give Appellants the benefit of Table 16-2 because, again, there simply was never a deduction for a PIT loss in a prior year, let alone one without tax consequences.</p>

The Department begins by harkening back to <em>Tufts, </em>which “alluded to ‘the full value of the outstanding liability’ being included in the amount realized upon the disposition of the mortgaged property.” <em>Id. </em>at 41 (quoting <em>Tufts, </em><a href="/us/461/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="461 U.S. 300" data-case-ids="11298509" data-case-paths="/us/461/0300-01">461 U.S. at </a>310 n. 11, <a href="/us/461/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="461 U.S. 300" data-case-ids="11298509" data-case-paths="/us/461/0300-01">103 S.Ct. 1826</a>).

      <em>Tufts, </em>however, involved a sale of property and not a foreclosure. The Commonwealth Court then, in the Department’s view, correctly turned to <em>Allan, </em>which did concern a foreclosure upon property encumbered by a nonrecourse mortgage. The Department reads <em>Allan </em>as permitting “inclusion of the ‘advances for interest added to the nonrecourse mortgage principal,’ so long as those advances constituted ‘a <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>legitimate debt obligation, <em>i.e. </em>a true loan.’ ” <em>Id. </em>at 42-43 (quoting <em>Allan, </em><a href="/f2d/856/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="127" data-cite="856 F.2d 1169" data-case-ids="10536724" data-case-paths="/f2d/856/1169-01">856 F.2d at 1173</a>). In permitting the inclusion of the interest advances, the <em>Allan </em>Court looked to several factors in concluding that the mortgage contract constituted a true loan, including the arms-length nature of the business relationship, the clear terms of the mortgage and their consistence with standard business practices, the legitimate business reasons for structuring the nonrecourse loan in that manner, and the potential for repayment of the accrued interest. <em>Allan, </em><a href="/f2d/856/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="128" data-cite="856 F.2d 1169" data-case-ids="10536724" data-case-paths="/f2d/856/1169-01">856 F.2d at 1173</a>.

      <em> </em>However, as the Commonwealth Court did, we easily agree with the Department that the exclusionary arm of the tax benefit rule simply has no application in the instant appeal. As noted above, the tax benefit rule began as a product of federal common law with cases such as <em>Dobson, </em>and was eventually codified by Congress in Section 111 of the IRC; the Department has seemingly incorporated the rule into Pennsylvania tax law through Table 16-2. <em>Dobson </em>and its progeny, as well as Section 111, all require that the attempted exclusion of realized gain be related to a deduction without tax consequence from a prior year. Appellants have not pointed to any jurisprudence, regulation, or Department policy that states otherwise. Through all of their protestations regarding the mandatory application of the exclusionary arm of the tax benefit rule, Appellants never address this salient point, nor, more importantly, when they attempted to take the required <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>prior deduction.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a> Thus, in our view, there simply can be no application of the tax benefit rule in this case.</p>

In <em>Allan, </em>the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insured a nonrecourse mortgage on an apartment building. After three years of ownership, the partnership defaulted upon the mortgage, and HUD acquired the mortgage from the mortgagee. Given the financial difficulties of the partnership, HUD paid the real estate taxes associated with the building and further charged the partnership interest based upon the mortgage principal. The amount of paid taxes, plus the interest, was then added to the mortgage principal. The partnership unfortunately continued to encounter additional financial difficulties, and HUD ultimately initiated foreclosure proceedings. In order to discontinue the proceedings, the partnership transferred its interest in the building, plus approximately $57,000, to HUD. By this point, the partnership’s liability under the nonrecourse mortgage, including the real property taxes advanced by HUD and the interest upon the mortgage, totaled almost $1.5 million, and the partnership’s adjusted basis in the apartment building was less than half of that.</p>

The Commonwealth Court below employed the <em>Allan </em>decision, albeit with some hesitancy. We do not feel the same reluctance. In our view, upon accepting <em>Tufts </em>as the controlling law of this case, <em>Allan </em>flows staunchly from it, and directs that the accrued interest constitutes income for purposes of PIT. Indeed, the terms of the PMM Note contemplated the postponement of the normal interest payments on the nonrecourse mortgage should the Partnership operate at a loss for any given month, with the acknowledgement that such payment would defer and compound on an annual basis at the agreed upon interest rate of 14.55%. This agreement was not contemplated as any sort of tax shelter, but rather with the understanding that the Partnership might well fail to turn any profits in the first few years of its ownership of the Property. As the <em>Allan </em>Court explained, “the Partnership secured additional loans from [the lender],” <em>i.e., </em>funds to pay the interest, which the lender then compounded onto the original principal. <em>Allan, <a href="/f2d/856/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="856 F.2d 1169" data-case-ids="10536724" data-case-paths="/f2d/856/1169-01">856 </a></em><a href="/f2d/856/1169-01" class="citation" data-index="138" data-cite="856 F.2d 1169" data-case-ids="10536724" data-case-paths="/f2d/856/1169-01">F.2d at 1173</a>.

Pursuant to Department Regulation 121.13(a), 61 Pa.Code § 121.13(a), in light of the uniqueness of the Pennsylvania Tax Code, which divides income into eight specific categories, “a person shall not be allowed to offset a gain in one class of income with a loss in another class of income.” For reasons unclear from its opinion, the Commonwealth Court refused Appellants any deduction on the basis that they sought a deduction based upon the net operating losses suffered by the Partnership during its years of existence, and not based upon losses arising from Appellants’ individual investments in the Partnership. Indeed, the Commonwealth Court denied the deduction, holding that the foreclosure which generated the income gain constituted a disposition of real property (Section 7303(a)(3)), while the net operating losses of the Partnership represented a business expense (Section 7303(a)(2)).</p>

Appellants contend that a causative factor exists between the Partnership and the Property: the Partnership would not have existed without the Property, and when the Property was foreclosed upon, the <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>Partnership liquidated and ceased to exist. Accordingly, Appellants posit that both the investment loss and the gain associated with the foreclosure constituted one economic transaction, all related to the disposition of the Property, and therefore the deduction should be permitted.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[171,575,1150,521]]]'>The Department responds with two discrete arguments. First, while recognizing that the liquidation of the Partnership and the foreclosure upon the Property were related events and close in time, the Department argues that they were not the same economic transaction; merely because the Property was foreclosed upon, the Partnership did not have to terminate. Indeed, the foreclosure occurred pursuant to Pennsylvania law, while the liquidation of the Partnership transpired under Connecticut law, thus, in the Department’s view, demonstrating the separate nature of the two events.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[171,1119,1152,840]]]'>The second contention is much more substantive, and diverges from the Commonwealth Court’s reasoning below. Initially, it appears that the Department disagrees with the Commonwealth Court’s suggestion that the disposition of the Property and the investment loss are two different classes of income. The Department notes that Section 7303(a)(3) of the Code includes the sale, exchange, or disposition of both “real property” and “intangible personal property.” 72 P.S. § 7303(a)(3). “Unlike certain other forms of personal property, ... a partnership interest is inherently an intangible asset. It follows that the purchase or sale of a partnership interest is a purchase or sale of an intangible asset, potentially taxable under [Section] 7303(a)(3).” Department’s Brief at 51 (citing 15 Pa.C.S. § 8561 (providing, within the Pennsylvania Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, that “[a] partnership interest is personal property”)).</p>

Department’s Brief at 52 (citing Pa. PIT Bulletin 2005-02, § 2, <em>found at </em>Reproduced Record (R.R.) 795a.).

    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[289,734,1150,830]]]'>This issue presents an interesting conundrum, because Appellants argue that both the investment loss and the Property’s foreclosure constitute the disposition of real property pursuant to Section 7303(a)(3), while the Department likewise avers that the investment loss should be considered under Section 7303(a)(3) as intangible personal property. Theoretically, this would negate the Commonwealth Court’s determination that no deduction could be made by Appellants at all under the “cross-class” prohibition of Regulation 121.13(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a> However, the Department would have us decline the deduction based upon the situs of the intangible personal property, <em>ie., </em>Appellants’ individual partnership interests, because the gain or loss from the disposition of intangible personal property cannot be accounted for within the Commonwealth; Appellants would have to claim those losses (or gains) on tax returns filed in their home states. <em>See </em>Pa.

With that, we first examine what, for tax purposes, Appellants’ individual interests in the Partnership actually are. As noted above, Appellants argue that the Partnership interests and the disposition of the Property are essentially one in the same, while the Department contends that the Partnership interests are intangible personal property, which Section 7303(a)(3) includes as within the class of “[n]et gains or income from disposition of property.” Intangible personal property is not defined anywhere in the Code or the Department’s Regulations. It is defined, however, in Black’s Law Dictionary as “property that lacks a physical existence!; e]xamples include stock options and business goodwill,” as opposed to tangible personal property, which has physical characteristics. Black’s Law Dictionary (9th ed.) (defining “property”). Further, we have persuasive guidance from the United States Supreme Court regarding partnership interests and their status as tangible or intangible personal property.</p>

For similar reasons, the Commonwealth Court majority refused to apply the so-called “tax benefit rule,” which will be explained in greater detail <em>infra </em>Part IV, to reduce Appellants' tax liability. For ease of discussion, we briefly note that the tax benefit rule is a creation of federal common law, which has been used by the IRS and federal courts to reduce the detrimental effect that annual accounting methods may have on tax liability. As recognized by the United States Supreme Court, the tax benefit rule is utilized only in situations where the occurrence of an event in an earlier tax year that permitted a deduction, subsequently results in realized income in a later tax year. <em>See Hillsboro Nat'l Bank v.

As an aside, we are compelled to comment briefly upon the manner in which the Commonwealth Court decided that the <em>Tufts </em>rule is encompassed within Section 7303(a)(3) and Regulation 103.13.
