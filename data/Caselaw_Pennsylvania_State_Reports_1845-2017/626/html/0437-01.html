According to OOR, Section 901 affords an agency five business days to respond to a RTKL request after receipt of the request by any employee of the agency. Instantly, OOR concluded that the five business day period for responding to Donahue’s request began to run on March 7, the date on which an OG employee first received the request, and that the request was therefore “deemed denied” when OG failed to respond within five business days, which was by March 14.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The fact that OG’s open-records officer did not receive the request until March 12 was immaterial to OOR’s analysis.

To the contrary, OG argued that an agency, including it, has five business days to respond from the date its RTKL open-records officer receives the request for records. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.901 (stating that agencies must respond to record requests within “five business days from the date the written request is received by the open-records officer for an agency.”). On July 2, 2012, the Commonwealth Court issued a <em>per curiam </em>order quashing OG’s petition for appellate review.

OG argues that OOR’s interpretation of Section 901 would require a result that is both impossible in execution and absurd in implementation. OG warns that if Section 901 is interpreted as to require an agency response within five business days of receipt by any agency employee, then agencies will be confronted with the impossible task of averring that no agency personnel are in receipt of a request. Finally, OG submits that if OOR’s interpretation of Section 901 is upheld, agencies will experience “shotgun” RTKL record requests where duplicate requests are submitted to multiple agency employees.

OOR’s interpretation, however, does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the language in Section 901 that specifically directs agencies to respond within “five business days from the date the written request is received by the open-records officer for an agency.” While OOR acknowledges that the plain language of Section 901 affords an agency’s open-records officer five business days to respond to a RTKL records request, OOR adds, without any basis, that this holds true only if the officer is the first agency employee to receive the request. <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>Because OOR’s interpretation does not give effect to all the language contained in Section 901, and otherwise inserts language that does not appear in the text of the statute, we reject OOR’s construction of Section 901. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a), 1922(2).</p>

In quashing the appeal, the Commonwealth Court capsulized the issue as follows: “Because petitioner is not aggrieved by the April 30, 2012 order but merely disagrees with an issue decided against it, it lacks standing to appeal the April 30, 2012 order.” Order, 7/2/2013 <em>(per </em>curiam) (citing <em>Ridgway’s Magnetics Co. v.

Nevertheless, with respect to the parallel declaratory judgment count, the Commonwealth Court overruled the OOR’s preliminary objections, holding that the Office of the Governor did have standing to sue, premised upon the very same averment of harm caused by the <em>Donahue </em>decision that was insufficient to confer standing to appeal. On the merits, the Commonwealth Court ultimately agreed with the Office of the Governor’s interpretation of Section 901 of the RTKL. The Office of the Governor did not appeal the decision of the Commonwealth Court that it lacked standing to pursue a direct appeal of the <em>Donahue </em>decision. The lower Court’s “standing to appeal” decision and the Office of the Governor’s <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>concession have inextricable practical implications on how this Court reaches the merits of the dispute over the proper interpretation of Section 901.</p>
    <p id="b519-4" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[174,472,1150,1703]]]'>The merits of the dispute regarding Section 901 are before this Court in the direct appeal of the OOR from the Commonwealth Court’s decision granting the Office of the Governor declaratory judgment relief. The OOR raises three questions. The second question — addressed by the Majority in Part III of the Opinion — asks “Whether the Commonwealth Court erred by finding it had jurisdiction over the Governor’s original jurisdiction complaint alleging a misinterpretation of statutory law in the absence of any harm or constitutional question?” As the Majority notes, in its briefing of the question, the OOR conflates the distinct notions of jurisdiction, standing, and exhaustion of statutory remedies. <em>See </em>Majority Op. at 449-50, 98 A.3d at 1230-31. The OOR’s chief complaint, however, is that the Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Office of the Governor failed to exhaust the available statutory remedies. Notably, the Office of the Governor’s brief is not responsive to the OOR’s actual arguments relating to the exhaustion of statutory remedies claim. Instead, the Office of the Governor suggests that the Commonwealth Court had original jurisdiction over the dispute because a declaratory judgment action is the sole means of obtaining review of the OOR’s interpretation of Section 901. The argument is premised upon the notion — unsupported by citation to the relevant rules of procedure, decisional law, or a principled analysis — that standing to appeal an administrative agency decision and standing to bring a declaratory judgment action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court implicate distinct requirements of aggrievement. For my part, the Commonwealth Court’s decision and the Office of the Governor’s concession relating to standing to appeal is the proverbial “elephant” in this room, with respect to which I offer the following.</p>

Neither the RTKL nor the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure purport to foreclose the appeal of a “prevailing” party — the ultimate “winner” of a dispute — upon that ground alone.

Notably, Section 1301 does not articulate special rules of appealability applicable to RTKL cases. Meanwhile, the rule of appellate procedure governing which persons may take or participate in appeals — Rule 501— states that, “any party who is aggrieved by an appealable order ... may appeal therefrom.” According to the commentary to Rule 501, “[wjhether or not a party is aggrieved by the action below is a substantive question determined by the effect of the action on the party, etc.” Pa.R.A.P. 501 &amp; note.

First, the lower court decision seemingly sanctioned an agency decision to by-pass the administrative review process and to shortcut the procedure by filing an action in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court and obtaining review as of right in this Court. Second, the declaratory judgment action is a collateral attack on the administrative decision that would enable the parties to proceed upon a lower burden of proof than in an appeal from an OOR decision, and to avoid salutary prudential concerns such as preservation and presentation of issues. Finally, these procedural artifices place an unnecessary burden upon this Court’s limited resources. The OOR’s and the Commonwealth Court’s miscues in interpreting the RTKL have already generated a flurry of appeals that this Court has accepted on its discretionary docket. The lower court’s approach in this matter has the potential effect of swinging the door open for litigants in OOR matters to file direct appeals of right to this Court.

Respectfully, in my view, it is beyond dispute that, as a general matter, the RTKL provides agencies (including the Office of the Governor) with a statutory remedy to challenge an adverse OOR decision. Any lack of remedy here would flow from the truncated notion of aggrievement I have described above, and thus is a result of the agency’s interpretation of the Rules of Appellate Procedure and its subsequent concession <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>regarding its ability to appeal the OOR decision.

The Court may and should reach the merits of the parties’ dispute for prudential reasons. Resolution of the dispute on the merits unquestionably is important to the Office of the Governor and to all other agencies subject to the RTKL and the OOR. The OOR decision in <em>Donahue </em>may affect numerous parties and agencies, not all of which may have an opportunity to challenge the decision before incurring harm. In this respect, the available statutory remedy is inadequate to vindicate the rights of the multitude of interested parties. In the meantime, the costs to the public purse accompanying agency efforts either to comply with the OOR’s non-textual interpretation or to challenge the rule in every instance are unjustifiable. The OOR should consider more seriously, and fairly, these consequences when fashioning its seemingly shifting litigation stances.</p>

With respect to the declaratory judgment action, OOR argued that OG had suffered no harm to its immediate interests and, thus, lacked standing to pursue declaratory relief.

Herein, OG’s claim necessarily assumes that, in the future, RTKL requestors will, <em>contrary to the RTKL’s requirements, </em>submit their requests for records to OG employees other than its open records officer, and that its employees will not forward the requests to the open records officer in a sufficiently timely manner to permit him or her to respond thereto within five business days of the initial receipt <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>of the request. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.703 (providing that requests “must be addressed to the open-records officer” and directing employees to forward them “to the open-records officer”).

On one hand, if OG acquiesces in OOR’s expressed view of the RTKL’s requirements, it may have to adopt new procedures for handling improperly filed RTKL requests, which could require some administrative expense.

At that point, if the requestor appeals, OG will have the option of pursuing an interlocutory appeal challenging OOR’s view that its delay constitutes a deemed denial and, thus, that it has <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>jurisdiction to hear the appeal, whereupon it may obtain the review it seeks now. <em>Cf. </em>Pa.R.A.P. 312; 313.

Unlike the other regulations challenged in this action, in which seizure of goods, heavy fines, adverse publicity for distributing “adulterated” goods, and possible criminal liability might penalize failure to comply, a refusal to admit an inspector here would at most lead only to a suspension of certification services to the particular party, a determination that can then be promptly challenged through an administrative procedure, which in turn is reviewable by a court.

As noted above, this Court refuses to issue advisory opinions largely out of concern that doing so robs the court of the practical factual predicate and adversarial argument necessary for the resolution of complex legal issues. In the instant matter, however, the need for legal guidance is greater than the average case, as OG, as well as the multifarious other state governmental agencies subject to the RTKL’s requirements, have a sovereign duty to follow the law in their day-to-day responsibilities and to do so faithfully in the interests of the citizenry. <em>Cf.

Moreover, although OG has abandoned its appeal from the <em>Donahue </em>decision, its arguments arise directly from OOR’s conduct in that case, such that <em>Donahue </em>provides context for the practical consideration of the issues presented. Likewise, although, as noted <em>supra, </em>OG and OOR may not be sufficiently adversarial parties with respect to the substantive controversy over OG’s records, OG has essentially challenged OOR’s jurisdiction such that OOR is likely to defend the case with vigor akin to a party seeking the disclosure of OG’s records. Finally, given that the issue is a purely legal issue of statutory interpretation concerning an exclusively procedural question, I am less concerned that taking up review will embroil this court in precipitous questioning of the substantive policy judgments of another branch of government. Thus, although I do not join what I view as the majority’s broad reframing of the standing doctrine, which could have far-reaching consequences in future cases, I find that the agencies’ need for guidance under this peculiar set of circumstances substantially outweighs the concerns underlying our traditional standing approach, and I am willing to reach the merits notwithstanding OOR’s claim that OG lacks standing.</p>
