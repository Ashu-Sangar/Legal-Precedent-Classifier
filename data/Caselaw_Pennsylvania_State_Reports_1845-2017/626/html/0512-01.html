Counsel specifically referenced the Cruel Punishments Clause of Article I, Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, (as well as the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, found in the Eighth Amendment). In addition, although the argument was somewhat scattered and not particularly sophisticated, counsel articulated an objection sounding in terms of disproportionality and excessiveness, focusing on the disproportional relationship of the fine compared to the amount stolen, and in comparison to the far lesser fines imposable for related, or far more serious, crimes. Counsel labeled the fine “draconian”; argued that no other theft offense, and indeed no other felony offense, exposed the defendant to such a fine; and claimed that “the fine does not match the act” and “is more than you can impose in any [other] particular case.” Also relevant, for issue preservation purposes, is that the trial court plainly understood the gravamen of the claim, noting the disconnection between a theft of $200 and its power under the Gaming Act to impose a fine of $150,000, and its lack of discretion to impose a fine of less than $75,000.

Guilty pleas are momentous occasions, of course, and the proper entry of such a plea acts to extinguish virtually all legal challenges that could have been brought upon the trial, or appeal, of the case. When a negotiated plea includes sentencing terms (or, more properly, the Commonwealth’s commitment to recommend a certain sentence), the defendant’s knowing and voluntary acceptance of those terms rightly extinguishes the ability to challenge a sentence the defendant knew was a proper consequence of his plea.</p>

Our intermediate court has suggested that even appellate claims implicating purely discretionary aspects of sentencing are available in that instance, subject, of course, to the restrictions in Section 9781 and Rule 2119(f). <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Appellant’s fines challenge obviously does not implicate the lower court’s discretionary act: the trial court’s only discretion was to choose a dollar figure between $75,000 and $150,000, and appellant’s complaint is that the statute is unconstitutional to the extent it afforded no discretion to impose a lesser fine than $75,000. Moreover, appellant’s claim is not that there was some error by the trial court raising a substantial question that the sentence imposed was inappropriate under the Sentencing Code. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9781(b) (allowance of appeal) (“Allowance of appeal may be granted at the discretion of the appellate court where it appears that there is a substantial question that the sentence imposed is not appropriate under <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>this chapter.”).

On appeal, he claimed that the lower courts erred in interpreting Section 9714, arguing that he was instead a two-strike offender. The <em>Shiffler </em>Court found that the claim implicated the legality of the sentence because, “in the absence of the twenty-five year mandatory minimum sentence provided for in Section 9714(a)(2), appellant would have been exposed to a maximum sentence of only twenty years of imprisonment for the burglary conviction.

Appellant logically adverts to the fines construct in the Crimes Code, which governs the vast majority of Pennsylvania criminal cases, including non-Gaming Act theft offenses. The Crimes Code generally reposes a considerable amount of discretion in the sentencing judge. Typically, the court is authorized to impose a fíne up to a maximum set by statute. Thus, for example, if appellant had been charged with theft under Chapter 39 of the Crimes Code, he would have faced the prospect of a fine up to $10,000, in the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 3903 &amp; 1101(4). Indeed, as appellant notes, even the most <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>serious of offenses in Pennsylvania, murder in the first degree, affords the sentencing court discretion in determining the appropriate fine, and the maximum fine imposable is $50,000. 18 Pa.C.S. § 1101(1). The same general construct is found with respect to drug offenses, which are set forth in Title 35. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 780-113 (subsection (a) enumerates thirty-nine prohibited acts related to various narcotics; subsections (b) through (o) grade each of thirty-nine offenses and directs court to impose fines “not exceeding” certain amounts).</p>

For example, in the realm of drug trafficking, Section 7508(a)(3)(iii) of Title 18 requires that when a person is convicted of possessing at least 100 grams of cocaine, the court must impose, at a minimum, “four years in prison and a fine of $25,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity[.]” 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508(a)(3)(iii). Notably, the qualifier “as is sufficient to exhaust the assets” employed in Section 7508 reflects a proportionality approach (at least insofar as the fine will exceed $25,000), that is not present in the provision subject to challenge in the case <em>sub judiee.</em>

Simply put, appellant, who had no prior record, stole $200 from his employer, which happened to be a casino. There was no violence involved; there was apparently no grand scheme involved to defraud either the casino or its patrons. Employee thefts are unfortunately common; as noted, appellant’s conduct, if charged under the Crimes Code, exposed him to a maximum possible fine of $10,000. Instead, because appellant’s theft occurred at a casino, the trial court had no discretion, under the Gaming Act, but to impose a minimum fine of $75,000 — an amount that was 375 times the amount of the theft.</p>
    <p id="b592-4" data-blocks='[["BL_592.4",592,[279,969,1150,1008]]]'>In addition to the sheer disproportion of the fine to the amount stolen is the fact that $75,000, by any common measure, is a considerable amount of money.

In other words, the mandatory nature of the provision could act to effectively pauperize a defendant for a single act. It is not a measure targeted solely at high rollers, at the casino itself, or even at thefts from patrons, which might implicate the integrity of the gaming business. Rather, the statute affords the trial court no discretion to inquire into the specific facts or the individual circumstances of a case, which, in this instance, happens to include a twenty-six year old defendant with no prior record who was, at the time of sentencing, enrolled full-time as a student, living with his fiancee, expecting his first child, and did not own a house.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a>

We acknowledge that all fines serve the twin purposes of punishment and deterrence. At the same time, however, we note that the extension of the mandatory fine to this offense was adopted in 2010, and it was accompanied by no separate legislative statement of purpose. The only statement of purpose is that attending the initial Gaming Act legislation, <em>i.e., </em>the general statement of purpose to protect the public through regulation of the gaming industry. The Commonwealth cites nothing in the later legislation, its legislative history, or logic to explain the sheer amount of this fine for this particular added offense, and the reason for making the offense subject to a mandatory fine.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

The original twelve offenses deemed subject to the mandatory fine all involved conduct that went directly to the integrity of the fledgling industry, an industry that naturally raises concerns about associated criminal activity. Thus, for example, the General Assembly attempted to ensure that each entity seeking a gambling license was forthcoming on its application, that only properly licensed entities could operate slot machines, and that all participants refrained from cheating or counterfeiting. Even those provisions involving persons other than industry employees, principals, or insiders implicated obvious concerns of industry integrity. To be sure, there can be thefts (though perhaps not of $200) in a casino setting that <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>might implicate core concerns with gaming integrity. But, the statute admits of no nuance. In our judgment, an employee theft of $200, as at issue here, does not implicate the identified industry concern. The Gaming Act establishes the same fine structure whether a casino itself perpetrates a fraud against the Gaming Control Board, or an individual commits a theft of any amount on the casino’s property. <em>Compare, e.g., 4 </em>Pa.C.S. §§ 1518(a)(1) (Chapter 49 of Title 18 related to perjury, false swearing, and unsworn falsification to authorities “shall apply to any person providing information or making any statement, whether written or oral, to the board, the bureau, the department, the Pennsylvania State Police or the Office of Attorney General, as required by this part.”), and 1518(a)(2) (“It shall be unlawful for a person to willfully: (i) fail to report, pay or truthfully account for and pay over any license fee, authorization fee, tax or assessment imposed under this part; or (ii) attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any license fee, authorization fee, tax or assessment imposed under this part.”). On its face, the mandatory fine provision when adopted seemed calculated to deter abuses by industry players who generate or manage millions of dollars. By lumping the entire spectrum of theft offenses under a scheme apparently focused on deterring instances of theft that impugn the integrity of the industry, the General Assembly appears to have lost sight of the constitutional limitation on excessive fines.</p>

We need not conduct an encyclopedic review of the fine schemes for criminal offenses in Pennsylvania to make the point. It is enough to note that, under the Crimes Code, the maximum fine imposable for any crime is $50,000 (that, for a conviction of murder or attempted murder, but still within the trial judge’s discretion), and the maximum fine imposable for Crimes Code equivalents of appellant’s offense — a first-degree misdemeanor — is $10,000. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 1101(1), (4). The fine at issue here, both in an absolute sense and in a comparative sense, is strikingly <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>disproportionate to the manner in which other crimes are punished in Pennsylvania.

In those cases, the fines were tailored, scaled, and in the strictest sense, calculated to their offenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a> It is undoubtedly within the Legislature’s discretion to categorize theft from a casino differently than other theft crimes in Pennsylvania, and, in turn, to fashion different penalties. However, the prohibition against excessive fines under Article I, Section 13 requires that the Legislature not lose sight of the fact that fines must be reasonably proportionate to the crimes which occasion them.

Here, if appellant's parallel statutory claim were meritorious, the transfer could have been avoided.

However, subsection (4) is subject to the proviso that a first-degree misdemeanant may be required to pay "any higher or lower amount specifically authorized by statute.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 1101 (9). Because the Gaming Act is a statute authorizing a higher amount, imposition of the $75,000 fine is not contrary to the plain language of Section 1101 when read as a whole. <em>Accord </em>Commonwealth’s Brief at 11.</p>

In <em>Eckhart, </em>the appellant kennel operator had committed numerous infractions incurring a fine amount in excess of $150,000 based on a $100-$500 per dog/per day penalty scheme, $15,000 of which appellant claimed was excessive in light of perceived triviality of the offense. In <em>CSX, </em>the appellant's train car leaked enough corn syrup into the Youghiogheny River to kill approximately 10,000 fish, and thus appellant incurred a roughly $100,000 fine, based on a $10 per fish calculation.</p>
      <p id="b595-9" data-blocks='[["BL_595.8",595,[206,2108,1115,233]]]'>It is also worth noting that the fine scheme at issue in <em>Carela-Tolentino, </em>to the extent it authorized fines exceeding $25,000, included a limiting principle that it only be large enough “as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activityf.]” 18 Pa.C.S. § 7508(a)(3)(iii). No such limitation exists under the Gaming Act’s mandatory fines provision.</p>
