Burno has filed a cross-appeal claiming the trial court erred in refusing to grant him relief on numerous remaining issues, which he raised in his post-sentence motions. We reverse the trial court’s September 30, 2009 order granting Burno’s motion for a new trial, remand for the resolution of any pending preserved claims related to trial court error raised in Burno’s post-sentence motion, and dismiss Burno’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel without prejudice to his right to pursue those collateral claims under the PCRA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">2</a>

Upon arriving at the scene, Allentown Police Officer Scott Derr discovered blood on the residence’s <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>front steps and on the back of a sign located on the porch. The front door of the residence was ajar, and the inside lights were on when Officer Derr entered the residence to perform a security check. Officer Derr discovered two homicide victims inside the residence and obvious signs that a struggle had taken place within the residence. One of the victims was found lying on his back in the doorway leading to the bedroom, while the other victim was found in the back of the bedroom curled up in a fetal position. Officer Derr secured the scene and waited for detectives from the Criminal Investigation Division to arrive.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[165,906,1152,734]]]'>Subsequently, the first victim, who was found in the bedroom doorway, was identified as Carlos Juarbe, the lessee of the residence, and the second victim was identified as his friend, Oscar Rosado. Detectives processed the scene and spoke to witnesses. Specifically, when questioned, Ms. Moyer informed the police that, immediately after hearing gunshots, she saw two men flee the area in a red or maroon compact car with its headlights turned off. The detectives found a trail of blood leading from Juarbe’s apartment to the spot where Ms. Moyer saw the car drive away from the area. The detectives recovered various blood samples, shell casings from a nine-millimeter luger, both jacketed and unjacketed lead projectiles, and a sawed-off 12-gauge double barreled shotgun containing one live shell and one spent shell of bird shot.</p>

Bethea voluntarily gave a statement to Detectives Si-mock and Miller, admitting that he and Junius Burno were inside of Juarbe’s residence when the two victims were shot and killed. Bethea also admitted that one of the victims shot him, and he and Burno fled from the scene in Burno’s car.</p>

Neither Burno nor Bethea would tell her how or why Bethea was shot. All three <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>proceeded to a hospital in Philadelphia to seek medical treatment for Bethea, and while at the hospital, Bethea gave hospital personnel, and subsequently the police, a false name, false birth date, and false information about how he had been shot.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[293,610,1147,578]]]'>Thereafter, Detectives Simock and Miller contacted the Lansford Police Department, and based on information provided by that Department, the detectives determined that Burno owned a car, which matched Ms. Moyer’s description of the vehicle that fled the scene of the double homicide. On the evening of September 12, 2003, Burno turned himself into the Allentown Police Department, and he was arrested. The next day, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint charging Burno with, <em>inter alia, </em>two counts of criminal homicide, and thereafter, the Commonwealth gave timely notice of its intention to seek the death penalty.</p>
    <p id="b88-6" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[286,1229,1151,1120]],["BL_89.1",89,[176,312,1145,95]]]'>Subsequently, Burno gave several conflicting statements to the police. For instance, he initially gave the police a statement claiming he and Bethea were innocent bystanders who were visiting Juarbe when two armed intruders entered the residence, and Bethea was shot when he got caught in the crossfire between Juarbe and the intruders. However, on September 24, 2003, Burno gave the police a taped statement in which he admitted to some involvement with the crime. Burno explained during the taped statement that, some months prior to the killings, Bethea had informed him that he obtained two handguns when he burglarized his neighbors’ apartment. One of the handguns was a nine-millimeter model, which Bethea gave to Burno. He also explained that, in April of 2003, when he took his ex-wife, Michele Wright, medicine for their daughter, he stole a .38 caliber handgun from underneath Ms. Wright’s bed. Burno claimed he drove Bethea to Juarbe’s residence on the night in question in order to trade the .38 caliber handgun for drugs and money, and he remained in the car at all times. Burno further claimed in his taped statement that he heard two gunshots and then saw Bethea emerge from Juarbe’s residence with a leg wound. Burno <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>asserted he disposed of the stolen guns after he transported Bethea to the hospital in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[174,430,1150,843]]]'>On September 26, 2003, Burno gave a third statement to the police in which he confessed that he and Bethea went to Juarbe’s residence to rob him of drugs and money. In this third statement, Burno admitted he entered Juarbe’s residence, he struggled with Rosado, and he shot Rosado in the bedroom with the nine-millimeter handgun. This version was consistent with the trial testimony of David Rawlins, a jailhouse informant who testified pursuant to a plea deal that Burno had provided him with a detailed account of the murders. According to Rawlins’ testimony at Burno’s trial, Burno claimed that he came to Bethea’s aid after Bethea was shot in the leg and he shot Rosado after Rosado dropped to his knees, pleading for his life. Moreover, while jailed in the Lehigh County Prison, Burno made several telephone calls, which were recorded, admitting to his ex-wife and an acquaintance, James Alford, that he was involved in the shootings.</p>

The bullet entered his left ear and then severed the jugular vein and carotid artery as it proceeded downward into the body. Based on the trajectory of the bullet, Dr. Land opined that the gunman was above Rosado at the time of the shooting. Another forensic pathologist, Dr. Sara Lee Funke, performed an autopsy of Juarbe, and she observed eleven gunshot wounds, three of which were fatal chest wounds. Dr. Funke recovered from Juarbe a total of five bullets, which were of two different types. She testified the first type was a leaded, non jacketed projectile, which entered Juarbe from both contact and non-contact wounds, as indicated by the presence or absence of injury to the skin surrounding the point of entry. She concluded that the contact wounds and the positions and trajectories of their entries were consistent with a struggle between the victim and the assailant. She further testified that the second type of bullet recovered from Juarbe, the jacketed ammunition, did not enter through a contact wound. Finally, she noted that, in <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>considering the trajectory of the bullets, with regard to at least one of Juarbe’s wounds, the shooter was elevated higher than Juarbe.</p>
    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[291,486,1147,409]]]'>A ballistics expert, Pennsylvania State Police Sergeant Eric Wolfgang, analyzed the ammunition recovered from the scene and concluded two guns were utilized during the shootings inside of Juarbe’s residence. He testified the jacketed bullets came from a nine-millimeter handgun and the non jacketed bullets were a .38 Special multi-ball type of ammunition, which was compatible with the gun Burno had stolen from his ex-wife.</p>
    <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[289,936,1150,793]]]'>Burno took the stand in his own defense and recounted the sequence of events contained in his second police statement, <em>ie., </em>he claimed that he gave the stolen .38 caliber handgun to Bethea and remained in the car at all times. He claimed he did not know anyone had been killed inside of Juarbe’s residence until the next day when he saw a news report about the shooting. Burno maintained he gave a statement falsely implicating himself in Rosado’s murder because he was afraid of the death penalty, and his attorney warned him that Bethea would likely blame him for both murders. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth produced a fourth statement made by Burno that had been previously suppressed by the trial court on Sixth Amendment grounds. This fourth statement contradicted Burno’s trial testimony and indicated that Burno had, in fact, shot both Juarbe and Rosado.</p>

However, Alford admitted that, on April 13, 2003, the night of the murders, he received a telephone call from Burno asking if he could borrow Alford’s vehicle, which was larger than Burno’s vehicle, to take Bethea to the hospital. Alford described how they then exchanged vehicles. Alford acknowledged at trial that he subsequently gave a taped statement to police in which he indicated that, when the men exchanged vehicles on April 13, 2003, Burno admitted to his participation in the death of <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>Juarbe and Rosado.

Simultaneously, Burno’s trial attorneys filed on behalf of Burno a post-sentence motion, which presented allegations related to alleged trial court error, insufficiency of the evidence, weight of the evidence, and excessiveness of sentence.

Specifically, in its opinion, the trial court, as a threshold matter, indicated that Burno had presented numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

Specifically, the trial court found “arguable merit” to Burno’s claims trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor’s (1) references to Burno’s other crimes, bad acts, and wrongs to refute Burno was a “good family man,” and (2) argument, as a matter of fact, that Burno cowardly shot Juarbe while he was down on the ground. Regarding the first aspect, the Commonwealth argues the trial court impermissi<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>bly viewed the prosecutor’s statements in isolation and, when viewed in proper context, the prosecutor’s statements were not improper. The crux of the Commonwealth’s position is that all of the statements at issue constituted permissible oratorical flair and the prosecutor “was fairly commenting” on evidence of other crimes, which Burno candidly acknowledged occurred in his trial testimony. The Commonwealth submits the trial court assessed these comments out of context, in that the prosecutor was properly referencing admissible evidence, and legitimate inferences arising therefrom, which disputed the reasonableness of the version of events Burno presented to the jury.</p>

To the contrary, the Commonwealth argues that, when the prosecutor’s comment is viewed in proper context, it is clear the prosecutor’s “statement was merely a passing comment within a large argument.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 21.

That is, Burno argues the prosecutor’s statements regarding Burno’s prior crimes and misdeeds encouraged the jury to convict Burno on the theory that “he was a bad person, with a criminal record, who mistreated the mother of his daughter and liked to do drugs and drink alcohol.” Burno’s Brief at 21. Burno argues the prosecutor impermissibly “sought to persuade the jury to dislike [Burno] as a ‘bad family man,’ because of certain prior bad acts or other crimes-the very propensity argument the law forbids under any circumstance.” Burno’s Brief at 21 (citations omitted). Further, Burno submits the defense neither “opened the <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>door” to the prosecutor’s cascade of personal attacks nor portrayed Burno as a “good family man,” and thus, the prosecutor’s statements were not a “fair response” to the defense’s argument.</p>

Here, the trial court applied, to some extent, the “harmless error” standard in determining whether Burno was prejudiced; however, as this Court has suggested, “the test for prejudice in the ineffectiveness context is more exacting than the test for harmless error, and the burden of proof is on the defendant, not the Commonwealth.” <em>Commonwealth v.

As a general and practical matter, it is more difficult for a defendant to prevail on a claim litigated through the lens of counsel ineffectiveness, rather than as a preserved claim of trial court error. As indicated <em>supra, </em>in order to demonstrate a defendant was prejudiced by counsel’s <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>deficient performance, the defendant must “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.” <em>Hinton, </em>— U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1089 (quotation and quotation marks omitted). In light of the distinct review standards applicable to a preserved claim of trial court error versus a claim sounding in ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude the trial court erred in utilizing the “harmless error” standard, rather than the <em>Strickland/Pierce </em>“prejudice” standard, in analyzing Burno’s ineffectiveness claims.</p>

Forensics determined the blood trail, which led from the residence where the murders occurred to the area where Ms. Moyer saw the subject vehicle parked, matched that of Bethea, who later implicated Burno. The Commonwealth presented evidence that Burno subsequently turned himself into the police and confessed to participating in the murders. The Commonwealth further presented evidence of Burno’s confessions, which he made to his ex-wife and Alford while using a county prison telephone, as well as the confession, which Burno made to a jailhouse informant. Moreover, forensics linked bullets from the crime scene to a gun, which was compatible with the gun Burno stole from his ex-wife. Thus, we conclude Burno’s claim of ineffectiveness additionally fails since he failed to demonstrate prejudice under <em>Strickland/Pierce.</em>

Significantly, for purposes of fashioning the appropriate mandate in this case, we note each of the issues presented in Burno’s cross-appeal, with the exception of numbers eight and nine, which Burno faults the trial court for failing to address, explicitly sound in the ineffective assistance of counsel. While issue number eight alleges trial court error, our preliminary review reveals that this issue appears to be derivative of issue number three, was thus waived by trial counsel’s failure to argue it below, and accordingly, would likewise be cognizable solely as a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Issue number nine presents a cumulative error argument, which has no application at this time in light of the unreviewable nature of the individual claims upon which it is premised. In any event, to the extent issues eight and nine are allegations of preserved trial court error, which were presented in Burno’s post-sentence motion, the trial court may fully consider the issues upon remand.</p>
