The primary issue is whether Sections 6152(a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of the Medical Records Act (“MRA” or “Act”), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 6151-6160, require businesses such as appellee MRO Corporation (“MRO”), which reproduce medical records for patients and their representatives, to limit their copying charges to their estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing requested charts or records (subject to a statutory ceiling rate), or whether such businesses may simply charge the statutory ceiling rate. In addition, appellants ask us to review the Superior Court’s finding that, where a medical records reproducer fails to disclose and charge its estimated actual and reasonable expenses and instead charges the MRA’s ceiling rates which the records requestor then pays, the defenses of “voluntary payment” and “prior approval” bar the records requestor from maintaining a breach of contract claim to recoup alleged overpayments. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the Superior Court and remand the matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>

Prior to the use of computer technology in hospital medical record keeping, when a request was made for copies of medical records, the patient’s medical chart (which consisted of numerous sheets of paper, sometimes printed on front and back and/or in tri- or bi-fold format, two-hole punched and held together by a metal clip), was retrieved from an in-house or off-site storage location. The party producing photocopies would need to take the sheets of paper out of clips, photocopy the records by hand, reassemble the chart and return it to storage, then assemble and mail the copies to the requestor. Now, however, medical records are increasingly created and stored in electronic form, the records can be retrieved and printed instantly, copied to CD-ROM, or electronically transmitted to the requestor. Thus, appellants alleged, although the cost of storing, locating, retrieving, copying and transmitting medical records has decreased dramatically, MRO’s fees have not reflected those actual, lower costs for the reproduction of records.</p>

Appellants demanded monetary damages; an order enjoining MRO from charging in excess of its actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction; an accounting of sums billed to records requestors since June 15, 2005; prejudgment interest; and punitive damages.

MRO noted that the MRA provided two means for requesting records: (1) a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>under Section 6152; or (2) a patient authorization seeking the patient’s records under Section 6155(b)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> MRO argued that <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>Section 6155(b)(1) does not include an “estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing” qualifier, and thus permits a records reproducer to charge any fee not in excess of the rate ceiling set forth in Section 6152(a)(2)(i).

The trial court noted that appellants did not allege that MRO charged more than the statutory maximum rate, but that its charges did not reflect their lower actual costs of reproduction.

The court then looked to Section 6152(a)(2)(i), which states that, “the health care provider or facility or a designated agent shall be entitled to receive payment of such expenses before producing the charts or records.” The court interpreted the term “such expenses” as obviously referring back to the “actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction” language in the prior paragraph. Thus, the trial court concluded, Section 6152(a)(2)(i)’s reference to “such” expenses “clearly and unambiguously provides that charges shall be based on actual and reasonable expenses.” <em>Id. </em>The court then explained its reasoning in rejecting MRO’s argument that it could charge any amount up to the statutory ceiling rate, as follows:</p>

To the contrary, while the previous provision of § 6152 entitles the health care provider to receive actual and reasonable expenses, this second sentence of § 6152(a)(2)® places a cap on what may be charged as actual and reasonable expenses by providing that the payment of actual and reasonable expenses “shall not exceed” the amounts set forth in this sentence.

The trial court also pointed to <em>Liss, </em>where records were sought through patient authorization, and yet the Court applied Section 6152.

    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[276,472,1150,1321]]]'>The panel majority deemed the first three issues to be interrelated. The court summarized MRO’s position as being that the trial court misread the MRA in holding that MRO is only permitted to bill its actual and reasonable expenses, subject to a statutory cap; and the trial court’s reading, MRO said, threatened to put private companies like MRO out of business and conflicted with the <em>Liss </em>decision. Addressing the issues concurrently, the appellate court began its analysis with an extended block quotation from the “Background” section of the <em>Liss </em>opinion, a quotation that ended with the issues presented in <em>Liss. </em>Within that <em>Liss </em>quotation, the court below emphasized that the pertinent issue in <em>Liss </em>was stated in terms of whether the MRA required “that copying of any records other than those stored on microfilm be billed at the rate specified for copying records stored on paper.” <a href="/a3d/27/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="27 A.3d 1272" data-case-ids="7282313" data-case-paths="/a3d/27/1272-01">27 A.3d at 1279</a>, quoting <em>Liss, </em><a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="983 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="4196654,7292845" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01,/a2d/983/0652-01">983 A.2d at 657</a> (emphasis added by panel majority below). As relevant here, the court then noted that appellants argued that <em>Liss </em>was distinguishable because the case “did not specifically answer whether the ‘estimated actual and reasonable expenses’ language in section 6152(a)(1) prevents the use or applicability of the fee schedule unless those actual expenses exceed the amounts listed in the fee schedule.” <em><a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="983 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="4196654,7292845" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01,/a2d/983/0652-01">Id.</a> </em>The court disagreed, stating that <em>“Liss </em>is controlling as to the fees that are charged under the Act for paper copies of medical records.” <em><a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="983 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="4196654,7292845" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01,/a2d/983/0652-01">Id.</a></em>

First, the court rejected MRO’s distinction premised upon whether a subpoena was employed. The court agreed with <em>Liss </em>and Judge Wettick that Section 6152(a) applies as a result of the reference in Section 6155(b)(1) to the “amounts” that may be <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>charged as set forth in Section 6152(a)(2)(i). Nor, in the court’s view, did it matter in what medium the requested records were stored and from which copies were transferred. Rather, the court viewed the issue similarly to the trial court, <em>i.e., </em>as posing a basic question of “whether the rates provided under the Act are <em>per se </em>reasonable fees that constitute safe harbor rates, or whether they are just a cap on actual expenses that must be calculated on a case-by-case basis....” <a href="/a3d/27/1272-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="27 A.3d 1272" data-case-ids="7282313" data-case-paths="/a3d/27/1272-01">27 A.3d at 1280</a>. In answering the question, the court deemed it significant that <em>Liss </em>had labeled the pricing schedule a “rate” rather than a “price cap” in its analysis:</p>
    <blockquote id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[229,894,1108,1161]]]'>The Court in <em>Liss </em>began its discussion of the rate issue by stating: “[hjaving established that Appellee properly stated a contract claim against Appellants, we turn next to the question of whether Appellants breached the parties’ contract by charging rate M [ (copies from microfilm) ] rather than rate D [ (copies from all media other than microfilm) ] for copies from electronic records.” <em>Liss, </em><a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="603 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="4196654" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01">603 Pa. at 215</a>, <a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="983 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="4196654,7292845" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01,/a2d/983/0652-01">983 A.2d at 662</a>. As can be seen from this quote from <em>Liss, </em>the Supreme Court labels the fees as rates, and not price caps for the varied and case specific actual and reasonable expenses. Nowhere does the Court interpret the Act as requiring that a record reproducer bill only the actual and reasonable cost for paper copies; the Court concludes that the Act refers to a billing rate. Moreover, the Court ultimately calls the fee set for copying from any media other than microfilm (“rate D”) the “default rate” and states that the reproducer of the records is “entitled to receive rate D per page.” <em>Id. </em>at 216-217, <a href="/pa/603/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="983 A.2d 652" data-case-ids="4196654,7292845" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0198-01,/a2d/983/0652-01">983 A.2d at 662-663</a>. Also, the language of the Act itself uses “shall not exceed” for copying charges as opposed to “actual cost” language for shipping charges. This suggests copying charges are not cost-based.</blockquote>

The second duty, imposed by Section 6152(a)(2)(i), is to limit the charges to the estimated actual and reasonable expenses or the statutory pricing schedule limit, whichever is less. Section 6152(a)(2)(i) also entitles the records reproducer to receive payment of the expenses before the charts or records are produced. According to appellants, when the two subsections are read together, the Act clearly contemplates that records reproducers are entitled to receive payment of their estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing records prior to handing over the records, but this advance payment may not exceed the Act’s statutory maximum amounts for search, retrieval, reproduction and delivery.</p>

Appellants argue that this formulation cannot support the notion that the General Assembly intended to establish a uniform “safe harbor” rate the record reproducer can charge in all cases. If that result had been intended, appellants note that, “The Legislature could have originally avoided in 1986, or stricken in 1998, any mention in the MRA of charges being limited to ‘the estimated actual and reasonable expenses incurred’ in the reproduction of medical records; of records providers being entitled to receive payment of ‘such expenses’; or of provider charges for actual and reasonable expenses ‘not to exceed’ certain amounts....

Thus, MRO cites the last sentence in Section 6152(a)(2)(i), which provides for annual adjustments to the pricing schedule based on the consumer price index: “The amounts which may be charged shall be adjusted annually beginning on January 1, 2000, by the Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth based on the most recent changes in the consumer price index reported annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.” MRO deems it significant that, in mandating the adjustments, the statute refers to the pricing schedule as “amounts which may be charged.” MRO also argues that Section 6152(a)(2)(i) <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>uses the terms “expenses” and “charges” interchangeably, which MRO interprets as conveying a legislative intent that “expenses” (as used throughout the MRA) means prices authorized to be charged for the records, not out-of-pocket costs actually incurred in reproducing records in a given case. MRO adds that, if the General Assembly had intended to limit chargeable expenses to actual costs, it could have used precise language as it did in Section 6152(a)(2)(i) when discussing what a records reproducer could charge for delivery, i.e., “the actual cost of postage, shipping or delivery.”</p>

This is so, MRO insists, because the only “amounts” set forth in Section 6152(a)(2)(i) are the “amounts which may be charged” — the pricing schedule.

MRO notes the large number of variables affecting costs, such as the medium in which the records are stored and labor costs. In addition, records reproducers would be required to create sophisticated cost-accounting systems, so as to defend against accusations of over-charging, systems which themselves would increase “expenses.” In MRO’s view, the 1998 amendments were designed to put an end to such litigation by adopting a uniform pricing system. MRO concludes this portion of its argument by arguing that it is unreasonable to construe the Act as requiring a limitation to “actual expenses;” the legislative history points to a contrary intent; and appellants’ contrary argument is unreasonable.</p>

Finally, HHAP notes that the General Assembly has already determined in the pricing schedules what is a reasonable copying charge, and that the legislation provides for annual rate adjustments, tied to the consumer price index; “requiring hospitals to undertake the immense task of estimating the cost of each request is even more unreasonable when considering these multiple levels of oversight for determining copying rates.” HHAP Brief, 10.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

Appellants note that MRO’s construction ignores the complete phrase in the statute, which speaks of “... expenses of reproducing the charts or records.” Appellants argue that the reference to reproducing the records makes clear that the expenses adverted to are the costs resulting from actual reproduction of the <em>records </em>— ie., MRO’s actual reproduction costs.

Appellants note that the Legislature easily could have, but did not, adopt a “flat fee” approach to these charges, as it did in Section 6152.1 of the Act, which addresses charges for records requests relating to claims under the Social Security Act. Appellants also note that the legislative floor debates contain no reference to a single flat fee schedule, but rather are consistent with the understanding that a cap on fees was being proposed. With respect to the claim that appellants’ construction of the Act would threaten the financial viability of for-profit records producers like MRO, appellants note that, at this stage of the proceedings, what MRO charges and collects from its clients is a key factual question yet to be examined via discovery, much less resolved by a factfinder.

Having set forth at some length what was at issue and actually decided in <em>Liss, </em>the parties’ competing positions respecting the decision, and the competing views articulated by the courts below, it is enough to note that, when the Court in <em>Liss </em>spoke to the proper “rate” to be charged, it did not purport to reject a claim that a records reproducer is required to charge the lesser of its estimated actual and reasonable expenses or the statutory pricing schedule rate. Nor did the <em>Liss </em>Court purport to hold that the Act established a safe harbor rate that could be charged in all cases. Instead, the issue before the <em>Liss </em>Court was which of two distinct rates, identified in the second sentence of Section 6152(a)(2)®, applied — the paper rate or the higher microfilm rate. The panel majority below erred in construing the case as if it resolved the different issue presented here; thus, the primary ground for the Superior Court’s decision is not sustainable.</p>

However, we simply do not believe that the structure and plain language of the provisions of the Act at issue here support MRO’s construction. To be sure, as Judge Wettick recognized and MRO and its <em>amici </em>explain, it is no doubt within the power of the General Assembly to establish a statutory rate for copies of medical records (and perhaps such an intention is reflected in the General Assembly’s decision to amend the statute in 2012 to delete the clause concerning “estimated actual and reasonable expenses” — but that question is not before us). But, as appellants’ counter-presentation makes apparent, there is likewise something to be said for a cost-based-with-a-cap system. The question of <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>which approach to employ is a matter for the General Assembly in the first instance. Our task is to determine which approach is conveyed by the language in the Act before us.</p>
    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[195,474,1150,1166]]]'>In our view, the plain and unambiguous language of the Act — read in a way to avoid surplusage and to give effect to all provisions — fully supports the construction employed by the trial judge and the Superior Court dissent, and elaborated upon by appellants here. Having already summarized the competing views at length, we merely stress the following factors, evident in the language and structure of the MRA, that convince us that this legislative scheme establishes that the expenses chargeable for medical records are the reproducer’s actual and reasonable expenses, but subject to a statutory cap. First, the language of Section 6152(a)(1) speaks to a records reproducer providing “the estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing the charts or records” requested. We agree with appellants that the natural reading of this Section is not that it refers to what it will cost the requestor, with that cost, or charge, determined by the reproducer employing a uniform statutory rate — which is MRO’s reading — but rather to the actual expenses involved in reproducing the records involved. As Judge Wettick noted, MRO’s construction would instead substitute the word “charges” for the formulation actually employed, which is expenses in reproduction, and which is a different concept.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[196,1665,1149,684]],["BL_386.1",386,[282,301,1144,140]]]'>Second, the language of Section 6152(a)(2)(i) reaffirms the focus on actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction. The provision begins by stating that the reproducer shall be entitled to “receive payment of such expenses” before providing the records. This is not a stand-alone provision, but a new subsection to Section 6152(a), and the reference to “such expenses” is obviously a reference back to the “estimated actual and reasonable expenses” described in (a)(1) — the only other mention of expenses, as it happens. The statutory pricing schedule only then follows, but introduced by the important qualifier that the payment shall not exceed the amounts set forth as the pricing schedule. This language and structure plainly suggests that the pricing schedule serves as <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>a cap on the actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction. Such, anyway, is the natural and logical reading of the provisions.</p>
    <p id="b386-4" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[280,477,1147,634]]]'>Third, we agree with both courts below that the fact that the records here were requested under Section 6155, governing rights of patients, rather than by subpoena under Section 6152(a), does not change the analysis. Section 6155 explicitly states that the records reproducer shall not charge “a fee in excess of the amounts set forth in section 6152(a)(2)© (relating to subpoena of records).” This cross-reference to, and effective incorporation of, Section 6152(a)(2)© is simply not limited to the pricing schedule set forth in the second sentence. Moreover, use of the word “amounts” suggests awareness that the prior section approved actual and reasonable expenses, but subject to a statutory rate cap.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[278,1138,1147,419]]]'>Fourth, we do not believe that the fact that Section 6152(a)(1) speaks of providing the “estimated” actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing the records, rather than an exact figure, supports the notion that a uniform rate was intended. This reads too much into the statute. As appellants note, the use of the word “estimated” merely suggests a recognition that the records reproducer may not know in advance the actual cost of reproducing the records.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[275,1583,1150,635]]]'>The other points debated by the parties are equivocal at best. For example, it is true, as MRO notes, that the statute does not simply declare that the charge for record copies cannot exceed the cost of reproduction. But, it is also true, as appellants argue, that the statute just as easily could have simply set forth “the specific amounts that records providers are permitted to charge for reproduced records, period,” if that had been the legislative intention. The fact remains that the legislation includes references to estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction, records providers being entitled to receive payment of “such expenses,” and a limitation that charges cannot “exceed” the pricing schedule.</p>

Moreover, to the extent the point is relevant, appellants offer the plausible rebuttal that the question of what MRO charges and collects from its clients is a factual question not yet resolved and, in any event, it is not self-evident that all profit to be made in providing this service to hospitals and other facilities must necessarily be passed on to Pennsylvania’s patients requesting their records.</p>

Op. at 6 (emphasis in original).

The preliminary difficulty we have, however, is that the Superior Court should never have addressed these issues. This was not an appeal as of right, but an interlocutory appeal by permission, certified by the trial court, and ultimately approved for review by the Superior Court. The trial court certified the single issue resolved by its order: whether the MRA prohibited a records reproducer such as MRO from charging a records requestor in excess of its own actual and reasonable expenses in reproduction. The court did not certify, and the Superior Court did not accept, additional issues respecting defenses that the trial court had yet to pass upon. Moreover, the defenses were deliberately not passed upon by the trial judge in his efficient and methodical approach to this class action litigation. The opinion by the trial judge specifically noted the existence of the defenses, which the court appreciated could be complicated; and the court rightly noted that those complicated issues would only have to be reached if MRO’s construction of the statute proved to be correct — which is precisely why the judge certified the statutory construction issue for appeal.</p>

The majority clarifies some of the ambiguity by adopting the trial court’s view that <em>“actual expenses </em>means expenses existing in fact, and <em>reasonable expenses </em>means that the costs are not padded.” Majority Opinion at 337, 97 A.3d at 295 (quoting <em>Wayne M.

    <p id="b391-4" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[190,491,1151,1622]]]'>Additionally, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that third-party reproducers were limited to charging only their actual costs of reproduction. The majority states that “the language of Section 6152(a)(1) speaks to a <em>records reproducer </em>providing ‘the estimated actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing the charts or records’ requested.” Majority Opinion at 335, 97 A.3d at 293 (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a)(1) (superseded)) (emphasis added). However, the limiting language of Section 6152(a)(1) did not broadly reference records reproducers; instead, it specified that the “health care provider[ ] or facility[ ]” shall notify the requester of the “estimated actual and reasonable expenses” of reproduction. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a)(1) (superseded). In fact, the term “designated agent” <em>(ie., </em>a third-party reproducer such as MRO) did not appear in Section 6152(a)(1), but rather, only in the first sentence of Section 6152(a)(2)(i), which merely entitled the health care entity or agent to receive payment of “such expenses” prior to reproduction. 42 Pa.C.S. § 6152(a)(2)(i) (superseded) (“[T]he health care provider or facility or a <em>designated agent </em>shall be entitled to receive payment of such expenses before producing the charts or records.” (emphasis added)). Although the majority determines, correctly in my view, that the phrase “such expenses” referenced the “expenses” of the prior section, that did not alter the statute’s discrete limitation on the expenses of the health care entity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Thus, reading these provisions together demonstrates that the health care facility was to notify the requester of the reasonable expenses that <em>it </em>incurred to have the records reproduced, whether the copies were made by the provider itself or a third party, subject to the statutory cap.</p>
    <p id="b392-3" data-blocks='[["BL_392.3",392,[282,304,1152,1489]]]'>
      <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>To further elaborate, given the MRA’s focus on the health care entity’s expenses, I favor reading this ambiguous statute as previously having imposed on a health care provider or facility a duty to charge a requester only its actual and reasonable expenses of reproducing the charts or records, subject to the statutory cap. Thus, if the facility or provider made the copies itself, it was limited to charging only the actual costs of reproduction, without profit or padding. On the other hand, if the reproduction was outsourced to a designated agent, it was the reproducer’s charged rate, including its profit margin, which equated to the health care entity’s expense for reproduction. However, the designated agent scenario was not without limitations, since the health care entity was still burdened with the responsibility to seek a reasonable charge when outsourcing the copying. The determination of whether a health care provider or facility has met this burden will necessarily entail a factual inquiry, which may include, <em>inter alia, </em>an examination of the relationship between the reproducer and the health care entities it serves, the designated agent’s profitability, and the impact that the use of computers, electronic records, and the Internet has on the costs of obtaining and copying records. In this regard, considering the statutory text, its context, and history, I perceive no legislative intent to preclude a third-party reproducer from making a profit. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa. House Legislative Journal, Jan. 20, 1998, at 25 (remarks of Hon. Lita Cohen) (“This agreed-to language ... will lower the cost of litigation while adequately protecting the revenue base for the copying companies.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>
