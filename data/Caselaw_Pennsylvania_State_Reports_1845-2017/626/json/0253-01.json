Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603 (2013), to the extent that it upheld the amendments to Megan\u2019s Law, and the matter is REMANDED for reconsideration in light of Commonwealth v. Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603 (2013). Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues.\nJustice Stevens notes his dissent to the order, as he would vote to grant allocatur to revisit this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603 (2013), which struck down Act 152, P.L. 1243 No. 152 (2004) as unconstitutional under the single subject rule of Article III, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.",
