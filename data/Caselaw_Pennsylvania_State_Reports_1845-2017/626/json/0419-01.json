The Office of the Attorney General (the \u201cOAG\u201d) shall, pending resolution of the merits of the Commission\u2019s appeal currently pending in the Superior Court, produce to the defendants in the criminal proceedings below only those materials received from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (with appropriate redactions of confidential or protected information) that have been reviewed by the OAG, and that are determined by the OAG to be relevant to the pending prosecutions and properly subject to discovery. The OAG shall not produce other materials received from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to the defendants during the pendency of the appeal.\nThe applications of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission for Leave to File Reply in Further Support of Emergency Application, Leave to File Grand Jury Transcript Under Seal, and Leave to File Unsealed Grand Jury Transcript Excerpt are DENIED as moot.\nJustice McCAFFERY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a Concurring Statement which is joined by Justices SAYLOR, BAER, TODD and STEVENS.",

        "text": "Chief Justice CASTILLE,\nconcurring.\nThe Court today grants in part the Emergency Application of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) to Enforce Supersedeas or, in the Alternative, for Partial Stay of Trial Court Order Pending Appeal, and I join in that decision. I write separately to briefly explain my reasons for granting relief.\nThe Commission seeks emergency relief from orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County and the Superior Court which effectively allow the production of allegedly confidential and privileged material sought in discovery requests served upon the Office of Attorney General (the \u201cOAG\u201d) in these criminal cases, scheduled to go to trial on August 18, 2014. The material consists of approximately 12 terabytes of data, estimated to include 30 million documents, copied from Commission hard drives and servers by the OAG during a grand jury investigation that ultimately resulted in criminal charges against the various defendants. The trial court denied the Commission\u2019s motion for a protective order, and upon the Commission\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court, denied the Commission\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal. The Superior Court initially granted a stay, but then vacated its own stay on July 14, 2014, without explanation, and scheduled briefing in the matter, with the initial brief due in Superior Court on July 29, 2014.\nIn its application to this Court, the Commission seeks a directive that the OAG, pending resolution of the Commission\u2019s appeal, produce only redacted material from the copied drives and servers to the defendants, and only after the material has first been reviewed by the OAG and determined to be relevant to the pending prosecutions, and not private, confidential or otherwise legally privileged; the Commission further requests that the OAG be directed not to turn over any other materials during the pendency of the appeal. Given the privilege issues implicated, the Commission is entitled to relief.\nIn In re Thirty-Third, Statewide Inv. Grand Jury, 624 Pa. 361, 86 A.3d 204 (2014), we considered the application of attorney-client and work product privileges in the context of a grand jury investigation into the operation of a Commonwealth agency \u2014 the Commission. (That grand jury investigation led to these prosecutions.) We ultimately held that, in the specific circumstances presented, and given the role of the OAG, in response to grand jury subpoenas, the Commission was not entitled to a protective order shielding its communications with government lawyers from the OAG. Notably, however, nothing in our decision in Thirty-Third Grand Jm~y remotely suggested that surrender of documents \u2014 as stated, approximately 30 million documents here \u2014 to the OAG for grand jury purposes means that all privileges are lost, nor did it suggest that the OAG, and the trial court in any ensuing prosecution, are absolved of their duties under discovery rules, including the protection of privileged material. See, e.g., Pa.R.Crim. P. 573 (pretrial discovery and inspection).\nIn its April 16, 2014 order denying the Commission\u2019s motion for protective order, the trial court took the following measures to protect confidential and sensitive material from disclosure in the underlying criminal prosecutions:\n[T]o the extent that there is a possibility that the discovery materials may contain confidential or personal information, the parties are directed that any information or material obtained from the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and produced by the Commonwealth as part of discovery in this matter shall not be used, or the contents thereof communicated or disclosed to any person or entity, except as is necessary to the criminal trial of this matter.\nIn other words, the court determined that the OAG, which first received the copied drives and servers from the Commission three years ago (with approved access since the Thirty-Third Gmnd Jury decision on February 18, 2014), and which apparently has not yet reviewed those documents such that it can properly respond to defense discovery requests issued in its own prosecution, can simply turn over the material to the defendants, and place the onus on defense counsel \u2014 whose primary duties are to their clients, not to third parties-to determine what material \u2014 some of which is obviously privileged or intensely private \u2014 \u201cshall not be used\u201d outside the context of the criminal trial in this matter. In my view, this approach is obviously inadequate.\nIn criminal matters, discovery is governed by specific rules, and the obligation is upon the prosecution to determine what material in its possession is properly discoverable. Our ruling for the distinct purposes of the underlying Grand Jury investigation did nothing to alter that obligation, and consign the determination of the status of protected material to defense counsel. Given the nature of the materials the trial court essentially authorized for unlimited disclosure to defense counsel, the Commission is obviously aggrieved and directly so; it is one thing for a bell that cannot be unrung to sound in the narrow conf\u00ednes of a confidential, sealed grand jury investigation; it is quite another when it is in the context of a specific criminal prosecution, and the protection of private and privileged information consigned to defense counsel whose primary duty is to their specific clients and not to the Commission or its personnel.\nJustices SAYLOR, BAER, TODD, and STEVENS join this Concurring Statement.\n. According to the Commission, the subject material includes:\na. Full and partial social security numbers of Commission employees;\nb. Commission bank account information, including the identification of authorized signers for two accounts, the routing number and account number of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's General Fund Account, the account number for a Commission checking account, and balances of certain Commission accounts;\nc.

Software developer access keys for the Commission\u2019s SAP system, IP addresses, server names, and the results of internal testing on software reflecting confidential employee information;\ne.
