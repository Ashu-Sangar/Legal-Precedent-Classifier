The issues, as stated by petitioners, are:\n(1) Whether the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Stewart v. GGNSC-Canonsburg, L.P., 9 A.3d 215 (Pa.Super.2010), holding that the NAF Designation voided an identical Arbitration Agreement, was incorrectly decided and should be reversed, where there is no evidence indicating that the NAF designation was integral to the Agreement?\n(2) Whether the Court may ignore undisputed testimonial evidence that the party seeking to void the Agreement did not consider the NAF Designation to be an \u201cintegral part\u201d of the Arbitration Agreement (because she did not read the agreement)?\n. This issue has been abbreviated because, as stated verbatim, it was unnecessarily argumentative.",
