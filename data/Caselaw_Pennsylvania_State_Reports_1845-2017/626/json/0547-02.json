The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Where a physician provides emergency treatment at the request of a hospital for a person who was not previously the physician\u2019s patient, and does so negligently thereby causing the patient\u2019s death, may the patient\u2019s estate reach the jury on a claim that the hospital is vicariously liable under a theory of ostensible agency for the negligent conduct of that physician because a reasonably prudent person in the patient\u2019s position would be justified in the belief that the care in question was being rendered by the hospital or its agents?\n(2) Whether this Court\u2019s statement in footnote 8 of its ruling in Freed v. Geisinger Medical Center, 601 Pa. 233, 971 A.2d 1202, 1212 n. 8 (2009)\u2014that MCARE\u2019s limitation on who may provide causation testimony in a medical professional liability action against a physician does not apply where an expert witness nurse is testifying in support of a liability claim against a nurse\u2014 permits an expert witness nurse to provide causation testimony solely on a claim against a nurse defendant in a suit where the plaintiff has also sued the doctors alleging further injuries stemming from the doctors\u2019 additional acts of negligence?",
