The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether the Superior Court, in holding that a parent may only be designated a perpetrator of abuse if the child is \u201cin the parent\u2019s care at the time of the injury,\u201d disregarded the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL) 23 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6301-6386 and departed from established precedent which define \u201cchild abuse\u201d to include \u201cacts or omissions\u201d and which permit the dependency court to identify a parent as a perpetrator based on prima facie evidence that the abuse would not have occurred but for the acts or omissions of the parent and clear and convincing evidence that the child was the victim of child abuse?\n(2) Whether the Superior Court erred and exceed (sic) its scope and standard of review in vacating the trial court\u2019s finding of abuse against Mother, by disregarding important findings of fact of the trial court, by reweighing the evidence, by making assessments of credibility and by substituting its judgment for that of the trial court, where the trial court found that the child\u2019s multiple injuries were consistent with a pattern of abuse, that Mother provided explanations inconsistent with the injur\u00edes, that Mother was responsible for the child\u2019s care and protection, and that Mother failed to act to protect the child from the serious physical injuries he suffered?",
