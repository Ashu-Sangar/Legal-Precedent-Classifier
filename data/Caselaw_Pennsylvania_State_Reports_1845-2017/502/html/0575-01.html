    <p id="b618-9" data-blocks='[["BL_618.8",618,[237,894,1150,692]]]'>This is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Superior Court, 306 Pa.Superior 529, <a href="/pa-super/306/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="452 A.2d 851" data-case-ids="201515" data-case-paths="/pa-super/306/0529-01">452 A.2d 851</a>, affirming convictions of forgery (eleven counts) and conspiracy (one count). Appellant contends that the charge of conspiracy, which was brought in February of 1980 and which alleged that the conspiracy occurred between July 1975 and June 1976, was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 5552(a). A divided panel of the Superior Court held that the statute of limitations for conspiracy is determined by the statute of limitations for the most serious offense for which appellant could properly have been convicted, which in this case was forgery, an offense with a five-year statute of limitations.</p>
