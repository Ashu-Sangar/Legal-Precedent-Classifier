Commonwealth Court reversed determining that the Association had standing to appeal the Board’s order vacating its certification of AFSCME and that the Board exceeded the scope of this Court’s remand order when it reconsidered the issue of the appropriateness of the bargaining unit. We hold that Section 702 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 702, permitting “any person aggrieved by” an agency adjudication to appeal, is expressly inapplicable to appeals such as this, which “may be taken initially to the Courts of Common Pleas pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 933.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Since the Association was not a “party who is aggrieved” within the meaning of Pa.R.A.P. 501<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> by the Board’s order, <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>it lacked standing to appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Consequently, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the order of the Board reinstated.</p>

The Judges appealed alleging the Board lacked jurisdiction of the appeal because Common Pleas was not a “public employer” and the court reporters were not public employees within the meaning of PERA.

While the general labor law concepts of collective bargaining and exclusive representation, codified in PERA, may be in derogation of common law concepts of freedom to contract, the right to appeal from decisions of the Board concerning those concepts is not.

In deciding that the legislature intended PERA to apply to court employees we cited section 301(1) of PERA designating county commissioners as managerial representatives for the judges. In four cases decided the same day as <em>Bradley </em>we held that the county commissioners were the proper managerial representatives for the judges. <em>Ellenbogen </em>v. <em>County of Allegheny, </em><a href="/pa/479/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="479 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1742086" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0429-01">479 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/pa/479/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="479 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="1742086" data-case-paths="/pa/479/0429-01">388 A.2d 730</a> (1978); <em>Sweet v.

It is apparent from the above that the reason for our remand in <em>Bradley </em>was to compel the Board to designate an appropriate managerial representative. In light of our remand to consider the proper managerial representative, the Board, pursuant to section 604 of PERA, considered whether a unit of court reporters was appropriate. Section 604 requires the Board to take into consideration the following: “(i) public employees must have an identifiable community of interest, and (ii) the effects of over-fragmentization.” The Board sought to avoid the dangers of a bargaining unit limited to a small group of employees from a much larger group. In view of this Court’s mandate of broad based county government bargaining units the Board determined that the court reporters should be encompassed in an overall court appointed employee bargaining unit. Although we do not decide the merits of this decision we note that determinations of unit appropriateness are <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>peculiarly apt subjects for legislative delegations of discretion to administrative expertise.</p>
