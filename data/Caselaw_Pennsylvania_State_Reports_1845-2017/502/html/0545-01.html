Prior to filing that tariff, each pipeline will estimate the total gas acquisition costs it expects to incur in the prospective period to which the revised PGA tariff will apply. The estimated total gas acquisition costs which <em>exceed </em>the “incremental pricing threshold” price will be recorded in an unrecovered incremental gas cost account. These costs will be recovered by surcharges to non-exempt large industrial boiler <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>fuel facilities. The estimated total gas acquisition costs <em>equal to or less than </em>the “incremental pricing threshold” price will be incorporated in the new PGA, which will consequently be a reduced amount. In other words, the price difference between a basic charge for gas and the estimated total gas acquisition cost would be normally recovered by operation of the PGA tariff rates. That difference will now be divided into two groups, one of which will be the new, smaller PGA tariff rate, and one of which will form the basis of the surcharge to the facilities subject to the “incremental” pricing program. (It should be noted that the new PGA tariff rate may actually be higher than historical PGA rates, but it will still be smaller than a PGA rate which would reflect <em>all </em>gas acquisition costs.)</blockquote>

The rate of collection would be based upon the “maximum surcharge absorption capability” (MSAC) of each non-exempt industrial user. The MSAC consists of the difference between the price or rate such non-exempt users currently pay for natural gas and the alternate fuel price of No. 6 high sulfur fuel oil multiplied by the volume of usage. The distribution utilities report their aggregate MSAC’s to their respective pipeline supplier for allocation of incremental pricing surcharges and collect the final surcharge levied by the pipeline. If gas utilities have a tariff providing rates, for gas and customers subject to the incremental pricing program, which are equivalent to the ceiling price of such <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>gas, such customers would have no surcharge absorption capability. Therefore, the distribution utilities would report an aggregate MSAC of <em>zero </em>to their respective pipeline suppliers.

The PUC established a “Boiler Fuel Rider” (BFR) which is a surcharge to be added to the base industrial rates charged by Pennsylvania gas utility companies to large industrial users for boiler fuel application. The BFR surcharge was set at an amount necessary to bring the base gas rate up to the price for residual fuel oil. As a consequence of this BFR surcharge, the Pennsylvania gas utilities could report “zero” MSAC to the interstate pipeline suppliers. This result would have two effects: (1) The Pennsylvania gas utility companies and their non-exempt customers would avoid bearing any share of the interstate pipelines’ incremental gas cost accounts, and (2) the additional surcharge revenues generated would not have to be shared with consumers in. other states.</p>

The requirement that the appeal appear to present a question which is “not frivolous” is hardly a meaningful standard. This criterion would be satisfied in the overwhelming majority of appeals. It is quite the exception when an appeal is deemed to appear frivolous. Further, if indeed an appeal is found to be frivolous, then the appeal itself should be dismissed, rendering the question of a stay moot. It would follow then that if an appeal is not a bona fide candidate for dismissal because of it being addressed to frivolous matters, the initial <em>Allets </em>standard for the issuance of a stay has been met. Realistically, this has the effect of eliminating the first criterion as a standard beyond that which is traditionally required to ethically file an appeal. We then are left with the second and third criteria announced in <em>Allets </em>as the only standards which a court must follow in granting or denying an application for a stay. We cannot approve of such a rule.</p>

Without a stay, the surcharge monies accumulated prior to August 13,1982 may be spent on the conservation project ordered by the Commission. If, after the monies are so spent, it is determined that the Commission had no right to order such a disposition, exempt gas users will have been harmed to the extent that they were deprived of rebates of these funds in the form of lower gas rates for exempt uses.

The requirement that the applicant for a stay show that it is likely he will prevail on the merits should not be an inflexible rule. This criterion must be considered and weighed relative to the other three criteria. Under Rule 1781 of the Pa.R.A.P., a petition for a stay is to be presented, in the first instance, to the tribunal which rendered the order being challenged. If the likelihood of success on the merits is a rigid standard, then the requirement of seeking the stay in the first instance would be a futile gesture. It is that very tribunal which has just rendered an adverse decision on the merits which would be required to consider the likelihood of success factor. It is extremely unlikely that the lower tribunal will find it likely that its order will be reversed on the merits. On the other hand, there are ample instances where the lower tribunal could find that the applicant has presented a substantial case on the merits even though it disagrees.</p>
