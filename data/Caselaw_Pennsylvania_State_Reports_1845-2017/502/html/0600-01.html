The appellant, Donald Smith, was determined to have killed a Mr. Lonnie Hinerman sometime between October 6th and 7th, 1980. The victim’s body was discovered in the Cheat River on the morning of October 7, 1980, a short distance from the Ruane-Arnold Coal Tipple in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. After a review of the numerous assignments of error raised herein, we are of the view that the judgment of sentence must be vacated and a new trial granted.</p>

Ms. Lewis testified at trial that on October 6, 1980, Mr. Hinerman invited her sister, Ms. Smith, over for a drink and that she and the appellant drove Ms. Smith to Mr. Hinerman’s home in West Virginia and went in for a drink. When Mr. Hinerman became intoxicated and passed out, the appellant took $30 from his wallet and took two calculators from an adjoining office and all three left. While driving away, Ms. Lewis testified that appellant decided to go back to Mr. Hinerman’s house for the purpose of killing him. Once there, he ordered Ms. Smith and Ms. Lewis to wipe off any fingerprints, and he took the intoxicated Mr. Hinerman out to his car. Ms. Lewis stated that appellant then drove to Point Marion, Pa., where he hit Mr. Hinerman (apparently with his hands), then threw him into the Cheat River.</p>

On June 20, 1980, Ms. Lewis accompanied one Willy Stamper to the bank, where he withdrew $1,000 from his account. This money was to be used for his anticipated move to Florida, in which he was to be accompanied by Ms. Lewis. After leaving the bank, Ms. Lewis <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>drove to a remote area and, accompanied by another female, strangled Mr. Stamper to death with a rope, and took the $1,000. The women then transported the body from West Virginia to a farmhouse in Greene County, Pa. and left it. Ms. Lewis who allegedly masterminded the plan, confessed to the Stamper murder on October 30, 1980 and she then took the police to the Pennsylvania farmhouse where they found his skeletal remains.</p>

We note that the trial court did recognize this distinction when it ruled the prior bad acts of the defendant were relevant to establish the Commonwealth’s witnesses’ claim that they were intimidated by appellant. In that instance the court properly admitted that evidence even though there was no arrest, indictment, or conviction. The same rationale was clearly applicable here.</p>

These issues are as follows: Whether the trial court erred by; a) prohibiting the cross-examination of certain witnesses as to the type of cigarette that Mr. Hinerman smoked; b) failing to grant appellant’s pre-trial motion for a change of venue; c) failing to grant appellant’s pre-trial motion to quash the information against the appellant; d) failing to grant appellant’s demurrer to the charge of criminal homicide; e) failing to define the elements of robbery to the jury. Appellant also raised the issues of whether sections 9711(d)(9) and 9711(c)(iv), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9), (c)(iv), are unconstitutionally vague; whether the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual punishment; and other allegations of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.</p>
