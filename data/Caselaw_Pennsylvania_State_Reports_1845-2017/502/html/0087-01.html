    <p id="b131-4" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[196,501,1151,844]]]'>On April 6, 1978, PP &amp; L filed a proposed tariff supplement which, among others, contained a provision (Rule 2-H) establishing mandatory building insulation standards for newly constructed buildings as a pre-condition to the provision of electrical service. The tariff would apply the insulation standards to all new buildings regardless of whether heated or cooled by electrical energy sources. After hearings before an Administrative Law Judge, the tariff was approved with the modification that said standards did not apply to new buildings with heating and cooling systems powered by non-electrical energy sources. The Commission issued an order approving the tariff and reinstating the requirements as applying to all buildings regardless of energy source. The tariff supplement was given an effective date of May 21, 1980, with the exception that Rule 2-H, the subject of this appeal, had an effective date of April 1,1981.</p>

Richards filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, challenging the Commission’s approval of Rule 2-H. Appellees challenged the Commission’s authority to require such standards for buildings with energy sources other than electricity. Subsequent to the filing of briefs, the General Assembly enacted the Building Energy Conservation Act (Conservation Act),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> signed into law December 15, 1980, and with an effective date of January 1, 1981. In the Conservation Act, the Legislature established a set of mandatory minimum insulation standards, which standards were generally less stringent than those required by the PP &amp; L tariff. Both sides filed supplemental briefs and had oral argument before the Commonwealth Court <em>en banc. </em>That court, in its opin<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>ion and order of July 9,1981, and amended order of September 15, 1981, reversed the order of the Commission. The court held that the Legislature had passed a singular, comprehensive scheme to facilitate energy conservation, and that Section 302 of the Conservation Act thus prohibited the Commission from approving mandatory minimum insulation standards greater than those established by the Legislature. We disagree. It is evident from the expressed purposes of the Conservation Act and from the particular language of Section 302 that the Legislature did not intend to prohibit the promulgation of standards which meet or exceed the minimum standards of the Conservation Act. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[245,1020,1147,308]]]'>The question for our decision concerns whether the Legislature intended for its statutory scheme to comprise the exclusive set of standards governing insulation and energy conservation. We must conclude that it did not. In Section 102 of the Act, Legislative findings and declaration of purpose, the Legislature stated the following:</p>

      <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>It is abundantly clear that the Legislature, while wishing to establish at least a certain minimum level of conservation standards, had no intention of limiting energy conservation efforts to those minimum levels. Indeed, the opposite appears to be true, upon examining the particular provisions of Section 302.</p>
    <p id="b133-4" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[171,690,1149,145]]]'>Section 302 prohibits the promulgation of any rules or regulations which are inconsistent with those of the Conservation Act. This Section reads as follows:</p>

Moreover, the legislative choice of the term <em>minimum </em>insulation standards sup<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>ports the conclusion that standards equal to or more stringent than those of the Conservation Act are permissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
