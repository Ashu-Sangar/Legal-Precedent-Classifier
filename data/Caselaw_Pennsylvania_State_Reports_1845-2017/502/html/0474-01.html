Officer Miller was found lying on the highway by police officers who were responding to his radio request for assistance. His service revolver had been drawn, and all six rounds had been fired. Police investigation turned up the Lancia, abandoned, with the windows shattered and bullet holes in it. It was established that the automobile was registered to one William Nicholls of Pittsburgh who had recently disappeared.</p>

We need not decide that question because we find that the validity of the arrest does not depend on the validity of the warrant. A police officer may arrest without a warrant where there is probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed and that the arrestee is the felon. Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer are reasonably trustworthy and sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that the arrestee has committed the offense, <em>Commonwealth v.

The Appellants would treat the hotel room as a dwelling and apply the requirements of <em>Williams </em>and <em>Payton </em>to both the warrantless entry and the failure of the officers to announce their identities and purpose. <em>Stoner v.

The Court in <em>Stoner </em>held that a hotel clerk does not have authority to allow police to search a guest’s room. However, we find that even if the requirements of <em>Williams </em>and <em>Payton </em>apply to hotel rooms, they do not render these arrests invalid. In <em>Williams, </em>we listed certain factors that would tend to support a finding that a warrantless arrest of <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>a suspect in his or her home is legal. These include, <em>inter alia, </em>that a grave offense is involved, particularly a crime of violence; that the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed; a clear showing of probable cause—including reasonable, trustworthy information—to believe that the suspect committed the crime; and strong reason to believe that the suspect is on the premises. We find that these factors were present in this case and were sufficient to establish exigent circumstances so as to justify a warrantless entry and arrest. Although the exigent circumstances which “justify failure to obtain an arrest warrant are not entirely coextensive with those exigencies which justify noncompliance with the ‘knock and announce’ rule,” <em>Commonwealth v.

In that case it was held that the Commonwealth had not met its burden. We found that there existed a palpable ambiguity as to the defendant’s understanding of the reason for her interrogation before she executed the waiver of her rights. This ambiguity arose out of the fact that the defendant had defaulted in making restitution payments ordered by a justice of the peace several months earlier, a default which she had been warned would result in her arrest. Because the Commonwealth had not refuted the reasonable inference that the defendant, when she waived her rights, thought that the interrogation was to be in regard to the default, the waiver could not be said to be an intelligent and understanding one as to questioning about a homicide, and statements elicited as to the latter were suppressed.</p>

At one point Detective Prank Amity testified: “First thing we did was read him his pre-interrogation warning form advising him of his rights, the charges against him, <em>what we wanted to talk to him about.” </em>(Suppression Hearing, p. 553, Sept. 23, 1980) (Emphasis added).

It must be recalled that the four homicides about which Lesko was questioned had occurred over the five days immediately preceding the interrogation. The most recent homicide, the case at bar, had occurred in the early morning hours the same day. Indeed, Appellants Lesko and Travaglia had handed the weapon with which Officer Miller had been shot to Daniel Montgomery less than an hour before their arrest. To find under the circumstances here present that Lesko was unaware of the general nature of the transaction giving rise to his questioning would be tantamount to treating as fact that which is patently hypothesis and fantasy. We need not expound upon the differences which distinguish these facts from those in <em>Dixon. </em>We think it sufficient to note that in <em>Dixon </em>we recognized that “the fact that interrogation follows hard upon the criminal episode and there is no circumstance lending ambiguity to the direction and purpose of the questioning,” <a href="/pa/475/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="475 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1734071" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0017-01">475 Pa. at 23</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="475 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="1734071" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0017-01">379 A.2d at 556</a>, could supply the necessary evidence that the defendant knew of the occasion for the interrogation.

Once again after arrival at the police station, the Appellants were advised of the possible charges against them, told their rights, and both executed written waivers of their rights to remain silent and to have counsel present at further questioning. Lesko’s interview began within twenty minutes of his arrest and continued, with short breaks for coffee, for approximately an hour and a half. Travaglia likewise was interviewed for about an hour and a half after being detained for forty minutes in a holding cell.

According to this line of argument, the details of the Nicholls episode as testified to by Rutherford were so horrid as to inflame the passions of the jury and prejudice them against the Appellants <em>during the sentencing phase </em>of the trial and therefore were improperly admitted. Whether the trial court in a capital case, in balancing the probative value of proffered evidence against its potentially prejudicial effect, must give separate consideration to the possible effect of the evidence at the sentencing phase, is a question which admits of no general answer. There may be circumstances where evidence, deemed admissible at trial because its relevance to the determination of guilt outweighs its possible prejudice, should nevertheless be excluded because it is so inflammatory that its relevance to determination of sentence would be outweighed by its potential prejudice. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zettlemoyer, </em><a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">500 Pa. 16</a>, 53 n. 21, <a href="/pa/500/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="500 Pa. 16" data-case-ids="1781169" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0016-01">454 A.2d 937</a>, 956 n. 21 (1982) (conceivable that the reading of a “loaded” indictment to establish felony element of the aggravating circumstance that “the victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>by the defendant ...,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711[d][5], could so inflame the jury that the possibility of prejudice would outweigh the evidentiary value of reading the indictment.). In most cases, however, the decision that the evidence is admissible for purposes of the guilt phase renders it, like all evidence admitted at trial, admissible for the penalty phase as part of the “circumstances” to be considered by the jury. As long as there is no “embellishment” upon the facts or improper attempt by the prosecutor to dwell upon the inflammatory character of the evidence, no additional weight should be accorded to the potential for prejudice because such evidence might play a part in the sentencing determination. Where facts are relevant for a proper purpose at trial, defendants may not be heard to complain about the horrid character of such facts. To find otherwise would give rise to the perverse result that a capital defendant would benefit more, the more horrible the background circumstances were.</p>

The clear import of the first part of subsection (d)(10) is to classify the commission of multiple serious crimes as one of the bases upon which a jury might rest a decision that the crime of which the defendant stands convicted, and for which they are imposing sentence, merits the extreme penalty of death. The purpose of the second part of subsection (d)(10) just as clearly is to classify the fact that the defendant was already serving a life sentence at the time he committed the offense at issue as another basis for such a decision. The first part of the subsection allows as an aggravating circumstance the fact that “the defendant has been convicted of another Federal or State offense, committed either before <em>or at the time of the offense at issue, </em>for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable ...” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10) (Emphasis added). The emphasized portion of the statute highlights the incongruity of the construction urged by the Appellants. By including offenses committed contemporaneously with the offense in issue, the legislature clearly indicated its intention that the term “convicted” not require final imposition of sentence, but cover determinations of guilt as well. Given the practical operation of the criminal <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>justice system, a contemporaneous offense would either be tried together with the “offense at issue” or severed and tried separately. In the former situation, it would be impossible for sentencing to have occurred prior to the jury’s consideration of sentence on the “offense at issue”; in the latter, the vagaries of scheduling and conducting separate trials of a single defendant, within certain time limits and amidst the ordinary operation of a court calendar, would make it virtually impossible. At best, such factors would render it completely arbitrary whether a contemporaneous offense would qualify as an aggravating circumstance under subsection (d)(10).</p>

The prepositional phrase “for which a sentence of life imprisonment was imposable” refers back to, and is descriptive of, the offense which if the defendant has been “convicted” thereof may be considered an aggravating circumstance. Because the phrase modifies the noun “offense” rather than the verb “convicted”, by itself it sheds no appreciable light on the shade of meaning to be attributed to the latter. We note, however, that the second part of subsection (d)(10), allowing as an aggravating circumstance that “the defendant was undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense,” appears to be co-extensive with the situation which would exist where a defendant has been found guilty and had a life sentence imposed. Were we to read the first part of the statute as the Appellants suggest, the second section would be surplus verbiage. Because the Legislature is not presumed to have intended the provisions of its enactments as mere surplusage, <em>Masland v.

For these reasons, we find that, as used in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10), the legislature evidenced a clear in<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>tent that “convicted” mean “found guilty of” and not “found guilty and sentenced.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The rationale for this rule is that such comment would run counter to the privilege against self-incrimination and the defendant’s presumption of innocence. It is important to note that the argument complained of here was delivered <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>during the sentencing phase of Appellants’ trial. Lesko and Travaglia had already been tried and found guilty of first degree murder. The Commonwealth had been put to its proof and, without any infringement on the defendants’ privilege against self-incrimination, the presumption of innocence had been overcome beyond a reasonable doubt. We must keep in mind that the “sentencing phase” of the trial has a different purpose than the “guilt phase” and different principles may be applicable. For example, the privilege against self-incrimination in its pure form has no direct application to a determination of the proper sentence to be imposed; the purpose of the prosecutor is not to “incriminate,” and the goal of the guilty defendant is not to avoid “incrimination.” Likewise, the presumption of innocence which accompanies the accused throughout proceedings to determine his guilt has no direct application to the sentencing determination. This is reflected in the fact that the sentencing statute, without running afoul of the federal or state constitutions, places a burden on the defendant of proving mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. It may be acknowledged that in some sense there is a “presumption of life”—this from the fact that the prosecution is limited to specified aggravating circumstances which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, while a defendant is permitted great latitude in demonstrating mitigating circumstances, and then by the lesser preponderance of evidence standard. This presumption, if it be called such, does not, however, support the reasoning or the rule which Appellants argue for excluding comment on the failure to show remorse.</p>

We find the statements of the prosecutor in this case to have made minimal reference to the victim. Indeed, the memory of both Leonard Miller and William Nicholls was first invoked by counsel for Appellant Travaglia (“And Leonard Clifford Miller is dead, and there’s no question about that. Mr. Nicholls is dead; there’s no question about that. If the killing of Mike Travaglia can bring back those people, then there would be a legitimate reason for killing Mike Travaglia. Because then you bring back those people to their families, and you give something back; you create something from what you’re doing. But you cannot do that.” N.T. p. 1677).</p>

The prosecutor stated, “Right now, the score is John Lesko and Michael Travaglia two, society nothing. When will it stop? When is it going to stop? Who is going to make it stop? That’s your duty.” Appellants characterize this statement as an improper appeal to vengeance which requires reversal of the death sentences. As we read the record, the arguments presented by defense counsel were to a large extent directed toward demonstrating that there was <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>no rational reason for the existence of the death penalty, that it served no useful purpose. The prosecutor opened his argument by pointing out that the legislature in its lawmaking function had enacted the death penalty and had already decided that there is a rational reason and that the penalty does serve a useful purpose. He returned to this theme, and prefaced the comment complained of by requesting “I want you to remember this: We have a death penalty for a reason.” N.T. p. 1701. The prosecutor is permitted, by the terms of the statute, to argue in favor of the death penalty. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a)(3). Taken in context, we find the prosecutor’s comment to have been no more than permissible “oratorical flair” in arguing in favor of the death penalty.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In the absence <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>of such an inquiry, the reasons for counsel’s strategy, which do not appear of record, cannot be known, and it cannot be determined whether there existed evidence which should have been presented by counsel but was not.</p>
