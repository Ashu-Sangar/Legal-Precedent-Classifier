Bearing in mind that the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the <em>per se </em>nature of the machines, but also that the proceedings are <em>in rem </em>in nature, requiring the Commonwealth to prove its case only by a preponderance of the evidence, we hold that on the facts of <em>Electro-Sport, </em>the evidence was sufficient to show that the machine in question was a gambling device <em>per se. </em>We thus reverse the Superior Court’s ruling in <em>Electro-Sport. </em>Based on our disposition of <em>Electro-Sport, </em>we find that the evidence which points to the <em>per se </em>nature of the machine in that case is lacking in <em>One Poker Game. </em>We therefore affirm Superior Court’s ruling in that case.</p>

It is a coin operated video game which simulates some elements of five card draw poker. A microprocessor, through the operation of a random number generation program, simulates the shuffling of a deck of cards and the dealing of one hand of five card draw poker. The player can insert from one -to eight coins to begin play. Although only one coin is necessary to play a game, the insertion of multiple coins increases the number of “skill points” awarded to a winning hand— and hence increases the number of free games which can be <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>won.

The odds are precisely the same as those in an ordinary game of poker, and can only be changed by replacing the integrated circuitry.
