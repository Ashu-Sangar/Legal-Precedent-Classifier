    <p id="b196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_196.8",196,[261,878,1147,627]]]'>This is a direct appeal from a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judgment of sentence for voluntary manslaughter and possessing an instrument of crime. Appellant’s contentions are: (1) his signed statement made to police should have been suppressed as involuntary; (2) the Commonwealth failed to establish that the statement recorded by one police officer was identical to the statement read to appellant by a second police officer before appellant signed it; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter verdict. We have reviewed the record in this case and find appellant’s contentions lack merit.</p>
