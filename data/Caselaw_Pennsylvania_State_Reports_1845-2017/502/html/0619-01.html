The trucks had been locked the night before the break-in and secured behind a high chain link fence. The trucks that were broken into were identified as numbers 1, 2, 3 and 7. Certain hand and power tools were missing from truck # 7. Additionally, tools taken from truck # 1 were found in trucks # 2 and # 7.</p>
    <p id="b663-8" data-blocks='[["BL_663.7",663,[147,1779,1149,367]]]'>Appellant was employed by the Opportunity Board until he was fired on April 17, 1980, approximately two months prior to the break-in. While he was employed by the Board, appellant was in frequent physical contact with the trucks that were broken into. Appellant returned to the job site some time in June of 1980 to inquire about the possibility of being rehired.</p>

The Commonwealth’s fingerprint expert, an F.B.I. agent, testified that a <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>fingerprint lifted from the driver-side door button of truck # 1 and another fingerprint lifted from the driver-side wing window of truck # 2 were appellant’s. On cross-examination, the F.B.I. agent testified that he could not tell from his analysis how long the prints had been on the surfaces of the trucks, and that it was possible that a print could be lifted from a surface as long as two months after it was placed there.</p>

    <blockquote id="b664-6" data-blocks='[["BL_664.5",664,[315,860,1108,574]]]'>Considering the trucks were kept outside in the elements and are used daily by the employees, there is a reasonable inference that the fingerprints were impressed between closing time on June 18 and opening time on June 19. Likewise, the defendant could not have just wandered into the compound, but had to make an effort to gain entrance. Therefore, even though no fingerprints were obtained from vehicle number seven, the circumstantial evidence is sufficient to. sustain a conviction of theft of movable property, and the defendant’s motion for demurrer was properly denied.</blockquote>
    <p id="b664-7" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[272,1452,1149,573]]]'>While it is a reasonable inference that appellant’s fingerprints were impressed on June 18th or 19th, an equally reasonable inference may also be drawn that appellant’s fingerprints were impressed prior to the time of the break-in, since appellant was in frequent physical contact with the trucks when he worked for the Board only two months prior to the break-in and/or when he returned to the site in June only days prior to the break-in. Furthermore, there is no evidence that these trucks were used frequently; a fact which, if established, would diminish the possibility that the prints were old.</p>
