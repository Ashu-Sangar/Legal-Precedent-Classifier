At the time pertinent to these charges appellees were both members of the General Assembly, appellee Lynch serving as a Senator and appellee Wojdak as a Representative. Dr. Donald Goldenberg, the father of Andrew, testified at the hearing that he had made numerous <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>efforts to secure his son’s admission to dental school at Temple University (“Temple”). Among the efforts was a promise to a Dr. Cook, an officer of Temple’s Alumni Association, that Temple would receive a substantial contribution from Dr. Goldenberg if his son was successful in gaining admittance. After a number of months had passed without action on the application, Dr. Goldenberg contacted Samuel Biener (“Biener”). According to Dr. Goldenberg, Biener represented that he could be of assistance for a substantial sum of money. It was further understood that the money was not to be paid until the admission of Andrew was confirmed. At some later point, Biener requested and obtained from Dr. Goldenberg a transcript of the applicant’s grades.</p>

A short time thereafter Dr. Goldenberg received a second telephone call from Biener also indicating the situation looked favorable and suggesting it was as a result of his efforts. In an attempt to ascertain whether he was obligated to Dr. Cook or Biener for his son’s admission, Dr. Golden-berg called Dr. Cook and was advised by Dr. Cook that Andrew had been admitted without any help. At or about 9:30 p.m. on June 29, 1976, Dr. Goldenberg called Biener and related to him the conversation with Dr. Cook. Within the next two days, Dr. Goldenberg again spoke with Biener wherein Biener told him to “forget about everything” and wished his son well. Dr. Goldenberg did not know either of the appellees or of their alleged involvement in the matter.</p>

Lynch stated that he would “get back” to him. Later Lynch spoke with Biener and stated that an effort would be made to stop the letter acknowledging Andrew’s admission. Two days after the above conversation Lynch notified Biener that he could not stop the letter and warned Biener to stay away from Dr. Goldenberg. There was no testimony from Biener that Lynch at any time asked for or discussed money for his assistance for any services he might provide. Biener further testified that he did not know Wojdak or of any participation by Wojdak in this matter.</p>

He stated that he received a telephone call from Wojdak asking him to check on a dental school application of admission by an applicant' named “Rosenberg”. Elliott testified that he was accustomed to receiving recommendations, expressions of interest, and inquiries as to the status of applications for admissions from all segments of the community. He stated that it was his practice, whenever a legislator expressed interest, to inform the legislator as soon as action was taken, before notification was given to the applicant. His purpose was to afford the legislator the opportunity to be the first to give the news to the applicant’s family.</p>

Wojdak inquired whether the letter of acceptance had been sent out, and if not, whether it could be held up for a day. After further inquiry, Elliott learned that Temple had already sent the notification, and he relayed that information to Wojdak. Elliott further testified that prior to Wojdak’s inquiries, which came after the admission decision, there was no expression of interest in the admission of Andrew by <em>any </em>member of the legislature.</p>

Biener admitted at the same hearing that he had approached Lynch concerning the agreement between himself and Dr. Goldenberg.

According to Dr. Goldenberg, Biener represented that he “could help,” but that it would cost Dr. Goldenberg $15,000. Biener’s own testimony confirmed Dr. Golden-berg’s account: “I said you’ve got to have cash, no check and he asked me, you would protect me and I said you don’t give no money up until you get a letter of acceptance.”</p>

Dr. Goldenberg testified that shortly thereafter he was also advised of his son’s admission by Biener and told by Biener “to get the package ready.” According to Dr. Goldenberg, the receipt of the information regarding the admission from both sources had placed him in a “dilemma”: “Here I was obligated to give money to the school and also to give money to Mr. Biener and at this point, I didn’t know what to do.” That same evening Dr. Goldenberg called Biener to tell him of Dr. Cook’s independent efforts to assist his son’s admission. Dr. Goldenberg testified, “[Biener] swore to me that my son got in without any help, not even from him.... ” Nothing was said in that conversation regarding Dr. Golden-berg’s payment of money to Biener. According to Dr. Goldenberg, either the “next day or the second day,” Biener called Dr. Goldenberg and confirmed that the admission had occurred “without any help.” Biener told Goldenberg to “forget about it.”</p>

After checking school records, Sullivan told Elliott that no person named Rosenberg had been recently admitted. Elliott then called Wojdak, who asked Elliott to check again, this time to see if any person whose name ended in “-berg” had been admitted. Elliott did so, and Sullivan found the name “Goldenberg.” Elliott then called Wojdak, who asked Elliott if the letter of admission had gone out.

Elliott’s testimony established that on June 30, 1976, one day after Lynch had advised Samuel Biener that “they are going to try and stop the letter,” Elliott had received an inquiry from Wojdak regarding the possibility of having the formal letter of admission “held.” Clearly Wojdak was the “they” to whom Lynch had referred. In all of Elliott’s dealings with persons interested in the status of applications for admission, including Wojdak himself, Elliott had never previously been asked if he could hold a letter of admission. Elliott further testified that after he had informed Wojdak that the letter of admission could not be held, Wojdak made the statement that “they are trying to go around me.” Surely a factfinder could reasonably conclude on the evidence presented that the utterance of Wojdak was an expression of frustration over the fact that others had in fact circumvented his and Lynch’s scheme to exercise control over the admission of Andrew Goldenberg, a scheme which had fallen through despite Wojdak’s last-ditch effort to salvage it by “holding” the Dental School’s letter of admission.</p>

Under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3923, “[a] person is guilty of theft [by extortion] if he .intentionally obtains or withholds property of another by threatening to: * * * (4) take or withhold action as an official or cause an official to take or withhold action. * * * ” Here, the testimony relating to the joint effort of Lynch and Wojdak to have the letter held would permit a factfinder to conclude that Lynch and Wojdak were laying the groundwork necessary to assure that Dr. Goldenberg would pay Biener, a “substantial step toward the commission of [theft by extortion],” 18 Pa.C.S. § 901(a).

The evidence at the preliminary hearing established that Dr. Goldenberg had agreed to pay Biener $15,000 in cash upon the admission of his son to the Dental School. Prom this evidence a factfinder could reasonably conclude that Dr. Goldenberg and Biener had agreed that Biener was to purchase the exercise of influence from whomever Biener saw fit to contact. A factfinder could also reasonably conclude that Lynch must have realized, upon being told by Biener that Biener could “get $10,000” from Dr. Goldenberg, that the $10,000 was intended not to be compensation for the services of Biener alone, but rather compensation for Biener plus “pecuniary benefit” for Lynch “as consideration for [his] recommendation. . .,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 4701, if he should make one.</p>

Upon learning that Andrew Goldenberg had been admitted to the School of Dentistry “on his own,” Biener promptly contacted Lynch and charged Lynch with having “done nothing” to facilitate the admission, and told Lynch, “Let’s forget about it,” a proposal that their agreement be dropped. Once so confronted by Biener, Lynch made no effort to dispute Biener’s apparent understanding, but rather told Biener that “they are going to try and stop the letter.” From Wojdak’s subsequent conduct it <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>may be fairly inferred that Lynch promptly enlisted the aid of Wojdak to “stop” the letter.

Under that standard an actor has not completed an attempt to commit theft by false pretenses unless “the actor has gone so far as to convey all or part of a [culpable] message to his contemplated victim.” An absolute requirement that the actor actually convey the culpable message to the contemplated victim is inconsistent with the definition of attempt in Section 501 of the Model Penal Code and Section 901 of the Crimes Code.</p>
