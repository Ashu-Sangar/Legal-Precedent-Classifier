Membership of HSA consists of representatives of many, if not all, major health care delivery agencies in the region.

What <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>needs to be done is probably to prescribe in detail those expense components which constitute reasonable cost and to establish objective criteria for the individual expense items.

That the surplus existed and that the joint involvement occurred the agency does not dispute; it disputes that either was improper.</p>

As to the joint membership on the board of the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation and employment by the <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>Department of Welfare, the agency explained that as part of the contract with the federal government under which PHMC was formed as a non-profit corporation, it was agreed that the Department of Welfare, because of its role as the agency which administrates Title XIX, the Medicaid Program, and other health care payors as well, might participate in the PHMC.</p>

Since the testimony in question has two components—a fact component and a value or opinion component—and since the fact component of Sacks’ speech was accurate, it is not possible to say that the value component necessarily would have changed had Sacks been in possession of supplementary information which was offered by the agency at the Civil Service hearing. Additionally, there is nothing of record to indicate that Sacks did not already know the agency’s reasons, as they were asserted at the hearing, for the surplus and the joint involvement. Therefore, the commission’s assertions that Sacks would not have testified as he did if he had been more careful is in error for two reasons: (1) Sacks’ opinion may have remained the same if he had been in possession of supplementary information on the agency’s position, and (2) there is nothing of record to indicate that he did not have this supplementary information.</p>

Furthermore, the subject matter of this value judgment, while it concerned matters of agency management, also, more importantly, concerned matters of substantial public interest.

Teachers are, as a class, the members of a community most likely to have informed and definite opinions as to how funds allotted to the operation of the schools should be spent. Accordingly, it is essential that they be able to speak out freely on such questions without fear of retaliatory dismissal.</blockquote>

There was, therefore, the court concluded, substantial evidence that Sacks recklessly disregarded the truth in making public statements to the HSA.</p>

Furthermore, as stated earlier, the agency does not contend that the surplus did not exist or the simultaneous joint work did not occur; it alleges only that in its view there were good reasons for these occurrences.
