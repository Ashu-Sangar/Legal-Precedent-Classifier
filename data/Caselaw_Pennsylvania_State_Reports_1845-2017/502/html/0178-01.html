Thus, although in the case of a notice of compensation payable no final agreement has been reached as to the amount of compensation due, a notice of compensation payable, like a compensation agreement, amounts to an admission by the employer of the claimant’s employment, the occurrence of the accident, and the nature of the injuries caused by the accident while the claimant was in the employ of the employer. <em>See Fehr v.
