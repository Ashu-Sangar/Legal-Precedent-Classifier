Keene had been living there approximately two weeks. She had shared a home with appellant but moved into her grandmother’s following an argument with appellant during which he struck her with a belt. Early that evening appellant telephoned Keene. Rogers picked up a telephone extension and interrupted the conversation by saying, “I want to talk to you, man.” Shortly thereafter Rogers hung up the receiver because he said appellant had hung up on him.</p>

Rogers wanted to speak with appellant about his sister and the treatment she had received from appellant. Rogers rang the front door bell and appellant opened the door. Rogers said he wanted to talk but appellant responded by slamming the door. Annoyed at appellant’s action, Rogers punched and kicked the door, breaking the glass and cutting his hand.</p>

Enroute, they heard appellant shout, “Get out of the way.” Holmes ducked behind a car and Rogers jumped behind a hedge. Although he saw appellant was brandishing a shotgun, Rogers stepped from behind the hedge and said, “You got a gun. Well, shoot me then.” <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>Appellant pulled the trigger.

Approximately fifteen minutes later, Rogers and Holmes decided to leave. As they walked out the front door they were confronted with appellant standing on the porch of the house next door. He had a gun in his hand and was pointing it directly at Holmes. She warned Rogers to duck because “Charles has a gun.” Appellant fired at Holmes but the shot missed as Rogers pushed her safely off the porch. Appellant fired at Rogers but that shot also missed its target. Gail Keene then ran out of her grandmother’s front door and jumped across the porch rail to the porch next door. She threw her arms around appellant and pleaded “[D]rop the gun, that was her brother, don’t shoot him.” Appellant ignored her pleas, shot Keene in the chest and as Rogers was approaching his injured sister, appellant fired two more shots. Both struck Rogers. As both victims lay bleeding, appellant walked into the street, turned, and ran away. Keene recovered from her injuries but Rogers died about one month later from infection caused by his gunshot wounds.</p>

Appellant thought Rogers was reaching for a weapon and responded by firing a shot but “not directly at him.” Keene then came out of the house, jumped over the bannister, and started to wrestle with appellant. Rogers joined the struggle. The gun fired several times striking Rogers and Keene. Keene, who subsequently married appellant, testified similarly to his version of the struggle.

Appellant defended by attempting to show that the firearm accidentally discharged during a struggle among himself, Keene, and Rogers. This testimony has no rational link to the 2503(b) theory of imperfect self-defense.

If the Commonwealth charges murder, they should be obliged to prove all the elements or fail of their charge. The jury ought not be invited to compromise a defendant into a lesser charge of homicide because they are doubtful of the proofs. Both the Commonwealth and defendant are entitled to the charge proved, or nothing.
