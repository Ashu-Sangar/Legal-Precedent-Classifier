As two police officers approached the appellant, he threw a brown checkered jacket over a railroad bridge. At his trial, the appellant testified that he tried to get rid of the jacket because he was “excited” and “paranoid” at the sight of the police officers. The appellant was stopped. Upon retrieving the jacket off of the railroad trácks, the officers felt a hard object which turned out to be a silver .32 caliber revolver. One of the police officers testified that part of the serial number on the revolver was scratched out. The appellant was found guilty of “altering or obliterating” the identification on a firearm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Significantly, the Court did not hold that subsection (b) was without its proper uses.</p>
    <p id="b667-8" data-blocks='[["BL_667.7",667,[156,1363,1150,365]]]'>In this case, the trial court relied on more than the Act’s permissible inference of possession. The trial judge also had the testimony of the police officer concerning the appellant’s effort to dispose of the jacket containing the revolver, and as the finder of fact, he could pass upon credibility of the appellant and the weight to be accorded his testimony. <em>See Commonwealth v. Carter, </em><a href="/pa/481/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="481 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="1747326" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0495-01">481 Pa. 495</a>, <a href="/pa/481/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="393 A.2d 13" data-case-ids="1747326,1747341" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0495-01,/pa/481/0494-01">393 A.2d 13</a> (1978).</p>
    <p id="b667-9" data-blocks='[["BL_667.8",667,[153,1744,1151,367]]]'>In my view, the trial court and the Superior Court deserve more respect than the majority accords them in its one sentence reversal. I would hold that the statutory inference, along with the appellant’s effort to get rid of the weapon, was sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt. <em>See Commonwealth v.
