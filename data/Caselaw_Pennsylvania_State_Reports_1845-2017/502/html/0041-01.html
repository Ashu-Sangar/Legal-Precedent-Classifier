      <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>On appeal to this Court, the Commonwealth does not challenge the Superior Court panel’s conclusion that the March 15, 1978 petition to extend the time for trial was erroneously granted. Rather, the Commonwealth argues that (1) appellee waived the Rule 1100 issue as it related to the alleged one day delay between Friday, April 21,1978 and Monday, April 24, 1978 because he did not file a motion to dismiss the charges; (2) for purposes of Rule 1100 trial “commenced” on Friday, April 21,1978 and (3) the delay was attributable to appellee’s requested continuance on March 9, 1978. We agree with the third argument offered by the Commonwealth and consequently reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b87-5" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[127,1033,1152,462]]]'>On Friday, April 21, 1978, all parties were present and ostensibly prepared to proceed. The only reason preventing trial from actually commencing on that date was the belated request by the defense for a trial before a jury. It must be emphasized that the April 21st date was specially set on March 9, 1978. In accordance with the practice of the County in question, it was clear to both parties on that date that the case was being listed as a non-jury case and that a jury would not be available at the appointed time and place.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[127,1511,1151,765]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/498/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="498 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1776115" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0379-01">498 Pa. 379</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="498 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1776115" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0379-01">446 A.2d 895</a> (1982) this Court stated “that although a defense requested continuance which exceeds thirty days serves as a triggering device for exclusion, the number of days to be excluded is <em>not governed solely by the length of the continuance.” <a href="/pa/498/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="498 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1776115" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0379-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/498/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="498 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1776115" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0379-01">498 Pa. at 386</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="498 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1776115" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0379-01">446 A.2d at 899</a> (emphasis added). Similarly, it appears on this record the Commonwealth was prepared to proceed to trial on March 9, 1978, when appellee requested a continuance, which was granted until April 21, 1978. This delay, attributable to appellee, cannot therefore be viewed in a vacuum. On Friday, April 21, 1978, when appellee for the first time demanded his right to jury trial, the court immediately scheduled a jury trial for the very next day of court. Voir dire began on Monday, April 24,1978, and appellee was convicted.</p>

In all of the prior listings in this case, the appellee had accepted non-jury listings without comment. The fact that' the system was not able to accommodate this eleventh hour change in tactics clearly does not fall within the panoply of interests sought to be protected by Rule 1100. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. </em>Jenkins, <a href="/pa/500/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="500 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1781128" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0144-01">500 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/pa/500/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="500 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1781128" data-case-paths="/pa/500/0144-01">454 A.2d 1004</a> (1982).</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[279,692,1149,687]]]'>Appellee argues that because an actual waiver of jury trial had not been obtained as of record prior to the April 21st date, the Commonwealth must be held responsible for providing for the contingency that occurred. Such a technical approach loses sight of what is sought to be achieved by the application of Rule 1100. Here, the appellee was aware for several weeks that his case had been assigned for trial to a non-jury program. The possibility of an additional delay, because of the lateness of the announcement of the desire for trial by jury was evident. Such a delay could easily have been avoided by a simple communication to the appropriate parties any time between March 9,1978, and April 21,1978. Appellee chose not to avail himself of that avenue.</p>

The record demonstrates that the Commonwealth and the trial court were prepared to proceed on a non-jury basis on April 21, 1978. It would be unjust to penalize the Commonwealth for the delay in the trial when the delay was caused by the Appellee’s wish to exercise one of his constitutional rights, a trial by jury.
