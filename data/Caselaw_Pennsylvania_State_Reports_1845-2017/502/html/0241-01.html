There is little doubt that employers of labor are among those strategically placed to promote accident prevention in connection with their operations.... Pressure of legal liability on the employer therefore is pressure put in the right place to avoid accidents. This reasoning has nothing to do with fault. It is true of course that liability based on a finding of the master’s fault will put pressure on the employer to be careful.

There is no indication in the complaint that his subsequent continued involuntary confinement resulted from any reasons other than the underlying mental condition that caused him to be placed involuntarily in the care of appellant.

Wherein it is reasonable to hold the hospital for the direct consequences of its act, it is not reasonable to extend the liability to the consequences of governmental responses to the conduct in question over which the hospital had no control.

The hospital clearly owed a duty to James to prevent him from carrying out precisely that action which he accomplished. In addition, there is a great difference in the degrees of fault of the hospital and James; the hospital was at fault to the extent it breached its duty to care for James, while James’ mental condition precludes him from being at fault at all. Finally, two basic tort policies—punishment and deterrence—will be well served if the hospital is held responsible for the foreseeable consequences of its actions; these policies will not be served at all if the responsibility is left with James’ parents, who did everything they could when they took James to the hospital before he had hurt anyone.

It is clear, as Justice Flaherty has stated, that in order to recover, the Appellees must prove that the hospital owed a duty to James, the hospital breached its duty, and that the breach of that duty is the legal cause of the injuries suffered by James and his parents. Dismissing the Appellees’ claims at this stage is premature, as reasonable men may differ as to whether the hospital owed a duty to James, and that the failure to honor such duty caused the Appellees’ injuries.

It is not unreasonable or against public policy to impose upon the hospital the duty to supervise James so as to prevent harm either to himself or others.

Lojeski, </em><a href="/pa/437/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="437 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="1927791" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0448-01">437 Pa. 448</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20889" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="263 A.2d 889">263 A.2d 889</a> (1970). Section 433 of the Restatement of Torts 2d sets forth factors to be considered in determining whether a defendant’s condition is a substantial factor in producing the complained of injuries. One relevant consideration is the extent other factors have contributed to the defendant’s injuries. If the Appellees would have suffered their injuries notwithstanding the negligent conduct of the hospital, then the conduct of the hospital cannot be determined to have been a substantial factor in causing the said injuries. The hospital seems to argue that the Commonwealth or the decedent’s family, not the hospital, initiated proceedings against James for his actions. Therefore, either individually or together, the action of the Commonwealth and the decedent’s family was the substantial factor in causing the Appellees’ injuries. This position is untenable in that the actions of both the Commonwealth and the decedent’s family were the <em>result </em>of the initial tortious conduct of the hospital, and not a cause of the Appellees’ injuries. Without the hospital’s lack of supervision, James would not have killed his hospital roommate. Therefore, both civil and criminal proceedings would have been unnecessary.</p>
