The section 402A tort claim of Mr. Salvador was clearly out of time since the injury occurred in May, 1967 and suit was not filed until March, 1971 some three years and ten months later. As to the Code claim, defendants argued it should have been filed in 1968, four years from the date of the sale of the boiler to the plaintiff’s employer. Counsel for plaintiff Salvador argued the Code statute of limitations should not be applied literally but should run from the date of the injury. On appeal, the Superior Court, in an effort to maintain symmetry with Section 402A created the converse by applying the two-year tort limitation to Mr. Salvador’s claim. They ruled that third-party consumers should be limited to the two-year statute of limitations for their breach of warranty claim under the Code. The asymmetry results from the disparity in the treatment between a direct purchaser and all other consumers, even though the plain<a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>tiffs were hurt in the same accident and sustained equally grievous injuries.</p>
