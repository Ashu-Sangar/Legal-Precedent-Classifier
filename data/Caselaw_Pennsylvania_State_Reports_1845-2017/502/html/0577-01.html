In the event that such legislation was not obtained by July 1,1979, or, if the parties agreed, by October 1, 1979, then appellee Penndot would immediately move toward implementation of a private garage system of inspection. The General Assembly failed to <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>provide legislation for a franchise system and Penndot proceeded to arrange for implementation of a private garage system as agreed.

On June 16,1981, the District Court issued an additional order requiring appellees to have a fully operational program by May 1, 1982.

The provisions of Section 834(a) which immediately preceeded Section 4701, became part of the statute by amendment in 1972. This 1972 revision demonstrates a <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>legislative intent, at that time, to grant Penndot the authority to mandate auto emissions inspections, an authority it did not previously have.

Upon a reading of Section 4701, it is readily apparent that all references to emission control systems, emission control devices, inspection procedures and requirements, and the “Clean Air Act” were eliminated.

After the repeal of Section 834(a) and the adoption of Section 4701, Penndot was left without authority to order a system of auto emissions inspection.

It is argued that Act 3 of 1983 is a limiting statute which restricts the broad authority granted by Section 4702 of the Motor Vehicle Code and specifically sets forth the type of auto emission inspection program which may be established. We do not see Act 3 of 1983 as a limiting enactment in the sense advanced by the appellees. Rather Act 3 of 1983 is a statute, coerced by a Federal Court Order,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">18</a> and delivered as <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>ransom for the rescue of the citizens of Pennsylvania from the considerable financial distress caused by the withholding of million of dollars in taxpayers’ funds ticketed for Pennsylvania highways.

The authority vested here is circumscribed by the specific conditions set forth in Subsection (b). Act 3 of 1983 authorizes Penndot to establish and implement an inspection system for motor vehicles registered in areas where emission inspections are required by the environmental protection agency of the Federal government or by decrees of the Federal courts. In this case the inspection system Penndot seeks to implement is embraced by the terms of a consent decree of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The decree relied upon here, however, fails to provide the necessary condition required to activate Penndot’s authority. Act 3 of 1983 contemplates and refers to a <em>valid </em>decree based upon proper authority. Where the decree is a consent decree, as is the case here, proper authority includes the lawful ability and power of the parties to enter into the agreement. Penndot did not have the power to establish and implement an emissions inspection system as provided by the decree, and therefore, could not validly agree to the <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>conditions of the consent decree. Furthermore, the legislature, by passing Act 3 of 1983, cannot validate retroactively Penndot’s consent to implement an emissions inspection program which, at the time of its consent, was beyond its authority. <em>See: Hartle v. Long, </em><a href="/pa/5/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="953584" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0491-01">5 Pa. 491</a> (1846). The unrestrained power to validate actions taken without authority tends to erode government by previously enacted laws and in its place substitute government by men acting without authority, whose illegal acts may subsequently be validated. The rights of society are better protected when they can only be affected by previously enacted laws. Our system of government rests upon the will of the people and the authority granted thereby as expressed in previously enacted legislation, and not upon the adoption of legislation to justify actions previously taken without authority. When action comes first and legislative authority later, we have strayed from constitutional government. <em>See: Horton v.

Because of the lack of authority, Penndot could not validly agree to establish and administer an inspection program and its purported agreement to do so is void. Further, we conclude that nothing contained in Act 3 of 1983 does or can retroactively vest appellees with the requisite authority. In addition, the exception provided for in subsection (b) of Act 3 of 1983 has no application to the Federal Court consent decree under the facts in this case, in that the appellees’ agreement thereto is a nullity. Accordingly, and consistent with our holding that Penndot lacked the authority to consent to establish and implement an auto emissions inspection program, an injunction should issue enjoining appellees from performing the terms and conditions of the consent decree.</p>

If however, as was found by the federal courts, the Commonwealth itself was the party defendant, then regardless of the intragovernmental processes necessary to comply, the Commonwealth itself, not just the agencies or the executive, but the entire state government, became bound by the consent decree. The Court of Appeals in an early challenge to the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the State Implementation Plan by proceeding directly against the Commonwealth, held that such enforcement was valid. <em>Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v.

Although the deleted language had made such authority explicit, by retaining the language of Sections 4521 and 4531 after the deletions the legislature acknowledged the continued existence of the Department’s authority in this regard. It would be absurd for the legislature to have granted PennDOT authority to set requirements for emissions equipment, to make unlawful the tampering with such equipment and the operation of a vehicle until re-inspection establishes full compliance, and yet to have denied the authority to inspect such systems for tampering or compliance in the first place. At a minimum such authority must be recognized in Penn-DOT’s power to “promulgate regulations . . . consistent with but not limited by the provisions of this subchapter”. 75 Pa.C.S. § 4521. It is a basic rule of statutory construction that the legislature does not intend an absurd result. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1922(1). (Contrary to the assumption of the Majority, the change in language does not necessarily indicate a change in intent. The deletion of language is also consistent with the view that because that authority described by the deleted language was adequately spelled out by other statutory language, the language was no longer necessary. Such a view is particularly worthy of consideration when the deletion and change in language occurs as a result of the consolidation of statutes in a comprehensive Motor Vehicle Code.) We must, therefore, interpret the Motor Vehicle Code as having established in PennDOT the duty to promulgate the challenged regulations.</p>

PennDOT clearly has the authority to implement the challenged program following the enactment of Act 3 of 1983.
