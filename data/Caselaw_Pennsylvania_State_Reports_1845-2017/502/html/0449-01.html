Lawrence Convention Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In a complaint filed in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court, the Department of General Services (“Department”) seeks damages from the Frank Briscoe Company (“Briscoe”) for delay as well as faulty construction. Briscoe, one of the five prime contractors responsible for the construction of the Convention Center, in turn has filed a counterclaim seeking damages from the Department for the Department’s alleged delay. In addition to damages, the Department’s complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that, as between Briscoe and the Commonwealth, Briscoe alone bears liability to the other contractors for construction delay.</p>

The contracts, which were to be funded with over $40,000,000 of state monies, included provisions for dispute resolution. Claims of a contractor against the Department were to proceed through a four-tier administrative procedure, concluding with the submission of unresolved claims to the Board of Claims.

We now conclude that the Commonwealth Court may entertain such a counterclaim. The provision in section 761(a) for original jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court “of all civil actions or proceedings,” brought by or against the Commonwealth, except those in certain designated categories, evidences the Legislature’s <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>intent to confer upon the Commonwealth Court jurisdiction over an entire action or proceeding which is properly commenced in the Commonwealth Court.

[ajgainst the Commonwealth government” does not include “actions on claims in which immunity has been waived pursuant to ... the Act of May 20, 1937 (P.L. 728, No.. 193), referred to as the Board of Claims Act.” Here, however, Briscoe has attempted to assert its breach of contract claim against the Department not as an original matter but as a counterclaim in an assumpsit action instituted by the Department pursuant to section 761(a)(2), in which Briscoe was named as a defendant. This Court has previously held that in a suit initiated by the Commonwealth, the party sued may assert a claim derived from the same transaction as a basis for recoupment, even though the claim could only have been commenced as an original matter in the Board of Claims. See <em>Commonwealth v. Berks County, </em><a href="/pa/364/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="364 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1223459" data-case-paths="/pa/364/0447-01">364 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20A.2d%20129" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="72 A.2d 129">72 A.2d 129</a> (1950). Surely if the Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction to hear a counterclaim for purposes of recoupment, a claim which will, if successful, reduce or even nullify entirely a judgment for the Commonwealth, there is no sound jurisprudential or policy reason <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>why the Commonwealth Court should be unable to utilize the same trial to grant an affirmative recovery.

See Act of May 20, 1937, P.L. 728, 72 P.S. § 4651-1 et seq. (Supp.1983-84). If Briscoe were to initiate such a suit, that suit would have to be brought in the Board of Claims.

On June 29, 1980, in anticipation of these proceedings, the Department sought to avail itself of the procedure set forth in the Declaratory Judgments Act in an effort to have its contractual obligations fixed by the Commonwealth Court prior to having to defend in the Board of Claims. Unlike the counts of the complaint against Briscoe and Travelers which sought affirmative recovery, the two counts seeking declaratory relief against all five contractors sought merely to establish that under the contracts the Department bore no liability to any of the defendants for damages for delay, and that the Department was not obliged to be a party to any arbitration proceeding to resolve' one contractor’s claim against another. Because it is manifestly <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>apparent that the Department’s request for declaratory relief in counts X and XI of its complaint was in reality simply an attempt to establish in advance the validity of an affirmative defense to be used to defeat the contractors’ breach of contract actions currently pending in the Board of Claims, declaratory relief was properly denied.

In dismissing Briscoe’s counterclaim, the Commonwealth Court relied upon <em>Commonwealth v. Orsatti, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/448/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="448 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1944681" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0072-01">448 Pa. 72</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20313" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="292 A.2d 313">292 A.2d 313</a> (1972), which sustained the dismissal of a counterclaim on the ground that the Commonwealth had, pursuant to article I, section 11, consented only to those suits for breaches of contract brought in the Board of Claims. However, in <em>Orsatti </em>the party asserting the counterclaim had earlier sought to maintain the same claim in the Board of Claims, which dismissed the claim as untimely. Thus the facts presented by <em>Orsatti </em>did not require consideration of the scope of the Commonwealth’s consent to suit. <em>Orsatti </em>should be read only to direct that the Commonwealth Court may not entertain a counterclaim against the Commonwealth to redress an alleged breach of contract when the same claim would be barred if commenced as an original matter in the Board of Claims.
