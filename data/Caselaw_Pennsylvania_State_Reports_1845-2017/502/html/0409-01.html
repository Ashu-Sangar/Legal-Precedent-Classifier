On September 9, 1980, Deborah Ann Astemborski, appellee, filed an application for support with the Commonwealth’s Department of Public Welfare, and, in so doing, assigned to the Commonwealth all rights concerning support of her child. Accordingly, on December 30, 1980, she appeared at the intake office of the Erie County Domestic Relations Department and filled out a Complaint for Support which was dated and marked filed December 30, 1980. This complaint was taken to the Prothonotary in order to receive a civil number on January 29, 1981, fifteen days after the applicable six year statute of limitations had expired. The trial court held that the governing rule at the time required the complaint to be filed with the Prothonotary, not with the Domestic Relations Department. For this reason, the trial court concluded that the complaint was not timely filed, and the alleged father of appellee’s child, appellant Robert Susmarski, moved for dismissal of the complaint. Dismissal was denied, however, as the court declared the statute of limitations invalid.</p>

Since support for a child born in wedlock may be sought at any time during its minority, while support for a child born out of wedlock may, due to the statute of limitations on establishment of paternity, be sought during only the first six years of a child’s life, a disparity of <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>treatment is alleged to exist in violation of equal protection guarantees.

Pickett,- U.S. at ——, <a href="/us/462/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="103 S. Ct. 2199" data-case-ids="6183393" data-case-paths="/us/462/0001-01">103 S.Ct. at 2207</a>, <a href="/us/462/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="103 S. Ct. 2199" data-case-ids="6183393" data-case-paths="/us/462/0001-01">76 L.Ed.2d at 383</a>. Unlike <em>Mills, </em>and <em>Pickett, </em>wherein certain birth-related financial and emotional factors were cited as encumbering a mother’s filing of a paternity suit within one or two years, respectively, of her child’s birth, the present case involves a period of limitation of such greater duration as to negate birth-related encumbrances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Indeed, the six-year limit ex<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>tends beyond the period of the child’s first “several years” addressed by the Court in <em>Pickett, </em>quoted <em>supra, </em>as being a time when practical obstacles may prevent filing of a paternity action. Furthermore, as pointed out by Justice Rehnquist in <em>Mills, </em>the existence of greater impediments to recovery of support for an illegitimate child than for a legitimate one is justified by the fact that the cases differ in one crucial respect: a suit on behalf of an illegitimate child contains the element of proof of paternity, while a suit on behalf of a legitimate child does not. While the passage of one or two years could not be regarded as appreciably increasing the likelihood of fraudulent claims, a lapse of more than six years may reasonably be expected to coincide with prejudice to the defense through loss of evidence, the death or disappearance of witnesses, and the fading of memories. Hence, the Commonwealth’s interest in elimination of stale or fraudulent claims is substantially served by the limitation imposed.</p>

In the case at bar, the mother, representing her child, could have initiated a support action at any time prior to December 30, 1980, when she assigned her support rights to the Commonwealth. Because she neglected to do this, for whatever reason, her child is now prevented forever from asserting a successful claim for support against the alleged father, at least in the absence of any estoppel or statutory excep<a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>tions. We do not address the wisdom of the legislative scheme, but only its constitutionality. Since the statute is substantially related to a legitimate state interest, viz., the prevention of stale or fraudulent paternity claims, it is not constitutionally infirm under a Fourteenth Amendment challenge even though the statute may operate, as it has in this case, to deprive an illegitimate child of its right to make a claim for support beyond the six year limit.</p>

      <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.3",459,[206,1861,1120,499]]]'>Nevertheless, the statute at issue sets forth exceptions to the six-year period of limitation which are designed to deal with the situation where a child born out of wedlock has had a continuing relationship with the natural father during the first six years of the child’s life but the father has abandoned the child at a later point in the child’s minority. Under Section 6704(e), <em>supra </em>note 1, where the natural father has either voluntarily contributed to the support of the child or acknowledged in writing his paternity, “an action may be commenced at any time within two years of any such contribution or acknowledgment by the reputed father.” Such exceptions may result in a substantial extension of the time for filing a paternity action, thereby negating certain of the practical obstacles to filing suit discussed in <em>Mills </em>and <em>Pickett.</em>
