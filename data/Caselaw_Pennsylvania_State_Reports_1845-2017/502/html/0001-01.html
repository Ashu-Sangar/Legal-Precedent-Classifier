On June 30, 1980, the Commission issued an opinion, containing sixteen (16) findings of fact, including the following relevant findings:</p>

In <em>Frantz Advertising, </em>the Commonwealth Court also interpreting Section 2(1) of the Act, held that the Fraternal Order of Police was not a charitable organization subject to registration because the F.O.P. exists “solely for the benefit of its membership and whatever benefits may attach to those outside its fold are incidental and not controlling.” 23 Pa.Cmwlth. at 533-34, <a href="/citations/?q=353%20A.2d%20492" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="353 A.2d 492">353 A.2d at 496</a> (footnote omitted).</p>

There are no allegations of a constitutional violation in this case. In addition, we do not find that the Commission’s decision constitutes an error of law or that the Commission’s findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>
    <p id="b47-5" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[161,1701,1152,480]]]'>Heretofore, the only case addressing the issue of what is a charitable organization for purposes of registration under the solicitation of Charitable Funds Act is <em>Frantz Advertising, <a href="/citations/?q=353%20A.2d%20492" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="353 A.2d 492">supra.</a> </em>As noted, the Commonwealth Court in <em>Frantz Advertising </em>held that an organization is not charitable where it exists solely for the benefit of its membership, with whatever benefits that may attach to non-members being incidental and not controlling. Today, we adopt this test as the law in this area.</p>

Instantly, we note that by ACORN’s own admission, their purpose is to enhance the quality of neighborhoods. In addition, the record shows that ACORN solicits funds from the general public by distributing pamphlets to potential contributors in which they claim that ACORN has won countless neighborhood improvements throughout Philadelphia including a 10% reduction in auto insurance rates for most Philadelphia drivers, more police protection, improved traffic safety and public transportation and increased city support for a program to provide summer jobs to teenagers. Clearly, these widespread benefits can not be said to accrue only to ACORN members. Rather, ACORN members and the general public alike share in these civic improvements. Based upon these findings, we conclude that ACORN is a charitable organization within the meaning of Section 2(1) of the Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act and subject to the registration requirements of that Act.</p>
