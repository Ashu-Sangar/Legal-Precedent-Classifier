We now affirm and hold that, in the absence of any explicit directive in the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PURTA), Act of March 10, 1970, P.L. 168, No. 66 and its replacement, Article XI-A of the Tax Reform Code of 1971, added by the Act of July 4, 1979, P.L. 60, No. 1979-27, 72 P.S. §§ 8101-A—8108-A (Supp.1982-83), mandamus will not lie to compel a formal settlement of PURTA taxes by the Department of Revenue. If the Department disagrees with the taxpayer’s report and concludes that additional taxes are due the Commonwealth, it is authorized under the provisions of PURTA to enforce the payment by any lawful means.
