The sole issue raised is whether the statutory scheme chosen by the legislature to determine the levels of monetary earnings qualifying a worker for unemployment benefits<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution by creating invidious eligibility classifications. The statute applicable to this case required that claimants earning $3,738.00 or more in their highest quarter also earn the maximum of $6,000.00 in fixed qualifying wages in their base year, with a minimum 20% of such base year wages earned outside their highest quarter. On the other hand claimants earning less than $3,738.00 in their highest quarter had to earn 35% to 38% of their wages outside their highest <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>quarter without any higher fixed constant amount.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Since there is a rational basis for this legislative distinction the statute is valid and we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s order.</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[230,582,1150,853]]]'>The facts are not in dispute. Elaine Martin, appellant, had been employed by the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco) for three and one-half years on October 18, 1979 when she became unemployed. Because of sporadic lay-offs, she averaged approximately five months of employment per year during that period. On April 22,1979, appellant filed a claim with the Bureau of Unemployment Compensation. The Bureau found her financially ineligible. The table set forth in section 404(e)(1) of the Act, 43 P.S. § 804(e)(1), provides that a claimant such as appellant, with highest quarter earnings of $2,989.00 during her base year,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> can qualify for benefits of $122.00 per week, provided she earned total base year wages (“qualifying wages”) of $4,800.00. Because appellant’s “qualifying wages” during her base year, $4,433.00, were less than the amount required, the Bureau determined her ineligible for benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Instead the purpose of the amendment adding an explicit fixed percentage requirement to the statute for those earning maximum qualifying wages was improvement of the correlation between multiple of weekly earnings as a statistical test for attachment to the work force for claimants whose seasonal work is concentrated in their highest quarter. Its effect is to require such claimants to work a greater number of weeks in the base year in order to qualify for compensation. However, the use of the lower 20% requirement for such workers, instead of the table’s 35% to 38% requirement for workers earning less than the highest quarter maximum is in fact advantageous to the seasonal worker and ameliorates anomolous denials of benefits to claimants who are in fact fully attached to the work force but in seasonal employment which makes them powerless to correlate their work weeks with the base year calendar.</p>

Thus, the 1964 amendment served its intended purpose of improving the correlation between the statistical test and the reality of work force attachment, without the devastating impact on seasonal workers that <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>imposition of a uniform 35V-38% of earnings outside the highest quarter would have entailed.

Claimant A earned $300.00 a week and worked for ten weeks during her highest quarter for a total of $3,000.00. She also worked for six weeks during the rest of her base year earning a total of $1,800.00. Consequently, she had earned qualifying wages of $4,800.00.

It illustrates an imperfection in our Unemployment Compensation Law’s correlation of the proportionality of highest quarter and base year wages to work force attachment. However, as previously illustrated, the flat percentage scheme sought by appellant may punish a claimant with a low rate of compensation who works more weeks in his highest quarter than does a higher paid employee. That method of solving a perceived injustice merely creates another equally onerous classification. In addition, it is totally contrary to the overall intent of the 1964 legislature to tighten eligibility for high earners by requiring better statistical evidence of attachment to the <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>work force.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">20</a> In either case persons seemingly qualified when compared to selected others are disqualified.

The assumption of discontinuity ignores the other requirement that she must still earn at least $6,000.00 in base year qualifying wages. Consequently, a claimant earning $4,000.00 in her highest quarter would still have to earn 33% of her income outside her highest quarter and a claimant earning $4,500.00 in her highest quarter would be required to earn 25% of her income outside her highest quarter in order to earn qualifying wages of $6,000.00.

Thus, the majority pretends the legislature perceived this measurement from the Table (359N38%) as “anomolous” when it denies benefits to “seasonal workers”, and so enacted the “20% minimum rule” to “ameliorate” the disadvantage to those workers who are not sufficiently attached to the labor force under the Table formula.</p>

Majority opinion, 502 Pa. at 299, 466 A.2d at 115. Thus, while a claimant “on the Table” had to have earned 35%-38% of the qualifying wages outside of the high quarter, those who earned the maximum qualifying wage in one quarter had to have earned 0% of their wages in an outside quarter. As will be discussed more fully, <em>infra, </em>the pre-1964 scheme was clearly unconstitutional and an arbitrary measure of attachment to the labor force, since it measured attachment at a 35%-38% rate for lower paid claimants and <em>not at all </em>for higher paid.

The source of this trouble lies in administrative and reporting difficulties, particularly the inability to obtain accurate information from the employers concerning an employe’s actual time worked. (This informational deficiency was acute at the time the unemployment compensation laws were coming into being. As seen by the 1980 amendments to the Pennsylvania Act, section 404(c), 43 P.S. § 804(c), adopting “credit week” requirements, this problem has apparently been eliminated. <em>See </em>majority slip opinion at 5, note 5 and 31, note 21 and accompanying text.) As should be obvious, and as the Social Security Administration initially recommended, the most direct and accurate measure of attachment to the labor force is a formula that is a function of time, i.e., one which considers length and consistency of work during a given period. Brief for Attorney General at 9, n. 6.

If the “20% minimum rule” is sufficient to preserve the fiscal integrity of the fund when dealing with higher paid claimants, there is no perceptible justification for “preserving the fund” at a 35%-38% rate for lower paid claimants.

He suggests that an inequity has been visited upon higher paid claimants, stating “the continuation of the 37% requirement for those who earned above $3,738.00 in 1979 would have been <em>unfair in light of the fact that the legislature has placed a maximum upon the weekly benefit rate and the total amount of compensation for those who earned above $3,738.00 in 1979.” </em>Brief for Attorney General at 24. (Emphasis in original). Apparently, the Attorney General perceives the “20% minimum rule” as a <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>sort-of “quid pro quo” for this “unfairness” and suggests that, to “make it up” to the higher paid claimants, the legislature decided “to simplify the relationship between high quarter wages and qualifying wages for those who earn more than the amounts on the Section 404(e)(1) Table. .. . [The “20% minimum”] test is easy to administer, does not require extension of the Section 404(e)(1) Table ad infinitum and greatly simplifies the relationship between high quarter wages and qualifying wages for those who earn more than the ...” maximum Table amounts.</p>

The purpose is, rather, to stave off indigency during temporary periods of unemployment. Section 3, 43 P.S. § 752. The legislature has determined that such goal can be achieved by establishing a maximum rate of 66%% of the statewide average weekly wages. Section 404(e)(2), 43 P.S. § 804(e)(2). Even if this capping of benefits were, somehow, inequitable to higher paid wage earners, the legislature cannot cure one inequity by creating another. Moreover, the <em>contributions to </em>the unemployment compensation fund are capped as well, section 4(x)(l), 43 P.S. § 753(x)(l), so that contributions by an employer are <em>not </em>made on portions of a claimant’s salary for which there will be no proportionatly increased benefits paid.
