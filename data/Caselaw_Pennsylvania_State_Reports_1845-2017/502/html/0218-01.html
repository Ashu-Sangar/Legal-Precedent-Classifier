When, appellee was transported to a police station, after having been arrested for being in possession of 744 packets of heroin, he was recognized by one of the officers on duty as the juvenile son of another police officer. Mr. Christmas, appellee’s father, was immediately contacted, and, a short time later he arrived at the station, whereupon he conferred with his son, in private, for approximately 15 minutes. Next, Mr. Christmas emerged from the meeting and told the arresting officers that appellee wished to make a statement. In the presence of his father, appellee was then informed of his constitutional rights, waived them, and gave an inculpatory statement. A pre-trial motion to suppress the statement was denied, and the confession was admitted into evidence during trial.

Thus, we presume that a juvenile is incompetent to waive his rights without opportunity for consultation with an informed and interested adult; this presumption must be tested against the totality of circumstances surrounding a given waiver to determine whether the particular juvenile might in fact be competent to waive his rights without such opportunity. Thus, the <em>McCutehen </em>rule, requiring <em>per se </em>suppression of every statement obtained without there having been an opportunity for such consultation, is overruled. In its place, there shall exist a <em>presumption </em>that a statement derived in the absence of such an opportunity for consultation is inadmissible, but that presumption shall be regarded as rebutted where the evidence <em>clearly demonstrates </em>that the juvenile was in fact competent to make a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his rights. Hence, while the presumption of inadmissibility will serve to protect the juvenile defendant, who, in the <em>usual </em>case, is likely to be disadvantaged by his youth, consideration will no longer be foreclosed with respect to the totality of circumstances present in a particular case that may render the juvenile’s waiver of rights a <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>knowing and voluntary one.

At the time of his arrest, appellee was just four months under the age of eighteen years. Appellee had extensive experience with the criminal justice system, having been arrested on seventeen previous occasions and adjudicated delinquent on three different occasions, and having been committed to two separate youth detention facilities as well as serving “intensive” probation. Indeed, appellee was a veteran arrestee and a seasoned delinquent, not a naive and inexperienced youth needing the advice of an interested and informed adult to deal with a legal situation with which he was unfamiliar, or which he did not understand. Appellee did, nevertheless, confer with his father, an experienced police officer. In the presence of his father, appellee was then informed of his constitutional rights, waived them, and gave an inculpatory statement. The evidence also shows that appellee’s physical condition was normal and that appellee was not subjected to physical or psychological abuse, and that no threats or promises were utilized to induce his confession. Further, appellee’s reasonable requests,, such as the use of restroom facilities, were granted. Given these circumstances, the record clearly dem<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>onstrates that appellee’s confession was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.</p>

Strictly speaking, a presumption is a procedural device which not only permits an inference of the presumed fact, but also operates to shift the burden of producing evidence to the party upon whom the burden does not normally rest. <em>See: McCormick’s Handbook of the Law of Evidence </em>§ 342 (2nd Ed. E. Cleary, 1972). Also <em>see: Commonwealth v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/pa/458/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="458 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="479735" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0188-01">458 Pa. 188</a>, 193 n. 3, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20204" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="329 A.2d 204">329 A.2d 204</a>, 208 n. 3 (1974). If what is characterized as a presumption merely places the burden of producing evidence upon the party who normally has that burden, then calling this procedural step a presumption will have a tendency to create confusion. The Commonwealth always has the burden of producing evidence to show that a juvenile made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights. The so-called presumption an<a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>nounced by the majority is not a presumption at all since it merely establishes that the Commonwealth has its usual burden of proving a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver on the part of a juvenile.</p>

He had extensive experience with the criminal judicial system. Appellee had been arrested at least sixteen times previous to his arrest in this case. His record included commitments to two separate youth detention facilities as well as serving “intensive” probation. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the appellee was not a naive, inexperienced youth who suddenly found himself caught up in a legal situation which he did not understand and as a result needed the advice of an interested adult. On the contrary, appellee as a veteran arrestee and seasoned delinquent was probably in less need of the assistance of an interested adult than a first offender who happened to be born four months and one day earlier than appellee. Nonetheless, he did take advantage of the opportunity to confer with his father, an experienced police officer, before being questioned by the authorities.</p>
