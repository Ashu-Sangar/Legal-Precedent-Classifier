(There is no clear explanation in the record for the inordinate lapse of time between the filing of the custody petition on August 14,1978 and the hearings in March, April and August of 1979.) At these hearings, only Shane’s custody was in dispute. (No one has ever challenged the court’s determination that it was in the best interests of Shonda Lynn and Sean to be placed in the long-term foster care of the Youngs.)

This was due to Children’s Services’ expressed intentions to keep the three Davis children together under the long-term care of foster parents and the Youngs’ expressed intentions to raise all three children to maturity, as they had previously done with three other foster children. The appellants, as well, would raise Shane to maturity. Thus, the trial court did not treat the case as one of choosing between the Millers and institutional foster care, but rather, as is warranted by the evidence on the record, on a more personal level, considering the alternatives to be Shane’s placement with either the appellants or the Youngs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The court’s orders also provided liberal summer and weekend visitation rights for appellants with Children’s Services to arrange for Shane’s transportation. The Millers appealed that determination and filed various applications for stays pending disposition on appeal, which were rejected by the lower court and subsequently affirmed by the Superior Court. It was developed at oral argument before this Court that the Millers have, with the consent of Children’s Services, retained physical custody of Shane despite the denials of the applications for stays. On June 19, 1981, the Superior Court affirmed the lower court’s award of Shane’s custody to Children’s Services. This Court granted the Miller’s petition for allowance of appeal on October 16, 1981 and oral argument took place on May 27, 1983.</p>

Thus, the home life experienced by a child is critical in determining his ego-strength and his ability to cope with the pressures he will face as an adult. Where a child, therefore, will otherwise have an unsatisfactory developmental environment, placement in a home where he would receive love and acceptance would seem to override almost any objection raised because of mere racial differences.</blockquote>

As noted, the preferred practice is to interview the child whose interests are, after all, the <em>only </em>proper focus of a placement proceeding. The court proceeded with the intention of interviewing Shane on the last day of hearings, but counsel for Children’s Services interposed an objection, and was joined by the attorney for CPLS who was appointed to represent Shane. The court then sustained these objections. The disturbing feature of these events is this: counsel appointed to represent a child should certainly not be interjecting objections to having his client’s testimony brought before the court and placed on the record! Just as the court is not controlled by the stated preference of the child, appointed counsel<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> should not be satisfied merely with the stated preference but, instead, should form an opinion as to the child’s best interest after reasonable investigation of all relevant facts and circumstances. Counsel for Shane has vociferously argued that Shane’s best interests would be served by awarding custody to Children’s Services to be placed with the Youngs. Yet counsel does the child a disservice if he does not take care to submit the child’s viewpoint/preference to the court, offer whatever reasonable support may exist for that viewpoint, and explain why counsel’s opinion as to the “best interests” differs from that of the child/client. This disservice was compounded in the instant case by the lack of follow-up by appointed counsel for, as was disclosed at oral argument in response to questioning from the bench, no one <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>from CPLS had spoken with Shane since the hearings below. We are sorely disappointed with the caliber of Shane’s representation in this regard as it seems to relegate the child/client to second-class citizenship.

Much may have happened since 1979 in terms of Shane’s adjustment at Stony Run, attachments with his siblings and perhaps the Youngs, his progress at school, the development of his personal and social identity, the health of the respective parties, etc. There is simply too much unknown at this point to allow us to affirm without qualification, which affirmance would effectuate Shane’s transfer to Children’s Services and the Youngs.

Such couples should be encouraged to consider such a child.”</p>

This distinction must be recognized. If, immediately after [giving up the child] reclamation be sought, and the father is not what may be called an unfit person by reason of immorality, etc., the courts will pay little attention to any mere speculation as to the probability of benefit to the child by leaving or returning it. In other words, they will consider that the law of nature, which declares the strength of a father’s love is more to be considered than any mere speculation whatever as to the advantages which possible wealth and social position might otherwise bestow. But, on the other hand, when reclamation is not sought until a lapse of years, when new ties have been formed and a certain current given to the child’s life and thought, much attention should be paid to the probabilities of a benefit to the child from the change. It is an obvious fact that ties of blood weaken, and ties of companionship strengthen, by lapse of time; and the prosperity and welfare of the child depend on the number and strength of these ties, as well as on the ability to do all which the promptings of these ties compel.</p>
