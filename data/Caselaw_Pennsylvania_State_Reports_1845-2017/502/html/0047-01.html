Those expenditures, however, under the plain language of subsection (a), ultimately must be “incurred” in order to obligate DPW to reimburse at the specified percentages of “cost,” “actual cost” and “reasonable cost,” depending upon the service provided.

By January 1, 1980, it was the obligation of the Secretary of the Budget to have submitted DPW’s budget request to the Governor, who was authorized, “after giving to each department, board or commission an opportunity to be heard, [to] approve, disapprove or alter” the budget request. § 610(b), 71 P.S. § 230(b).

See § 613, 71 P.S. § 233.
