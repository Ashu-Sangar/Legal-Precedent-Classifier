Appellant, Mack Truesdale, was charged in connection with a shooting episode which occurred on October 17, 1975, as a result of a dispute over the sale of narcotics. As in the first trial, the jury found appellant guilty of two counts of murder of the first degree, and returned the death penalty on both counts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The jury also found appellant guilty of conspiracy and aggravated assault.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Sentences of death were imposed on the verdicts of guilty of murder of the first degree, a sentence of five to ten years’ imprisonment was imposed on the conspiracy verdict and a sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months’ imprisonment was imposed on the verdict of aggravated assault. All sentences were ordered to run consecutively.</p>

He contends that he should have been permitted to pursue questions regarding Jackson’s probationary status at the time of the offense as a means of impeaching Jackson’s credibility.

In addition, defense counsel fully explored the question of what, if any, protection and money Mr. Jackson received from the District Attorney’s Office for his testimony (N.T. 9/24/80, pp. 229-234). Hence, this Court’s failure to permit defense counsel to explore the issue of Mr. Jackson’s possible bias by means of questioning his probationary status was harmless in light of the other vigorous attacks made on Mr. Jackson’s interests in the case.”</blockquote>

This claim does not present a basis for relief. The testimony made it clear that the photograph was shown to Jackson after Jackson had asked to see a photograph of “Lieutenant Mack” and after Jackson had told police at the crime scene that “Mack shot me! Mack shot me!” As the trial court concluded, there was no evidence that should have reasonably suggested to the jury that the photograph was obtained as a result of prior criminal activity on the part of appellant.

Moody, </em>supra at note 1 (ruling the Act of 1974 unconstitutional), would have required that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on the appeal from his first conviction.
