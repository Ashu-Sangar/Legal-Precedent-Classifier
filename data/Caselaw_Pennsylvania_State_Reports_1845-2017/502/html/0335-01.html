At the time of the mishap, the appellee was engaged in his duties, within the scope of his employment, as an employee of the City of Pittsburgh. Because of the injuries he suffered in the accident, appellee was unable to continue performing his city employment duties. In addition, at the time of the accident, appellee had part-time employment with Central Maintenance and Central Service, Inc. The injuries also prevented him from performing his part-time job duties.</p>

He earned $245.76 a week with the city and $37.20 a week in his employment with Central Maintenance. Following the accident, appellee received $163.84 a week in Workmen’s Compensation benefits from the City.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[286,615,1149,1164]]]'>On the date of the truck accident, appellee had a no-fault insurance policy on his personal vehicle issued by the appellant, State Farm Mutual Insurance Company. Appellee submitted a claim to State Farm for payment of wage loss benefits to reimburse him for his wage loss over and above the amount he received from Workmen’s Compensation. Appellant denied the claim contending that any wage loss benefits due appellee must be paid by his employer’s insurance carrier. Appellee filed suit in assumpsit against appellant, State Farm, to recover the wage loss benefits he had applied for and had been denied. Motley's complaint also sought interest<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and attorney’s fees and costs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Subsequently, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted. The lower court ruled that appellant was liable to appellee for the excess wage loss benefits sought. Appellant was ordered further to pay statutory interest on the benefits due and attorney’s fees.
