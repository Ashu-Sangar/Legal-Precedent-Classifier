    <p id="b52-8" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[261,616,1150,1168]]]'>This is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which affirmed a decision of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (Board). The Board had certified the Fraternal Order of Police, Local 85, (FOP) as the collective bargaining representative of the Capitol Police. The issue to be addressed is whether the determination by the Board, that Capitol Police employed in Harrisburg and in state office buildings in Scranton, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh are “policemen” within the meaning of Act 111, the Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, No. Ill, § 1 et <em>seq., </em>43 P.S. § 217.1 <em>et seq. </em>(Act 111), is supported by substantial evidence. Act 111, enacted in 1968, encompasses policemen and firemen and provides for binding arbitration in the event of impasse during bargaining for which the covered employes relinquish the prerogative to strike the employer. Appellants contend that the Board conclusion is erroneous in that the employes are “guards” within the meaning of the Public Employe Relations Act, Act of July 23,1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, § 101 <em>et seq., as amended, </em>43 P.S. § 1101.101 <em>et seq., </em>(PERA). PERA, enacted in 1970, encompasses public employes generally, including “guards,” and retains the employe prerogative to strike.</p>

In 1973, under PERA and not Act 111 and pursuant to a stipulation that the employes were not “policemen,” the Board had previously certified the International Union, United Plant Guard Workers of America (Plant Guards) as the bargaining representative of all Police Officers I and II <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>and as the exclusive “meet and discuss” representative of all Police Officers III and IV, employed by various agencies throughout the Commonwealth, some of which are Capitol Police. Because the prior certification under PERA evolved from a stipulation of the status of Capitol Police, the instant FOP petition presented the first opportunity of the Board to take evidence on the issue.</p>
    <p id="b53-5" data-blocks='[["BL_53.4",53,[154,687,1151,1348]]]'>A series of hearings was held on the FOP petition before a designated hearing examiner of the Board at which time all parties in interest were afforded a full opportunity to examine and cross-examine witnesses, present testimony and furnish documentary evidence. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed. The Board concluded that the officers of the Capitol Police are “policemen” within the meaning of Act 111 and that the unit appropriate for collective bargaining is a subdivision of the employer unit comprising all full-time and regular part-time Capitol Police, including Police Officers IV (Lieutenants), Police Officers III (Sergeants), Police Officers II, Police Officers I, and excluding the Superintendent and Captain. The Board ordered an election which rendered a majority vote by the members of the defined appropriate unit in favor of representation by the FOP, whereupon the FOP was certified by the Board as the exclusive bargaining representative. Exceptions were filed by the Plant Guards and the Commonwealth, resulting in Board modification and vacation of some findings of fact but in the entry of a final order certifying the FOP as the exclusive bargaining representative. From this final order, the Commonwealth and Plant Guards appealed to Commonwealth Court which affirmed in part and reversed that part of the final order which concluded that Capitol Police serving state office buildings in Scranton were “policemen.”</p>

However, duties of police officers and security guards are not mutually exclusive and there is necessarily an overlapping of functions.

The conclusion of the Board that the Capitol Police are “policemen” is reasonable and emerges from an evidentiary pattern of full police powers and duties confined jurisdictionally to property of the Commonwealth, a geographical limitation not unlike special police forces in other governmental or principality jurisdictions.

We are not persuaded that the status of the Capitol Police as “police” is to depend upon frequency of acts. Frequency of performance may be a function of the relative infrequency of disruptive activity in and around state buildings as compared to the community at large and thus does not diminish the power or eliminate the duty of the Capitol Police, but merely reduces the necessity of exercising those powers and duties.

Thus, by subsection (e) of this enabling legislation, the Capitol Police are vested with the same powers exercised by the police of the cities in which the Capitol Police are located. Because the enabling legislation does not specifically name police of thje city of Scranton as being the model for powers held by Capitol Police in Scranton, the Commonwealth Court determined that Capitol Police in Scranton were not vested with traditional police powers and hence are not “policemen” fop purposes of Act 111. However, this interpretation assumes the legislature intended to deprive Capitol Police serving in state office buildings in Scranton of the same general powers and duties of Capitol Police serving elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Such an interpretation is in derogation of the clear import of § 646(e) that Capitol Police shall enjoy the powers and duties of police in the city or municipality in which they are currently serving. As such, Capitol Police serving in Scranton are empowered as are Scranton Police and police generally throughout the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Accordingly, we reverse that part of the Commonwealth Court decision which reversed the Board conclusion that Capitol Police in Scranton are “policemen.” We affirm that part of the Commonwealth Court decision which approves “police” <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>status of Capitol Police serving in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Harrisburg.
