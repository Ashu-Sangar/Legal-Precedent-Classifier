Superior Court held that the Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100(c) extension Common Pleas granted the Commonwealth was unjustified because it failed to establish unavoidable judicial delay under <em>Commonwealth v.

We therefore reverse the order of the Superior Court.</p>

Nevertheless, during the eleven week period from the listing of the case as ready and the original Rule 1100 run date, January 17, 1976, a substantial number of Montgomery County Common Pleas judges were available to try criminal cases except for a two week period. The criminal trial assignment clerk for the Court Administrator’s Office testified that during those two weeks, trials were not held because a one week argument court and an “open week” were scheduled instead. The full criminal division of four trial judges and one list judge was available for six weeks and two trial judges and one list judge were available for three weeks. From January 17, 1976 until trial began on February 8, 1977, the full criminal division was also available.

That view, which a majority of this Court declined to adopt in <em>Coleman, </em>is implicitly followed by the Superior Court here. It ignores the realities of crowded criminal and civil dockets which overburdened Common Pleas courts must deal with on a day-to-day basis. Rule 1100 was designed to promote the administration of criminal justice within the context of our entire judicial system, not to render that system hostage to its own closed logic. The goals of efficiency and ease of administration which Rule 1100 serves are worthy; they should not be exalted at the expense of justice. Thus, in interpreting our Rule 1100, we must throw away the stopwatch and pick up the scales of justice. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

Ehredt, </em><a href="/pa/485/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="485 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1755541" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0191-01">485 Pa. 191</a>, <a href="/pa/485/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="485 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1755541" data-case-paths="/pa/485/0191-01">401 A.2d 358</a> (1979). A court may grant an extension on a showing of due diligence and a certification that trial is scheduled for the earliest date consistent with the court’s business, but if a delay is due to the court’s inability to try the defendant within the prescribed period, the record must show the causes of the delay and the reasons why it cannot be avoided, <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Mayfield, <a href="/pa/469/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="469 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1722083" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0214-01">469 Pa. 214</a>, <a href="/pa/469/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="469 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1722083" data-case-paths="/pa/469/0214-01">364 A.2d 1345</a> (1976). A bare assertion that a case was ready for trial but not reached is insufficient to justify an extension for judicial delay, <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em><a href="/pa-super/290/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="290 Pa. Super. 399" data-case-ids="169717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/290/0399-01">290 Pa.Super. 399</a>, <a href="/pa-super/290/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="290 Pa. Super. 399" data-case-ids="169717" data-case-paths="/pa-super/290/0399-01">434 A.2d 813</a> (1981). Judicial delay that prevents a case from being tried within the prescribed period does not justify an extension if the situation is brought about by a lack of due diligence on the part of the Commonwealth. In <em>Commonwealth v. Martin, </em><a href="/pa-super/246/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="246 Pa. Super. 407" data-case-ids="828460" data-case-paths="/pa-super/246/0407-01">246 Pa.Super. 407</a>, <a href="/pa-super/246/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="246 Pa.

Such delay on the part of the Commonwealth was held to manifest a lack of due diligence and to preclude an extension on the basis of judicial delay.</p>
    <p id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[279,634,1151,771]]]'>Under the facts of the instant case, I would find that there was not a proper basis for extension. The Commonwealth should be held to the requirement that it exercise due diligence at all times during the pendency of a case. The Commonwealth’s unexplained delay in arraigning Appellee manifested a lack of due diligence similar to that shown in <em>Martin, supra. </em>Furthermore, the Superior Court decided that an extension on the basis of judicial delay could not be granted in the absence of a showing that the case could not be moved ahead of other cases that did not have Rule 1100 problems. The testimony indicated that it was not the court’s practice to change the order in which cases were tried for that reason, and thus no effort was made to determine whether Rule 1100 problems could be avoided by moving the case ahead of others.</p>
    <p id="b450-6" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[280,1420,1150,776]]]'>The majority holds today that strict adherence to the 180-day rule is ill-advised because of the rigidity it demands and the hardships it causes in urban areas with crowded dockets. I must respectfully disagree. Applying the majority’s view of Rule 1100 totally emasculates the purpose for which the Rule was adopted. The Rule was promulgated to ensure a defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial and to avoid a case by case review to determine whether that right has been violated. It is totally illogical to have a rule designed to protect both an individual defendant and society at large and now to apply that rule in such an elastic fashion so as to accommodate the practices of various judicial districts. If the majority is of the belief that the Rule should be abandoned, then it should do so without the charade of judicial gymnastics.</p>

As noted <em>supra, </em>counsel offered no justification for <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>failing to contest the Petition for Extension. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967), we held that in a case involving a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a reviewing court must conduct an independent review of the record and examine counsel’s stewardship in light of available alternatives. Counsel is deemed effective once it is determined that the course of action had a reasonable basis designed to effectuate the client’s interests. The failure of counsel to take a particular action on behalf of a client does not constitute ineffectiveness if it is based on a reasonable assessment of its value, but the failure does constitute ineffectiveness if it is the result of sloth or lack of awareness of available alternatives, <em>Commonwealth v. Twiggs, </em><a href="/pa/460/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="460 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="482793" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0105-01">460 Pa. 105</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="460 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="482793" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0105-01">331 A.2d 440</a> (1975). Counsel is not ineffective in failing to assert a baseless claim, but an inquiry into the basis for counsel’s decision must be made if the claim has arguable merit, <em>Commonwealth v. Hubbard, </em><a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">472 Pa. 259</a>, <a href="/pa/472/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="472 Pa. 259" data-case-ids="1727744" data-case-paths="/pa/472/0259-01">372 A.2d 687</a> (1977). In the instant case, the record shows that the failure of counsel to oppose the Petition for Extension was due to neglect and not a reasonable assessment of the merits. Counsel should be deemed ineffective, as opposition to the Petition for Extension would have had merit.</p>
