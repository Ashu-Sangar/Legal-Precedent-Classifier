Indeed, the trial court has found that defendant did in fact conceal his whereabouts. Under such circumstances a dismissal for failure to obtain jurisdiction over his person because the notice asking the sheriff to make substituted service did not set forth a good faith effort to locate defendant would exalt form over substance.</p>

The record only indicates that the petitioner was unaware of the current address of the respondent. No attempt whatsoever was made to locate the respondent. Accordingly, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate the “good faith effort” as required under the old Pa.R.Civ.Pro. 2079.</p>
