The actual value of each share is to be ascertained by adding together “the amount of capital stock paid in, the surplus, and undivided profits,” and dividing the sum by the number of shares. It has been the practice of the Department to treat various reserve accounts derived from capital as part of the tax base. See <em>Citizens National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>63 Pa.Cmwlth. 383, <a href="/citations/?q=437%20A.2d%201327" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="437 A.2d 1327">437 A.2d 1327</a> (1981). After the various reserve accounts have been added to the capital accounts, the “actual value” of capital is determined by adjusting the book value of the assets upward or downward to reflect the market value of the assets on January 1 of the reporting year.
