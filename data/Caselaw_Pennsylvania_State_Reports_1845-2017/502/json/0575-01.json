        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThis is an appeal by allowance from an order of the Superior Court, 306 Pa.Superior 529, 452 A.2d 851, affirming convictions of forgery (eleven counts) and conspiracy (one count). Appellant contends that the charge of conspiracy, which was brought in February of 1980 and which alleged that the conspiracy occurred between July 1975 and June 1976, was barred by the two-year statute of limitations set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552(a). A divided panel of the Superior Court held that the statute of limitations for conspiracy is determined by the statute of limitations for the most serious offense for which appellant could properly have been convicted, which in this case was forgery, an offense with a five-year statute of limitations.\nThe Superior Court\u2019s holding is contrary to the plain language of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552. At the time the present action was commenced, section 5552 provided:\n\u201c(a) General Rule.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a prosecution for an offense other than murder or voluntary manslaughter must be commenced within two years after it is committed.\n(b) Major offenses.\u2014A prosecution for any of the following offenses under Title 18 (relating to crimes and offenses) must be commenced within five years after it is committed:\nSection 3123 (relating to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse).\nSection 3301 (relating to arson and related offenses).\nSection 3502 (relating to burglary).\nSection 3701 (relating to robbery).\nSection 4101 (relating to forgery).\nSection 4902 (relating to perjury).\u201d\nBecause criminal conspiracy is not an offense enumerated in subsection (b) of section 5552, the two-year statute of limitations established by subsection (a) must apply.\nThe order of the Superior Court is modified to reverse the conspiracy conviction. As modified, the order of the Superi- or Court is affirmed.\n. Section 5552 is a recodification of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 108, which also provided for a two-year statute of limitations for all offenses not specifically enumerated. Section 5552 was amended after the commencement of the present proceedings by the Act of May 13, 1982, P.L. 417, to provide that a conspiracy to commit specifically enumerated offenses be brought within five years. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552(b)(3).\n. Appellant\u2019s additional claim that the complaint did not allege accomplice liability is without merit.",
