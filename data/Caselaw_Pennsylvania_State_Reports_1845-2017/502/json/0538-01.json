Indeed, the trial court has found that defendant did in fact conceal his whereabouts. Under such circumstances a dismissal for failure to obtain jurisdiction over his person because the notice asking the sheriff to make substituted service did not set forth a good faith effort to locate defendant would exalt form over substance.\nThe order of the Superior Court, 460 A.2d 861, is reversed and the record is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for further proceedings consistent with this order.\nNIX, J., files a concurring opinion.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion.",

Accordingly, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate the \u201cgood faith effort\u201d as required under the old Pa.R.Civ.Pro. 2079.\nOur conclusion is reinforced in that the amendment to Rule 2079 requires an affidavit of due diligence as a condition precedent to alternative service.",
