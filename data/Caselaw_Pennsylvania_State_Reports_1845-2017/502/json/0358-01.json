Johnson, Esq., is stricken in light of this Court\u2019s order of November 29, 1982, directing the appointment of new counsel.\nThe petition for allowance of appeal filed by Nancy J. Hopkins, Esq., is granted, the order of the Superior Court at No. 1014 Philadelphia, 1981, 305 Pa.Super. 411, 451 A.2d 714 is vacated, and the judgments of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County are vacated. The record is remanded to the court of common pleas for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether petitioner was afforded effective assistance of counsel. If the court determines that there were no reasonable grounds for counsel\u2019s action designed to effectuate petitioner\u2019s interests, see Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967), it shall enter an order granting petitioner a new trial. If it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s representation was effective, the court shall reinstate the judgments of sentence. The parties may appeal the hearing court\u2019s determination. See Commonwealth v. Vargas, 498 Pa. 121, 445 A.2d 96 (1982); Commonwealth v. Brown, 478 Pa. 628, 387 A.2d 665 (1978); Commonwealth v. Moore, 466 Pa. 510, 353 A.2d 808 (1976); Commonwealth v.

The initial factor which must be considered in determining whether there are reasonable grounds for counsel\u2019s actions is whether the claim is of arguable merit. Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977). I fail to see how the witness\u2019s reference in this case to a co-defendant\u2019s prior unrelated criminal conduct so prejudices petitioner as to require a new trial. Since petitioner has failed to provide an adequate basis to establish that a motion for a mistrial would have arguable merit, I would not remand for an inquiry into trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue the matter.
