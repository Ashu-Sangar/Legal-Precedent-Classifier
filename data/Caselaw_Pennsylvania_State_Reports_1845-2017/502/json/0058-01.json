        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court which reversed orders entered by the Department of Public Welfare (hereinafter \u201cD.P.W.\u201d). The lower court opinion appears at 65 Pa.Cmwlth 520, 442 A.2d 1236 (1982). We now reverse.\nAppellees, Shirley Keller and Helen Snyder, were eligible recipients of benefits under the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program (hereinafter \u201cM.A. Program\u201d) which is administered by the DPW under 62 P.S. \u00a7 441.1-453. Pursuant to its statutory authority, the DPW enacted a regulation dated September, 1980, which provided that costs arising from x-rays ordered and taken by chiropractors would no longer be covered under the M.A. Program. 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 1145.54. Appellees, whose treatment included x-rays prescribed and furnished by chiropractors, were duly informed of this policy change pursuant to the requirements of the Public Welfare Code. 62 P.S. \u00a7 432.17. Nevertheless, they continued to receive x-ray treatments furnished by chiropractors.\nBecause they were adversely affected by the DPW\u2019s regulation, appellees challenged it before the hearing and appeals unit of the DPW and Helen O\u2019Bannon, the secretary of the DPW. Their claims were rejected in both forums. They appealed to the Commonwealth Court which, after consolidating the two cases with the consent of all parties, reversed the findings of the administrative bodies. The court reasoned that under 62 P.S. \u00a7 443.3(2)(i) appellees were entitled to benefits.\nSection 443.3(2)(i) provides as follows:\nPayments on behalf of eligible persons shall be made for other services, as follows:\n******\n(2) Rates established by the department for (i) other laboratory and x-ray services prescribed by a physician, chiropractor or podiatrist and furnished by a facility other than a hospital which is qualified to participate under Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act\nThe Commonwealth Court concluded that under this section, appellee\u2019s x-ray bills were covered since they had been \u201cordered by\u201d a chiropractor. This analysis is flawed because it fails to recognize that there are two requirements under \u00a7 443.3(2)(i). X-ray services will be covered if they are (1) \u201cprescribed by a ... chiropractor\u201d and (2) if they are \u201cfurnished by a facility ... which is qualified to participate under Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act.\u201d\nIn the instant matter, there is no question that appellees met the first of these requirements since the x-rays were ordered by chiropractors. However, they failed to satisfy the second provision because under title XIX chiropractors are not authorized to furnish x-rays.\nAlthough chiropractors may be qualified to participate in the M.A. Program under Title XIX, the taking of x-rays is not included among those services they are authorized to provide for which benefits are available. Section 1396d(g) of Title XIX defines the parameters of services subject to reimbursement which a chiropractor may perform. It provides as follows:\n(g) Chiropractors\u2019 services. If the State plan includes provision of chiropractors\u2019 services, such services include only\u2014\n(1) services provided,by a chiropractor (A) who is licensed as such by the State and (B) who meets uniform minimum standards promulgated by the Secretary under section 1861(r)(5) [42 USCS \u00a7 1395x(r)(5) ]; and\n(2) services which consist of treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine which the chiropractor is legally authorized to perform by the State.\nThere are no authorizations allowing chiropractors to take x-rays or provide other services. Thus, under Title XIX, a chiropractor is not qualified to furnish x-rays.\nThe Commonwealth Court erred in ignoring this limitation because under \u00a7 443.3(2)(i), the DPW must look to Title XIX for guidance as to what facilities are qualified to furnish x-rays. In essence, \u00a7 443.3(2)(1) incorporates Title XIX into the M.A. Program with respect to the issue of payment for x-rays ordered and furnished by chiropractors. Therefore, because, as pointed out above, \u00a7 1396d(g) of Title XIX does not authorize chiropractors to take x-rays, the administrative tribunals below correctly applied the DPW\u2019s regulation of September 1, 1980, denying appellee\u2019s request for benefits.\nThe DPW\u2019s regulation recognizes the close interrelation between Title XIX and the M.A. Program, a fact which has also been observed by this Court and the Social Security Act. See Delaware Valley Convalescent Center Inc. v. Beal, 488 Pa. 292, 412 A.2d 514 (1980). See generally, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(17). Moreover, the Public Welfare Code empowers the DPW to regulate the M.A. Program so that its benefits are available in accordance with the terms of Title XIX.\nSection 451 of the Public Welfare Code provides in pertinent part as follows:\nNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the department, with the approval of the Governor, may by regulation grant assistance to any persons, modify or discontinue any type of assistance and establish new types of assistance in order to insure receipt of Federal contributions for such assistance.\n62 P.S. \u00a7 451. (Emphasis supplied.)\nThus, the fact that the regulation of September 1, 1980 departed from previous policy, contrary to appellees\u2019 assertions, provides no basis for the contention that the change was invalid. The challenged regulation, rather than constituting a misinterpretation of the law, as appellees contend, represents a reasonable attempt by the DPW to calibrate the operation of the M.A. Program with the provisions of Title XIX in compliance with the terms of \u00a7 443.3(2)(i).\nWe therefore hold today that under current provisions of the Public Welfare Code and Title XIX of the Social Security Act, benefits to cover costs for x-rays ordered by chiropractors are not available through the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program unless they are taken by a facility authorized under the act.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins and files a separate concurring opinion in which HUTCHINSON, J., joins.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n.

Accordingly, I dissent.\nIn this case, after the adoption of DPW\u2019s regulation, both appellees were referred to Reading Hospital for chiropractic X-rays. The hospital was not able to provide either the required X-rays or a chiropractic analysis of those X-rays. As a result, appellees have been unable to receive optimal chiropractic care because they simply cannot obtain the necessary X-rays. This result, and the majority\u2019s opinion upholding it, clearly contravene the policies of both the Public Welfare Code and Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\nThe Public Welfare Code provides that:\nPayments on behalf of eligible persons shall be made for other services as follows:\n(2) Rates established by the department for (i) other laboratory and X-ray services prescribed by a physician, chiropractor or podiatrist and furnished by a facility other than a hospital which is qualified to participate under Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act, (ii) physician\u2019s services consisting of professional care by a physician, chiropractor or podiatrist in his office, the patient\u2019s home, a hospital, a nursing home or elsewhere, . . .\n62 P.S. \u00a7 443.3 (emphasis added).\nI would hold that appellee\u2019s X-rays are covered within the broad category of \u201cprofessional care\u201d which chiropractors may provide in their offices and for which they may receive reimbursement under 62 P.S. \u00a7 443.3(2)(ii). Further, I would hold that a chiropractor\u2019s office is precisely that type of \u201cfacility\u201d which may be qualified to participate under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and in which a chiropractor may provide X-ray services for his patients, as provided in 62 P.S. \u00a7 443.3(2)(i).\nThis interpretation of the state Public Welfare Code is supported by pertinent provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act. That act provides that\n(a) The term \u201cmedical assistance\u201d means payment of part or all of, the cost of the following care and services . . . for individuals, . . . but whose income and resources are insufficient to meet all of such cost\u2014\n(3) other laboratory and X-ray services;\n(6) medical care, or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law, furnished by licensed practitioners within the scope of their practice as defined by State law;\n(13) other diagnostic, screening, preventive, and rehabilitative services;\n(g) If the State plan includes provision of chiropractors\u2019 services, such services include only\u2014\n(1) services provided by a chiropractor (A) who is licensed as such by the State and (B) who meets uniform minimum standards promulgated by the Secretary . ..; and\n(2) services which consist of treatment by means of manual manipulation of the spine which the chiropractor is legally authorized to perform by the State.\n42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396d (emphasis added).\nIt is clear that chiropractors in Pennsylvania are licensed and, to some extent, expected to use X-rays in the provision of appropriate care for their patients; certainly, their services are not limited to manual manipulations of the spine. Unlike the majority, I am of the opinion that this breadth of services, contemplated by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396d(g)(l), specifically allows for the reimbursement of costs for chiropractic X-rays.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\n. In Pennsylvania, \u201cchiropractic\u201d includes \u201cchiropractic diagnosis; ... the furnishing of necessary patient care for the restoration and maintenance of health and the use of scientific instruments of analysis, as taught in the approved schools and colleges of chiropractic .... \u201d 63 P.S. \u00a7 602(b). The \u201cscientific instruments of analysis\u201d which chiropractors are licensed to use in furnishing patient care clearly include X-ray equipment and X-rays. In fact, chiropractic colleges in Pennsylvania must offer as part of their standard course of instruction a class in X-rays. 63 P.S. \u00a7 604. In addition, before becoming licensed as a chiropractor, an individual must pass an examination which includes questions on the subject of X-rays. 63 P.S. \u00a7 610(a).",
