The Superior Court deemed the sentence invalid because a minimum term was not imposed pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b).\nThe record establishes that appellee, who was seventeen years old at the time of sentencing, was sentenced pursuant to the \u201cYouth Offenders Act,\u201d Act of April 28,1887, P.L. 63, \u00a7 6, 61 P.S. \u00a7 485 (1964), which specifically prohibits the imposition of a minimum period of incarceration. As 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b) thus did not apply to the sentencing proceeding in this case, the order of the Superior Court must be vacated.\nOrder of the Superior Court vacated and record remanded to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.",
