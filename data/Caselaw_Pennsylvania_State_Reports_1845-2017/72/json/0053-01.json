If the absolute confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report is to be regarded as a decree of distribution, then the appeal, not having been taken within the twenty days allowed by the act, was too late: Dawson\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 480. But if it cannot be so regarded, then the appeal was premature. The whole proceedings were manifestly erroneous and void for want of jurisdiction. The money was not in court when the auditor was appointed to make distribution, and, so far as appears, is still in the hands of the sheriff. The fund not being pdthin its grasp, the court had no power, even with the agreement of the parties interested, to decree its distribution: Williams\u2019s Appeal, 9 Barr 267; Masser v. Dewart, 10 Wright 534; Atkins\u2019s Appeal, 8 P. F. Smith 86. Nor was the defect cured by the Act of 28th June 1871, relating to the distribution of moneys r.aised by sheriff\u2019s sales, P. L. 1376, which was not intended to be retroactive.\nAppeal quashed. \u25a0",

Previously to that act, it was agreed that money in a sheriff\u2019s hands should be considered in court, and an auditor\u2019s report making distribution was confirmed. Held, that the whole proceeding was void for want of jurisdiction.\n3. The money not being in court, the agreement of the parities could not give the court power to distribute.\nMay 18th 1872.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Asnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nAppeal from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland county: Of May Term 1872, No. 88. In the distribution of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s .sale of the real estate of \u2022 Benjamin Keller.\nKeller\u2019s real estate was sold under a venditioni to January Term 1869, at the suit of George N. Hoch. The proceeds of sale after payment of costs amounted to $750.\nJanuary 18th 1869, by consent, the money made on this writ was considered in court, and William B. Parker, Esq., appointed auditor to report the facts and to make distribution.\nThe auditor reported distribution to various lien-creditors in full of their claims, and awarded $311.06, the remainder of the fund in court, to Hoch on his judgment and execution, his real debt being $1536. The report was confirmed absolutely March 14th 1870.\n\u201cJune 3d 1870. The within report being erroneous as per errors appearing on the report itself, the confirmation is vacated, and the report is referred back to the auditor for correction and revision.\u201d\nThe auditor by his second report awarded to Hoch $106.94.\nThis report was filed January 9th 1871, confirmed nisi January 17th 1871, and confirmed absolutely January 30th 1871.\nHoch appealed to the Supreme Court June 5th 1871, and assigned for error the order of the Court of Common Pleas of June 3d 1870.\nF.
