We think the enabling act was necessary and binding legislation on these state banks, and that the taxes due until the surrender was perfected according to its terms, were due to, and collectable by, the state. This was the opinion of the learned court below, and with it we agree.\nLet the judgments in both of the above cases be affirmed.",
