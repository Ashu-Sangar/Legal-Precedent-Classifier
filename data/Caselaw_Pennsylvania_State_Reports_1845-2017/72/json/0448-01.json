J.\n\u2014 Two questions are raised upon this appeal from the decision of the court below, awarding the damages arising from the taking of the land for the enlargement of a burial-ground to her brother, John Buchanan.\nThese questions arise upon the will and codicil of John Buchanan, their father, admitted to probate on the 2d May 1837.\nThe appellant claims: 1. That the legacy of $300 bequeathed to her by the will of her father, John Buchanan, was a charge upon the land devised by said will to her brother William, and that the fund in court, having been derived from a portion of said land, should be applied to the payment of her legacy.\n2. That William Buchanan took an estate in fee simple in the land in Pennsylvania, under his father\u2019s will, and having died intestate, and without issue, she as one of the heirs at law is entitled to a share of the money in court.\nThe learned judge in the court below, in a carefully drawn opinion, negatived both these claims, and held that the money in court belonged to John Buchanan, and ordered it to be paid to him. We, agreeing with the court below, for the reasons assigned by them, The said order or decree is affirmed.\nVide McEadden v. Johnson, antea 335. \u2014 Rep.",

    "head_matter": "Buchanan\u2019s Appeal.\nA testator devised land to his son William, \u201c he paying the legacies hereafter enjoined on him to pay,\u201d one was to a daughter,Nancy. He devised other land to his son John, he to pay legacies. He then directed, \u201c should either of my two sons die without issue, that such son\u2019s portion shall pass to the survivor.\u201d William died intestate without issue. Held, 1. That on William\u2019s death his devise passed to John. 2. That Nancy\u2019s legacy was not a charge on William\u2019s land. 3. That the legacy not having been paid in William\u2019s life was not a charge in the hands of John.\nNovember \u2014 1872.\nBefore Thompson, O. J., Read, Agnew, Shaeswood and Williams, JJ.\nAppeal from the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county: Of October and November Term 1872, No. 150.\nBy virtue of an Act of Assembly for that purpose, passed April 12th 1869, viewers appointed by the court reported in favor of enlarging a burial-ground by laying off from the lands of William Buchanan, one and one-half acres of land for which they awarded him $200; this sum was paid into court, May 15th 1871. William Buchanan died July 27th 1871, intestate, without issue.\nOn the 21st of August, John Buchanan petitioned to be allowed to take the money out of court, averring that the land was originally the property of John Buchanan, deceased, the father of the petitioner and William Buchanan ; and that William derived his estate in the land by the will of his said father, which was proved May 2d 1837; that under the same will upon the death of William without issue, the land passed to the petitioner in fee, and he was therefore entitled to the money in court.\nNancy Buchanan, a sister of William, in answer to the petition, averred that under the will of John Buchanan, deceased, William took a fee; that she was entitled to a legacy of $300, which was charged on the land of William Buchanan, deceased; that the money in court represented the land and was subject to the payment of her legacy; and that she was entitled to a share of the $200 as an heir of William.\nThe opinion of Judge Acheson approved by the Supreme Court, contains all that is necessary for the understanding of the case.\nThe opinion is as follows:\u2014\n\u201c The respondent, Nancy Buchanan, resists the application of her brother John to take the money out of court on two grounds :\n\u201c 1st. She claims that the legacy of $300 bequeathed to her by the will of her father, John Buchanan, was a charge upon\" the land devised by said will to her brother William, and that the fund in court, having been derived from a portion of said land, should be applied to the payment of her legacy.\n\u201c 2d. That William Buchanan took an estate in fee simple in the Pennsylvania land, under his father\u2019s will, and having died intestate and without issue, she, as one of his heirs at law, is entitled to a share of the money in court.\n\u201c The will of John Buchanan, hearing date June 10th 1836, contains the following provisions:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018 Item \u2014 I give and bequeath to my son William Buchanan, all my lands on the Pennsylvania side of the line dividing said state and Virginia, which I now live on, he paying the legacies hereafter enjoined on him to pay \u2014 to my daughter Nancy four hundred dollars, in the manner following, viz: two years after my decease he shall pay fifty dollars, and fifty dollars annually till all is paid.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018Item \u2014 I give and bequeath to my son John Buchanan'all my lands adjoining on the west side of the state line, he agreeing to pay two hundred dollars to my daughter Jane in manner following, viz.: two years after my decease he shall pay fifty dollars annually until all is paid.\u2019\n\u201c \u2018 To prevent mistakes, I hereby order that one hundred dollars of the above-mentioned four hundred dollars ordered to be paid by my son William to my daughter Nancy shall be paid to my daughter Jane in the same way as above ordered.\u2019\n\u201c On the 25th of January 1837, the testator added the following codicil to his will:\u2014\n\u201c \u2018 It is my will and desire that, should either of my two sons William or John die without issue, that such son\u2019s portion of the land above, mentioned shall pass to the survivor; and in that event the survivor shall pay the following sums, viz.: to my son Walter one hundred dollars, and to each of my daughters, Nancy and Jane, one hundred dollars; the said sums to be paid one-half in one year and the remaining half in one year thereafter.\u2019\n\u201c The testator died in 1837, and his sons William and John took possession of their respective portions of the land, as devised to them by his will. On the 27th of July 1871, William died intestate and without issue, leaving unpaid the legacy of $300 bequeathed to his sister Nancy.\n\u201c That this legacy was a personal charge upon William, for which his estate is liable, there can be no doubt;. but if he did not leave personal assets sufficient to pay the legacy, the question is, was it made a charge upon the land, so that if William\u2019s estate therein has become extinct, the land is still subject to its payment in the hands of John, the surviving devisee ?\n. \u201c In Wright\u2019s Appeal, taken up from this county, and reported in 2 Jones 257, the devise was to testator\u2019s son Thomas. If he chose to accept, he -was to pay $1700 to legatees. In deciding the legaey not to be a charge upon the land, the Supreme Court reiterated the rule laid down in Montgomery v. McElroy, 3 W. & S. 371, that \u2018 to make a' legacy a charge upon land devised, it is necessary it should be declared so by express words, or that it may be inferred from the whole will that such was the intention of the testator.\u2019\n\u201c Tower\u2019s Appropriation, 9 W. & S. 103, was a devise of all the testator\u2019s real and personal estate, the devisee \u2018 paying the several legacies hereinafter mentioned.\u2019 The design to charge the land was held to arise from the blending of the real and personal estate, the legal inference being that the devisee was to have nothing till the legacies were paid.\n\u201cThe latest casein the hooks is that of Hamilton v. Porter and Wife, 13 P. F. Smith 332, where the language used was : He \u2018 is to take the within-mentioned \u2018land\u2019 at my death, and pay $700,\u2019 &c. There is no appreciable difference between the expression here employed and that we are considering. In both cases the devisee was to pay a specified sum, for which, upon his acceptance, he was personally liable. There is no expressed intention to create a lien upon the land for the benefit of the legatee, nor can it be inferred from the tenor of the whole will.\n\u201c The devise to William Buchanan of the Pennsylvania lands vested in him an estate in fee simple under the ninth section of the Act of 1838. What, then, is the effect of the qualifying words of the codicil upon the absolute estate thus given to him by the will ? It is claimed on behalf of his brother Walter and sister Nancy that the design of the codicil was to provide merely for the contingency of the death of William or John without issue in the testator\u2019s lifetime, and that William, having survived his father, took an indefeasible estate in fee simple. The presumption is that the testator did not expect to outlive the sons between whom he divided the inheritance, and therefore this construction could be resorted to only on the ground of necessity, and to carry into effect the manifest intention of the will. The provision in the codicil that, upon the death of William or John without issue, his portion of the land should pass to the survivor, and in that event the survivor should pay legacies to Walter, Nancy and Jane in one and two years thereafter, indicates an intent adverse to such construction, and shows conclusively that the contingency must be referred to a period subsequent to the testator\u2019s death; otherwise the time fixed for the payment of the legacies might arrive in the testator\u2019s lifetime, and before the devise to the sons, or the survivor of them, could take effect. Moreover, the $300 legacy bequeathed by the will to Nancy, which William was to pay, would fail for want of any provision for its payment, in the event of his dying without issue in his father\u2019s lifetime. We are of opinion that William Buchanan did not take an absolute and indefeasible estate in fee simple in the Pennsylvania land at the death of his father.\n\u201c It matters not what we call the estates given by the will to William and John \u2014 Avhether estates tail, with vested cross-remainders in fee in favor of the survivor, or fee simple estates, upon condition that the son first dying should leave issue, and failing to do so, his estate should pass to the survivor as an executory devise. The codicil providing that the survivor should pay the legacies within a prescribed time to persons in esse, the testator could not have contemplated an indefinite failure of issue, but a failure of issue at the death of William or John, whichever of them should first die. The estate given to William, therefore, might be regarded as a conditional fee, with executory devise over to John; but whatever his estate might be, it became extinct upon his death without issue, and by the limitation of the will the land passed to John as the survivor: 5 Casey 490; 12 Harris 249; 13 P. F. Smith 485.\n\u201c It follows that the respondents, Walter and Nancy Buchanan, have no interest in the land as heirs at law of their brother William Buchanan, and that the money in court belongs to John Buchan an, the petitioner, and it is accordingly ordered to be paid over to him by the prothonotary.\u201d\nThe respondent appealed to the Supreme Court, and assigned the decree of the Court of Common Pleas for error.\nS.
