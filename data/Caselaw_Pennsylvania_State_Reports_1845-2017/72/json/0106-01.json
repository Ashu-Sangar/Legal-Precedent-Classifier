        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nThompson, C. J.\n\u2014 The learned judge of the Common Pleas was right in his reasoning and conclusions on the point raised by the defendant below and defendant in error, in regard to the question of notice furnished by the record of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. Had Chase been a justice of the peace of Erie county, the acknowledgment before him by the mortgagor, although the land lay in \u00ab Crawford, or any other county in the state, would have been all right, and the duty of the recorder of Crawford county to enter it of record, when offered for that purpose, would have been undoubted. This being the appearance of things, it was properly put on record by the recorder, and was thence primd facie notice to terre-tenant of the encumbrance. Had he doubted the validity of the acknowledgment taken by Chase, he could have satisfied himself by examining the recorder\u2019s office that he was a justice of the peace, in and for Crawford county, for undoubtedly his commission was on record, as required by the Act of 11th April 1840, and that he was a proper officer to take the acknowledgment. This being followed by an inquiry of the magistrate would have fixed the fact that the mortgage was in truth properly acknowledged. Whatever is sufficient to put a party on inquiry, where it ought to result in the information, is equivalent to notice. This is a general rule. All this by very little industry the plaintiff in error could have had. With it, would the defendants have been concluded? He did not make the examination and inquiry, but the plaintiff offered to prove the facts, and the court admitted the testimony. By this it appeared that Chase took the acknowledgment in his office in Titusville, Crawford county. It is very evident that the mortgage was filled up on an Erie county blank, and that the justice neglected to alter the name of the county referred to in the scilicet, from Erie to Crawford; hence the error. But in point of fact the mortgage was well acknowledged, as the testimony showed. Authorities abundantly establish that testimony to supply errors and omissions in acknowledgments and certificates of magistrates, quite as important as that under consideration, has always been received in this Commonwealth, and the reason is given in Rigler v. Cloud, 2 Harris 361, that \u201cit is against the spirit and genius of our government to extend nice technical objections to the acts of magistrates and other functionaries of the law, who are called from the mass of the people to discharge duties without previous legal learning or experience.\u201d The first of these cases is The Commissioners of Berks County v. Ross, 3 Binn. 539, where proof aliunde the magistrate\u2019s certificate to a deposition which omitted to state his official character, was admitted to prove that fact. In Fuhrman v. Loudon, 13 S. & R. 386, no county was mentioned by the magistrate at all as his place of residence in the certificate of acknowledgment. But it was held that the words, \u201ca justice of the peace, in and for said county,\u201d should be regarded as referable to the county in which the lands described in the deed lay, and in this way the acknowledgment was held good. So in Scott v. Gallagher, 11 S. & B. 347, an omission from the certificate of acknowledgment that the magistrate was a justice of the peace of the county in which the land was situated, was held not to vitiate the acknowledgment, and that it was proper to admit proof aliunde to establish that fact. The propriety of this ruling is fully sustained by Gibson, C. J., in Bennet v. Paine, 7 Watts 334. In, Pierce v. Hakes, 11 Harris 231, the objection was that the deed was defectively acknowledged before a court in the state of New York, because the certificate of the judge did not certify that the court in which the deed was acknowledged (being a deed to bar an entail), was a court of record, and that the omission was not cured by proof of the fact. In the opinion of this court, per Lowrie, J., it was said: \u201c It is admitted that such a certificate by a justice of the peace is good, though he omits to state his official character. It follows that it is the fact, and not the certificate .of the given official character, that is required.\u201d This court, in the recent case of Brookes\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 127, held that the clerical error made by the recorder on the margin of the record of a mortgage, of \u201cJanuary\u201d instead of \u201cFebruary,\u201d might be corrected by the note made when the instrument was left for record. This is in the spirit of the case just eited. We do not mean to say that every omission in a certificate of acknowledgment may be supplied aliunde ; it is only of those of the character we have been discussing and analogous cases, in which we think it may and ought to he done. It was proper in this case.\nThere is no error in this record, and the judgment is affirmed.",

Before the subscriber, a justice of the peace of said county,\u201d &e. The justice was of 'Crawford county, and the mortgage was put on record there. In a scire facias against a terre-tenant, evidence was admissible to show that the mortgage had been acknowledged in Crawford.\n2. The acknowledgment was prim\u00e1 facie regular, and the recorder was bound to record it; it was therefore notice to subsequent purchasers.\n3. Whatever is sufficient to put a party on inquiry which would result in the information sought, is equivalent to notice, and as an examination of the recorder\u2019s office would have shown a purchaser that the magistrate was of Crawford, he had notice.\nOctober \u2014 1871.\nBefore Thompson, O.

MoAvbray and Jacob I). Angier, terre-tenant; the defence was made by the terre-tenant.\nThe case was tried, November 22d 1870, before Yincent, J.\nThe plaintiff offered in evidence a mortgage from Mowbray to themselves for $2900 on real estate in Titusville, Crawford county; it was dated May 2d 1862.\nThe acknowledgment Avas as follows:\u2014\n\u201c Erie county, ss:\nBefore the subscriber, a justice of the peace of said county, personally came George M. Mowbray, the mortgagor above named, and in due form acknoAvledged the above indenture to be his act and deed. In testimony Avhereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two.\nE. H. Chase, [l. s.]\u201d\nThe mortgage was recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Crawford county, May 7th 1862.\nIt was admitted by the plaintiffs that at the date of the mortgage, Chase was not a justice of the peace of Erie county, but was of Crawford county.\nThe defendant objected to admitting the offer, because the mortgage was not so acknowledged as to entitle it to be recorded, and therefore was not notice to innocent purchasers.\nThe plaintiffs then proposed to prove that the acknowledgment was taken in Crawford county, and that \u201cErie\u201d with the scilicet was a mistake.\nThis was objected to by the defendant, allowed by the court, and a bill of exceptions was sealed.\nChase then testified that he took the acknowledgment at Titus-ville in Crawford county at the time it purported to be taken.\nThe court admitted the mortgage, and sealed a bill of exceptions.\nThe defendant then gave in evidence a sheriff\u2019s sale, February 12th 1866, of the premises covered by the mortgage to Jonathan Watson under a judgment against Mowbray subsequent to the mortgage, and deed from Jonathan Watson to Angier, the terretenant, March 2d 1866; recovery of the land in ejectment by Angier against Mowbray, April 22d 1870, and possession delivered to Angier under an habere facias.\nThe defendant submitted two points :\u2014\n1. The record showing that the acknowledgment was before E. El. Chase, a justice of the peace of Erie county, he being admitted not to be a justice there; the acknowledgment is illegal; the mortgage improperly on the record, and therefore no notice to purchasers at a judicial sale.\n2. Angier being a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, under no other notice than a defective record, took the premises discharged from the lien of the mortgage.\nBoth points were denied by the court. .\nThe court also charged that the case turned upon the sufficiency of the record of the mortgage to put a purchaser on notice; the acknowledgment was sufficient to allow it to be recorded, and being recorded it was notice to the purchaser. The purchaser took the land subject to the mortgage, and Angier is in no better position, and the \u201c verdict must be for the plaintiffs.\u201d\nThe verdict was for the plaintiffs for $4389.41.\nThe defendant (terre-tenant) removed the-record to the Supreme Court by writ of error.\nHe assigned six errors :\u2014\n1, 2. The admission of the evidence objected to.\n8, 4. The charge of the court.\n5, 6.

Jourdan, 9 S. & R. 268; Selin v. Snyder, 7 Id. 166 ; McPherson v. Cunliff, 11 Id. 422. The record of a deed defectively acknowledged is not notice to a subsequent purchaser : Simon v.
