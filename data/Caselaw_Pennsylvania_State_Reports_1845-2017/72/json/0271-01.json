        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nRead, J.\nThis is an action of ejectment for 106 acres of land in North Huntington township, in which it was agreed that certain facts should be submitted to the court, to be considered in the nature of a special verdict, with leave to either party to sue out a writ of error. The court below, on the stated case, entered judgment for the plaintiffs generally, to which this writ of error was taken. The only question argued before us was the construction of the will of John Rudebaugh, the elder, and that was whether John Rudebaugh, the son, took a life estate in the shares of his children or not. If he took a life estate, then it was agreed on both sides that the judgment below was wrong. The testator devised and bequeathed to his wife Elizabeth all his real estate whereon he was then living during her natural life, and also all his personal estate to her during her natural life, \u201c and at her decease to return back and be equally divided between my son John\u2019s children and my daughter Lydia\u2019s, intermarried with Martin Funk, their children; I give, devise and bequeath the same to their heirs and assigns, subject to the following restrictions, viz.: that my son John shall have the use of his children\u2019s share during his natural life.\u201d The devise of use during his natural life is a devise of the land to him for life, with a vested remainder in his children.\nJohn, the son, was married three times. By his first wife he had children born before the death of the testator and of his widow, who are the plaintiffs in this case, and three children born after the death of the testator and of his widow. The defendants and Mary Ellen, married to Demore, are the children of John, the son, by his third wife, after the death of testator and of his widow, and before the death of John, the son. There were, therefore, two life estates, that of the widow and that of the son, and therefore the term children of John included, according to all the authorities, all John\u2019s children born before his death: 2 Jarman on Wills 55, 56; Minnig v. Batdorff, 5 Barr 505.\nThe judgment, therefore, is reversed, and in conformity to the case stated, judgment is entered for the plaintiffs, including Joseph, Simon Reuben, Sarah Jane, for the undivided twelve-nineteenth parts; and as to the residue for the defendants, including Mary Ellen, married to Demore, but who is not one .of the defendants.",

By his will he provided as follows:\n\u201cI give to my wife Elizabeth all my real estate during her natural life, * * * and all my personal estate, and all the money and outstanding debts, * * * during her natural life, and at her decease the same to return back and be equally divided between \u25a0my son John Rudebaugh\u2019s children, and my daughter Lydia\u2019s, intermarried with Martin Funk, their children, I give devise and bequeath the same to their heirs and assigns, subject to the following restrictions, viz: That my son John shall have the use of his children\u2019s share during his life, after the debts to be yet mentioned are paid. Lydia Funk\u2019s children to pay their mother if so be she stands in need, $50 per year during her life.

Likewise I give to my son David Rudebaugh $700; to be paid by my son John if alive, or his children, and the children of Lydia Funk, in the following manner after my wife\u2019s death.\u201d * * * He gave also a number of small pecuniary legacies.\nElizabeth Rudebaugh, the widow of the testator, died in 1829.\nJohn Rudebaugh, the son of the testator, died about February 26th 1869. The plaintiffs are children and descendants of deceased children by his first wife, these children having been born before the death of the testator and Elizabeth his widow. He had also three children, Joseph, Simon Reuben, and Sarah Jane, by this same wife, born after the death of the testator and his widow. He had a second wife who left no children. The defendants are the children of his third wife, also born after the death of the testator and his widow.\nUpon these facts it was agreed:\u2014\n\u201c If the court should be of the opinion that the children of John, the son, who were born before the death of John, the elder, and his wife Elizabeth, are entitled to the land, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs generally.\n\u201cIf the court should be of opinion that the land belongs to all the children of John, the son, as tenants in common, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs, including Joseph, Simon Reuben, Sarah Jane, for the undivided twelve-nineteenth parts, and as to the residue for the defendants, including Mary Ellen, married to Demore, but who is not one of defendants.\n\u201c If the court should be of opinion that the defendants, Mary Ellen, wife of Demore, are entitled, under the will of John, the' son, to the undivided two-thirds of'the land in dispute, then the judgment to be entered accordingly.\u201d\nThe court entered judgment, October 17th 1871, for the plaintiffs generally on the case stated.\nThis was assigned for error by the defendants upon the removal of the record to the Supreme Court.\nF. Qowan (with whom was J. F. Wentling), for plaintiffs in error.\nThe use of the lands to John for life was a devise of the land to him. The division of the land between John\u2019s children and Lydia\u2019s children at the widow\u2019s death did not contemplate a division between the children themselves. The children then living took a vested remainder which would open to let in after born children: Wager v. Wager, 1 S. & R. 377; 2 Jarman on Wills 55 et seq.; Haskins v. Tate, 1 Casey 249.\nH. D.
