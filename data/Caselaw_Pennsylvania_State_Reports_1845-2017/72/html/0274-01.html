It was not leaking when I got to office; nothing broken; got it to office at 3.15 P. M. I put it on the counter a few feet from end; I carried it in carefully and set it down on bottom. No dog or other animal in when I went' out; nothing near that could interfere with it.

This is a question for you. To find this in the negative is an end of the case, and verdict should be for defendants. If found in the affirmative, you will next inquire whether the property was destroyed before delivery to consignee and whilst in charge of defendants, as carriers. If so, then there arises a presumption of fault, and without further explanation the plaintiff would be entitled to recover compensation in damages. Here it is first claimed that the demijohn, being in room of defendants, at Kittanning, was a delivery, and, therefore, defendants not liable otherwise than as warehousemen. There is no evidence in this case that would warrant you in finding this to be a delivery; neither proof of actual delivery nor notice of arrival.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There is no evidence tending to show a general usage or a consent of plaintiff to the goods remaining in the warehouse. Wherefore the liability of defendants as common carriers must be held to continue whilst the demijohn was in the house. Defendants being then common carriers and having charge of the demijohn as such, if you so find, and the property destroyed, also a question for you, whilst in their charge, has there been any showing under the evidence to release thorn from liability ? It is claimed by defendants that the destruction of the property arose from one or both of two causes.</p>

      <em>“ </em>First, either from the expansion of the liquor when exposed to the ordinary shaking and temperature, incident to its transportation, and the insufficiency of the package to repel such incidental exposure. And second, that the breakage was the result induced by the defect of the willow basket containing the glass enclosure, that but for the defective condition of the basket the breakage would not have occurred. Either of these positions, if made out by the evidence, would show contributing negligence, and would be an ample defence if the injury occurred during the transportation of the package, or within the time it should reasonably, under all the circumstances, have been delivered, and not after unreasonable delay and upon a concurring cause incident to that delay, and without which it would not have occurred.</p>

This is a question for you. That defendants would have a right, taking their packages out of trains at a point remote from their receiving-house, first to remove them to some general room before final distributing delivery, is undoubted.</p>

At section 50, page 38 of this last work, the learned author says; “One of the distinctive characteristics of this mode of transportation is that the companies, whether their line is by land or by water, or partly of each, undertake to deliver to the consignees in the same manner all common carriers by land did before railways came into general use; it being now well established, that in the ordinary railway transportation of goods by common carriers of goods, there is no obligation after the goods reach their appointed destination, but to put them safely in warehouse. It was mainly to remedy this defect in railway transportation of parcels of great value in small compass, that express companies were first instituted in America. That these companies are to be held ordinarily to personal delivery, has been so often decided as scarcely to require the citation of cases.” The court were therefore right in saying : “ Further than this, as to express company, we think the sound rule to be a personal delivery either to residence or place of business of the consignee.” In fact any other rule would be destructive of the business of express companies who receive a larger compensation, because they contract for a personal delivery of goods intrusted to them as common carriers. The charge of the court, as to the delay, its reasonableness or unreasonableness, was perfectly proper, as also their answers to the defendant’s point. We could not say the rejection of the evidence of the rules and regulations, as no copy of them was attached to the offer, was wrong, and it appeared on the argument they were the rules and regulations adopted by the company for the government of its members and employees.</p>
