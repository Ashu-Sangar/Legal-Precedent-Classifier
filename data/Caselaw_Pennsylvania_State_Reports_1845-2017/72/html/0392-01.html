In a suit for nondelivery ;of the oil, defendant offered to prove: 1. That about the time of delivery the principal oil dealers made a combination to create an artificial scarcity to compel defendant to pay extravagant prices or be liable for unnatural damages. 2. That the market value of oil was less than it had been raised to by the combination. 3. That plaintiffs, being producers of oil, bound themselves with a railroad not to send oil except by that road, for the purpose of showing a combination to restrict the supply of oil. Held, that the rejection of these offers was error. ■</p>

The refusal of the court below to receive evidence for this purpose in this case was therefore error.</p>

It is to be conceded that usually the courts making rules of practice are the best judges of their interpretation and application; but the question here arises upon the true interpretation of the aflidavit itself rather than upon the rule. We have said heretofore that too much nicety should not prevail in considering affidavits of defence, when a,solid or substantial defence is really set forth; otherwise the rule will be converted into a snare to entrap justice: Leibersperger <em>v. </em>Reading Savings’ Bank, 6 Casey 531; Thompson <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 P. F. Smith 33. This affidavit sets forth in unambiguous terms an illegal combination of the plaintiffs and others to buy up oil, create a scarcity and enhance the price, for the very purpose of preventing the defendant from complying with his contract, and to enable them to make great gains. It sets forth also the means whereby this purpose was accomplished, and that the confederates succeeded in raising the price of oil between the dates named in the affidavit from 13^ cents up to 18 cents per gallon. It also states that on the 31st of December 1869, the day when the contract was to be performed, the fair market price of oil was considerably less than 18 cents per gallon. Now, clearly, this would have been a good defence to the inflated, fictitious and temporary price as a proper measure of damages. But the court below thought that the statement, that the confederates succeeded in raising the price on the 31st of December 1869, to 18 cents a gallon, was an admission of that being the market price. It was an admission of an inflated market price, but not that it was the fair market value of the oil. What the defendant averred substantially was, that the market price on that day was the result of an unlawful combination <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>to put up the price, but that the fair market value of the oil was considerably less than 18 cents per gallon, which was the price sworn to in the plaintiffs’ affidavit of claim. What more could the defendant say truthfully ? He could not conscientiously deny that the apparent price in the market on that day was 18 cents; but he could conscientiously say that the price was not the fair and true market value of the oil on that day, and that the fictitious and inflated price was not the true measure of the damages. This he did say substantially, and he should have been permitted to prove the truth of his averments. The affidavit of defence had performed its office, he was now on the trial of its truth, and he clearly had not admitted that 18 cents ivas the fair market value of oil on that day.</p>
