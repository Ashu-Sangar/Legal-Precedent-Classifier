    <p class="summary" id="b71-9" data-blocks='[["BL_71.8",71,[184,1615,1166,807]]]'>The court below (Junkin, P. J.) entered judgment for the defendant in the following opinion: — “The question in the ease is, whether a separate covenant by a debtor made at the same time with the giving of the note for borrowed money, will render valid the promise of the borrower embodied in the note itself, to pay the lender <em>eight </em>per cent, interest. We do not see how or why it should. If by law more than six per centum cann'ot'be recovered, when the promise to pay (as is the case), is expressly made in the body of the note itself, how can the matter be aided, by a separate agreement or covenant to do the same thing ? One agieement or promise is just as binding as the other, and neither can be enforced, because the law forbids the thing to be done <em>at all </em>by adverse proceedings. In Heath <em>v. </em>Page, 13 P. F. Smith 108, it is held that ‘ excess of interest over six per cent, is the money of the borrower, which, when received by the lender, he cannot retain, but holds for the use of the borrower, and assumpsit will lie for it.’ If it may be recovered back, surely it may be applied directly when paid to the credit of the borrower in discharge of the unpaid balance due on the note.”</p>

The Act 6f 1858, on this subject, was passéd to regulate the rate of interest among the people, and to change the odious system of forfeitures existing under the old law. Under the new act any lender may receive more than six per cent, interest without any penalty or forfeiture, subject only to have it recouped or reclaimed by the payor. If this be not done the party receiving the interest can hold it lawfully. We cannot, and perhaps never could, hold that this right to reclaim excessive interest may be waived in a note, or by a contemporaneous instrument. It would be better to repeal the provision altogether than this, for it would <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>be resorted to in every case of loan or contract. We cannot allow public policy to be set aside in this manner. The opinion of the learned judge below is a satisfactory presentation of the law on this point.</p>
