The court below, on the stated case, entered judgment for the plaintiffs generally, to which this writ of error was taken. The only question argued before us was the construction of the will of John Rudebaugh, the elder, and that was whether John Rudebaugh, the son, took a life estate in the shares of his children or not. If he took a life estate, then it was agreed on both sides that the judgment below was wrong. The testator devised and bequeathed to his wife Elizabeth all his real estate whereon he was then living during her natural life, and also all his personal estate to her during her natural life, “ and at her decease to return back and be equally divided between my son John’s children and my daughter Lydia’s, intermarried with Martin Funk, their children; I give, devise and bequeath the same to their heirs and assigns, subject to the following restrictions, viz.: that my son John shall have the use of his children’s share during his natural life.” The devise of use during his natural life is a devise of the land to him for life, with a vested remainder in his children.</p>

There were, therefore, two life estates, that of the widow and that of the son, and therefore the term children of John included, according to all the authorities, all John’s children born before his death: 2 Jarman on Wills 55, 56; Minnig <em>v. </em>Batdorff, 5 Barr 505.</p>
