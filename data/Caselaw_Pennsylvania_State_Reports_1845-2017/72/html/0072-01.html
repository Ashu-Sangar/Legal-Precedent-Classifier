    <p class="summary" id="b90-7" data-blocks='[["BL_90.9",90,[264,1048,1168,1362]]]'>“ This case comes into court by appeal from the decision of the accounting department, which has charged the defendant with a tax on moneys paid as interest due to his creditors, and which the state avers that the corporation was bound to retain under the Acts of 1864 and 1868, and pay into the public treasury. The Susquehanna Canal Company is a corporation of Pennsylvania, created under an Act of Assembly, passed on the 15th of April 1835, and empowered to make a canal from Columbia to the Maryland line. By a supplement to that act this company was authorized to borrow money and pledge or mortgage its works. This was done, and eventually very considerable loans made, and the company gave its bonds therefor, bearing interest. Among its creditors was the state of Maryland, which, pursuant to a statute of that state, lent this corporation some seven hundred thousand dollars, which were secured by a bond and mortgage on its works, executed on the 27th day of May 1839, and duly recorded. Prior to that time the state of Maryland had incorporated the ‘ Tide Water Canal Company,’ which was authorized to connect with the Pennsylvania work by the laws of both states, and Maryland lent the two corporations $1,000,000, which were divided at the rate of $700,000 to the one and $300,000 to the other. The Tide Water Canal was wholly in the state of Maryland. The specification of exceptions taken on the appeal and filed in the cause, embrace substantially the following: First. There is no law imposing a tax on money at interest due by a corporation. Second. That the money due to Thomas Wilson by this company could not be taxed, he being a citizen of the state of Maryland, and the interest payable therein. Third. The money due to the state of Maryland is not subject to taxation; and Fourth. The laws authorizing and requiring a deduction of the amount of tax from the interest due to the several creditors impairs the obligation of the contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[164,417,1164,2028]],["BL_92.1",92,[296,405,1162,730]]]'>
      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>“ It is unnecessary and scarcely proper for this court to enter upon a course of reasoning to prove that debts due by a corporation, of the character proved here, and secured by mortgage, as shown, are taxable under the thirty-second section of the Act of April 29th 1844, and other laws of this Commonwealth, as the point has been repeatedly decided by the Supreme Court. The statute cited imposes a tax on <em>all mortgages </em>and money owing by solvent debtors, &amp;c., and “on all public <em>loans </em>or stocks, except those issued by this Commonwealth.” Loans to corporations must have been here intended, as those to the state are excepted. This is strengthened by the Act of May 1st 1854, though it is true that it speaks of ‘ bonds or certificates of loans of any <em>railroad company </em>incorporated by this Commonwealth,’ but it is merely excepting those from taxation for county purposes, and shows that the legislature considered such obligations taxable by the former law. The question is settled not only in Maltby <em>v. </em>The Reading Railroad Company, 2 P. F. Smith 140, but in several unreported cases since. See especially Commonwealth v. The Phoenix Iron Company, where the tax is sustained purely on the word ‘ <em>mort</em>gages,’ and in some other of the various railroad cases. It is no longer an open question in this state, nor is the non-residence of the creditor in Pennsylvania any ground for relieving his debt from taxation, as already decided in Maltby <em>v. </em>The Reading Railroad Company, and many others of kindred character. The tax was always due, but there was no means to effect its collection before the enactment of the Act of April 30th 1864, which required its retention by the corporation officers, and authorized its deduction from the interest due to the creditor. The only new and undecided point in the case arises on the money due to the state of Maryland. Is that subject to taxation by our laws? We cannot doubt the power of our legislature to tax the property of another state situated within Pennsylvania, or choses in action, bonds or other claims — a lien on property protected by our laws or where they must be invoked to coerce payment of the debt. The only question is, do the laws embrace the bonds due to a sovereign state ? It may be conceded that here, as in England, laws which speak in general of inferior persons, cannot properly be applied to superiors. Those which speak of the subject do not embrace the sovereign; or of the people do not include the state. It is well settled, however, that the statute may by express words extend to the state, and where it does so it is binding. The Statute of Limitations in general will not bar the sovereign, yet it may be and often is made so to do, both here and in England; and this either by express words or necessary implication. It has also been held that where an Act of Parliament is made for the public good, the advancement of religion or justice, or to prevent injury and wrong, the king shall be bound by such act, though not par<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>ticularly named therein: Plowd. 186-7, 11 Co. 586, 5 Id. 14, 7 Id. 32; Bouvier’s Bac. Abr. vol. 8, tit. <em>Prerogative, </em>p. 92. Laws imposing taxes would rarely be applied to property solely owned by the state, for the same hand would both pay and receive. This could not apply to the property of another state found in this, for the recipient would be different from the person paying. It is questionable whether any other sovereign can claim exemption from the laws of the state which enacts them. If another state or foreign sovereign sues to collect its debts in our courts, it cannot claim immunity from the operation of the Statute of Limitations. The doctrine of <em>nullum tempus, </em>&amp;c., only runs in favor of the local, not the foreign sovereign. It may be assumed as a settled principle that when a sovereign becomes a member of a trading company he divests himself, with reference to the transactions of the company, of the prerogatives of sovereignty, and assumes the character of a private citizen.

The Act of 1844 speaks of <em>all public loam or stocks whatever, </em>except those due by this Commonwealth. The Act of 1864 requires retention by the corporation officers from all bondholders or creditors to whom interest is payable, and if a neighboring state chooses to become a lender here, it thus far divests itself of its .sovereignty. True, the loan may have been made for the most beneficial purpose, and with the most patriotic views. Doubtless it was here done to secure the completion of a work through which the people of Maryland would be more cheaply supplied with fuel and other products of this state, and the citizens of Pennsylvania furnished with ready access to a good market, but although this motive might well be considered by our legislature in relieving a sister state from the burden of taxation, it cannot influence the judgment of the court in construing the statutes. The eleventh section of the Act of May 1st 1868, is, if possible, even more explicit in requiring the retention of the present tax by the corporation officers, a portion of which is claimed under that law. Some stress is laid on the words of the Act of April 22d 1846, section 3, to show that <em>persons </em>alone are required to make returns of property, &amp;c., for taxation, but after the most careful reading of that act we are of opinion that it has no bearing on the present case. This assessment, so far as regards the taxes of 1864-5-6-7, must be sustained, if at all, under the Act of 1844. The state of Maryland is the immediate beneficiary of the interest on the loan here, and its property alone can be looked to. We are referred to the decision of the Secretary of the Treasury, that the Acts of Congress did not contemplate a deduction from the interest due to a state by the corporations to which it had made loans, but only from that of the <em>people of a state. </em>It may be observed that the wording of the Acts of Congress is different from the statutes of Pennsylvania, and therefore must receive a different construction, but as the United States does not suffer its obligations, business, institutions or sources of revenue to be taxed by the state, so it extends a like comity to the revenues of the various states— will not impose any obligations in the form of taxes on the money which comes into their treasury, and it has been seriously questioned in several of the states, whether Congress could tax the <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>judicial proceedings. The decision of the honorable secretary, although a correct exposition of the laws of Congress under their wording, and the connection between the state and Federal governments, has little bearing on the present case, at least is nowise conclusive.</p>
