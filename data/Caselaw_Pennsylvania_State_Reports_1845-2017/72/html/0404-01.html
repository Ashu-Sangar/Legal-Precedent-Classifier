Under the Act of April 10th 1862, Pamph. L. 364, entitled “ An Act relative to the distribution of the proceeds of sheriff’s sales of real estate in the county of Allegheny,” the sheriff had returned a list of the liens appearing of record, to which, according to the provisions of the act, the fund would be distributed by the sheriff in the order of their priority, unless exceptions were filed. Exceptions were filed to the award of any1 part of the fund to three judgments and a mortgage appearing upon the list in favor of William H. Brown, by the plaintiffs in error, who were creditors by judgment posterior in date. They thereupon presented a petition with accompanying affidavits, averring that the defendants, Jenkins, Nish &amp; Co., were not indebted to William H. Brown in the amounts of said judgments and mortgage, but that the said judgments were confessed and taken for a much larger sum than was really due, for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the petitioners and other creditors of the said defendants, and to prevent the property from being taken in execution and made liable for the payment of the just debts of the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>said defendants, and that the mortgage was given to secure the said judgments with the same fraudulent purpose.</p>

Now, however, we have here no writ of error to any judgment on the issue; no bill of exceptions setting out the evidence. It is true that the testimony, which is said to have been given, is attached to the record, but it requires no argument to prove that it is no part thereof, and is therefore not judicially before us.</p>

But the issue awarded in this case under the Acts of Assembly was not an issue to inform the conscience of the court, but to decide the facts in dispute material to the distribution, by a trial by jury, which is the constitutional right of the suitor. This it was the object of the acts to secure, and therefore their language is imperative, and it is our duty to enforce their plain mandate.</p>
