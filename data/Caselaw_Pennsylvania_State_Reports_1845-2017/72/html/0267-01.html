The land described in the writ of ejectment was for the whole of the tract, for three-fourths of which the plaintiff in this case claimed mesne profits. The record showed further, that the writ in ejectment was served on the defendants August 1st 1865. On the 20th of November 1867, there was a verdict for the plaintiff for three-fourths of the land, and for the defendant for one-fourth. On the 25th of November judgment was entered on the verdict; this judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court, November 1st 1869, and the plaintiff put into possession under an habere facias on the 1st of December 1869.</p>

To sustain this, the plaintiff offers record of the C.

We cannot agree <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>that the verdict in that action is conclusive evidence as to the ouster. That verdict has received a construction by our Supreme Court: vide 16 P. F. Smith, page 319. Thompson, C. J., in the opinion there reported, holds the following language, as to the effect of the verdict on the reeord before us: ‘It appears, in this case, that the defendants at first took a general defence, by a plea of ‘not guilty;’ but afterwards disclaimed title as to all the land described in the plaintiff’s writ, excepting the one undivided fourth-part of it; and there was a verdict on the trial in favor of the plaintiff for the undivided three-fourths part of the land described, in favor of the defendants for the remaining one undivided fourth-part. This was exactly according to the disclaimer. It was a finding that the defendants had not possession of any more or greater proportion of the land sued for than that for which the defence was taken.’ This, then, construes the verdict as a finding that the defendants were not in possession of the three-fourths of the land; and the fact of their not having been in possession, is inconsistent with an ouster by them of’plaintiff as to this part.</p>

The judgment in ejectment is conclusive evidence of the plaintiff’s right to the possession of the premises, and his right to mesne profits from the service of the writ: Osbourn <em>v. </em>Osbourn, 11 S. &amp; R. 55; Huston <em>v. </em>Wickersham, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20309" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 309">2 W. &amp; S. 309</a>; Postens <em>v. </em>Postens, 3 Id. 182; Man <em>v. </em>Drexel, 2 Barr 202; Man <em>v. </em>Drexel, Id. 271; and it is also conclusive evidence that the defendant was in possession of the premises when the writ was served, and estops him from denying that he had possession, or that his possession was tortious. But it is not conclusive evidence of his possession after the service of the writ, and will not prevent him from showing that he abandoned or surrendered the possession to the plaintiff, or was not in it after the writ was served: Mitchell <em>v. </em>Freedley, 10 Barr 198 ; Sopp <em>v. </em>Winpenny, 18 P. F. Smith 78. But though not conclusive, it is primfi facie evidence that he continued in possession down to the time when the writ of habere facias possessionem was executed. It follows that under the evidence in this case the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the action of trespass for mesne profits. The judgment in ejectment for the undivided three-fourths of the land, for which the action was brought, was conclusive of the plaintiff’s right to the possession and his right to the mesne profits from the commencement of the suit, and of the defendants’ possession at the date of the service of the writ; and in addition to the evidence furnished by the judgment there was direct and positive testimony that the defendants were in the exclusive possession of the land from the date of the service of the writ until after the recovery in the ejectment. If the evidence was believed the plaintiff was entitled to recover. But the court below, misapplying the language of the Chief Justice in delivering the opinion of this court, in Lane <em>v. </em>Harrold, 16 P. F. Smith 319, which was a mere question of costs, told the jury that there had been no such recovery in ejectment shown by the evidence as would sustain a recovery in this action, and instructed them to return a verdict for the defendants. This was clearly error. The court, instead of giving a binding direction to find for the defendants, should have submitted the case to the jury, under proper instructions, for their determination upon the evidence.</p>
