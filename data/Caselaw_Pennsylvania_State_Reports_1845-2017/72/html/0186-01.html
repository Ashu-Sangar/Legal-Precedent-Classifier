In the year sixty-six and sixty-seven I was operating in the oil regions; while there, I learned that the Canfields’ estate was all advertised for sale, and among others, the lot purchased by the plaintiff in this suit was <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>advertised. I came home to Coudersport a week before the sale was to take place, at Meadville, and told the plaintiffs, that the lot was advertised as Canfield’s property. I was going to return immediately and did so. A. G. Olmstead, the plaintiff’s attorney, drew up a written notice of their title to the fifty acres in controversy, and sent it by me to be handed the sheriff of Crawford county, to be read at the sale. I got to Meadville and gave the sheriff the notice while the sale was pending. I knew the sheriff; his name' was Krick. Ira (Isaac) Canfield and a lawyer McAlister were present at the time, and others who were strangers. The sheriff took the notice and made the remark <em>that notice had already leen given of that title. </em>I heard the sheriff, Canfield and McAlister all say that notice had been given already. I then said to the sheriff, that the parties in Coudersport had requested me to hand him the notice and have it read, and he said as notice had already been given, this sale would not affect their title.”</p>
    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[201,1073,1174,1069]]]'>It is clear that at the time of Funk’s judgment, the Canfields were not the owners of the land in dispute, but that the whole equitable title to it was in the plaintiffs. The only question therefore is, was the defendant conusant of the plaintiff’s title, or had such information or notice as to put him on inquiry which would lead to a knowledge of the requisite fact by the exercise of ordinary diligence and understanding. The cases of Barnes <em>v. </em>McClinton, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pa.%2067" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Pa. 67">3 Penn. Rep. 67</a>; Hill <em>v. </em>Epley, 7 Casey 331, and Owens <em>v. </em>Myers, 8 Harris 134, fully establish this doctrine, and the vigorous language of Chief Justice Gibson in the first case is well worthy of an attentive perusal. The evidence above stated shows clearly that the Canfields publicly disclaimed all title to the land, naturally in reference to the time when the judgment was entered. Stitt the bidder put this construction upon it, for Morley says: “I think Stitt then advised me not to bid; he thought it would end in a lawsuit.” The defendant said, “ He had notice other parties owned it. He knew of the notice at the time of the sheriff’s sale, that the other parties owned it, and that after Stitt’s purchase, he employed Finney to examine the title,” which Mr. Finney did, and upon the same state of facts probably was of the same opinion with the learned judge. Gordonier’s evidence shows plaintiff’s title was known at the sale. “ The sheriff took the notice and made the remark that notice had already been given of that title,” and he said “as notice had already been given this sale would not affect <em>their </em>title.”</p>
    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[211,2150,1165,128]]]'>Upon such evidence, it is certain if believed, the jury might have found that the defendant had notice and full knowledge of the title of the plaintiffs.</p>

    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[229,506,1166,259]]]'>The circumstances attending the sale show this to be a correct view. The plaintiffs in March 1865 paid for this land $8000 in cash. The judgment was for $449.62, and the sale in the summer of 1866 was for $740, or less than one-tenth of the price paid by the plaintiffs; pregnant proof of knowledge of the title of the plaintiffs by the bidders at the sheriff’s sale.</p>
