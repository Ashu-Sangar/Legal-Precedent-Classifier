What, then, is the effect of the qualifying words of the codicil upon the absolute estate thus given to him by the will ? It is claimed on behalf of his brother Walter and sister Nancy that the design of the codicil was to provide merely for the contingency of the death of William or John without issue in the testator’s lifetime, and that William, having survived his father, took an indefeasible estate in fee simple. The presumption is that the testator did not expect to outlive the sons between whom he divided the inheritance, and therefore this construction could be resorted to only on the ground of necessity, and to carry into effect the manifest intention of the will. The provision in the codicil that, upon the death of William or John without issue, his portion of the land should pass to the survivor, and in that event the survivor should pay legacies to Walter, Nancy and Jane <em>in one and two years thereafter, </em>indicates an intent adverse to such construction, and shows conclusively that the contingency must be referred to a period subsequent to the testator’s death; otherwise the time fixed for the payment of the legacies might arrive in the testator’s lifetime, and before the devise to the sons, or the survivor of them, could take effect. Moreover, the $300 legacy bequeathed by the will to Nancy, which William was to pay, would fail for want of any provision for its payment, in the event of his dying without issue in his father’s lifetime. We are of opinion that William Buchanan did not take an absolute and indefeasible estate in fee simple in the Pennsylvania land at the death of his father.</p>

The codicil providing that the survivor should pay the legacies within a <em>prescribed time </em>to persons <em>in esse, </em>the testator could not have contemplated an indefinite failure of issue, but a failure of issue at the death of William or John, whichever of them should first die. The estate given to William, therefore, might be regarded as a conditional fee, with executory devise over to John; but whatever his estate might be, it became extinct upon his death without issue, and by the limitation of the will the land passed to John as the survivor: 5 Casey 490; 12 Harris 249; 13 P.
