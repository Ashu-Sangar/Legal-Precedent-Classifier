    <p class="summary" id="b224-8" data-blocks='[["BL_224.6",224,[273,601,1166,859]]]'>“ The plaintiff sold to the defendant his livery stable stock, and, in part payment therefor, accepted a conveyance of a tract of land in a distant state. The plaintiff afterwards discovered that the title thereto was worthless — or thought he did — and claimed to be paid in money the amount for which he had accepted it. The defendant disputed his liability to make the amount good and according to the theory of the plaintiff’s case (afterwards found by the verdict), a treaty of compromise was held between them, in which it was agreed that in place of the land the defendant should pay the plaintiff $1200, one-half in one year and one-half in two years, with promissory notes and security therefor. The defendant afterwards denied the agreement and refused to perform it, and hence this suit, in which the plaintiff declares in assumpsit on the common counts, including one for goods sold and delivered. The questions reserved on objections made by defendant’s counsel are: <em>‘ </em>Is assumpsit the proper form of action for the case ? <em>Is </em>any one of the counts sufficient for it? Oan the plaintiff sue without a previous tender of a reconveyance of the land ? ’ and the verdict was taken subject to the opinion of the court on these reserved questions.</p>

If these were the facts of the case there can be no question that the judgment was right. But the plaintiff here assigns as error that the court below erred in certifying disputed facts against the consent of counsel. But how does that appear? <em>Omnia prcesumuntur rite esse acta. </em>If it did appear how can we notice it without an exception ? The plaintiff has no other exception except the bill in question, and that does not show any exception to the statement of the facts. One of the facts, and the principal one, the judge certified to have been found by the jury. This is certainly a very irregular and unlawful manner of making out a bill of exceptions, and if an exception had appeared it could not have stood for a moment. The defendant had a right to require the disputed facts to be submitted and found specially by the jury, so that they should appear in the record as part of the verdict if it was proposed to resérve a question of law. If this was not done he should have required the judge to state a bill of exceptions to the reservation in any other mode. If the judge refused to answer the defendant’s points a bill should have been tendered to such refusal. It is certainly asking too much of this court to presume that the learned judge, without the consent or. acquiescence of the parties, undertook in his bill to find the fact as well as to decide the law.</p>
