These usages and customs may grow up spontaneously and unconsciously, or they may be instituted by expressed law or rule. The general customs of the country are its common law, and all are charged with knowledge of them. Not so however with the rules and usages of particular occupations, trades and businesses, other people are not bound by them merely by coming into transient relation with trades. These usages are principally for the convenience of the trade itself, and others are not bound by them, except so far as they know and may be presumed to accept them. Whatever a law says it says to those who come under it, that they may not have the excuse of ignorance of it, and thus by law is knowledge of sin and of duty in matters of this kind as well as in other cases.</p>

The rule insisted on is said to require a passenger to give notice to the conductor of his intention to get off and take another train at any point, so that the conductor may punch or otherwise mark his ticket accordingly; but it is not shown how the rule originated, who made it, or whether it applies to the whole or only to a part of the defendant’s road, and I know of no evidence that the plaintiff had any knowledge of the rule. From the argument of the defendant’s counsel it might seem to be specially applicable to the locality in question, for the purpose of providing against the crowds who throng the cars there and the attempts of some of them to steal a ride. But honest men are not to be presumed to know of such necessity. We cannot dispense with the passengers’ knowledge of the rule, because the defendant’s business is so great that they cannot give notice of their rules, and especially against a passenger who may accidentally and unintentionally find himself left by the train. This would be like 'saying, the greater the company’s profits the less its duties to the public.</p>

But of whom must he inquire ? Conductors offer no information and generally have no time to give any. At principal stations there are many offices, and modest men cannot be expected to run from one to another to inquire, at the risk of finding themselves very unwelcome. At way stations there is only the ticket agent, and he has no time to give instruction in the few minutes before train time that he opens his window to a jostling crowd of applicants. If the people are bound to find out such rules, then reason would require that the company should provide agents to give the information, and let it be known who they are, and give time and opportunity to find them and obtain it. It is not denied that the plaintiff had a right to travel the whole journey, part on one train and part on later ones, but it is claimed that he <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>forfeited part of this right by leaving the first train without giving notice to the conductor. For the purpose of raising the answer relied on by the plaintiff, I assume this to be true; if the plaintiff knew of the rule of the road which the defendant relies on, I should hesitate about accepting this claim as a true statement of the law, even with this qualification, if the case depended on it; because it makes a cancellation mark, which at the will and for the convenience of the defendant, is made in advance of satisfaction of the ticket, equivalent to a real satisfaction, if for any reason part of the journey is postponed for a later train, and will bear no excuse for relief from the alleged forfeiture; but this is a suggestion aside of the’ point in issue.</p>

R. R. Co., 21 P. F. Smith 432. The principles there ruled govern the question before us, and require a reversal of the judgment below. A ticket such as that printed in our paper-book imports upon its face no right to stop off, or in other words to make the journey, between the points named in it by stages, and by different trains. It is simply a ticket from the station called Miller Farm to Oil City, and imports nothing but a single and continuous trip. If a privilege of stopping off and continuing the trip at a subsequent time and by a different train exist, it is only by the rule or sufferance of the carrier, who having commenced the performance of his part of the contract of carriage has a right to pursue it to completion. This shows that the argument that notice of the terms of the rule permitting the passenger to stop and get upon another train must come from the company, is unsound. As the ticket imports a continuous passage, the company having undertaken and commenced its performance, it is evident that it lies on the passenger holding such a ticket to inquire whether a rule to suffer him to change the terms of his ticket exists, and what are the conditions of the exercise of the privilege. He must ask for his stop-off, and exercise the privilege upon the conditions imposed; and this is usually by obtaining a stop-off ticket, to be presented to the conductor of the next train. Of course we must be understood as treating of a case such as that before us, where no custom or general license of the company has been shown. This license to stop off at pleasure is sometimes given by some companies, or given upon certain trains. The effect of such a license, it is not our purpose now to treat of. But to hold that the passengers on every train have a right to stop and get on at pleasure, and that they are not bound by the terms of getting off unless notice can be shown by the company, would in effect take the government of their trains out of the hands of the company. This subject has been so fully discussed in Deitrick <em>v. </em>Penn’a. R. R. Co., we shall not pursue it further.</p>
