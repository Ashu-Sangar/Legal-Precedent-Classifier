The constitutional prohibition takes effect on contracts, whether between a state and an individual, or between individuals: Potter’s Dwarris Statutes 447. The state by legislation cannot impair the obligation of its own contracts ; it cannot alter a municipal charter, or revoke it, so as to destroy the lawful contracts of the corporation.

Whatever belongs merely to the remedy may be altered, provided the alteration does not impair the obligation of the contract, but if a statute so changes the nature and extent of an existing remedy as materially to impair the rights and interests of the owner of property, it is just as much a violation of the constitutional provision as if it directly overturned his rights and interests. If the statute does not impair the right or property itself, if it still leaves the party a substantial remedy, according to the course of justice, as the right existed at the time of its passage, it does not impair the obligation <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>of the contract, nor will it he held to do so, merely because the new remedy is less efficient, less speedy or less convenient than the old one: Ibid. 472.</p>

Whoever contracts with a municipality does so knowing that the state may do with the corporation whatever she shall deem expedient, as well as he knows the obligation of the contract cannot be impaired. He knows remedies may be changed, that he may be hindered, delayed and embarrassed. No better illustration exists of what he is liable to encounter than the statute referred to in the bill and answer, relative to the debts of the borough of Oil City. The Act of March 24th 1868, P. L. 444, provided that four-fifths of the tax authorized to be levied should be paid in borough orders, and the remaining fifth in money, for the exclusive use of the fire department. Not a dollar was allowed to be applied to the indebtedness of the borough. The officers were allowed to settle with their creditors and give bonds payable in the future. But all remedy to enforce payment was taken away. No remedy express or implied was allowed until after those bonds should become due. This was a stay law on all existing indebtedness of not less than one nor more than twenty years, at the option of the debtor. And it was passed after the borough officers had filed their answer to the mandamus on the larger judgment of the plaintiff. By Act of March 1st 1871, P. L. 187, the existence of the borough was wiped out, but a fair provision was made for payment of its debts. The proper officers levied a tax, but before any portion of the money was paid out, the Act of March 11th 1872 ousted the old officers, created new ones, and placed it out of the present power of the plaintiff to <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>collect his judgments.

This legal and certain remedy, then existing, is so much a part of the contract that it cannot be wholly taken away, nor changed so as substantially to deprive the creditor of all remedy. The borough of Oil City has been subjected to such special legislation that, if constitutional, the creditors are not only deprived of all remedy which existed when the credit was given, but the borough officers are forbidden to pay any creditor who will not release a part of his debt, while others offer to release. The creditor cannot collect and the debtor is prohibited from paying.</p>

If the part of the act in question is valid the money raised by taxation cannot be distributed <em>pro rata </em>among the creditors, in which case there would be some appearance of fairness; nor can it be applied to the oldest creditors in the order of contracts, nor to the vigilant creditor who obtained judgment by due legal process and issued the mandatory writ then authorized by law.
