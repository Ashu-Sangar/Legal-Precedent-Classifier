A subscription book was accordingly opened in which the several subscribers agreed to pay the sums set opposite their names, “provided $20,000 is made up and paid;” $20,245 were subscribed and paid; the lot was purchased and paid for by the money subscribed, and the title, on the 30th of April 1864, conveyed by John Herron, the owner, to Thomas H. Lane, George Black and Jacob S. Newmyer; the plaintiffs, by resolution of their church council on the 18th of November 1867, requested Lane, Black and Newmyer to convey the lot to the corporation ; Lane and Black executed a deed of conveyance, but Newmyer refused.</p>

Previously to the request to him to execute the deed of conveyance, he had been notified by subscribers to the amount of $6360 to the fund for the purchase of the lot, not to convey it to the plaintiffs, as they would hold him “to strict accountability in regard thereto.” In his answer he suggested that the subscribers thus notifying should be made defendants in the bill, and declared his readiness to execute such deed as the court should decree; he further submitted whether any decree could be made against him.</p>

The notice to him not to convey, by Graff and others, did not justify him in refusing so to do. Even if their alleged parol condition had been established and valid, it was a condition subsequent, and a matter between them and the church. It was not a matter about which Newmyer was bound to interpose in any way.
