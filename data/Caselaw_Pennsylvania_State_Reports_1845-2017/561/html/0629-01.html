Winslow-Quattlebaum then filed an underinsured motorist (UIM) claim against Maryland, which denied coverage, claiming that Winslow-Quattlebaum had declined the optional underinsured motorist protection by signing the rejection form on her original insurance application. Winslow-Quattlebaum brought a declaratory judgment action against Maryland on May 1, 1997, seeking underinsured motorist benefits under the terms of her policy. The trial court found that Winslow-Quattlebaum had rejected the disputed coverage by complet<a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>ing and signing the appropriate form on the application and that, therefore, Maryland had no duty to pay underinsured motorist benefits to her. The Superior Court reversed, finding that the form Winslow-Quattlebaum signed was void because the language offering the option to reject underinsured motorist coverage was not presented alone, on a separate page, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(c.l). <em>WinslowQuattlebaum v.

Furthermore, section 1738 (“Stacking of uninsured and underinsured benefits and option to waive”) contains no directive at all that the statement rejecting stacking coverage of either UM or UIM benefits must appear on a page alone— or even that it must be separated from any other provision. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1738(d), (e).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, we find that there is no <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>prohibition to having rejection of UIM benefits and UIM stacking benefits appear on the same official form.</p>

Were the UIM waiver the only information on the page, “prominent type and location” would be meaningless, and of course unnecessary, as there would be no other information on the page diminishing its prominence.

Specifically, at 31 Pa.Code § 68.103, the Insurance Department interprets section 1731 as requiring that UM coverage shall be sold separately from UIM coverage. 31 Pa.Code § 68.103(b). It is logical, therefore, that the insured must be given an opportunity to waive UM coverage <em>separately from waiver of UIM </em>coverage. Moreover, § 68.103 mandates the use of “statutory language” and directs the reader to the required form in “Appendix A.” 31 Pa.Code § 68.103(a). Appendix A contains, verbatim, the very form used by the Plan for Winslow-Quattlebaum. In Appendix A, on a single sheet, appears the template for “Rejection of Underinsured Motorist Protection” with the language of Win-slow-Quattlebaum’s paragraph “A,” <em>supra. </em>Immediately following appears “Rejection of Stacked Underinsured Coverage Limits” on the same sheet with the language of Winslow-Quattlebaum’s paragraph “B,” <em>supra. </em>Thus, the waiver in question is an exact replica of this mandated form.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Moreover, it stands to reason that where there is a paragraph “A” followed by a paragraph “B,” logic would dictate that B follows <a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>A in the same document and that “B” is not presented independent of “A.” Furthermore, on a <em>separate </em>sheet in Appendix A, appears the form for “Rejection of Uninsured Motorist Protection” with its own paragraph “A” and, immediately following, on the same page, “Rejection of Stacked Uninsured Coverage Limits” with the pertinent paragraph B.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> As the Insurance Department mandates the use of these forms precisely as they appear in Appendix A, the Department has demonstrably spoken as to the interpretation of section 1731(c.l) regarding what is to be on the same sheet and what must appear on a separate sheet. 31 Pa.Code Ch. 68, Appendix A.
