    <p id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.8",401,[143,930,1154,634]]]'>In November of 1998 Trivigno and the victim, Varano, argued during a court proceeding involving Trivigno and a friend of Varano’s, Martin Dougherty (Dougherty). Dougherty had asked Varano to accompany him to court because he was “frightened.” (N.T., 9/24/96 at 34.) While at court, Trivigno made a snide comment to Dougherty to which Varano asked, “you got a problem?” <em>(Id. </em>at 35.) The exchange escalated and Trivigno threatened, “We will take care of it later.” <em>(Id.) </em>In the court appearances that followed, Varano and Trivigno continued to have heated words and according to Dougherty, on each occasion, Trivigno indicated that he would, “take care of it later.” <em>(Id. </em>at 40, 48, 45.)</p>
    <p id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.9",401,[143,1594,1157,688]],["BL_402.1",402,[311,239,1163,891]]]'>More than a year following the conclusion of the court proceedings, on December 9, 1995, at about 7:00 a.m., Varano and his wife, Cheryl, went to an alley near the intersection of Palethorpe and Lehigh Streets in North Philadelphia to buy heroin (Palethorpe is a small street near Second and Lehigh). They had been going to this location on a daily basis for several months before the incident. According to the trial testimony of Cheryl Varano, her husband parked their red GEO, in a parking lot next to Palethorpe Street and he then walked up to a nearby alley to buy drugs. After a few moments, Cheryl Varano heard two or three gunshots and she saw her husband come back to the car, holding his hand over his stomach and saying, “Hon, I got shot, I got shot.” (N.T., <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>9/25/96 at 135.) He got into the car and slumped over the steering wheel. Cheryl Varano saw Trivigno run toward the car, approach the passenger side, point his gun at her, and shoot her through the car window. As she defensively placed her arm to cover her head, the bullet traveled through her hand and grazed the side of her head, above her eye. Trivigno then reached through the broken passenger side window and shot her husband in the head, killing him. Trivigno ran from the car, but came back, attempting to shoot Cheryl Varano again, but the gun did not fire. After the gun misfired several times, Trivigno fled back up Palethorpe Street, got into a car and drove away. During this entire ordeal, Cheryl Varano had a clear view of Trivigno, as he was mere feet away from her when he shot her and her husband in the car. About five days after the shooting, Cheryl Varano picked Trivigno out of a photo array and testified at trial that she had no doubt that he was the man who shot her and her husband.</p>
    <p id="b402-5" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[308,1163,1177,1112]],["BL_403.1",403,[143,255,1153,146]]]'>That morning gunfire awoke many residents on Palethorpe Street. Mildred Rivera (Rivera) testified that she was on the second floor of her home when she heard the shots. She saw a man, who she later positively identified as Trivigno, running on Palethorpe Street towards a red car, shooting. Rivera opened her window and stuck her head out to get a better view. She went on to testify that she had a good view of Trivigno given that the situation occurred about two doors from her own home and at one point Trivigno looked directly up at the location where she was peering out of her window. Rivera saw Trivigno approach the car, break the “windshield,”. stick his whole hand inside the car and shoot Varano, who she saw sitting in the driver’s seat. (N.T., 9/24/96 at 76.) Rivera stated that Trivigno left, then came back, and started firing at Cheryl Varano, who was still sitting in the passenger side of the car. Rivera heard the gun misfire, stating that it went “click, click.” <em>(Id.) </em>She saw Trivigno leave the scene and proceed back towards Lehigh Street, where a “Cadillac with yellow tags” was waiting for him. <em>(Id. </em>at 78.) Trivigno got into the car and it sped away. On cross-examination, defense counsel elicited that Rivera was uncertain about the make of <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the car, but that it looked like a Cadillac and she was unsure whether the car was white or beige. Rivera stated that on the morning in question it was snowing, so the car looked white.</p>
    <p id="b403-5" data-blocks='[["BL_403.5",403,[142,427,1157,1004]]]'>Another resident, Jose Romon (Romon), testified that he heard people shouting, and he looked out his second floor window. He saw a man shoot another man, then run down Palethorpe Street, past his house down to Lehigh Street, jump into a Lincoln and speed away down Lehigh towards Front Street. Although unable positively to identify the shooter, Romon could get the license plate number of the car, AVB 7336, which he yelled to his wife, Betsey Colon (Colon), who wrote down the numbers of the license. Romon also stated that he recognized the driver of the car, but that person was not in the courtroom. Romon testified that the car he saw was a medium or light brown Lincoln. Romon stated that he was “100 percent” sure that the car was a Lincoln, because he was a mechanic, who had done auto body work. (N.T., 9/25/96 at 29-30.) When asked to point to a color that resembled the car color that he saw, he identified a burgundy colored briefcase. Colon also testified, verifying the license plate number that she had written down was AVB 7336 and that she saw the plate number and she saw the man hop into the getaway car.</p>
    <p id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[140,1455,1156,844]],["BL_404.1",404,[322,255,1157,306]]]'>Detective Santiago, the homicide police detective who conducted the investigation, testified that he traced the license plate number that Romon and his wife had written down to a burgundy Lincoln, registered at 333 Daly Street and owned by a Philip Bastile (Bastile). However, the car led back to Trivigno. Detective Santiago determined that a Lincoln with the license plate number AVB 7336 had accumulated a number of tickets around the comer from the street where Trivigno lived with his grandmother and also near a jewelry shop that Trivigno’s father owned and where Trivigno worked in December of 1995. Further, Trivigno’s sister lived at 333 Daly Street, the address where the car was registered, but when Detective Santiago went to that address he received no information regarding Bastile. Additional investigation suggested that Trivigno’s father (Trivigno, Sr.) had sold the car to Bastile. However, when asked about information concerning <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>Bastile, Trivigno Sr. gave conflicting stories concerning his identity, and no information as to his location. Detective Santiago testified that Trivigno Sr. told him that he met Bastile at his store, and that Bastile was a homeless man who had a diamond worth $10,000, which he wanted to trade for a car to use as his home.</p>
    <p id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.5",404,[321,594,1162,853]]]'>At trial Trivigno, Sr. gave a completely different version of the sale of the car at issue. He testified that in January of 1995 he owned a 1988 burgundy Lincoln sedan, but that he transferred it to Bastile. He stated that, at the time of the sale, he was aware that the vehicle would be registered to a man living at his daughter’s address. Trivigno, Sr. described the man as looking like his son. Trivigno, Sr. testified that he, his son and Bastile went to the establishment to transfer ownership of the automobile, however, Trivigno, Sr. could not recall any specific details of the deal. He gave conflicting details of where the transaction took place (on either Girard Avenue or Baltimore Avenue) and indicated that Bastile drove a car to the location. The police did extensive investigation and found no record that Bastille ever existed.. Undoubtedly, the jury was left with the impression that it was Trivigno’s Lincoln that was the getaway car.</p>

Both positively identified Trivigno as the man they saw follow Varano and shoot him in the head after Varano fled to his car. Both of these witnesses also saw Trivigno fire at Cheryl Varano; and, other witnesses placed what the jury could undoubtedly conclude was Trivigno’s car at the scene of the crime. These facts establish that Trivigno shot and killed Varano and that he did so in a deliberate and intentional manner.

Further, at trial, the police testified concerning extensive efforts to locate Bastile; and, there was absolutely no record or other evidence that Bastile ever existed.

These alleged contradictions are not significant. While Rivera testified that the car Trivigno drove away in probably was a white or beige Cadillac, she said she was not certain because it was snowing so that most of the car looked white. Further, although Romon, the witness who wrote the license plate down, testified initially that the car was medium or light brown, when asked more specifically, he indicated that it was the color of the attorney’s briefcase, which was burgundy (notably the color of Trivigno’s Lincoln). Romon, a mechanic who did auto body repair, was a particularly believable witness on the identification of the car. At the time of the shooting, he told the police that he was 100 percent certain that the automobile was a Lincoln. He was at the best vantage point on Palethorpe Street to observe the vehicle as it <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>sped away (Rivera was closer to where the shooting took place and Romon was closer to where Trivigno ran and jumped into the getaway car).</p>

Also, it is not significant that Romon and Rivera, who both needed interpreters during the trial, indicated in English that the car color was beige or light brown, whereas the color of Trivigno’s was burgundy. Particularly here, where when shown an actual color with which to compare the car’s color, Romon was able to say that the burgundy briefcase was the closet color to the car he saw on December 9,1995.</p>

When first called to the stand, Romon began by quickly stating only that he saw a car drive away, and he heard some screams. The prosecutor then confronted Romon with his earlier statement that he had given to police shortly after the shooting. In this statement, he told the police that he saw two men arguing and then one man pulled a gun, shot the other man and fled in a Lincoln. Romon further indicated in this statement to police that he saw the car’s license plate. Romon, after being confronted with the statement and after obtaining a Spanish interpreter, adopted his earlier statement to the police. In the course of the cross-examination, the district attorney questioned Romon as to why he had previously stated that all he saw was a car going away. In that context, the prosecutor asked Romon whether “anybody approached” or “threatened” or “offered [him] money or any consideration in order to withhold testimony.” (N.T., 9/24/96 at 32-33.) Romon denied any of this and testified simply that he had been nervous.</p>

The South Carolina death penalty statute at issue in <em>Simmons </em>required the jury to first decide eligibility by reference to whether one or.more statutorily prescribed aggravating circumstances existed. Where an aggravator was present (and thus eligibility established), the jury made the selection determination, in the course of which it was expressly permitted to consider “additional evidence in extenuation, mitigation, or aggravation of the punishment.” <em>See </em>S.C.Code Ann. § 16-3-20(B). Thus, as the Court in <em>Simmons </em>explained, South Carolina’s “evidence in aggravation is not limited to statutory aggravating circumstances.” <em>Simmons, </em><a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="134" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">512 U.S. at 162</a>,114 S.Ct. at 2193.</p>

    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[322,742,1159,515]]]'>In short, the prosecution did not argue future dangerousness and, even if it did, appellant never requested, nor was he “refused,” a <em>Simmons </em>instruction. Appellant never argued to the trial court that the prosecutor argued future dangerousness and, therefore, he was entitled to a <em>Simmons </em>charge. The majority has vacated a valid sentence of death premised upon an argument unsupported in the record and never raised at the penalty hearing. Because I can discern no error in the trial court’s rulings at the penalty phase, I would affirm the sentence of death.</p>

Martin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="554 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="765961" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0331-01">554 Pa. 331</a>, <a href="/a2d/721/0763-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="721 A.2d 763" data-case-ids="11794952,11795060,765961,765969" data-case-paths="/a2d/721/0763-01,/a2d/721/0763-02,/pa/554/0331-01,/pa/554/0330-01">721 A.2d 763</a>, 785 (1998), the majority states that, “the defendant should be entitled to have the jury aware of what statistical possibility exists that a life sentence imposed on him would result in commutation.” I believe that the Court significantly errs by requiring consideration of statistics concerning recent commutations. Once we start down that path, the next logical step is to examine what happened to those whose life sentences were commuted. Thus, the Commonwealth should be able to request that the jury be informed about Reginald McFadden, a convicted murderer and model prisoner who, upon commuta<a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>tion and release, went on to kill again, or any other horror story involving a commuted killer. The defense would then counter with the number of commuted killers who, at least to date, had proven to be productive members of society. None of this extraneous information, it seems to me, is an appropriate consideration for a capital jury. The pertinent information is that, in Pennsylvania today, life means life without the prospect of parole, but the possibility of commutation exists.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[144,699,1158,1285]]]'>Furthermore, the majority’s requirement of evidence of recent commutation statistics immediately calls to mind Mark Twain’s aphorism, which he attributed to Benjamin Disraeli, that “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.” Mark Twain, Autobiography of Mark Twain 286 (Charles Neider ed., Harper Perennial 1990). What puts Twain’s “lie” to the statistics required by the majority is that evidence of the percentage of recent commutations has little relevance in determining the “statistical possibility” of commutation for any particular life-sentenced defendant. Commutation decisions are necessarily fact-driven. The fact that a certain percentage of other defendants, from widely differing backgrounds, charged with a wide variety of offenses, have, or have not, had their sentences commuted says little about the prospects for any other defendant. Furthermore, past commutation percentages are hardly the only, or even the most important, predictor of future commutation prospects. No commutation scheme, or history, is impervious to change. Times change, state legislatures change, and governors change. It is impossible to forecast in any way approaching reliability the commutation prospects of a life-sentenced prisoner fifty years from now, or forty years from now, or even next year. At a minimum, under the majority’s scheme, the jury should also have to be informed of this political reality.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

In <em>May, </em>this Court held that the Commonwealth's pursuit of the multiple violent felony aggravating circumstances did not implicate future dangerousness, because "[t]he aggravating circumstances of appellant's prior record for violent felonies addressed only appellant’s past conduct, not his future dangerousness.” <em>May, </em>551 Pa. at 291, 710 <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>A.2d at 47.

Although appellant made no further objection, the trial court interrupted the prosecutor again and <em>sua sponte </em>issued a further cautionary charge that, in effect, ordered the jury to find the presence of the insignificant criminal history mitigating circumstance, instructing the jury that: "[s]ignificant history means that you have two or more violent crimes prior to the incident, and that is what significant history means.” N.T. 10/1/96 at 49. This instruction, which assumes that the violent felony aggravating circumstance mirrored the insignificant criminal history mitigating circumstance, was clearly erroneous and benefited appellant.</p>
