A plaintiff who settles or is awarded a judgment between September 1 and August 31 of a calendar year will be paid by the CAT Fund on December 31 of that following year.

The CAT Fund filed preliminary objections in both actions claiming that the CAT Fund is not authorized by the Healthcare Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. § 1301.101 <em>et seq. </em>(Act), to acknowledge and participate in the assignments between CAT Fund plaintiffs and Legal Capital and further, that the CAT Fund is entitled to sovereign immunity because Legal Capital failed to allege a cause of action that falls within one of the statutory exceptions to sovereign immunity. The Commonwealth Court sustained the CAT Fund’s preliminary objections holding that the CAT Fund lacks statutory authority to participate in the assignment transactions and that the CAT Fund is an executive agency entitled to sovereign immunity because this action does not fall within any of the exceptions to sovereign immunity. We disagree with both holdings and therefore reverse.</p>

      <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>The CAT Fund initially contends that the Act does not authorize it either to participate in or to acknowledge the assignment of portions of medical malpractice settlements or judgments. Specifically, the CAT Fund argues that its statutory mandate is to pay all awards, judgments and settlements against health care providers when those awards, judgments or settlements exceed the health care providers’ primary insurance coverage. 40 P.S. § 1301.701(d). As such, the CAT Fund asserts that its objective is the protection of <em>claimants </em>in medical malpractice actions. A “[claimant” is defined in the Act as “a patient and includes a patient’s immediate family, guardian, personal representative or estate.” 40 P.S. § 1301.103. This definition, the CAT Fund urges, does not include or contemplate an assignee such as Legal Capital. Relying on <em>Judge v. Allentown and Sacred Heart Hospital Center, </em>78 Pa. Cmwlth. 373, <a href="/citations/?q=467%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="467 A.2d 899">467 A.2d 899</a> (1983), <em>rev’d on other grounds, </em><a href="/pa/506/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="506 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="1790927" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0636-01">506 Pa. 636</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="506 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="1790927" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0636-01">487 A.2d 817</a> (1985), the CAT Fund asserts that it may only exercise those powers that have been expressly conferred upon it by clear and unmistakable language. Because the Act does not specifically authorize the CAT Fund to participate in or to acknowledge assignments of awards in malpractice actions, the CAT Fund argues that it is prohibited from doing so.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[325,1497,1160,796]],["BL_505.1",505,[143,247,1155,463]]]'>Legal Capital counters that the assignment transactions do not require the CAT Fund’s participation as the CAT Fund is not a party to the assignments; rather, the CAT Fund is merely asked to acknowledge that the valid assignments exist by paying directly to Legal Capital the amounts to which Legal Capital is entitled under valid assignments. We are persuaded by Legal Capital’s reasoning that, as a non-party to the assignment transactions, the CAT Fund is not a participant in the transactions. Indeed, by the time Legal Capital informs the CAT Fund of the assignment, the assignment transaction has already been completed. Therefore, this Court is not required to determine whether the Act permits the CAT Fund to participate in the assignment transactions. Legal Capital argues further that nothing in the Act prohibits the CAT Fund from acknowledging the assignments and <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>paying directly to Legal Capital the assigned amounts. Legal Capital is certainly correct that there is no statutory provision prohibiting the CAT Fund from acknowledging the assignments or making payments to Legal Capital as the assignee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Nor does the Act specifically prohibit a successful plaintiff from assigning the proceeds of a medical malpractice action. <em>Cf.

Moxham National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/548/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="548 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="960595" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0394-01">548 Pa. 394</a>, 406, <a href="/a2d/697/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="697 A.2d 577" data-case-ids="12017497,12017615,960441,960595" data-case-paths="/a2d/697/0577-01,/a2d/697/0577-02,/pa/548/0393-02,/pa/548/0394-01">697 A.2d 577</a>, 583 (1997). Here, medical malpractice plaintiffs and/or their attorneys legitimately assigned their rights to settlement funds or awards to Legal Capital in exchange for immediate payment of cash.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Applying common law principles of assignment, an assignment to Legal Capital extinguishes the assignor’s right to payment from the CAT Fund and transfers that right to Legal Capital. The CAT Fund’s refusal to recognize the legal ramifications of the assignments and its refusal to pay Legal Capital interferes both with the contractual relationship between Legal Capital and the assigning plaintiffs as well as with Legal Capital’s property rights. In addition, this refusal burdens the assign- or’s own right to transfer his interest in a settlement or judgment. Because the Act does not prohibit either the assignment of settlements or awards or the CAT "Fund from <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>acknowledging the assignments and making payment directly to the assignee, the CAT Fund is obligated to pay the assigned settlements and awards to Legal Capital.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[314,429,1162,898]]]'>The CAT Fund’s second argument is that, as an executive agency of the Commonwealth, it is entitled to sovereign immunity pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8501. To the extent that Legal Capital only seeks declaratory judgment that Legal Capital has a right to receive the assigned funds and that the CAT Fund has an obligation to pay the funds to Legal Capital, sovereign immunity does not apply because it is not applicable to declaratory judgment actions. <em>See Wilkinsburg Police Officers Ass’n v.

Sovereign immunity applies only where the action filed seeks to compel affirmative action on the part of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth agency or to obtain money damages; it does not apply where the plaintiff seeks to restrain the agency from performing an affirmative act. <em>Wilkinsburg, </em><a href="/pa/535/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="535 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="1841502" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0425-01">535 Pa. at 430-31</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="636 A.2d 134" data-case-ids="1841502,1841546,7353721,7353866" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0425-01,/pa/535/0424-01,/a2d/636/0134-01,/a2d/636/0134-02">636 A.2d at 137</a>. Clearly, Legal • Capital does not seek to obtain money damages from the CAT Fund itself in the instant action. The funds that Legal Capital seeks are funds the CAT Fund is already affirmatively <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>obligated to pay. The sole issue is to whom those funds should be paid. Therefore, sovereign immunity does not bar the instant action on that basis.</p>
    <p id="b507-4" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[142,432,1156,529]]]'>The CAT Fund contends that Legal Capital is seeking to compel the CAT Fund to take affirmative action and pay the assigned funds to Legal Capital. Legal Capital, on the other hand, argues that it is only attempting to restrain the CAT Fund from paying the wrong party. We agree with Legal Capital that the goal in the instant action is to restrain the CAT Fund from paying the assigning plaintiffs or counsel rather than an action to compel any affirmative act on the part of the CAT Fund. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not bar Legal Capital’s action.</p>
    <p id="b507-5" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[141,989,1158,310]]]'>Accordingly, the orders of the Commonwealth Court sustaining the CAT Fund’s preliminary objections are reversed, and Legal Capital’s complaints for equitable relief and declaratory judgment are reinstated.
