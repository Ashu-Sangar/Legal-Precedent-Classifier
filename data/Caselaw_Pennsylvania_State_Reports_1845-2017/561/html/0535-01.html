      <em>Mathews </em>presents three distinct factors to consider in examining the adequacy of procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. The first factor looks at the private interest that will be affected by official action. The second assesses the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures actually used and examines the value, if any, of additional or different procedural safeguards. The third examines the government’s interest, including any fiscal and administrative burdens that additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail. <em>Mathews, </em><a href="/us/424/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="424 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="12026449" data-case-paths="/us/424/0319-01">424 U.S. at 335</a>, <a href="/us/424/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="424 U.S. 319" data-case-ids="12026449" data-case-paths="/us/424/0319-01">96 S.Ct. at 903</a>.</p>

Therefore, the basis on <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>which disciplinary action could be taken was uncontested. Telang also had the opportunity to present witnesses, and chose his treating psychotherapist to testify as an expert witness. With regard to the sanction to be imposed, both Telang and his expert testified as to mitigating factors to be considered. Slowinski recommended that, rather than suspend Telang, he be allowed to continue practicing while undergoing therapy but that he be constantly monitored when seeing patients. In addition, Slowinski recommended regular reporting and patient feedback on Telang. Finding that Slowinski’s opinion was based in part on the unverified history from Telang himself that the abuse of record against the New Jersey patient was Telang’s only incident of misconduct, the Hearing Examiner decided that constant monitoring was inadequate, and imposed a minimum three-year suspension.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Telang appealed to the Medical Board.</p>

Thus, it was the sole task of the Medical Board to determine what sanction, including possible revocation, fit the offense, which the Medical Board had full and final statutory authority to do. 63 P.S. § 422.41(4). Based on the record, the Hearing Examiner herself could have properly revoked Telang’s license. Simply because the Medical Board, and not the Hear<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>ing Examiner, revoked Telang’s license does not warrant adding to the procedural due process already afforded Telang by giving him additional notice and a second hearing to argue his fitness to practice.

In making its ruling, the Medical Board merely assessed the seriousness of Telang’s offense differently than the Hearing Examiner did on the same undisputed facts. This is the Medical Board’s prerogative. A second hearing would merely reiterate the facts already undisputed, duplicating the function of the Hearing Examiner and needlessly consuming time and resources. State Medical Board’s Adjudication and Order, June 24, 1997 at 3 (adopting the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Hearing Examiner). Moreover, at the hearing, Telang availed himself of ample opportunity to present evidence aimed at mitigating any allowable sanctions. Therefore, a second evidentiary hearing nets mere surplusage at the expense of an unwarranted duplication of the Hearing Examiner’s efforts.
