The Commonwealth, however, is not a guarantor of the safety of the highway, but is only exposed to liability for dangerous conditions thereof.

Mr. Justice Nigro’s dissenting opinion asserts that a guardrail is an “obvious part of the highway.” Dissenting opinion at 1135. Accepting this proposition as true does not change the outcome of this case, as the Commonwealth is only liable for <em>dangerous </em>conditions not <em>all </em>conditions of a highway. Following the dissent's position to its logical conclusion would expose the Commonwealth to unlimited liability, a result clearly not intended by the legislature in enacting the sovereign immunity statute. The dissenting opinion also queries why the Commonwealth would ever erect a guardrail if it does not affect the safety of <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>the road for travel. Such inquiry is deceptive as the determination of whether a guardrail "affects the safety of the road" is totally unrelated to the legal issue of whether the absence of a guardrail renders a highway a <em>dangerous condition </em>and therefore subjects the Commonwealth to liability under the real estate exception to sovereign immunity-</p>

If, as the majority contends, the absence of a guardrail does not affect the safety of the road for travel, I question why the Commonwealth would ever place a guardrail on a highway in the first place. For example, in the instant case, it seems clear that an appropriately placed guardrail at the scene of the accident would have stopped Mr. Bell’s truck from sliding over the embankment and therefore, would have prevented the serious injuries incurred by Ms. Dean.</p>
