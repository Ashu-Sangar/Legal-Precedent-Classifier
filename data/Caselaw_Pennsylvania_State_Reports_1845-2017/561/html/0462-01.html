We granted the Borough’s petition for allowance of appeal to address the issue of the standard to be applied to claims for workers’ compensation benefits when the claimant asserts that a psychic injury is manifested through both psychic and physical symptoms. We hold that where a psychic injury is claimed, regardless of whether it is manifested through psychic symptoms alone or physical symptoms as well, the claimant must establish that the injury arose from abnormal working conditions in order to recover benefits. We reverse the Commonwealth Court’s order in this case and reinstate the Board’s order denying benefits.</p>

Davis asserted that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and specific work inhibition as a result of <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>repeated stressful and life-threatening experiences during the course of his duties as a police officer.</p>
    <p id="b630-4" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[317,357,1166,985]]]'>At the hearing before the workers’ compensation judge (WCJ), Davis testified that he had been hired as a police officer by the Borough in July of 1960. The population of the Borough of Swarthmore was approximately 5,900, including 1,300 college students, while the size of the Borough was one plus square miles. The Borough’s police force consisted of eight officers, including the chief of police, a sergeant, a corporal and five patrol officers. In May of 1971, Davis was promoted to the position of sergeant. As the sergeant, Davis was the second in command after the chief of police. His responsibilities included patrol functions, supervisory functions and investigative functions. The Borough did not have a separate detective division, and the responsibility for criminal investigations was given to the sergeant. The responsibility for supervising the police officers during the three eight-hour shifts was divided among the chief of police who worked the 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift, the sergeant who worked the 4 p.m. to midnight shift, and the corporal who worked the midnight to 8 a.m. shift.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[314,1376,1163,352]]]'>For twenty years, Davis performed the functions assigned to him as the sergeant. On June 16,1991, the Borough’s chief of police died unexpectedly of a heart attack. . Mayor G. Guy Smith issued an order four days later naming Davis, the ranking officer, as the officer in command of the police force. Davis remained in the position for a period of only four months.</p>
    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.7",630,[313,1761,1164,519]],["BL_631.1",631,[132,247,1155,201]]]'>Donald Lee was designated as the chief of police on October 15, 1991. Lee, then a 28-year veteran of the Swarthmore Police Department, had been Davis’s close friend and partner on the police force. Lee testified on behalf of Davis that the functions performed by Davis were normal things that would be required of a detective sergeant in a town the size of Swarthmore. He further testified that he had not noticed any specific incident during their years together that triggered any change in Davis’s conduct, but felt that Davis’s position as second in command caused Davis to feel that his loyalty was <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>torn between the patrol officers and the chief of police. He discussed the fact that Davis had married and divorced twice, stating that Davis’s marital difficulties did not affect his ability to carry out police functions.</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[130,476,1158,583]]]'>It was not until Davis assumed the responsibilities of the chief of police that Lee obseived a change in Davis. Lee testified that Davis demonstrated that he was incapable of being the police chief or acting chief. He described Davis as an acting chief who had difficulty making decisions that affected the police department. Davis also had difficulty dealing with officers under his command and with issuing orders to the patrolmen. Lee became so concerned about Davis’s inability to command that he spoke to Mayor Smith on several occasions. Mayor Smith asked Lee to check on Davis because he was concerned about Davis’s health and well being.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.6",631,[131,1087,1154,310]]]'>Mayor Smith, who also testified on behalf of Davis, felt that Davis had become paralyzed by his role as police chief. He stated that “it wasn’t like he was making bad decisions; he simply wasn’t making any decisions.” Mayor Smith indicated that he would have discussions with Davis about getting certain tasks done, minor or major, without any results.</p>
    <p id="b631-6" data-blocks='[["BL_631.7",631,[129,1426,1156,471]]]'>In October 1991, Mayor Smith recommended that Davis take vacation leave, which Davis did. Shortly thereafter, Lee informed Mayor Smith that he did not think Davis would be able to perform his functions as police chief. Mayor Smith concurred in this assessment and recommended to the Public Safety Committee of the Borough Council that Davis be allowed to go out on disability retirement. The recommendation was accepted, and Davis began receiving a disability pension as of May 1, 1992.</p>
    <p id="b631-7" data-blocks='[["BL_631.8",631,[129,1926,1154,366]],["BL_632.1",632,[326,253,1161,628]]]'>Davis testified that between June and October 1991, he noticed that he was not sleeping well, that “it seemed like his strength was being zapped,” and that his blood pressure was up. Davis did not attribute the changes to his appointment as the acting police chief. Instead, Davis recounted several stressful incidents that had occurred during the course of his 31-year career. The first incident happened approximately 27 <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>years earlier, in 1964 or 1965. Another officer had gone into a house and was confronted in the basement by a young man who was armed. Davis, who was the back up officer, began negotiations with the man and was able to convince him to put his weapon down. When Davis went to pick up the weapon, the man pulled out another weapon, pointed it at his face and started to pull the trigger. Davis caught the hammer of the weapon before it fell and wrestled the gun away from him. The disarmed man was then arrested. Davis testified that he continually dreamed about the incident, but that it was not until he underwent psychiatric treatment that he remembered the incident itself.</p>
    <p id="b632-4" data-blocks='[["BL_632.5",632,[326,930,1161,581]]]'>Davis testified regarding another incident which occurred in 1965 or 1966 when he became involved in a high speed pursuit of robbery suspects. During the course of the pursuit, Davis fired his weapon at a suspect for the first time in his career. Davis also related two other incidents in his career when he fired his weapon at suspects. Davis further testified about the 1974 arrest of a member of the Pagan motorcycle gang for attempted murder. Davis testified that the police chief informed him that unknown sources had threatened to shoot him and his family to prevent him from testifying at trial. Other than the reported threat, no incident occurred.</p>
    <p id="b632-5" data-blocks='[["BL_632.6",632,[323,1553,1163,742]]]'>The only incident that was not remote in time occurred in January 1991. Davis responded to a call from Swarthmore College security officers for assistance in handling a group of 25 people he described as <em>“a </em>bunch of neo nazis.” Davis called for assistance and confronted the group, along with four unarmed college security officers. No weapons were visible, but Davis ordered them to lay down whatever weapons they had within five minutes. The group lined up, refusing to comply. Faced with a standoff, Davis did not know what to do next. He was not attacked by any member of the group. When four other police officers responded to his call for assistance, 22 members of the group were arrested. The police officers recovered baseball bats, chains, knives, and tear gas — none of which was used or displayed during the incident.</p>

      <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>Davis also testified that as a police officer he was required to undergo annual firearms training. He described himself as an expert shooter and well-versed in handguns. During his last qualification on the shooting range, Davis had to go through three rounds before he was qualified. Davis testified as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b633-4" data-blocks='[["BL_633.5",633,[181,584,1107,96]]]'>Q. Explain what the qualification involves and why you had to go through it three times.</blockquote>

    <p id="b633-10" data-blocks='[["BL_633.11",633,[137,1367,1155,309]]]'>Nor did Davis describe his experience as the acting police chief. He did not acknowledge any problems with assuming command of the officers. Davis testified only that when he took leave time in October of 1991, he experienced difficulties with sleeping. Davis consulted his family physician, who eventually referred him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Sol Radish.</p>
    <p id="b633-11" data-blocks='[["BL_633.12",633,[138,1709,1155,583]],["BL_634.1",634,[321,249,1161,94]]]'>Dr. Radish testified that he first saw Davis on January 30, 1992. Dr. Radish diagnosed Davis as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and specific work inhibition. Post-traumatic stress disorder was defined to include when a person has experienced, witnessed or been confronted with an event that is life threatening or threatening to the person’s or another’s personal or physical integrity, and the event evokes fear, horror or helplessness. Dr. Radish explained specific work inhibition as Davis’s inability to return to work and fear of returning to work because of his stress symptoms. Dr. Radish was of the opinion that the accumulation of events <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>experienced by Davis from 1965 until 1991 was the cause of Davis’s psychic injury.</p>

He becomes nervous. He has generalized muscle twitching with aches and pains. He has flashbacks and reliving experiences of these various stressors that occurred during his duty as a police officer and most significantly, his right-hand shakes. When he writes a check or holds a glass of water, his right hand feels tremulous and he feels very unsteady and, in fact, since he was sent out of work on October 23rd, 1991, he has not touched his revolver.</blockquote>

    <p id="b634-7" data-blocks='[["BL_634.8",634,[315,1098,1161,526]]]'>Davis’s counsel asked Dr. Kadish for his expert opinion as to whether the right hand tremors were related to Davis’s psychic injury. The Borough’s counsel objected to Dr. Kadish rendering an expert opinion as to the cause of Davis’s right hand tremors because Dr. Kadish had not been qualified as an orthopedic expert or qualified as an expert with regard to the physical components of Davis’s claim, as compared to the psychic components. The Borough’s counsel further asserted that no foundation had been laid that Dr. Kadish had ever performed a physical examination of Davis.</p>

Dr. Kadish testified that there was a direct temporal connection between the onset of Davis’s hand tremors and an event that occurred while at work as a police officer. Dr. Kadish based his opinion on two events related to him by Davis, i.e. that Davis’s hand shook sometime in 1986 after the arrest of an individual for murder and in 1993 when Davis’s “right hand shook so badly that he <em>uncharacteristically </em>had to try three <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>times before he could just barely qualify to continue his duties.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
    <p id="b635-4" data-blocks='[["BL_635.5",635,[136,383,1156,311]]]'>On cross-examination, Dr. Kadish testified that he had not conducted a physical examination, neurological examination, or orthopedic examination of Davis.

Dr. Rieger did not conduct any psychological or psychiatric tests. He diagnosed Davis as suffering from an adjustment disorder with anxious mood. Dr. Rieger concluded that Davis was a man who simply suffered from job burn-out.</p>
    <p id="b635-6" data-blocks='[["BL_635.7",635,[132,1087,1161,1012]]]'>The WCJ awarded benefits to Davis, finding that “[a]s of October 23, 1991, Claimant suffered and continues to suffer, from a bona-fide psychiatric illness, which was caused by the abnormal objective working conditions imposed upon Claimant by Defendant in June, 1991.” The WCJ found that in June, 1991, Davis’s usual police duties had changed because he was instructed to perform the duties of the police chief in addition to his regular police duties, and that between June 1991 and October 1991, Davis had to fill in vacant patrol shifts himself because of manpower shortages. The WCJ did not specifically rule on the Borough’s objection to the competency of Dr.. Kadish to testily regarding the cause of Davis’s right hand tremors, but relied upon his expert opinion in concluding that Davis “had developed physical impairments as a result of his job-related stress, including a right-hand tremor which directly affected his ability to continue to perform his employment duties.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The WCJ also found that during Davis’s 31 year employment as a police officer, Davis had experienced numerous stressful and life-threatening incidents.</p>

The Board discussed three categories of claims involving a psychological component: (1) psychological stimulus causing physical injury (mental/physical); (2) physical stimulus causing psychic injury (physical/mental); and (3) psychological stimulus causing psychic injury (mental/mental). Davis’s claim was categorized by the Board as a psychological stimulus causing a psychic injury. The Board determined that Davis had failed to establish that abnormal working conditions had caused his psychic injury as required to recover benefits. The Board found that Davis’s working conditions were not unusually stressful for police work, stating,</p>

    <p id="b636-6" data-blocks='[["BL_636.7",636,[323,1169,1161,891]]]'>On appeal to the Commonwealth Court, Davis raised two issues for review: (1) whether Davis’s physical symptoms were a result of work-related stress justifying a finding that Davis suffered a compensable injury; and (2) whether Davis’s work-related stress resulting from normal working conditions was sufficient to constitute a compensable injury. The Commonwealth Court reversed the Board’s decision, concluding that Davis did not have to establish that his injury was caused by abnormal working conditions. The court reasoned that because Davis had introduced evidence that he was exposed to a psychological stress that caused him to suffer a distinct physical injury, i.e. right hand tremor, Davis was not required to prove abnormal working conditions. The court held that Davis was required to prove only that the psychological stress of normal working conditions caused a physical injury, stating that “he is not saddled with the heightened burden of proving an abnormal working condition.” (Slip opinion at 6.)</p>

The workers’ compensation shorthand for these are known as 1) physical/mental (where a physical stimulus causes a psychic injury) 2) mental/mental (where a psychological stimulus causes a psychic injury), and 3) mental/physieal (where a psychological stimulus causes a physical injury). <em>Volterano v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Traveler’s Insurance Co.), </em><a href="/pa/536/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="536 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1843181" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0335-01">536 Pa. 335</a>, 345, <a href="/pa/536/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="639 A.2d 453" data-case-ids="1843181,7861305" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0335-01,/a2d/639/0453-01">639 A.2d 453</a>, 457-57 (1994). Thus, in examining a claimant’s petition, the element to the left of the slash mark indicates, very simply, what <em>happened </em>at the workplace; that is, what “befell” the employee such that he alleges he sustained a disability and cannot perform the job he was doing before something work-related happened. The effect on him, whether it be a disease, an affliction, a condition, a handicap, an illness, a death, (in other words, the harm done to his body) is expressed by the term following, or to the right of, the slash mark.

Specifically, <em>Martin </em>requires that a claimant prove that he suffered a psychic work-related injury and that such injury is other than a subjective reaction to normal working conditions. In <em>Martin, </em>the injured employee endured stress on the job and ultimately committed suicide. The claim was deemed “mental/mental,” and the two-pronged test was therefore appropriate. Here, however, the WCJ found the testimony of Davis’s medical expert to be “credible, and convincing” and furthermore found the testimony of the Borough’s medical expert to be equivocal, unconvincing and <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>not credible. The WCJ found that Davis suffered from “psychiatric illness” <em>as well as </em>“physical impairments ... including a right-hand tremor” and “loss of sleep, shortness of breath, chest pressure and palpitations, muscle twitching, with aches and pains ...” which directly affected his ability to continue to perform his employment duties. The Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Board) reversed, finding that Davis’s claim should have been considered under the mental/mental paradigm requiring a showing of abnormál working conditions, and that the tremor was not sufficient as a physical injury to change the paradigm to mental/physical requiring a reduced burden of proof. Accepting the findings of the WCJ,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> the Commonwealth Court characterized Davis’s claim as mental/physical and reinstated the grant of benefits finding that Davis had met the mental/physical burden of proof regarding the hand tremors.

Based on the majority’s present analysis, it in effect has eliminated the mental/physical paradigm. According to the majority’s interpretation, despite case law to the contrary, a heart attack,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> angina, colitis,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> or an ischemic heart condition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> would be merely “related physical complaints” attendant to the stress reaction a claimant would suffer from workplace trauma or pressures. Thus, wherever the cause is psychological, I read the majority opinion as relabeling the physical injury as a psychological injury with “physical man<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>ifestations,” instead of recognizing that physical illness may result directly from a psychological workplace stimulus. I contend that, merely because the cause (the event at the workplace) of certain physical ailments may have a psychological component, the physical injury (the effect on the employee) is <em>not </em>metamorphosed into a psychological injury with physical manifestations and the subsequent burden of proof is <em>not </em>the two pronged <em>Martin </em>test. Instead, where, as here, a physical injury results from a psychological stimulus, the proper burden of proof is that articulated for a mental/physical claim under <em>Whiteside.</em>

The appellant in <em>Metropolitan Edison </em>claimed to be suffering from shift work maladaptation syndrome due to being rotated between day and night schedules for more than twenty years. This Court denied him disability benefits finding that the schedule rotations were a normal working condition of employment with Metropolitan Edison. In other words, we found that there were certain conditions of being employed that were just unavoidable (like having to report to a place a business, having to work a certain number of hours, and having to do so within an employer’s schedule) and cannot, alone, be considered triggers of either mental or physical work-related injury. The <em>Metropolitan Edison </em>Court merely considered the threshold' question of whether work shifts, an ordinary element of the job, could, in and of themselves, be deemed the cause of any workplace injury. I joined the majority opinion as I believed that being scheduled on or rotated between day and night shifts was not a cause or stimulus which could result in a compensable injury — mental or physical. It was not necessary, therefore, to determine whether shift work maladaptation syndrome was a physical or a mental condition as it was not compensable either way. We therefore did not assign a burden of proof to such a claim. <em><a href="/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20668323" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="1998 WL 668323">Id.</a> </em>at *6 n. 2, <a href="/a2d/718/0759-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="718 A.2d 759" data-case-ids="11687686,356200" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0759-01,/pa/553/0177-01">718 A.2d at </a>764 n. 2.
