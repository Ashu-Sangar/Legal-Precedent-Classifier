Rather, each presumes a certain meaning for the terms used by the parties. The Court in <em>Snellenburg Clothing, </em>for instance, understood “advance” to include by definition an expectation of repayment. Absent specific language or other evidence indicating that the parties gave a different meaning to the term, the Court applied this meaning in construing their agreement. This is the import of the Court’s statement that it felt “constrained to treat the advances strictly as such.” <a href="/pa/282/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="282 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1088358" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0065-01">282 Pa. at 68</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20309" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="127 A. 309">127 A. at 310</a>.

Rather, it is <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>more appropriate to recognize that such terms are neutral with respect to the issue of repayment beyond commissions earned, and courts should follow the rules of contract interpretation generally applicable when parties to a contract disagree as to the meaning of its terms. <em>See, e.g., Pritchard v.

To take but one example, as noted above one of the reasons offered in support of this approach is the assumption that such agreements are imposed by employers, who have superior bargaining position. This may be true in some or even many cases, but there is neither logical nor empirical basis for approaching any particular case with this preconception in mind. The mere fact that Banks Engineering operates as a corporation, for instance, does not justify the assumption that it thereby enjoyed superior bargaining power. The record indicates that Banks Engineering is a family corporation owned by Ed Banks, his wife, and their daughter. Moreover, it appears from the testimony of both Banks and Polons that they personally negotiated the terms of the agreement back and forth over a period of time, beginning with a draft produced by Banks. It was not a “take it or leave it” form presented for Polons’s signature. Indeed, Banks Engineering had not advertised for or otherwise solicited the services of a salesman. Rather, Polons approached Banks Engineering representing himself as an experienced salesman <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>in the area, Polons prepared the sales projections on which the anticipated commissions and amount of the draw were based, and Polons agreed to be compensated by straight commission rather than salary. We cite this evidence not to indicate what weight it should be given in deciding the case, but to demonstrate the fallacy of the decisional model which assumes a state of affairs that may or may not exist.</p>

Indeed, the circumstances of the present case belie the majority’s claim that Banks was not in the superior position. Regardless of appellee’s corporate status, his refusal to release Polon’s first paycheck unless he signed the addendum certainly seems to indicate that Banks was in a superior position in this relationship and that this was a “take it or leave it” proposition at that point.</p>

When the ... draw has been compensated for ... the full commission will be paid and the draw eliminated.” This language indicates that the anticipated repayments of advances, whether by commissions or other means, would occur during the expected life of the contract and not after its termination.

The contract explicitly provided that the draw and repayment of advances applied solely during the life of the contract. Additionally, the phrase “by other means” is irrelevant; it too only applied during the life of the contract. Had the addendum not failed for lack of consideration and been determined to be a proper modification of the contract, appellee’s argument might have been more convincing since the addendum expressly provided for repayment in the event of termination. However as the addendum failed, so must appellee’s argument. I do not believe that a remand is necessary, since the plain language of the agreement would refute any attempt to rebut the presumption.</p>

      <em>Snellenburg </em>stands for the proposition that, where the parties’ agreement fails to address whether a draw in excess of commissions earned is to be repaid to the employer, the employee is obligated to repay such draw. However, I maintain that the instant case has never been controlled by <em>Snellenburg </em>since the agreement between Banks and Polons did address the repayment. Moreover, as I believe the terms of the written contract between Banks and Polons does not provide for repayment of the draw beyond the termination of the contract, I see no reason to remand the case.</p>

Furthermore, the court recognizes that the parties have the right to make their own contract; it is not the function of the court to rewrite it or to give it a construction in conflict with the accepted and plain meaning of the language used. <em><a href="/pa-super/427/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="427 Pa.

    <p id="b812-4" data-blocks='[["BL_812.5",812,[320,820,1161,956]]]'>The contract between Banks Engineering and Michael Polons addressed the repayment of Polons’ draw, providing that “[t]his draw will continue until the commissions exceed the draw <em>and this contract is in effect </em>.... Once commissions exceed the draw ... payment will continue at the rate of the draw until the draw is compensated for by commissions ... or by other means. When the ... draw has been compensated for ... the full commission will be paid and the draw eliminated.” (Emphasis added). Thus, pursuant to the plain meaning of the contract’s terms, it is evident that Banks was entitled to reimbursement of its advances so long as Polons was still under the contract, but that the contract does not provide for reimbursement in the event of his termination. Insofar as the contract was drawn up by the employer, Banks Engineering, Banks was in the position to elaborate beyond the language it used if it so chose. We must therefore infer that Banks intended to address the repayment of Polons’ draw only to the extent that the contract expressed.</p>
    <p id="b812-5" data-blocks='[["BL_812.6",812,[318,1819,1162,473]]]'>Thus, I believe that the parties are bound by the terms of the contract between them, which does not provide for repayment of the draw except while the contract is in effect and, once Polons’ employment was terminated, so, too, was his obligation to continue to repay the draw. Therefore, based on the explicit language of the contract, I would find, without remanding for further consideration of evidence, that the plain terms of the contract has determined that Polons no longer has an obligation to repay the draw.</p>
