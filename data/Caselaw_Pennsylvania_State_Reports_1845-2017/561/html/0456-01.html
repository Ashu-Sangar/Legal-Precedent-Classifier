      <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>On April 21, 1995, CPA, a limited partnership, filed an application for a grading permit pursuant to Cranberry Township’s Grading Ordinance (“Ordinance”). While the application was pending, CPA began grading operations without a grading permit. On May 30, 1995, the Director of the Department of Code Administration of the Township denied the application for a grading permit because CPA failed to provide certain data required by the Ordinance. In addition, the Director issued a notice of violation and a stop work order, finding that CPA willfully violated the Ordinance. CPA filed an appeal with the Board from the permit denial, notice of violation and stop work order on June 27,1995. The next day, another attorney for CPA filed two separate appeals with the Board and the Zoning Hearing Board, challenging the validity of the Ordinance because it was never numbered, dated, signed or recorded.</p>

The Board found that the Ordinance was passed on July 16, 1987, and that it became effective on July 21, 1987. <em>See </em>Bd. of Supervisors Conclusions of Law, No. 59. Since the appeal was filed in 1995, well over the thirty day limit of § 5571(c)(5), the Board denied the appeal as untimely filed and the CPA subsequently appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
