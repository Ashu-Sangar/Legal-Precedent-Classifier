As the troopers neared the Pennsylvania-Delaware border, they observed a vehicle operated by Appellant, Stephen Sadvari (“Sadvari”), approach from behind at a high rate of speed, abruptly decelerate as it reached the rear of the police cruiser, then proceed past. The troopers began following, clocking Sadvari at approximately 60 miles per hour in a 45 mile per hour speed zone. Shortly after crossing the Pennsylvania-Delaware state line, the troopers activated their emergency lights, stopping Sadvari approximately four-tenths of a mile inside the state of Delaware. When one of the troopers requested Sadvari’s license and <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>registration, he smelled a strong odor of alcohol and noticed Sadvari’s slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. Upon questioning, Sadvari admitted drinking after work, at which point he was asked to step out of his vehicle and perform two field sobriety tests. Sadvari failed the tests and was arrested and transported to Riddle Memorial Hospital in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where blood samples were drawn for chemical testing. A subsequent analysis of the samples revealed a blood alcohol content of .16%. Sadvari was then taken to the State Police barracks near Media, Pennsylvania, and was ultimately released. On November 12, 1996, a criminal complaint was filed, charging Sadvari with driving under the influence of alcohol and exceeding the maximum speed limit. A preliminary hearing was held on January 9, 1997, following which the driving under the influence offense was held for court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

While the court agreed with Sadvari that he should have been taken before a Delaware justice of the peace as required by Section 1933 of the Delaware statute, it viewed this requirement as an extradition provision. Thus, the court concluded that suppression of the evidence was not appropriate, since the violation of Delaware law did not affect either the reliability of the evidence seized or Sadvari’s constitutional rights. Sadvari proceeded to a jury trial, was found guilty and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty days to twenty-three months. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed, reasoning that Section 1933 is an extradition statute to which the exclusionary rule does not apply, <em>see Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth, oh the other hand, maintains that Section 1933 is merely an extradition provision and that the failure to comply with it cannot render an initially lawful arrest unlawful.

Shaffer, </em>the Superior Court considered the propriety of an extraterritorial arrest of a Pennsylvania citizen that occurred in New York.

The Superior Court determined that a Pennsylvania officer has no inherent authority to effect an arrest in New York; rather, his authority to do so is derived from the New York close pursuit statute and is conditioned by the terms of such enactment upon timely validation by a New York court. Since the trooper did not take the defendant before a local criminal court, the Superior' Court deemed the arrest unlawful. <em>Shaffer, </em><a href="/a2d/710/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="710 A.2d 89" data-case-ids="11827725" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0089-01">710 A.2d at 91</a>. Further, the Superior Court found that, in light of the situs of the arrest in New York and the New York legislature’s designation of a procedure for review of such an arrest, the trooper’s noncompliance constituted an impingement upon New York’s jurisdiction and sovereignty. Given this concern, when it turned to the question of remedy, the <em>Shaffer </em>court held that suppression of the evidence was appropriate to ensure accountability of police officers in carrying out their duties. <em>See Shaffer, </em><a href="/a2d/710/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="710 A.2d 89" data-case-ids="11827725" data-case-paths="/a2d/710/0089-01">710 A.2d at </a>92 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

Additionally, the court rejected the Commonwealth’s argument that New York’s good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should apply, as the defendant was a Pennsylvania citizen and “it is for Pennsylvania to dictate how its police officers are to carry out their duties and the consequences for violating such dictates.” <em>Id. </em>at 92.</p>

The court found that New York’s close pursuit statute addresses the out-of-state officer’s <em>authority </em>to make the arrest, specifically requiring a New York court to determine whether its internal terms establishing the basis for such authority have been violated, whereas the Delaware statute contained no such requirement. <em>See Sadvari, </em><a href="/a2d/723/1044-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="723 A.2d 1044" data-case-ids="11774404" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/1044-01">723 A.2d at 1048</a>. The Superior Court also found that Section 1932 of the <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>Delaware statute negated an interpretation that would require a Delaware tribunal to pass upon the arresting officer’s compliance with the Delaware statute in the provision’s directive that “[t]his section shall not be construed so as to make unlawful any arrest in this State which would otherwise be lawful.” DeLCode, tit. 11, § 1932(b). Since it discerned no requirement that a judicial officer determine compliance with the Delaware statute, and based upon references to extradition contained in the title and text of Section 1933, the Superior Court concluded that the provision was solely an extradition statute. Thus, the Superior Court perceived no concern of jurisdiction or sovereignty related to Sadvari’s arrest such as had motivated the application of the exclusionary rule in <em>Shaffer. </em>Indeed, because it viewed the proceedings under the Delaware statute as summary in nature and not implicative of procedural safeguards of the form required in criminal proceedings, the Superior Court determined that no evidentiary sanction was required. <em>Sadvari, </em><a href="/a2d/723/1044-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="723 A.2d 1044" data-case-ids="11774404" data-case-paths="/a2d/723/1044-01">723 A.2d at 1049</a>.</p>

While in <em>Sadvari </em>the Superior Court distinguished the New York and Delaware statutes on the basis of their respective titles and textual references, we do not view the distinctions drawn as controlling. First, with regard to the title of Section 1933 of the Delaware statute, the designation refers to two subjects— “hearing before justice of the peace” <em>and </em>“waiver of extradition” — only the latter of which is specific to extradition; therefore, the title is not necessarily suggestive of an exclusive focus.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Significantly, both the New York and Delaware statutes derive from a uniform law, namely, the Uniform Act on the Fresh Pursuit of Criminals Across State Lines. <em>See </em>Council of State Governments, The Handbook on Interstate Crime Control 147-50 (1978). More important, the Superior <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>Court’s conclusion that the text of Section 1933 does not require a justice of the peace to determine whether the arresting officer complied with the Delaware statute is in error. The Delaware statute plainly requires the justice of the peace to “determin[e] the lawfulness of the arrest,” and, as in <em>Shaffer, </em>there simply is no authority for a uniformed Pennsylvania trooper in a marked police cruiser to effectuate an extraterritorial arrest in Delaware other than Section 1932 of the Delaware statute. <em>See Commonwealth v. Stair, </em><a href="/pa/548/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="548 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="960584" data-case-paths="/pa/548/0596-01">548 Pa. 596</a>, 609, <a href="/a2d/699/1250-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="699 A.2d 1250" data-case-ids="11913113,960584" data-case-paths="/a2d/699/1250-01,/pa/548/0596-01">699 A.2d 1250</a>, 1257 (1997) (Zappala, J., opinion in support of reversal) (stating that “in the absence of statutory or constitutional authority, a police officer acting within his official capacity cannot make an arrest outside the territorial limits of the jurisdiction from which his authority is derived”); <em>State v.

Accordingly, to comply with the mandate of Section 1933 to evaluate the lawfulness of an arrest, a Delaware tribunal must assess the arresting officer’s compliance with Section 1932. There is no functional difference between this approach and that of New York — the only semantic distinction is that New York’s version of the fresh pursuit statute directly references the sole source of the out-of-state officer’s authority by way of citation to subdivision two of the New York statute, N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law § 1405(2) (setting forth New York’s equivalent to Section 1932 of the Delaware statute); whereas, Delaware accomplishes the same effect by referring more generally to review of the lawfulness of the arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

As the Superior Court correctly noted, not every violation of a statute or rule requires suppression. On the one hand, it could be argued that the Delaware statute merely duplicates the framework provided by Pennsylvania law and our procedural rules for safeguarding defendants’ constitutional rights; therefore, in individual cases a remedy as exacting as suppression should not be deemed necessary. We find, however, that the Delaware statute, with its directive that an out-of-state officer present the arrestee to a Delaware judicial tribunal for review of the lawfulness of an arrest conducted in Delaware, functions as more than merely an extradition statute, and that a contrary interpretation would render empty the mandate of the Delaware law. The exclusionary rule has previously been employed to ensure the orderly administration of justice where a police officer acts without authority, even in cases in which constitutional rights are not at the forefront. <em>See generally State v. Rizzo, </em><a href="/a2d/634/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="634 A.2d 392" data-case-ids="7362164" data-case-paths="/a2d/634/0392-01">634 A.2d 392</a>, 402 (Del.Super.Ct.1998) (characterizing the exclusionary rule as a rule of evidence, adopted as an instrument to implement justice, and not standing upon constitutional grounds). <em>Cf.

Additionally, contrary to the Superior Court's conclusion, Section 1932(b) of the Delaware statute, which provides that Section 1932 does not operate to make unlawful any arrest in Delaware which would otherwise be lawful, cannot insulate Sadvari’s arrest from review for compliance with Delaware fresh pursuit jurisprudence. This is so, because an extraterritorial arrest of the kind at issue is not one "which would otherwise be lawful” but for the Delaware statute, since, again, Pennsylvania law enforcement officers lack authority independent of the Delaware statute to effect the arrest in Delaware. Indeed, the New York fresh pursuit statute employs the same language, N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law § 140.55(4), but at the same time quite consistently requires the New York reviewing tribunal to pass upon the question of compliance with the arrest terms of the statute. N.Y.Crim. Pro.
