The vehicle was traveling east on Greenfield Road in Schenley Park, Allegheny County, when Wilson failed to negotiate a sharp curve in the road. The car traveled off the roadway, went down an embankment and struck a tree. Lockwood suffered fatal injuries in the crash. Blood alcohol tests revealed that Wilson had a blood alcohol content of .168%. Wilson was subsequently convicted of vehicular homicide while driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>

The County was subsequently dismissed from the case when it was discovered that it did not own the road in question. At trial, Appellant contended that the City was negligent in failing to maintain its roadways. He alleged that the absence of a guardrail on the road where the accident took place created a foreseeable risk of injury and was a substantial factor in causing Lockwood’s death.

Our Court explained that the “lack of a guardrail does not render the highway unsafe for the purposes for which it was intended, i.e., travel on the roadway.” <em>Id. </em>at 1134. We found that “the legislature did not intend to impose liability upon the government whenever a plaintiff alleged that his or her injuries could have been avoided or minimized, had the government installed a guardrail along the roadway.” <em>Id. </em>Our conclusion was based on the fact that the exceptions to immunity should be narrowly construed and that the General Assembly did not expressly waive immunity for the condition of guardrails. <em>Id.</em>
