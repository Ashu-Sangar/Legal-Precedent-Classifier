The lake is used by the public for boating and other water activities. Appellants, York Haven Power Company and Metropolitan Edison Company, erected the dam in question. On April 30, 1994, Kenneth Stone and Lynn Meinsler were boating on Lake Frederick. During the late afternoon and evening of that date, the two men drank alcoholic beverages at different locations around the lake, ending at the Falls Hotel with friends. At approximately 11:30 p.m., the two men and their friends left the Falls Hotel <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>and returned to their various boats. While on the lake, one of the men who departed the Falls Hotel by boat at the same time Stone and Meinsler departed in their boat was passed by a boat that he believed to be Meinsler’s, which was headed toward the area where appellants’ dam is located. It was raining heavily by this time, and visibility was very poor. The following day, Meinsler’s boat was found lodged in the main channel dam, and both Stone and Meinsler were drowned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Judge Olszewski filed a concurring and dissenting opinion, stating that he would find that Lake Frederick was the type of area that should be subject to RUA immunity. Nevertheless, Judge Olszewski concluded that there was a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether appellants could be considered the “owners” of the lake for the purposes of RUA immunity.

The lower courts denied summary judgment because they found that the lake was not covered by RUA immunity. Our holding that the lake, but not the dam, is subject to RUA immunity does not resolve the question of whether this particular action may go <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>forward. Nor have the lower courts addressed the distinction between dam and lake. Hence, a remand is necessary. It will be for the trial court to determine, in the first instance, whether appellees have alleged sufficient facts to proceed on a theory of negligence relating to the dam, or a theory of wilful or malicious conduct relating to the lake, for their suit to proceed.</p>

Although the trial court addressed the matter briefly in its opinion on summary judgment, the discussion was not central to its decision on the applicability of the RUA. Given its resolution on appeal, the Superior Court majority did not address the issue of ownership at all. This additional fact-intensive issue should also be addressed by the trial court on remand.</p>
