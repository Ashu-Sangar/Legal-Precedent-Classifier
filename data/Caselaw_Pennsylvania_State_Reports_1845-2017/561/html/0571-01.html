Even though <em>DiFrancesco </em>dealt with now repealed 75 P.S. § 624.1, the predecessor of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547, the case is presently instructive because in it we undertook the very inquiry that is immediately before us — whether in enacting a statutory evidentiary tool, the legislature created a permissive inference or a mandatory presumption. In <em>DiFrancesco, </em>four defendants were found guilty by a jury of operating a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Section 624.1(c)(3), which the trial court recited in its charge, provided that if a person’s BAC was .10% or more, “it shall be presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.” 75 P.S. § 624.1(c)(3). ' The defendants took exception to the court’s instructions on the basis that § 624.1(c)(3) infringed upon their due process rights. <em><a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20204" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="329 A.2d 204">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20204" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="329 A.2d 204">at 207</a>.</p>

By its terms, § 3731 (a.l) does no more than allow the Commonwealth to establish its case in a § 3731(a)(4) prosecution. Section 3731 (a.l) does not shift the burden of proof or the burden of production from the Commonwealth to the defendant. The defendant may introduce competent evidence to rebut the inference and overcome the Commonwealth’s <em>prima facie </em>case. Even in the absence of such evidence, however, the factfinder is not required to find that the defendant had a BAC of .10% or more while he drove. Based upon its independent evaluation of the evidence presented, the factfinder in a § 3731(a)(4) prosecution is always free to ignore the inference allowed by § 3731(a.l).</p>

In our view, the court’s approach was flawed from the start insofar as it failed to consider as a threshold matter whether § 3731(a.l) is permissive or mandatory. Although the court initially referred to § 3731(a.l) as a “rebuttable presumption”, it did not clarify what it meant by that term nor did it assess § 3781(a.l)’s intended legal operation and effect. The court embarked immediately upon its constitutional inquiry, conducting a facial analysis of the statute. The court evaluated the inference in § 3731(a.l) as applied to hypothetical defen<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>dants in hypothetical situations. Its conclusion that the relationship between the basic and elemental facts is unconstitutionally tenuous was entirely academic. In essence, without first determining whether § 3731(a.l) is a mandatory presumption, the court analyzed it as if it were. Thus, the court’s error was twofold: first, it treated a permissive inference as a mandatory presumption; and second, it determined the constitutionality of this permissive inference in a vacuum, before it was applied to appellee and apart from an evidentiary record.
