    <p id="b211-7" data-blocks='[["BL_211.8",211,[133,932,1157,634]]]'>On March 21, 1979, F.B.I. Agent Daniel Glasgow (Agent Glasgow) interviewed Russell Loomis (Loomis) concerning a fraud scheme involving Appellant, William Slick (Slick), George Cornell (Cornell), Ronald Hull (Hull), and others. Loomis gave Agent Glasgow a statement outlining what Glasgow described as a “break out” or “bust out” scheme, whereby Appellant and his co-conspirators would fraudulently obtain merchandise on credit, avoid paying for the goods by concocting a story about it being lost or destroyed, and then sell the merchandise to a fence, or to the public from a discount store. Loomis agreed to testify before a federal Grand Jury investigating Appellant’s bust out scheme.</p>
    <p id="b211-8" data-blocks='[["BL_211.9",211,[130,1594,1157,410]]]'>Loomis disappeared several days before he was scheduled to testify before the Grand Jury. Theresa Slick, Loomis’ live-in girlfriend, testified that she last spoke with Loomis at about six o’clock on the evening of April 11, 1979, at Appellant’s discount store, where Loomis worked. Loomis told her and others that he had to go with Appellant to retrieve a jeep that was stuck in mud in the woods and that he would be home late. He never returned.</p>
    <p id="b211-9" data-blocks='[["BL_211.10",211,[130,2040,1156,257]],["BL_212.1",212,[326,258,1158,420]]]'>On the morning of April 14, 1979, two fishermen found Loomis’ body in a remote area of Lackawanna County, wedged between some debris in a creek called Painter’s Creek. Near the body they found a shovel and a come-a-long (a hand operated wrench), which were later identified as <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>having come from Appellant’s discount store. A short distance away, there was an old foundation with a recently dug rectangular hole about the size of a grave. An autopsy revealed that Loomis had three bullet wounds one entered his back and exited his chest area; one entered his forehead near the left scalp line and lodged at the base of his skull in the rear; and the third entered his lower left lip area in an upward direction, exiting below his right eye.</p>
    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[325,705,1160,572]]]'>Shortly after the murder, police interviewed Hull, and he denied any knowledge of the killing. Appellant was arrested in December of 1980 on charges related to the bust out scheme, but fled while free on bail. After Appellant fled, police interviewed Hull again, and he again denied any knowledge of the murder. The police also interviewed Slick and Cornell, both of whom gave statements implicating Appellant and Hull in Loomis’ murder. Cornell also told police that he helped Appellant dispose of a jeep in New York City, and that he had supplied Appellant with a .357 caliber gun, the same caliber as Loomis’ bullet wounds.</p>
    <p id="b212-6" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[323,1312,1161,411]]]'>In 1981, police took the statement of Andrew Halupke (Halupke), another co-conspirator in the bust out scheme. At that time, Halupke told police that on April 8,1979, three days before Loomis disappeared, he and Hull participated in the planning of Loomis’ murder by searching for a place where they would be able to dispose of Loomis’ body. According to Halupke, Appellant wanted them to dig a grave where Loomis would never be found.</p>
    <p id="b212-7" data-blocks='[["BL_212.7",212,[322,1758,1162,419]]]'>In 1991, police again spoke to Hull, and this time he admitted to participating in Loomis’ murder. At first, Hull denied being present at the scene of the murder, but later admitted to being there with Appellant, Cornell, and Paul Nemish. Hull later retracted that statement and told police that Nemish was not present at the murder scene, but Slick was. Hull eventually agreed to testify against Appellant and his co-conspirators.</p>

When they arrived at Painter’s Creek, Loomis began to walk across a fallen log that was acting as a bridge over the creek, and Appellant shot him in the back. Loomis turned around and attempted to walk back toward Appellant, but Cornell grabbed the gun and shot Loomis a second time. Loomis fell, and Cornell shot him again. Hull, Appellant, and Slick tried to pull Loomis’ body off the log and put it in the grave, but they were unable to extricate it from the debris in the creek, so they left the body where it was. Slick drove away in the jeep, and the others drove away in Loomis’ car, a green Ford LTD.</p>
    <p id="b213-5" data-blocks='[["BL_213.5",213,[128,969,1154,472]]]'>Hull testified that the undercarriage of the car was damaged as they were leaving the Painter’s Creek area, so they stopped to fix it on Route 502 in Springbrook Township, Lackawanna County. Harold Litts, who owned a gas storage tank near where the co-conspirators stopped, saw the jeep and the LTD and became suspicious. He drove past the stopped vehicles, and then turned around and drove past them in the opposite direction, seeing two individuals whom he later identified as Appellant and Slick.</p>
    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.6",213,[128,1474,1156,365]]]'>After the LTD was fixed, Hull drove it to the parking lot of the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Appellant’s brother-in-law picked up Hull and took him to Appellant’s parents’ home, where they met Appellant and Cornell. They disassembled the murder weapon and threw the parts into the Susquehanna River, and Appellant told Hull and the others not to discuss the murder with anyone.</p>

The three co-defendants were tried together, and, on September 6, 1995, a jury found Appellant guilty of first degree and third degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a) and (c), respectively. At the penalty hearing, the jury found one aggravating circumstance, that Appellant had killed Loomis to prevent him from testifying before the federal Grand Jury investigating Appellant’s bust out <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>scheme, and they found no mitigating circumstances.

    <p id="Amq" data-blocks='[["BL_214.8",214,[585,748,621,33]]]'>1. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b214-8" data-blocks='[["BL_214.9",214,[312,814,1164,471]]]'>Appellant first argues that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of Loomis’ murder because Hull, the only witness who implicated Appellant directly, gave conflicting testimony that was unreliable as a matter of law. Appellant argues that because Hull gave the police numerous inconsistent accounts of his participation in Loomis’ murder, made statements at trial that conflicted with earlier statements, and was easily led by the prosecutor, Hull’s entire testimony, and the Commonwealth’s entire case, should be disregarded.</p>
    <p id="b214-9" data-blocks='[["BL_214.10",214,[312,1312,1162,904]]]'>Appellant’s argument is flawed for several reasons. First, he fails to acknowledge that there was substantial evidence against him independent of Hull’s testimony. At trial, Harold Litts identified Appellant as one of the men he saw on Route 502 on the night of the murder, and Andrew Halupke testified that he and Hull helped Appellant plan the murder by looking for a place to dispose of Loomis’ body. Second, Hull’s testimony was corroborated by that of Litts and Halupke, and by the physical evidence, e.g., the location and position of Loomis’ body, the location of the grave, the presence of the shovel and come-a-long from Appellant’s store, and the location of Loom-is’ car in the parking lot of the Wyoming Valley Mall. Finally, there was additional circumstantial evidence of Appellant’s guilt, including his attempt to alter his fingerprints.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In short, the totality of the evidence against Appellant, both direct and circumstantial, was more than sufficient to sustain Appellant’s conviction for first degree murder.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[125,310,1156,503]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in molding the jury’s verdicts of guilty on the charges of first degree murder and third degree murder into a conviction for first degree murder. He argues that the two verdicts are legally inconsistent, because the conviction for first degree murder requires a finding that Appellant had a specific intent to kill, while the conviction for third degree murder requires the opposite finding that Appellant did not have a specific intent to kill. This, however, is an incorrect statement of the law.</p>
    <p id="b215-5" data-blocks='[["BL_215.6",215,[125,846,1156,616]]]'>Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, third degree murder is not a homicide that the Commonwealth must prove was committed with malice and without a specific intent to kill. Instead, it is a homicide that the Commonwealth must prove was committed with malice, but one with respect to which the Commonwealth need not prove, nor even address, the presence or absence of a specific intent to kill. Indeed, to convict a defendant for third degree murder, the jury need not consider whether the defendant had a specific intent to kill, nor make any finding with respect thereto. Thus, there is no inconsistency in the jury’s convicting Appellant of both first and third degree murder.</p>

Accordingly, the court dismissed Juror Two. The court found that Juror One’s reasons for seeking to be excused had nothing to do with the merits of the case and that he could be impartial.

He noted that where a nontestifying witness makes a statement implicating his accomplices, the Court has historically viewed such statements as “presumptively unreliable” as an accomplice has a strong motivation to lie. <em>Id. </em>at 1897-98 (citing <em>Lee v.

The Majority notes that Young presented an alibi defense, but the record shows that this defense was so seriously undermined that there is no doubt that the jury rejected it for reasons completely unrelated to the statements of Slick and Cornell. First, the jury heard that Appellant had acted as counsel on his own behalf for most of the pre-trial in this matter. At that time, Appellant had listed three witnesses who could supposedly provide Appellant with an alibi for April 11, 1979. The first of these, John Hope (Hope) had provided an affidavit in 1993 while Young was pro se counsel. Hope swore that he was with Loomis on April 13, 1979 and Loomis was driving a green jeep.

Further, at the time that Hope provided the false affidavit he was in a cellblock with Young. <em>(Id. </em>at 51).

Like Hope, Tigue was an inmate who had extensive contact with Young in the jail system. Tigue stated that in 1979 he had been at Young’s store and had a signed receipt that showed that at 8:57 p.m. on April 11, 1979 Young was at the store, consequently providing Young with an alibi for the night of the Loomis murder.

However, as holds true with Young’s other two alibi witnesses, Rish was a fellow prison mate of Young’s, and his story lacked any credibility. Rish only came forward with this alibi in 1992 when he first sent a letter to the State Police (and when he and Young were in prison). On the stand, Rish claimed that he remembered the date of April 11, 1979, because he had a birthday party for his daughter the day before that, however, his wife told police that there was no birthday party for their daughter. (N.T. August 30, 1995 at 153-55). Further, his statement given to the police in 1993 indicated that he did not “know the month or year” of this alleged visit with Young but remembered the day only because Young had told him the day was April 11, 1979. <em>(Id. </em>at 145^6). Moreover, Rish claimed that he was with Young from 3:30 p.m. until at least 8:00 p.m., almost without interruption, but Young testified that he had a “meeting” with Hull, Slick and Cornell at 4:30 p.m. that day regarding air fresheners. <em>(Id. </em>at 140, 144, N.T.
