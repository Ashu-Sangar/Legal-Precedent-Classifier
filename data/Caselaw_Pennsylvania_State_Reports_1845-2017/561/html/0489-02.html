Appellant also argues that the criminal sentencing proceeding was the only forum in which he could have been removed from office. This argument is patently flawed. Contrary to Appellant’s assertion, the prohibition against those convicted of infamous crimes from holding public office is a Constitutional mandate that can never be altered by a sentencing plea bargain agreement. It is not within a trial judge’s authority to reshape or ignore the Constitution when fashioning a sentence. Likewise, the district attorney does not have the power to enter into a plea agreement that specifically reserves the defendant’s right to hold public office in spite of his conviction for an infamous crime.

The legislature may change felonies to misdemeanors and vice versa or, indeed, criminalize acts as felonies that were not previously criminal at all.
