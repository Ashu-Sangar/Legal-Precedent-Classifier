Katheryne also progressively developed chronic respiratory congestion. She was under the care of Appellee Dr. Elizabeth Edmunds, the Aldridges’ family physician. By six months of age, Katheryne exhibited severe congestion, and her weight fell below the fifth percentile on a standardized average scale. At such time, Dr. Edmunds noted that Katheryne appeared thin and old for her age and described her symptomology as a failure to <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>thrive. Thereafter, Dr. Edmunds pursued a course of investigation and treatment which included: blood and fluid tests; weekly weight assessments; consultation with a pediatric physician; dietary substitutions; adjustments to caloric intake; and initiation of iron replacement therapy.</p>
    <p id="b490-4" data-blocks='[["BL_490.5",490,[311,524,1164,728]]]'>On July 20, 1991, Katheryne developed pneumonia, and her parents brought her to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Reading. A chest x-ray was taken and an echocardiogram performed, which showed enlargement of the heart and other irregularities. From these and other tests, medical professionals determined that Katheryne was experiencing severe cardiac and respiratory failures and first diagnosed her heart condition. Katheryne was transferred to Appellee St. Christopher’s Hospital for Children (the “Hospital”) for further cardiac assessment, where, on July 26, 1991, a cardiac catheterization study was performed, confirming the congenital defects. Corrective surgery was scheduled on an urgent basis, and, during this period, Katheryne underwent treatment for a rash in her vaginal area.</p>
    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.6",490,[310,1275,1163,677]]]'>Appellee Dr. Pierantonio Russo performed the corrective surgery on July 30, 1991, prior to which femoral catheters were inserted to permit continuous blood pressure monitoring. Although the surgery initially appeared to have been successful, two days later, Katheryne’s heart arrested. Despite efforts to resuscitate her and to sustain breathing and circulation, a neurologist found no evidence of brain cortical or subcortical function, and Katheryne was removed from life support on August 2, 1991. Several days later, in the performance of an autopsy, a pathologist found evidence'of infection with a fungus known as candida albicans and issued a report indicating as a cause of death “candida albicans sepsis with septic shock.”</p>

At trial, Appellants emphasized that Katheryne’s mother was a diabetic, a risk factor relative to congenital defects in offspring, and that despite such risk and Katheryne’s symptoms (including her failure to thrive and respiration problems), Dr. Edmunds failed to conduct tests which would have disclosed the heart defects and resulted in earlier treatment at substantially lower risk. Appellants also asserted that Hospital personnel inserted the pre-surgical femoral catheter into an area infected with candida albicans, thus introducing the fungus into Katheryne’s system. Appellants presented several expert witnesses to support their claims of non-conformance to accepted medical standards.</p>
    <p id="b491-4" data-blocks='[["BL_491.6",491,[142,1003,1159,1103]],["BL_492.1",492,[329,257,1155,94]]]'>Appellees maintained that appropriate care had been rendered, denied that Katheryne’s death was attributable to a fungal infection, and further asserted that Katheryne had died as a result of her heart defects and known risks associated with the corrective surgical procedure. Of particular relevance to this appeal, Dr. Edmunds maintained that the care she provided was reasonable because, although it was clear in hindsight that Katheryne’s failure to thrive was due to her congenital condition, the clinical picture presented at the time of treatment simply did not suggest heart disease. In support of this defense, Dr. Edmunds offered testimony from Dr. William Mebane, a pediatric and family physician, who indicated that congenital heart malformations are an uncommon cause of failure to thrive; whereas, common causes of the syndrome include dietary problems, hormonal problems and psycho/social problems, avenues of Dr. Edmunds’ investigation. Over the objection of Appellants’ counsel, Dr. Mebane was permitted to support his diagnosis by reference to excerpts from a textbook on pediatrics, Frank A. Oski et al., Principles and Practice of Pediatrics (J.B. Lippincott Co.1990), which were enlarged, mounted on posterboard and <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>marked as an exhibit.
