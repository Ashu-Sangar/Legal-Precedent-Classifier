The detectives advised Appellant that they were investigating Ms. DeMarco’s murder and he agreed to go with the detectives and to be interviewed at the police station. At 10:57 a.m., the detectives began to take Appellant’s statement, in which he denied any involvement in Ms. DeMarco’s murder. After stopping for a short break at 12:35 p.m., the detectives resumed taking Appellant’s statement at 12:50 p.m. and concluded the conversation at 1:05 p.m. At that point, Detective Justice asked for Appellant’s consent to have his fingerprints taken and Appellant consented.

Approximately five minutes later, Appellant signed a permission form to have his finger and palm prints taken and he was then printed. At about 2:40 p.m., Appellant was given something to eat. During this time, Detective Justice told Appellant that he was not telling the truth in his statement because surveillance indicated that Appellant did not live in the house he had told the detectives he lived in. The detectives then informed Appellant that they had a reasonable belief that he was involved in Ms. DeMarco’s murder. Appellant did not respond, but placed his head down on the table. At 3:50 p.m., Appellant was advised that his palm print was identified as being the same as a latent palm print from the. interior wall of the burglarized building, and he was placed under arrest for burglary.

      <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>With the <em>Bennett </em>factors in mind, we find that there was a clear continuity of interrogation in the instant case and thus, that the detectives were not required to rewarn Appellant of his rights. Appellant was read his rights two and one-half hours before he gave his first incriminating statement. Immediately after his rights were read, he signed a waiver form. During the period of time before his first incriminating statement, there were only momentary lapses in the interview process to allow Appellant time to take short breaks. Appellant confessed in the same room where he was read his rights. Though Appellant confessed to a different officer than the one who had previously read him • his rights, we believe this solitary factor does not compel a finding that the officers were required to rewarn Appellant of his rights. It cannot be said that Appellant was not aware of his rights a mere two and one-half hours after he heard, acknowledged and waived them. As this Court has previously stated, “where there is a time lapse of several hours, the accused is not moved, and there is a <em>clear continuity of interrogation </em>interrupted only by a lapse of time, there is no need for repeated warnings before the second interrogation.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In <em>Dixon, </em>the defendant was warned of his rights, which he then waived. The defendant denied any involvement in the crime. About three hours after his initial warnings, the defendant was moved to the polygraph testing room where the polygraph operator told him that he “must tell if he knew something about the homicide in order for the test to be conducted.” <em><a href="/pa/475/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="475 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1734082" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0365-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/475/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="475 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1734082" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0365-01">at 372</a>, <a href="/pa/475/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="475 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="1734082" data-case-paths="/pa/475/0365-01">380 A.2d at 768</a>. In response, the defendant made his first incriminating statement, which this Court later held to be inadmissible. Unlike the instant case, <em>Dixon </em>involved a polygraph test, which was clearly an important factor in this Court’s decision to suppress the statement. The polygraph <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>test presented the potential of undue influence in coercing the defendant to answer a certain way and to make incriminating statements. This element of possible undue influence stemming from the polygraph test simply was not present here. Thus, we find Appellant’s reliance on <em>Dixon </em>to be misplaced. Instead, based on the factors set forth in <em>Bennett, </em>we find that there was a clear continuity of interrogation and, therefore, that Appellant was not entitled to be rewamed of his constitutional rights. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that there was no need to suppress Appellant’s statements.</p>
