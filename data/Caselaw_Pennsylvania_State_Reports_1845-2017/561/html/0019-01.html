The Pennsylvania Game Commission (Game Commission) is an independent administrative commission under the executive branch and is governed by eight Game Commissioners who are appointed by the Governor. All Game Commission personnel, except for the Executive Director, are em<a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>ployed in accordance with the classification and compensation plans of the Commonwealth as set by the Office of Administration (OA). Appellant Robert M. Toth was named Chief of Personnel Services for the Game Commission in 1987. Ultimately, Toth was responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the Commonwealth’s payroll system and ensuring that the policies of the Commonwealth were followed.</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[311,626,1162,305]]]'>As Chief of Personnel Services, Toth reported directly to Kenneth Hess, Director of the Bureau of Administrative Services. In turn, Hess reported to Steven Williams who was the Deputy Executive Director of the Game Commission. Williams reported to the Executive Director of the Game Commission, Peter Duncan.</p>
    <p id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[309,957,1164,679]]]'>Toth’s termination from his employment with the Game Commission was a result of actions taken by Toth surrounding a controversy over a systematic increase in pay called a “longevity increment.” A longevity increment is an employee’s advancement to the next step on a pay scale as a result of the passage of a certain period of time. In April 1991, the OA amended personnel rules applicable to all agencies under the Governor’s jurisdiction, including the Game Commission. Pursuant to the amendments, any employee hired after July 1, 1988 was required to work seven years before receiving a longevity increment. Prior to the amendments, an employee was entitled to receive a longevity increment after only one year of service.</p>
    <p id="b186-6" data-blocks='[["BL_186.7",186,[309,1660,1162,625]],["BL_187.1",187,[127,255,1154,310]]]'>Toth’s immediate supervisor, Hess, was not pleased with the alteration to the longevity increment. He told Toth to “look into it, see if there is anything we could do.” In January 1998, Toth became privy to information that the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (Fish Commission) was able to change the time it took to obtain an initial longevity increment to one year by placing an incorrect longevity date into the payroll computer system. Toth took his newfound information and informed Hess of what the Fish Commission was doing. Hess asked Toth to investigate further and to see if it were possible for the Game Commission to do the same for its employees. Toth directed an assistant in his division, Pamela Klinger, to <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>obtain information from the Fish Commission as to how it was making the changes to the payroll system which reduced the time for employees to receive an initial longevity increment. Subsequently, Toth was informed as to how the Game Commission could change the initial increment to one year in the computer system.</p>
    <p id="b187-4" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[124,607,1159,1005]]]'>Toth informed Williams, Hess’ immediate supervisor, about how to alter the longevity increment in the computer by changing an employee’s longevity date. Williams told Toth to change his (Williams’) longevity increment. Toth volunteered that they do the same for Jane Peyton, a Personnel Analyst 2 employed in Toth’s division. Both Williams and Peyton had been hired after 1988. These changes were envisioned as “test cases” to determine the feasibility of reducing the initial longevity increment for other Game Commission employees who would be affected by the policy changes enacted by the OA. Thus, Toth directed that Peyton’s longevity date be altered from September 5, 1996 to March 1, 1993. Additionally, William’s longevity date was changed from February 10, 1999 to March 1, 1993. As a result of these changes, both Wiliams and Peyton received an increase in pay. Subsequently, Toth informed Hess of the actions that he had taken; Hess voiced no objection to these changes and spoke about altering other employee’s longevity dates if the changes were successful.</p>
    <p id="b187-5" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[123,1663,1159,634]]]'>In the spring of 1993, Greg Matthews, a pay specialist for the OA, found the alteration of Peyton’s longevity increment and determined that the change was inappropriate. Matthews’. supervisor conducted an investigation of other personnel records and noted that Williams’ longevity date was also changed. Charles Sciotto, Deputy Secretary for the OA, telephoned Toth and informed Toth that the longevity dates would have to be changed back to their original status and that Williams and Peyton would have to make restitution for the improper increases that they received. Toth admitted to Sciotto that it was a mistake to alter the payroll records and that he knew it was the wrong thing to do.</p>

      <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>Upon Hess’ retirement in July 1994, Hess wrote to the Game Commissioners discussing the altered dates and Toth’s role in the scheme. While attending an October 1994 Game Commissioner meeting, Toth admitted that he altered the payroll records but contended that he did so with the approval of Williams and Hess. At this point, the matter was turned over to the Office of the Inspector General. The Inspector General concluded its investigation and offered a report to the Game Commissioners which was the subject of discussion at a January 1995 meeting of the Commissioners. The Inspector General’s report concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that Toth had acted improperly and had possibly violated the Crimes Code.</p>
    <p id="b188-4" data-blocks='[["BL_188.5",188,[325,919,1163,418]]]'>Following these events, Williams was terminated. The Commissioners also sent a letter to Toth informing him that he was suspended pending a January 20, 1995 pre-disciplinary conference. On January 23, 1995, Toth was terminated for “directing that payroll records be changed without justification.” The letter informing Toth of his dismissal further stated that Toth may have violated the Crimes Code and that his conduct brought discredit to the Game Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Furthermore, Toth argued that the personnel policies of the Game Commission permitted him to make the alterations and that the Fish Commission had similar policies that authorized that administrative commission to change the <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>longevity increment for its employees.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Finally, Toth asserted that it was Game Commission policy not to follow dictates of the OA. He cited to two previous incidents in which Hess directed him to ignore mandates from the OA and to implement what was considered Game Commission policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[126,526,1155,578]]]'>The Civil Service Commission found that because Toth admitted to directing his subordinate to perform alterations to the payroll computer system to change the longevity dates, the case turned on whether he was justified in doing so. The Civil Service Commission concluded that because Toth’s actions were at the direction of his supervisors, Toth did not act without justification. According to the Civil Service Commission, further justifying Toth’s actions was the history of noncompliance within the Game Commission. Thus, the Civil Service Commission determined that the Game Commission failed to establish just cause for termination.</p>
    <p id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.6",189,[125,1129,1155,522]],["BL_190.1",190,[313,251,1162,202]]]'>However, the Civil Service Commission went on to note that Toth was responsible for safeguarding the Commonwealth’s payroll system and ensuring that the personnel policies of the Commonwealth were followed. The Civil Service Commission went so far as to note that Toth had exhibited “exceptionally poor judgment” and that Toth should have been particularly cautious since Williams had only been the Deputy Executive Director for one year and that Williams would personally benefit from the changes to the longevity dates. Finally, the Commission suggested that Toth should have used better <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>judgment and sought more direct authority from the Game Commissioners themselves rather than rely on any approval from Williams or Hess. Ultimately, the Civil Service Commission ordered Toth reinstated but without back pay.</p>
    <p id="b190-4" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[315,479,1162,258]]]'>. The Game Commission appealed to the Commonwealth Court. By order dated October 23, 1998, the Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the Civil Service Commission. On June 22, 1999, we granted Toth’s petition for allowance of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[313,761,1167,688]]]'>The threshold issue before the court is whether the Commonwealth Court stated and utilized the appropriate standard of review in its consideration of the Civil Service Commission’s award. The Commonwealth Court articulated its standard of review as determining “whether the Commission committed an error of law, abused its discretion or found facts that were not supported by substantial evidence.” <em>Pennsylvania Game Commission v.

As noted above, Toth argued before the Civil Service Commission that he was not without justification for three reasons: first, he had authorization for his acts from his superiors; second, Game Commission policies authorized the change to the system; and finally, the atmosphere at the Game Commission was one of non-conformity with OA personnel policies. The Civil Service Commission, in reinstating Toth, relied primarily on its finding that Toth acted with justification in altering payroll records because he had autho<a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>rization from Ms superiors for Ms acts.

However, as found by the Civil Service Commission, as Chief of Personnel Services Division, Toth’s duties included “safeguarding the Commonwealth’s payroll system.” Finding of Fact No. 6. Moreover, Toth was charged with ensuring that the policies of the Commonwealth were followed. Given Toth’s managerial position of import, whose primary function was to act as guardian of the payroll records, there cannot be justification for the admittedly wrongful, willful, and intentional alteration of those same records. Toth conceded that he knew his actions were a “mistake” and that he was “wrong.” Changing of the payroll records was not from a lack of knowledge. We find that a public employee in a position of trust and oversight, especially where the position involves disbursement of public funds, cannot blindly follow orders which he knows or should know violates the law. “I was just following orders” does not operate as a legal justification when one is in a position of oversight and responsibility such as that held by Toth. <em>See Geissler v.

The facts presented and found by the Civil Service Commission simply do not support the legal conclusions reached by the Civil Service Commission that there was no just cause for Toth’s termination. Toth’s primary responsibility was safeguarding the Commonwealth’s payroll files. Instead, he used his position to direct subordinates to override the Commonwealth’s payroll system and to corrupt those files.

First, as noted above, Civil Service Commission determinations are subject to review by appellate courts for, <em>inter alia, </em>errors of law. Second, such an interpretation of the Civil Service Commission’s authority reads out of the relevant statutory provision the limiting language “where appropriate,” which qualifies otherwise limitless action by the Civil Service Commission.</p>

In light of the position held by Toth, the unjustified acts he committed, and just cause for his termination, the Civil Service Commission was without a basis to modify the Game Commission’s decision to terminate Toth. Simply stated, this is not an appropriate situation to modify the Game Commission’s action. In this case, the proven and admitted misconduct constituted a serious dereliction of duty and directly impacted upon Toth’s ability to perform in his position. By the Civil Service Commission’s own findings, just cause for dismissal was established and modification was not appropriate.</p>

Additionally, in <em>applying </em>its stated standard of review, the Commonwealth Court analogized its limited role to that of appellate court reviewing an Act 195 labor arbitration award. In reviewing an Act 195 arbitration award, appellate courts apply what has come to be called the “essence test.” In this case, the Commonwealth Court's statement of the essence test included a determination of whether the Civil Service Commission's award was “manifestly unreasonable.” First, we desire to make clear that the appropriate standard of review of the Civil Service Commission is that stated in <em>Bowman </em>and § 704 and not the essence test. Analogy to a court's review of an Act 195 labor arbitration award unnecessarily clouds the proper focus of appellate review. Furthermore, in rendering its decision, the Commonwealth Court did not have the benefit of this coinTs recent decision which traced the history of and defined the essence lest, <em>State System of Higher Education (Cheyney University) v. State College and University Professional Association, </em><a href="/pa/560/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="560 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="95778" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0135-01">560 Pa. 135</a>, <a href="/a2d/743/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="743 A.2d 405" data-case-ids="11487623,95778" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/0405-01,/pa/560/0135-01">743 A.2d 405</a>, 199 Pa. LEXIS 3783 (1999). In <em>State System </em>a majority of our court specifically determined that a standard based upon reasonableness ("reasonable interpretation” and "manifestly unreasonable”) was inappropriate and lacking in the deference necessary to uphold the policy goals of binding arbitration. While in his concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Castille indicated that he would go farther and allow the court to review whether an arbitration award was “manifestly unreasonable” under ihe essence test, this concurring view had no joinders. Thus, we reiterate that the essence test does not permit an appellate court to intrude into the domain of the 'arbitrator and determine whether an award is “manifestly unreasonable.” While reasonableness is an improper focus in the context of a review of an Act 195 labor arbitration award, in the context of a review of an administrative agency decision, our court has noted that while a reviewing court is not to invoke a concept of reasonableness as justification to simply substitute its judgment for that of an agency, it remains within the purview of an appellate court to determine whether any reasonable mind could make the same determination as the agency based upon the evidence. <em>Fraternal Order of Police, </em><a href="/a2d/735/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="735 A.2d 96" data-case-ids="11533716,56880" data-case-paths="/a2d/735/0096-01,/pa/557/0586-01">735 A.2d at 100</a>. Thus, although this basis was not articulated, the Commonwealth Court’s use of the concept of reasonableness was not wholly without foundation.</p>

As to Game Commission policies, it is sufficient to note that upon discovery by the OA of the changes to payroll records, Toth admitted to OA Deputy Secretary Sciotto that he knew his attempt to alter the records was "wrong” and that Toth corrected the records without challenge to the OA. Toth’s argument is nothing more than a post hoc rationalization for his misconduct. Furthermore, the Civil Service Commission’s finding that there existed a "general atmosphere of antagonism” towards the OA's personnel policies is equally unavailing to Toth. Contrary to the previously described incidents which involved above-the-board policy disputes with OA, in this instance, Toth and other equally unauthorized Game Commission employees unilaterally altered payroll records in an attempt to secure an unapproved increase in pay. These unrelated incidents provide no safe harbor for Toth’s outlandish conduct.</p>
