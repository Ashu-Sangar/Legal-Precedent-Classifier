In 1990, Conner applied for funding with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, Office of Vocational Rehabilitation (“OVR”), for the purchase of updated hand controls for a new van. OVR referred Conner to Moss Rehab Driving School for Disabled (“Moss”), which recommended, among other things, a left-hand control providing for acceleration and braking via side-to-side movement. The recommendation also included, as a component of the throttle/brake control, a device described as a “palmer cuff w[ith] D-Ring on velcro,” designed to partially secure the driver’s hand to the control. OVR approved funding, invited bids for the van modifications, and ultimately accepted the bid submitted by Appellee Quality Coach, Inc. (“Quality Coach”), which purchased the brake/throttle device and palmer cuff from Creative Controls, Inc., and completed the modifications pursuant to its contract with OVR.</p>

Conner subsequently commenced a civil action against Quality Coach, Moss, Creative Controls, Inc. and others, alleging that he lost control of his van because he was unable to remove his left hand from the brake/throttle control. Conner contended that the restriction resulted from defective design of the hand securement device — primarily the location of the “D-ring on velcro” in relation to the palmer cuff — and presented theories of negligence, breach of warranty and strict products liability. Quality Coach filed a motion for summary judgment asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was entitled to immunity from suit as a government contractor. The trial court granted such motion on the ground stated, and, after Conner settled his claims <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>against the remaining defendants, entered a final order disposing of all claims against all parties.</p>

The third of these criteria supplanted two factors deemed relevant by the <em>Mackey </em>court in the federal military context, namely, that the defendant warned <em>the government </em>concerning certain defects in design or dan<a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>gers known (actually or constructively) to the defendant; and the defendant provided necessary warnings or instructions, unless the military would provide them. <em>See Conner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="724 A.2d 379" data-case-ids="11636344" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0379-01">724 A.2d at 384</a>. The Superior Court reasoned that this modification was necessary, since the contractor’s duty in military matters runs to the government; whereas, in the non-military context, the duty to warn would extend to the ultimate user of the product. <em>Id, </em>at 385.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[147,672,1157,1264]]]'>Applying these criteria to the present case, the Superior Court first found the government responsible for the relevant specifications. Initially, the court noted that OVR’s bid invitation was unspecific in designating a location for the velcro strap vis-á-vis the palmer cuff; thus, it appeared to accept that the placement may have been determined, in the first instance, by Quality Coach. Nevertheless, the Superior Court found that, in a case where the design alleged to be defective originates with the contractor, the government contractor defense may still be available if “the government actually considered the particular specification and decided to make it a part of the plans or design for the project.” <em>Conner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="724 A.2d 379" data-case-ids="11636344" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0379-01">724 A.2d at 386</a> (quoting <em>Beaver Valley Power Co. v.

The Superior Court also found the second and third criteria met, as Conner did not dispute that the brake/throttle control comported with OVR’s specifications; and Conner’s awareness of the safety issues implicated by the design of the hand securement device eliminated any need for Quality Control to have issued a particularized warning. <em>Conner, </em><a href="/a2d/724/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="724 A.2d 379" data-case-ids="11636344" data-case-paths="/a2d/724/0379-01">724 A.2d at 387-88</a>.</p>

Rather, he argues primarily that the Superior Court improperly supplanted the requirement, established in <em>Mackey, </em>that a contractor seeking to avail itself of the defense must demonstrate that it warned the government about defects or dangers involved in the design or use of a product of which the contractor was or should have been aware. Conner contends that such a pre-manufacturing warning is necessary so that the government may balance the risk and benefits inherent in the use of the product, <em>see generally McKay v.

Supporting Conner’s position, <em>amicus curiae </em>the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association urges that the application of the government contractor defense should not be extended to insulate manufacturers of consumer products which would otherwise be held strictly liable simply because the injured plaintiff obtained financial or administrative assistance from a government agency, but rather, should be closely limited to the military context. In support of the government contractor defense, Quality Coach contends that its affordance under either the criteria established by the Superior Court in the present case or those established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Boyle: </em>ensures that contractors carrying out the discretionary decisions of the Commonwealth are not unjustly subject to liability; encourages contractors to partid<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>pate in the competitive bidding process for government work without inflating their bids for fear of future litigation; and prevents judicial inquiry into the merits of discretionary political judgments, such as are involved in the funding or procuring of products for use in the performance of government functions. <em>Amicus curiae </em>the Product Liability Council, Inc. supports Quality Coach’s position, emphasizing that “the public policy bases underlying the government contractor defense predominate the present appeal.”</p>

Before the Court was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit holding that the government contractor defense insulated a military contractor, the Sikorsky Division of United Technologies Corporation (“Sikorsky”), from exposure to liability for damages arising out of the death of David A. Boyle (“Boyle”), a United States Marine lieutenant, following the crash of a United States military helicopter. Boyle’s estate alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>defective design of a component of the helicopter (its emergency egress system); thus, the threshold issue in <em>Boyle </em>was whether there was any justification in federal law for shielding government contractors, particularly military contractors, from liability for design defects.</p>

In Pennsylvania, however, this Court has deemed the common law justifications for sovereign immunity to be invalid, and the common law immunity was therefore abolished. <em>See Mayle v.

This having occurred, there simply is no justification in Pennsylvania for utilizing a common law framework for <em>expanding </em>a rule that no longer exists. Following this abrogation, however, as a matter of its legislative prerogative, the General Assembly restored sovereign immunity, providing that “the Commonwealth, and its officials and employees acting within the scope of their duties, shall continue to enjoy sovereign and official immunity and remain immune from suit except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive the immunity.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310. We are therefore left with purely a question of statutory interpretation, namely, did the General Assembly in this enactment seek to include government contractors within the statutory shield of immunity conferred upon the Commonwealth?</p>

For the same reasons that it would be inappropriate to broaden such defense in favor of Commonwealth contractors using the mechanism of the common law, we also decline to employ the rubric of public policy to expand the reach of statutory sovereign immunity. Indeed,-pursuant to the rules of statutory construction, where the Legislature has provided a remedy, or a duty is enjoined, the direction of the statutory scheme is to be strictly followed. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1504.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

We reject this distinction, however, as being critical to the disposition of this case; instead, the crucial distinction is between federal and state contractors since, as discussed below, the source and nature of available immunities differ between these two categories of contractors. For this reason, the Superior Court's decision in <em>Mackey, </em>involving a <em>federal </em>contractor, is of limited relevance. <em>See Mackey, </em><a href="/pa-super/350/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="350 Pa.

Parenthetically, the construct set forth in <em>Mackey </em>pertaining to federal government contractors is, of course, altered to the extent that it conflicts with the subsequent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Boyle, </em>since the immunity of federal contractors derives from the immunity available to the United States, and <em>Boyle </em>is grounded in federal preemption. <em>See Boyle, </em><a href="/us/487/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="487 U.S. 500" data-case-ids="1775177" data-case-paths="/us/487/0500-01">487 U.S. at 508</a>, 108 S.Ct. at 2516.</p>
