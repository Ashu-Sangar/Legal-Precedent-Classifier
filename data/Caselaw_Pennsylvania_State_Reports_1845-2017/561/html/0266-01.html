Additionally, immediately following the investigator’s testimony, the trial court instructed the jury that evidence of the robbery conviction was relevant only to evaluate the credibility of appellant’s penalty hearing testimony and that the underlying facts of the conviction were irrelevant to that assessment.

Initially, we note that the court properly denied defense counsel’s request to view the document while the prosecutor was showing it to the witness. The document was used only for rebuttal during the penalty hearing for the purpose of refuting a defense claim that the police had engaged in improper conduct — arresting appellant for a crime he did not commit. The trial court also properly determined that the affidavit was not subject to pretrial discovery, as it did not contain exculpatory information and had no relation to the murder for which appellant was on trial. A further review of the record reveals that the trial court ordered the prosecutor to turn over the affidavit to defense counsel at the conclusion of the prosecutor’s re-direct examination of the witness. Defense counsel did not request a recess in order to examine the document and instead cross-examined the witness about matters relating to the affidavit.

He further testified on cross-examination that Jamaican drug-dealers once solicited him to work for them as a security guard but he declined the offer. Appellant denied that he became involved in selling drugs. N.T. 2/2/93 at 138. In rebuttal, the prosecutor impeached appellant’s testimony by presenting evidence of appellant’s arrest for selling drugs in October of 1991, an arrest that resulted in a conviction in April of 1992.

In addition, on cross-examination of one of the investigators, appellant attempted to establish that police had fabricated Williams's written account of the murder based on information they had received from Natalie Grant.
