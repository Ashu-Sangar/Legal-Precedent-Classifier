Moreover, this interpretation of "entirely free from private profit motive” is also consistent with federal tax exemption law. Although we realize that federal tax exemption involves a completely separate inquiry and does not control the case at hand, we find that it is instructive in helping to determine when an organization is operating entirely free from a private profit motive. As the trial court astutely noted in the instant case, under federal law, "nonprofit corporations can own for-profit corporations without losing their federal nonprofit tax status as long as the profits of the for-profit corporations are used to further the nonprofit purposes of the parent organization.” Trial court opinion, 1/26/96, pp. 22, 23.</p>

In addition, I agree with the majority that charitable entities may invest their surplus funds and gain a reasonable return that will be used to further their charitable missions. Easton Hospital, however, has not reinvested in its charitable enterprise or made investments producing a reasonable return to support its charitable mission. Rather, Easton Hospital transferred its surplus to other non-profit and for-profit entities, which the record does not establish are charitable. Of the $1,960,000 transferred to these entities from 1990 to 1995, only $20,000 has been repaid.

Appellants argue that Easton Hospital does not operate entirely free of private profit motive because it has loaned and contributed more than $3,320,000 to its parent company and its other subsidiaries to fund for-profit and non-profit ventures which are not charitable in nature and which compete with private sector businesses. Appellants further argue that Easton Hospital’s employment contracts with doctors whose practices it buys have non-compete clauses which evidence a private profit motive. Contrary to the majority, I believe that Appellants’ arguments have merit and that Easton Hospital’s ventures into the private sector clearly evidence that during the tax years in question, it did not operate entirely free of a private profit motive.</p>
