Around 1:00 pm, she punched out on the time clock in order to meet her husband for lunch.

Therefore, we turn to the next prong, which inquires whether appellee’s presence upon the premises was required by the nature of her employment. In <em>Brind Leasing, </em>Commonwealth Court found that the employee’s presence on the employer’s premises was required by the nature of his employment. Specifically, the court determined that the employee “saw his night supervisor being attacked and felt compelled to come to his aid” and that “[t]his compulsion arose from the employment relationship.” <em>Id. </em>at 1104.</p>

    <p id="b286-4" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[314,474,1161,453]]]'>Appellant contends that the Commonwealth Court failed to identify a source for the requirement of appellee’s presence on the premises. Appellant claims that rather than a work-related compulsion, appellee was motivated to assist Mrs. Walker because appellee is a “Good Samaritan.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> For example, appellee characterized herself as a “Good Samaritan” who will “always stop anywhere”; in fact, just one week prior to the attack, appellee stopped at the scene of a highway accident to render assistance.

The basis for such a compulsion is unclear. Appellee argues that the compulsion existed because there is no evidence that appellee knew Mrs. Walker from any contact outside of the employment relationship. In other words, appellee only assisted Mrs. Walker because she became acquainted with Mrs. Walker at work. However, the fact that they became acquainted through work does not mean that appellee was required by the nature of her <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>employment to assist Mrs. Walker. To the extent that appellee is claiming that she felt compelled to save her co-employee’s life because of an obligation to further her employer’s business or affairs, we reject that claim. As previously indicated, this is too tenuous a basis to impose liability upon an employer. Appellee fails to demonstrate an employment-related compulsion that necessitated her presence on the premises at the time of the attack. Thus, the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that appellee was required by the nature of her employment to be on her employer’s premises at the time of her injury.</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[141,851,1159,952]]]'>Appellee contends that the fact that an assault occurs on an employer’s premises creates a presumption that the claimant is covered under the Act, and the employer must rebut this presumption by proving that the assailant intended to injure the employee for personal reasons. <em>See Wills Eye Hospital v.

Appellee claims that she was assaulted along with her co-worker since (1) the assailant brandished the knife in the direction of Mrs. Walker, next to whom appellee was seated and (2) in the attempt to subdue the assailant, appellee’s glasses were knocked off. We disagree. The WCJ made no finding that the incident involved an assault upon appellee, nor are the above-cited facts sufficient to transform the personal attack upon Mrs. Walker into an assault upon appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The fact that appellee found it most convenient to eat lunch at Kmart in no way establishes that she was required to eat there; to the contrary, the WCJ found that she was free to leave the store. WCJ Opin. at 7. Appellee also claims that but for her employment, she would not have been eating lunch at that location, nor would she have come to Ms. Walker’s aid.
