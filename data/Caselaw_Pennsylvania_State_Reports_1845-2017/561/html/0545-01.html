The source of the captain’s information is unknown. Two and one-half hours later, the officers proceeded to the designated area in a marked police cruiser and observed Appellant, Abdul Zhahir (“Zhahir”), standing in front of a Chinese restaurant, wearing clothing matching the description. Upon seeing the officers, Zhahir turned, walked into the restaurant, and appeared to throw something on the floor with his left hand. The officers. were able to view Zhahir’s actions through the window and door to the restaurant, and such conduct was consistent with the officers’ experience that individuals trafficking in narcotics often attempt to abandon their contraband when seen by the police. The officers drove past the restaurant and began to turn their vehicle around, at which point, they noticed Zhahir exiting the restaurant and looking both ways. When the officers pulled in front of the restaurant, Zhahir had his back to them and was bending over to retrieve something from the <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>floor in the same area where previously he appeared to have discarded an item. Officer Singletary got out of the vehicle and approached Zhahir, who turned to face the officer with his left hand in his jacket pocket. Officer Singletary asked Zhahir what was in his pocket, immediately grabbed Zhahir’s left hand and pocket at the same time, and “felt what formed the consistency of a bundle of caps” (vials of cocaine). Officer Singletary then seized a plastic bag from Zhahir’s jacket pocket, which contained 98 vials of crack cocaine, the total weight of which was 3.70 grams. Zhahir was charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance and unlawful possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(16), (30).</p>
    <p id="b715-4" data-blocks='[["BL_715.5",715,[134,959,1157,1326]]]'>Prior to trial, Zhahir moved to suppress, arguing that the police lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him and, in the alternative, that in seizing the drugs, Officer Singletary exceeded the scope of a permissible frisk for weapons. The trial court denied the motion, finding that the information the officers received from their captain, the fact that Zhahir matched the description, and Zhahir’s suspicious activity upon observation provided a reasonable suspicion that criminality was afoot. The trial court also determined that the seizure of the contraband was proper pursuant to the “plain feel” doctrine, as it occurred during a permissible frisk for weapons, and the perceived consistency of the vials, the surrounding circumstances, and Officer Singletary’s experience allowed him to reasonably conclude that what he felt was a controlled substance. Following a jury trial, Petitioner was found guilty and was sentenced to a period of incarceration of three to six years. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion, reasoning that the stop of Zhahir was justified based upon the information provided to the officers and Zhahir’s suspicious behavior, police had not exceeded the permissible scope of the frisk for weapons, and the seizure of the drugs was permissible under the plain feel doctrine. This Court allowed appeal to consider whether the plain feel doctrine harmonizes with Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.</p>

Furthermore, the frisk occurred in an area noted for drug activity and the officer felt what he immediately perceived as numerous (98) vials of cocaine, which was consistent with cocaine packaging he had encountered in previous narcotics cases. Significantly, given the number and nature of the containers, their presence was not equally consistent with legitimate purposes. <em>Cf.

Moreover, although the description of the Appellant may have been corroborated, there was no similar corroboration of any “assertion of illegality.” The fact that the tip, if true, described the illegal activity of drug dealing in a high crime area, does not transform the innocent act of dropping and retrieving an object into evidence demonstrating that criminal activity is afoot. Had the officers not received the anonymous information from their captain, Appellant’s evasive conduct would not <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>have alerted them to drug activity. The overriding factor here is that Appellant was in a high crime area and drugs were ultimately recovered. These are impermissible factors upon which to find reasonable suspicion to warrant government intrusion.</p>

The record establishes that the arresting officers received unverified information from their captain that a male, wearing a green jacket and blue jeans, was selling narcotics on a particular street in Philadelphia. The officers did not respond until two and one-half hours later and then observed Appellant in the designated area, standing in front of a Chinese restaurant, wearing clothing matching the description. The officers observed Appellant enter the restaurant, drop an object upon seeing police and return outside. Appellant went back into the restaurant and apparently retrieved the object when the police approached.</p>

The stop in <em>J.L. </em>was premised solely on the information contained in the anonymous tip, while the officers in the instant case relied on the anonymous information as well as Appellant's conduct in dropping and retrieving an object upon seeing police. This distinction is not controlling, however, as the additional information is meaningless unless the unconfirmed report of drug dealing is taken as true.</p>
