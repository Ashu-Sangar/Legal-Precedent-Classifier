The matter proceeded to compulsory judicial arbitration pursuant to Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 1301-1361. On August 7, 1997, a board of arbitrators issued an award in favor of Stellar and against Keystone in the amount of $55,-782.62, plus interest and costs, and the clerk of courts made a contemporaneous entry on the docket reflecting such issuance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On August 11, 1997, the clerk provided notice to the parties and, apparently, made a docket entry concerning the provision of notice on even date.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Although Keystone failed to lodge an appeal in the common pleas court (functioning as a statutory appeals court vested with the authority to conduct a trial <em>de </em>novo) within thirty days after the physical entry of the award on the docket, it filed a notice of appeal on September 10, 1997, within thirty days after the docketing of the notice. Thereafter, Stellar filed a motion to quash the appeal as untimely, which the common pleas court granted on the basis that the August 7th notation concerning the issuance of the award triggered the commencement of the thirty-day appeal period. A molded judgment in the amount of $67,595.69 was entered against Keystone, and Keystone filed a notice of appeal in the Superior Court, which affirmed in an unpublished opinion for the reason identified by the common pleas court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>Presently, Keystone maintains its argument that the period allowed for appeal does not commence until an entry is made upon the docket confirming that the required notice has been provided to the parties. In significant part, Keystone relies upon Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 108(b), which establishes such a rule with respect to appeals lodged in the appellate courts, contending that this rule is also directly applicable to appeals to the common pleas courts, as it applies by its terms to any matter subject to the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure. Stellar emphasizes the jurisdictional nature of the time limits established for the filing of a notice of appeal; argues that the express scope of the Rules of Appellate Procedure is limited to the governance of appeals lodged in the <em>appellate </em>courts; and notes the absence of a corollary to Rule 108(b) within the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, which expressly govern review by the <em>common pleas </em>courts of awards in matters subject to compulsory judicial arbitration.</p>

In its memorandum opinion, the Superior Court also considered an issue concerning the timing of the entry of the molded judgment, deeming such entry premature as the common pleas court entered the judgment prior to the entry of its order quashing Keystone's appeal. Thus, the Superior Court held that the judgment itself was void and must be stricken. The Superior Court's decision in this regard has not been questioned in this appeal. We note, however, that, although the Superior Court's order struck the judgment, the present appeal contains a live controversy, since the Superior Court's order did not <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>undermine the underlying arbitration award, on which a proper judgment may ultimately be entered once the matter has ripened.</p>
