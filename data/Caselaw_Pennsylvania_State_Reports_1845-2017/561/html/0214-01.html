Subsequently, Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>application for post-conviction relief and sought the appointment of counsel. After Appellant’s initial counsel withdrew, the trial court appointed new post-conviction counsel on June 24,1991.

Appellant sought both to supplement this amended PCRA petition and to have hew PCRA counsel appointed. The trial court denied both requests and on March 26, 1993, denied Appellant’s amended PCRA petition without a hearing. Appellant, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appealed this dismissal to this Court, raising the.three issues that PCRA counsel included in the amended PCRA petition and twenty-seven claims that were not raised in the petition, including numerous claims of ineffectiveness of PCRA counsel.

He argues that he was denied his right to counsel on appeal from the denial of his first PCRA petition and was compelled to proceed <em>pro se </em>on that appeal without having made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel. He contends that the refusal of the trial court to appoint new counsel for him amounted to governmental interference with the preparation and presentation of his present claims, thus qualifying under the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i) exception. Moreover, Appellant asserts that he could not have been aware of the existence of these claims of trial court error and prior counsel’s ineffectiveness because he possessed only a layman’s knowledge of the law and could not identify his current claims until present counsel undertook his representation. Accordingly, Appellant maintains that the exception contained in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h) applies. Appellant further contends that he satisfied the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2) because he filed this petition within sixty days of his representation by current counsel, which, according to Appellant, was the earliest moment that his present claims could have been asserted. Relying on this argument in his second issue, Appellant contends that the petition was not untimely and that the court has <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>jurisdiction to review all of the claims presented in his petition.</p>

Appellant’s nineteenth issue raises a layered ineffectiveness claim, contending that all previous counsel were ineffective for failing to present the claims identified in issues four through eighteen. Appellant’s twentieth and twenty-first issues request relief based on the cumulative deficiencies in the prior proceedings and seek an evidentiary hearing to develop Appellant’s present claims. In his third issue, Appellant argues that he was denied his right to counsel on appeal from the denial of his first PCRA petition and was compelled to proceed <em>pro se </em>without having made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel.</p>

In so doing, we note that the essence of Appellant’s claims relate to prior counsels’ (both trial counsel and PCRA counsel) alleged ineffectiveness for failing to raise in the prior proceedings the claims that Appellant presently asserts. Appellant’s strategy in framing his issues in this manner is apparent: assuming that he successfully argues application of the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)® and (ii) exceptions to the one-year time limitation, he nevertheless must show that his specific claims were neither previously litigated nor waived. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544. We have held that properly layered claims of ineffective assistance of counsel survive the waiver bar of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(b). <em>See Commonwealth v.

Our <em>review </em>of Appellant’s present claims demonstrate that they relate to alleged errors discernable from the trial court record or to trial counsel’s failure to present defenses or mitigation evidence that were purportedly available at the time of Appellant’s trial. As we have stated previously, the allegation of ineffectiveness of counsel for failure to put forward available claims does not excuse compliance with the timeliness requirements of the PCRA. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>Beasley, <a href="/pa/559/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="559 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="837192" data-case-paths="/pa/559/0604-01">559 Pa. 604</a>, <a href="/a2d/741/1258-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="741 A.2d 1258" data-case-ids="11658193,837192" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/1258-01,/pa/559/0604-01">741 A.2d 1258</a>, 1260 (1999). Therefore, the 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(h) exception does not apply where the petitioner merely alleges that more competent counsel would have presented other claims based on a better evaluation of the facts available to him or her at the time of trial, and we reject Appellant’s contention that the “facts” which form the bases of these claims were not knowable until he was advised of their existence by present counsel.</p>

Jiuliante, who had issued the March 26, 1993 order, was on senior judge assignment with the Commonwealth Court. Pursuant to our remand order, Judge DiSantis conducted a status conference. At that conference, Robert B. Dunham, Esquire, an attorney for the now-defunct Pennsylvania Capital Resource Center, presented the PCRA court with an unfiled motion on behalf of the Appellant requesting another status conference. Although Mr. Dunham had not filed an entry of appearance, the PCRA court permitted Mr. Dunham to represent the Appellant at a second status conference. At that status conference, Mr. Dunham requested permission to file an amended PCRA petition or, alternatively, permission to file a brief for Appellant. The PCRA court denied those requests. <em>See Commonwealth v.
