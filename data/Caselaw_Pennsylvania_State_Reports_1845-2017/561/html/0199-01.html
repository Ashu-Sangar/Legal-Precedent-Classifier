Le-Le returned to the house with Weston (hereafter appellee) at his side. Appellee, armed with a gun, entered the house and asked Le-Le, “which one was it?” The decedent stood up.

In addition, any implication by the <em>Correa </em>court, that voluntary manslaughter does not involve an intentional killing, is similarly flawed, as both statutory language and case law make clear that a conviction for voluntary manslaughter necessarily entails proof of intent. 18,Pa.C.S. § 2503(b); <em>see also Mason, infra; Butcher, infra.</em>

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we find that the Superior Court erred, as a matter of law, in resolving the sufficiency of the evidence analysis on the basis of <em>Coma. </em>Although we would normally remand to the intermediate appellate court to apply the correct legal analysis, since the instant case involves a question of law, in the interest of justice, we now perform a sufficiency of the evidence analysis related to each of appellee’s convictions.</p>

In the instant case, the evidence established that Le-Le argued with the decedent. Following the argument, Le-Le solicited appellee’s help to confront the decedent and appellee and Le-Le armed themselves before going to the decedents. These facts, combined with the fact that appellee and Le-Le in fact employed the weapons to harm the decedent, warranted a finding by the trial judge that appellee and Le-Le had a shared intent to harm, or at least to threaten, the decedent. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to establish the shared criminal intent required for criminal conspiracy.</p>
