The charges arose from insurance claims submitted by Batoff to State Farm Insurance Company (State Farm) requesting payment for treatment of forty-four different persons, each of-whom was insured by a State Farm automobile policy. In each case, the insured had been involved in an auto accident and claimed psychological injury derived from that event.

On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed, finding that the record did not support the Psychology Board’s determination of Batoffs violations, and that, in reaching its conclusions, the Psychology Board improperly substituted its own independent judgment for the expert testimony presented before the Hearing Examiner.</p>

Additionally, the Psychology Board noted that Batoffs own expert, Dr. Adelman, testified that the training Batoff received under his supervision included no psychological testing. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s conclusions, the Psychology Board did not ignore or discount Dr. Bersoffs and Dr. Adelman’s opinions.

Upon reviewing the data and the resulting reports, the Psychology Board found the quality of Batoffs “reports alone support these charges.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 40.

Ultimately, the Psychology Board concurred with Paul’s opinion as it related to Batoffs report writing skills and his apparent failure, during the time period in question, to recognize the boundaries of his competence and to meet professional standards. Paul’s testimony therefore only further validated the Psychology Board’s own independent conclusions regarding Batoffs competence. Thus, the Psychology Board neither relied on nor discredited altogether Paul’s opinion, but merely set it aside until the Board reviewed Batoffs work directly.</p>

In part, Batoff's credentials were in question because Batoff received his Ph.D. from an institution not regionally accredited. This fact was not a consideration by the Psychology Board, however, as such accreditation did not prevent Batoff from qualifying, when he did, to be licensed in this Commonwealth, or from referring to himself as a Ph.D. It is therefore not in respect to the Ph.D. nomenclature that the Psychology Board found that Batoff misrepresented his credentials but rather that he was empirically incompetent to do the psychological evaluations he submitted to the insurance company and to administer the underlying tests.</p>

The Board found, <em>inter alia, </em>that many of the reports in question contained no discussion regarding the nature and extent of an insured's specific injuries, whether or not the insureds were receiving treatment from any other providers or whether additional evaluation and/or treatment was recommended. Furthermore, the assessments lacked distinctive qualities in both form and content, making one report indistinguishable from the next. In addition, while Batoff gave virtually the same battery of tests to each of the insureds, the reports contained no test scores and failed to identify any norms used to evaluate the individual. There was also no description of, or reference to, the insureds' pre-accident medical history or developmental history. Psychology Board Adjudication at 40-41. The Board also specifically cited the unprofessional administration of two tests, evidence of which is disputed by the Commonwealth Court. The Board found that one test was given to an adult insured whose answer sheet showed that he only partially completed the test, rendering any conclusions based thereon invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 42-44. The other was an adult achievement test the Board found was mistakenly given to a four-year-old instead of the appropriate Children's Apperception Test. <em>Id. </em>at 45-46. The Board therefore found that the evaluation reports in these two cases consisted primarily of conclusory statements without valid substantiating documentation to support such statements.</p>
