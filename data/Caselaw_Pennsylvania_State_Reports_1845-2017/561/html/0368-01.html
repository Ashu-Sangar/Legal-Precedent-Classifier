The anonymous caller stated that a black man named Tony would be driving a white van on Piney Ridge Road and that Tony would have cocaine and marijuana in his possession. The anonymous caller gave the officer the van’s license plate number. The state police checked the number and learned that the van was registered to Appellant Anthony Wimbush. After also learning where Wimbush lived, they called the police in his area to notify them and found out that Wimbush was suspected of drug activity in his county.</p>

An officer watched the van and the others took positions on other parts of the road. When the van left the trailer, the observing officer contacted the others by radio. These officers followed the van and stopped it at an intersection. Another officer approached the passenger side and when he saw Wimbush reach between the bucket seats, he shined his flashlight on the van floor.

The anonymous caller asserted that a black male, wearing a white shirt and white shorts, would exit the complex with drugs in his possession and get onto a girl’s black bicycle.</p>

Once White reached the street, Officer Matthews stopped him, questioned him briefly about the anonymous call, and began to pat him down for weapons. The officer testified that White appeared nervous during this detention and that before she could finish her pat-down search, he ran from her. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Floyd Newingham saw White, ordered him to stop and directed him to walk towards him. As White approached Sergeant Newingham, he dropped a bag containing sixteen individually-wrapped bags of crack cocaine. Sergeant Newingham placed White under arrest.</p>

White even refers to Pennsylvania’s “strong right of privacy,” asserting that Pennsylvania’s view of privacy is applicable to his case.</p>

The applicable law, therefore, is our decisions in <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Hawkins.</em>

The anonymous caller in <em>Wimbush </em>indicated that a black man would be driving a white van with a specified registration number on Piney Ridge Road and would have drugs in his possession. The fact that police discovered this particular van on Piney Ridge Road being driven by a black man is predictive of nothing since the van was there from the beginning of police surveillance.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[139,890,1157,839]]]'>However, the Commonwealth asserts that the stop was permissible under Pennsylvania law because the arresting police called police in the area where Wimbush lived and were told that he was a suspect in drug activity. This, according to the Commonwealth, is independent corroboration of the anonymous tip. I cannot agree that such information validates the stop for two reasons. First, the anonymous tip provided no information except that the van and driver were located at a particular location. Since the van was already on Piney Ridge Road when police arrived, separate information as to suspected drug activity gives the police nothing except that the driver is a suspected drug dealer. Secondly, the call from one police department to the other was made after the stop had been ordered. Information validating the stop which arrives after the stop had been already decided upon cannot serve to justify the stop.</p>

One wonders how else police officers can advance cases such as these without asking questions of the suspects. The only possible alternative here was to allow the suspects to pass on unimpeded and follow them in an attempt to discover direct evidence of criminal conduct. But following suspects further would most likely yield no rewards unless the suspects were so simple-minded as to carry on their criminal activity in public. To say that the officers could have procured the cooperation of other witnesses is to ignore the reality that gives rise to <em>anonymous </em>reports of criminality to begin with— namely, citizens are frequently in mortal fear of drug dealers, and often with good reason. One can only conclude that there will frequently be <em>nothing </em>that officers can do in the wake of this opinion to justify an investigative stop. Instead, they must allow criminal activity to go forth unabated, even when concerned but fearful citizens try to alert them to such criminal activity, when they first corroborate the predictive information supplied by these citizens, and when all they seek to do is ask questions.</p>
