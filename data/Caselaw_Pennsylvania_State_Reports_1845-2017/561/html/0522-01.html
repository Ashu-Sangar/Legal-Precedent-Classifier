For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Fifth Amendment does not preclude a criminal defendant from having to submit to an independent pretrial psychiatric examination under these circumstances.

In either case, the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the government from gaining a balanced perspective of the defendant’s psychological makeup. The Fifth Amendment does not spring to life merely because a defendant’s intentions to use psychiatric testimony have been expressed orally rather than through a formal filing, or because the psychiatric testimony will be used in an effort to reduce the defendant’s culpability at sentencing rather than at trial.

The better practice, one that fully protects whatever residual Fifth Amendment claim can be said to be implicated, is that provided for in the federal rule: that providing the information to the prosecution is not a license to use it. The trial court must merely be receptive, as it is in countless other Fifth Amendment situations in which evidence has been ruled either inadmissible or conditionally admissible, to objections that the prosecution is attempting to use the information improperly. If the defendant believes that the prosecution is improperly seeking to introduce evidence that it derived from the government’s psychiatric examination, then the defendant may make that objection. The trial court will then be required to exclude the evidence unless the prosecution carries its burden of establishing that the evidence originated from an independent, untainted source. <em>See Alderman v.

But there being, in my view, no Fifth Amendment issue unless and until the prosecution improperly attempts to use the information at trial, I see no practicalities to weigh. In any event, even if there were a Fifth Amendment concern present, the Majority’s solution disregards the realities of trial. Depending upon the contents of the sealed examination report, the Commonwealth or the defendant, or both, may need to conduct further investigation. Indeed, this is particularly likely for the defendant, because the Commonwealth’s expert at least knows what is in the defendant’s expert’s report as well as in his own report. On the other hand, the defendant will have to have the report reviewed by his own expert in order to effectively make use of or to counter the results and to cross-examine the witnesses. Thus, the defense as well as the Commonwealth will be hampered in the ability to prepare effectively for the penalty phase of trial, raising the prospect of significant delay and inconvenience.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> To hold that the report must be sealed is to return to the now discredited days of trial by ambush and surprise rather than the modern <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>theory of open discovery and pre-trial announcement of defenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a>

On the other hand, determining the admissibility of evidence is an integral part of the trial court’s responsibility at trial; I fail to see how challenges to trial evidence on the ground that it was derived from the then-inadmissible psychiatric examination report will cause any more delay in the proceedings than rulings on hearsay, the authenticity of documents, or any of a myriad of other evidentiary issues faced by trial courts on a daily basis.</p>
