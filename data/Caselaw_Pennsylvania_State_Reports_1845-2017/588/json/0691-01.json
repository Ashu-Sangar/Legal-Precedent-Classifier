        "text": "OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nWe granted allocatur in this case to consider the extent to which courts can limit parents from advocating religious beliefs that, if acted upon, would constitute criminal conduct.\nFacts and Procedural History\nStanley M. Shepp (Father) and Tracey L. Shepp, a/k/a Tracey L. Roberts (Mother) married in June of 1992. They converted to the Mormon faith prior to their marriage. Their child, Kaylynne Marie Shepp (Kaylynne), whose custody is at issue in this case, was born on February 3, 1993. The parties separated in April of 2000, and they divorced in February of 2001. Shortly after the divorce, the Mormon Church excommunicated Father because he is a fundamentalist who believes in polygamy.\nFollowing the parties\u2019 separation, Kaylynne lived with Mother and her three other daughters from previous marriages. On January 2, 2002, Father filed a Petition seeking an order of shared legal and physical custody of Kaylynne. The trial court issued an Interim Order for Custody on January 30, 2002, which provided that the parties would share legal custody and that Mother would have primary physical custody. The Interim Order notes, \u201cFather\u2019s position is that he requests primary physical custody, although the Petition does indicate shared physical custody.\u201d Order dated January 30, 2002, at 3.\nThe trial court held a hearing on May 6, 2002. Father testified that he practices Mormon fundamentalism and the teachings of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. He further stated that fundamentalism \u201cincludes plural marriage.\u201d Notes of Testimony (N.T.), dated May 6, 2002, at 72. He testified that he has not set a limit on the number of wives he would like to have, but would have no problem with additional wives if they love his family and get along. Id. at 107. With respect to discussing plural marriage with Kaylynne, Father stated that he has told the child of the possibility that she could have another mother who comes into the family through plural marriage. Id. at 75. He indicated his belief that it is important for children to know, while they are young, about any lifestyle the family may practice, rather than to \u201call of a sudden pop something on them like that\u201d when they are seventeen. Id. When asked if he would try to marry Kaylynne into a polygamist relationship, he replied that he would not, but that in order for her to be happy, she has to have choices, and that as a father it is his job to help her learn about and understand alternatives. Id. at 77-78. Father\u2019s current wife testified that she accepts the idea of plural marriage and that she is comfortable with the idea of participating in a family with more than one mother. She stated that there are no plans at the present time for her marriage to become a plural marriage. Id. at 123.\nMother testified that Father\u2019s belief in polygamy was the reason for the parties\u2019 divorce. She stated that Father would like to have five wives, id. at 13, and expressed concerns that he would introduce Kaylynne to men so that she would be ready to engage in polygamy once she reaches the age of thirteen. Id. at 16. She stated that she did not wish her daughter to interact with polygamist families or \u201cto be taught polygamy in any way.\u201d Id.\nManda Lee (Manda), Mother\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, testified that when she was thirteen years old, Father (who is her stepfather) told her \u201cthat if you didn\u2019t practice polygamy or you didn\u2019t agree with it, but mostly if you didn\u2019t practice it, that you were going to hell.\u201d Id. at 164. She further testified that Father told her that in Pennsylvania a fourteen-year old can get married with a parent\u2019s permission, and \u201csince I was already living in the house and we were already related, that it would be a good idea for us to be married.\u201d Id. at 165. On rebuttal, Father denied Manda\u2019s allegation that' he suggested they participate in a polygamous relationship. Id. at 175.\nAt the conclusi\u00f3n of the hearing, the trial court noted:\nContact [between a parent and a child] can be limited only when the parent has been shown to suffer from severe mental or moral deficiencies that constitute a grave threat to the child.\nWhile we may have evidence of moral deficiency of [F]ather because of his belief in having multiple wives, there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\nId. at 180. In its final Order, the court awarded joint legal custody to both parents, and primary physical custody to Mother. Noting that the parties had raised Kaylynne in the Mormon faith, the court directed, \u201cthe child will continue with that religious upbringing.\u201d Id. at 181. However, the court ordered, \u201cFather is specifically prohibited while the child is a minor from teaching her about polygamy, plural marriages or multiple wives.\u201d Id.\nFather filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, which affirmed the decision of the trial court. However, the Superi- or Court disagreed with the conclusion of the trial court, stating, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s factual findings as to the nature of the practice endorsed by [Father] and as to [Father\u2019s] own character render its conclusion that [Father] poses no grave threat to his daughter both erroneous and unreasonable.\u201d Shepp v. Shepp, 821 A.2d 635, 638 (Pa.Super.2003). The Superior Court made this determination based on the following facts elicited during the testimony of Father\u2019s stepdaughter, which the trial court and the Superior Court deemed credible:\n[Father\u2019s] promotion of his beliefs to his stepdaughter involved not merely the superficial exposure of a child to the theoretical notion of criminal conduct, but constituted a vigorous attempt at moral suasion and recruitment by threats of future punishment. The child was, in fact, warned that only by committing an illicit act could she comply with the requirements of her religion.\nId. The court further expressed concern that Father\u2019s intention to inculcate a belief in polygamy in his own daughter \u201cmay perhaps, as the child matures, even become insistence that she engage in such conduct.\u201d Id. While recognizing the difference between discussion and coercion, the court held that the best interests of the child would be served by restricting Father from discussing polygamy with Kaylynne until she is eighteen years old.\nDiscussion\nThis case implicates two highly important values: the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the public policy of this Commonwealth, as set forth in Section 5301 of the Domestic Relations Code, \u201cwhen in the best interest of the child, to assure a reasonable and continuing contact of the child with both parents after a separation or dissolution of the marriage and a sharing of the rights and responsibilities of child rearing by both parents.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301.\nThe essence of Father\u2019s position is that he is simply a parent who wishes to share his sincere religious beliefs with his child. In support of his view that the courts may not interfere with this right, he relies on Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). In Yoder, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which held that the convictions of Amish parents for violating the State\u2019s compulsory school attendance law were invalid pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although the relevant statute required that all children between the ages of seven and sixteen attend school, Yoder and other parents refused to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade. The United States Supreme Court recognized the importance of the State\u2019s interest in universal education, but nevertheless concluded that such interest \u201cis not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children.\u201d Id. at 214, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Furthermore, \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise' of religion.\u201d Id. at 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526.\nBased on a review of the record, the United States Supreme Court noted that the Amish way of life, which the parents wished to maintain by prohibiting formal education beyond the eighth grade, was a matter of deep religious conviction. The Court stated:\n[T]he Court\u2019s holding in Pierce [v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) ] stands as a charter of the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. And, when the interests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record, more than merely a \u2018reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State\u2019 is required to sustain the validity of the State\u2019s requirement under the First Amendment.\nId. at 233, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Unchallenged expert testimony established that the \u201cenforcement of the State\u2019s requirement of compulsory formal education after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d Id. at 219, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The United States Supreme Court determined that exposing Amish children to the worldly influences of secondary school \u201ccontravenes the basic religious tenets and practice of the Amish faith, both as to the parent and the child.\u201d Id. at 218, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The State maintained that its interest in compulsory education was \u201cso compelling that even the established religious practices of the Amish must give way.\u201d Id. at 221, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The Court disagreed, noting that \u201c[w]here fundamental claims of religious freedom are at stake ... we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote____\u201d Id. Because the record established that persons who practice the Amish faith are able to fulfill their responsibilities of citizenship without compulsory education beyond the eighth grade, and receive vocational education that allows them to be self-reliant, the Court determined that Yoder had introduced \u201cpersuasive evidence undermining the arguments the State ha[d] advanced to support its claims in terms of the welfare of the child and society as a whole.\u201d Id. at 234, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The United States Supreme Court concluded by explaining that accommodating the religious objections of the Amish by foregoing an additional year or two of secondary education would not impair the health of the children or in any way harm society.\nIn the case sub judice, Father asserts that where the State interferes in matters of religious speech between parent and child, such action is subject to strict scrutiny, or a showing that a compelling governmental interest outweighs the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions concerning a child\u2019s upbringing.\nMother disagrees with Father\u2019s position that polygamy is a constitutionally protected practice within a religious context. In the nineteenth century, the United States Supreme Court issued four decisions in which it took a firm position against Mormon polygamy: Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878); Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885); Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890); Late Corp. of the Church of Latter Day-Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 792, 34 L.Ed. 478 (1890). See, Keith E. Sealing, Polygamists Out of the Closet: Statutory and State Constitutional Prohibitions Against Polygamy are Unconstitutional Under the Free Exercise Clause, 17 Ga. St. U.L.Rev. 691, 710-710 (2001). The Reynolds Court referred to polygamy as \u201codious among the northern and western nations of Europe.\u201d Reynolds, 98 U.S. at 164. The Late Corp. Court stated that Mormon polygamy is \u201ca crime against the laws, and abhorrent to the sentiments and feelings of the civilized world.\u201d 186 U.S. at 48, 10 S.Ct. 792. In Davis, the Court upheld a law in the territory of Idaho that required an individual registering to vote to swear or affirm, inter alia, that he was not a bigamist or a polygamist, was not a member of an order that practices bigamy or polygamy, and that he did not and would not counsel or advise others to commit bigamy or polygamy. The Court stated:\nBigamy and polygamy ... are crimes by the laws of the United States, and they are crimes by the laws of Idaho.... If they are crimes, then to teach, advise, and counsel their practice is to aid in their commission, and such teaching and counseling are themselves criminal, and proper subjects of punishment, as aiding and abetting crime are in all other cases.\nDavis, 133 U.S. at 341-42, 10 S.Ct. 299.\nPlural marriage is a crime in Pennsylvania. Section 4301 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4301 provides:\n(a) Bigamy. \u2014 A married person is guilty of bigamy, a misdemeanor of the second degree, if he contracts or purports to \u25a0 contract another marriage, unless at the time of the subsequent marriage:\n(1) the actor believes that the prior spouse is dead;\n(2) the actor and the prior spouse have been living apart for two consecutive years throughout which the prior spouse was not known by the actor to be alive; or\n(3) a court has entered a judgment purporting to terminate or annul any prior disqualifying marriage, and the actor does not know that judgment to be invalid.\n(b) Other party to bigamous marriage. \u2014 A person is guilty of bigamy if he contracts or purports to contract marriage with another knowing that the other is thereby committing bigamy.\nIn the instant matter, the illegal nature of polygamy becomes important when determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to Father\u2019s free exercise claim. The decision of the United States Supreme Court in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) (Smith II), is critical to this issue. Alfred Smith (Smith) and Galen Black (Black) were fired from their employment with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote while participating in a religious ceremony of the Native American Church. Pursuant to the relevant Oregon statute, persons in possession of peyote are guilty of a felony. Smith and Black applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which the Employment Division denied because their employer had discharged them for work-related misconduct. The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed based on its conclusion that the denial of benefits violated the free exercise rights of Smith and Black as protected by the First Amendment. The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the criminality of the use of peyote was irrelevant because the purpose of the misconduct provision, pursuant to which the Employment Division denied relief, was not to enforce criminal laws, but to preserve the financial stability of the unemployment compensation fund. The Oregon Supreme Court held that this purpose did not justify the burden that denial of compensation placed on the religious practice of Smith and Black. On appeal, Employment Division, Department of Human Re sources of Oregon v. Smith, 485 U.S. 660, 108 S.Ct. 1444, 99 L.Ed.2d 753 (1988) (Smith I), the United States Supreme Court held, \u201cif a State has prohibited through its criminal laws certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating the First Amendment, it certainly follows that it may impose the lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to persons who engage in that conduct.\u201d Id. at 670, 108 S.Ct. 1444. However, because the Oregon Supreme Court had not determined whether an exception to the controlled substance law existed for the sacramental use of peyote, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to the Oregon Supreme Court for further proceedings. On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that there was no sacramental use exception to the criminal statute. It then determined that the prohibition was invalid pursuant to the Free Exercise Clause and, accordingly, reaffirmed its previous ruling..\nThe Employment Division again sought certiorari, which the United States Supreme Court granted. The Court, in an Opinion by Justice Scalia, reversed, determining that the Sherberi test, which requires a compelling government interest, does not apply where the challenged State action that is claimed to inhibit the free exercise of religion is a generally applicable criminal law. The Court noted:\nThe government\u2019s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, \u2018cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector\u2019s spiritual development.\u2019 To make an individual\u2019s obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s interest is \u201ccompelling\u201d \u2014 permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, \u2018to become a law unto himself,\u2019 Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. at 167 \u2014 contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\nSmith II, 494 U.S. at 885, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (internal citation omitted).\nLike the Oregon law prohibiting the use of peyote, the Pennsylvania statute prohibiting bigamy is a law of general application. Therefore, pursuant to Smith II, a neutral law criminalizing polygamy overrides a claim that such law places an improper limitation on the free exercise of religion. Based on Smith II, Mother asserts, \u201c[s]ince 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4301 is a valid and otherwise neutral law, it follows that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the right to enforce, regulate, and prohibit such conduct or speech that may be incidental to such conduct, whether it be the use of peyote, enforcement of social security taxes, or the practice of polygamy.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 14 (citation modified).\nSmith II further recognized:\nThe only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press ... or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), to direct the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972)....\n494 U.S. at 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Justice Scalia referred to such claims as presenting \u201ca hybrid situation[,]\u201d id. at 882, 110 S.Ct. 1595 which is subject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 881 n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (reaffirming a higher level of scrutiny for cases involving a free exercise claim made in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as the right of a parent to direct the upbringing and education of his child). The instant matter, combining free exercise claims with the fundamental right of parents to raise their children, is a hybrid case. As such, Smith II, which presents a \u201cfree exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right;\u201d id., does not directly answer the question of whether a court may prohibit a parent from advocating religious beliefs, which, if acted upon, would constitute a crime.\nIn light of the fact that Smith II does not apply to hybrid cases, we must reject the position advanced by Mother that a court may prohibit a parent from discussing religious beliefs with a child solely because acting upon those beliefs would result in the commission of a crime. Instead, we believe that Yoder provides the appropriate standard by which to consider the issue before us. As previously noted, \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Based on the record before us, it is clear that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in promoting compliance with the statute criminalizing bigamy is not an interest of the \u201chighest order\u201d that would supersede the interest of a parent in speaking to a child about a deeply held aspect of his faith. However, this does not end our inquiry because Yoder also provides:\nTo be sure, the power of the parent, even when linked to a free exercise claim, may be subject to limitation under Prince [v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944),] if it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.\nId. at 233-34, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Yoder recognized that government has an interest in protecting \u201cthe physical or mental health of the child.\u201d Id. at 230, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Applying strict scrutiny,\n\u201cThe Government may ... regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. We have recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\u201d\nSable Communications of California v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 98 (1989). The state\u2019s compelling interest to protect a child in any given case, however, is not triggered unless a court finds that a parent\u2019s speech is causing or will cause harm to a child\u2019s welfare. Cf. Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727, 765-66, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996).\nIn the instant matter, the trial court determined that Father believed in polygamy, and that acting on that belief \u201cwould be not only illegal in Pennsylvania, but would also be immoral and illogical.\u201d N.T., May 6, 2002, at 179. The court noted that Father had approached his stepdaughter and \u201cinformed her that she would go to hell if she did not believe in polygamy,\u201d id. at 180, and that the stepdaughter recalled that Father \u201chad suggested that when she became of age, that they would perhaps be married.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, the trial court stated that there was, \u201cno evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\u201d Notes of Testimony, May 6, 2002 at 181. Engaging in speculation that Father\u2019s statements to his stepdaughter might lead to insistence that his own child engage in polygamy, the Superior Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court, and concluded that the teaching of plural marriage constituted a grave threat. In light of the fact that the trial court did not find a grave threat, it erred in restricting Father from teaching Kaylynne about polygamy.\nBy their very nature, decisions involving child custody must focus on the character and conduct of the individual parents and children involved. Accordingly, there may be instances where restricting a parent from teaching a child about a sincere religious belief involving illegal conduct is appropriate. However, we emphasize that the illegality of the proposed conduct on its own is not sufficient to warrant the restriction. Where, as in the instant matter, there is no finding that discussing such matters constitutes a grave threat of harm to the child, there is insufficient basis for the court to infringe on a parent\u2019s constitutionally protected right to speak to a child about religion as he or she sees fit.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, we conclude that a court may prohibit a parent from advocating religious beliefs, which, if acted upon, would constitute a crime. However, pursuant to Yoder, it may do so only where it is established that advocating the prohibited conduct would jeopardize the physical or mental health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens. Because such harm was not established in this case, there was no constitutional basis for the state\u2019s intrusion in the form of the trial court\u2019s Order placing a prohibition on Father\u2019s speech. That being the case, the second facet of the strict scrutiny test \u2014 whether the trial court\u2019s Order was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling end \u2014 was not implicated. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion.\n. The official name of the Mormon Church is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n. \u201c \u2018Mormon Fundamentalism\u2019 denotes the beliefs and practices of contemporaiy schismatic groups that claim to follow the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Fundamentalist movement began after the issuance of the Manifesto of 1890, which publicly declared an official end to plural marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Fundamentalists held that God requires all \u2018true\u2019 believers to abide by the principle of polygamy, irrespective of Church mandate. ... The thread that binds all Fundamentalists together is their belief that the LDS Church has improperly changed doctrines and practices.\" Abstracted from J. Max Anderson, \"Fundamentalists\" in Encyclopedia of Mormonism, ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1992), 2:531-32. Abstract prepared by Brigham Young University Studies staff and interns at ht1p://ldsfaq.byu.edu/view. asp?q=316 (last visited January 19, 2006).\n. Father\u2019s testimony was as follows:\nQuestion: As part of your fundamentalist Mormon philosophy, would you try to marry off Kaylynne into a polygamist relationship?\nAnswer: There is no way. Kaylynne has the same agency that anybody has. I can\u2019t marry her off any more than I could marry off anybody.\nN.T. at 77-78. In his Dissenting Opinion, Mr. Justice Baer, purporting to correct this Court as to the facts, indicates that the trial court concluded that Father \" \u2018clearly would\u2019 seek to act and use his parental control to convince Child to act illegally and immorally. Id. at 709, 906 A.2d at 1176.\u201d In making this assertion, Mr. Justice Baer quotes two words from the Opinion of the trial court, i.e., \u201cclearly would.\u201d and then supplies his interpretation. However, these two words appear in a broader passage:\nWe have also taken into consideration character, conduct, and fitness.\nBoth of the parties seem to have adequate character, conduct, and fitness, with one exception, and that is the fact that father acknowledges a belief in polygamy. That belief, if he would follow through with it, would be not only illegal in Pennsylvania, it would be immoral and illogical.\nThe issue is not having such a belief, but his interest in pursuing this belief, which the testimony indicates that he clearly would.\nTrial Court Opinion at 5. Thus, facially, it is less than evident that the court intended to memorialize a finding that Father would coerce Kaylynne into practicing polygamy. Indeed, in context it appears more plausible that the court was discussing Father\u2019s own marital plans. Moreover, to the extent that there is any ambiguity, the trial court\u2019s subsequent pronouncement clarifies the point:\nWhile we may have evidence of moral deficiency of father because of his belief in having multiple wives, there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\nId. at 6. The conclusion that there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child would be difficult to explain if the court had previously found that Father \"clearly would\u201d coerce Kaylynne into polygamy, a practice that it has already noted was \"illegal,\u201d \"immoral,\u201d and \"illogical.\u201d\n. Section 1304(b)(1) of the Marriage Law, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1304(b)(1), provides, \"No marriage license may be issued if either of the applicants for a license is under 16 years of age unless the court decides that it is to the best interest of the applicant and authorizes the issuance of the license.\u201d\n. In Yoder, the United States Supreme Court referred to Sherbert v. Vemer, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), in which the appellant, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was dismissed from her job because she refused to work on Saturday, which her religion considers the Sabbath. Unable to find employment that would not require her to work on Saturday, she sought unemployment compensation benefits. The South Carolina Employment Security Commission denied benefits because the appellant failed to accept suitable work when offered. The Court of Common Pleas for Spartan-burg County and the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Commission. The United States Supreme Court reversed. The Court effectively created a balancing test that any burden on the free exercise of the appellant\u2019s religion must be justified by a compelling state interest.\n. In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996), the United States Supreme Court stated:\nTo the extent Davis held that persons advocating a certain practice may be denied the right to vote, it is no longer good law. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). To the extent, it held that the groups designated in the statute may be deprived of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling could not stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 337, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972); cf. United States v. Brown, [381 U.S. 437, 85 S.Ct. 1707, 14 L.Ed.2d 484] (1965), United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258, [ 88 S.Ct. 419, 19 L.Ed.2d 508] (1967).\nId. at 634, 116 S.Ct. 1620 (citations modified).\n. In a Concurring Opinion, Justice O\u2019Connor expressed her belief in the continued viability of the Sherbert test, noting that \"[tjhere is nothing talismanic about neutral laws of general applicability or general criminal prohibitions, for laws neutral toward religion can coerce a person to violate his religious conscience or intrude upon his religious duties just as effectively as laws aimed at religion.\u201d Smith II, 494 U.S. at 901, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring).",

        "text": "Justice EAKIN,\nconcurs.\nI agree with the majority that the Superior Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court when it concluded the teaching of plural marriage was a grave threat, when the trial court found such teaching was not a grave threat. See Majority op., at 1173. The Superior Court\u2019s error is a sufficient basis for this Court to reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order. Botek v. Mine Safety Appliance Corp., 531 Pa. 160, 611 A.2d 1174, 1176-77 (1992) (Superior Court not free to substitute its judgment for that of trial court). However, I do not join the majority\u2019s constitutional analysis.\nIf a constitutional analysis were necessary, I have misgivings about the application of the strict scrutiny test here. This is not a case where the government, as a party, is alleged to have infringed upon another party\u2019s fundamental constitutional right. The government is not a party; the parties are the biological parents of their daughter. Each parent has a fundamental constitutional right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their daughter. See Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). Presumably, any government infringement upon either parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise daughter would require strict scrutiny be employed to evaluate such an infringement. See id., at 80, 120 S.Ct. 2054 (Thomas, J., concurring). Father wants to teach daughter about plural marriage; mother does not want daughter to be so taught. With the parents in conflict concerning how daughter should be raised in this regard and with each having an equivalent fundamental right to direct daughter\u2019s upbringing, I would conclude the fundamental rights of one parent are not superior to the fundamental rights of the other. For analytical purposes, they \u201ccross-out\u201d one another, leaving us with an analysis based on the best interests of the child' \u2014 the hallmark of every custody matter\u2014 without applying strict scrutiny.\nApplying strict scrutiny to the trial court\u2019s order based upon father\u2019s First Amendment rights gives him a tremendous advantage in the custody dispute over whether daughter should be taught about plural marriage, since the strict scrutiny test is rarely met. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 200, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (noting \u201ca law rarely survives [strict] scrutiny\u201d). However, applying strict scrutiny to the trial court order makes mother\u2019s fundamental right to raise daughter without learning about plural marriage substantially less valuable than father\u2019s fundamental right to teach her about plural marriage. To ensure that neither parent\u2019s fundamental rights are improperly devalued, I would apply a \u201ccross-out\u201d analysis that would not strictly scrutinize the trial court order, thus providing the trial court\u2019s decision appropriate deference after it applied the traditional test in custody disputes between two biological parents \u2014 determining the best interests of the child by a preponderance of the evidence. See Charles v. Stehlik, 560 Pa. 334, 744 A.2d 1255, 1258 (2000) (in custody disputes, fundamental issue is child\u2019s best interest; burden of proof shared equally in custody dispute between two biological parents).",

        "text": "justice BAER,\ndissents.\nBecause I agree with the Superior Court that the facts of record in this case furnish a showing adequate under the law to support the narrow restrictions attached to Stanley Shepp\u2019s (Father\u2019s) otherwise unrestricted partial custody of Kaylynne (Child), I would affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order upholding those restrictions. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\nTracey Roberts (Mother) and Father converted to Mormonism before their June 1992 marriage. Child was born February of 1993, and was seven years old when the parties separated in April of 2000. Mother testified that the reason for the separation was Father\u2019s conversion to what is commonly referred to as fundamentalist Mormonism, which differs from traditional Mormonism principally in its tenet that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints improperly strayed from the teachings of its founder, Joseph Smith, when it renounced polygamy. From separation, Child lived with Mother and Mother\u2019s three other daughters from previous marriages. After a February 2001 divorce, Father filed a petition seeking shared legal and physical custody of child.\nOn May 6, 2002, the trial court held a hearing to consider Father\u2019s petition. Father\u2019s belief in fundamentalist Mormonism, including its principal tenet of religiously mandated polygamy, was undisputed. Father testified that he had not set a limit on the number of wives he would like, and that his new and current wife supported him in his faith. Further, Father acknowledged that he had told Child of the possibility that she would have additional mothers. Father testified that he wishes to teach Child about polygamy because, as he sees things, her happiness depends on having choices in life and it is a father\u2019s responsibility to teach children alternatives.\nMother testified that the reason for the separation was Father\u2019s belief in polygamy, and that he had indicated his desire to take five \"wives. Mother expressed concern that Father would introduce Child to polygamy at her then current age of nine years so that she would be ready to marry into a polygamist relationship at age fourteen. Accordingly, Mother sought an order prohibiting Father from teaching polygamy.\nImportantly, Manda Lee (Manda), one of Mother\u2019s daughters from a previous marriage and Child\u2019s half-sister, testified that when she was fourteen Father told her that if she failed to practice polygamy she would go to hell. He suggested that because he and Manda were already living under the same roof, it only made sense for them to marry. While Father denied that he had suggested marriage to Manda, he did not deny her other factual averments.\nThe trial court found Manda\u2019s version of what occurred credible. Acknowledging an important distinction between Father\u2019s light to express opinions regarding illegal and immoral activities, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 430 (criminalizing polygamy), and his willingness to commit, and coerce Child to commit, such activities, the court specifically found that Father\u2019s conduct vis-a-vis Manda indicated that Father \u201cclearly would\u201d seek to act and use his parental control to convince Child to act illegally and immorally. Tr. Ct. Op., 5/6/02, at 5. With this glaring exception, the trial court found father to be an appropriate parent to Child. Accordingly, it fashioned an order granting Father partial custody subject to the sole restriction that \u201cFather is specifically prohibited while the child is a minor from teaching her about polygamy, plural marriages, or multiple wives.\u201d Notes of Testimony, 5/6/02, at 181.\nThe Superior Court accepted the trial court\u2019s factual findings, as the law requires. Further, the court agreed with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Pennsylvania law as permitting substantial curtailment of contact by a parent with his child only when such contact presents a grave threat of harm to Child, see, e.g., In re Damon B., 314 Pa.Super. 391, 460 A.2d 1196 (1983); Com. ex rel. Lotz v. Lotz, 188 Pa.Super. 241, 146 A.2d 362 (1958); cf. Zummo v. Zummo, 394 Pa.Super. 30, 574 A.2d 1130, 1157 (1990) (opinion announcing the judgment of the court) (requiring, in support of restrictions of a parent\u2019s right to instruct his child in his religious faith, a demonstration that the \u201cbelief or practice ... to be restricted actually presents a substantial threat of present or future physical or emotional harm to the [child], and that the restriction is the least intrusive means adequate to prevent the specified harm\u201d), an interpretation I find flawed for reasons I explain, infra. The Superior Court read the trial court\u2019s opinion as ruling that, notwithstanding its supported factual findings, Father\u2019s conduct in espousing and urging Child toward a polygamist lifestyle presented no grave threat of harm to Child. Shepp v. Shepp, 821 A.2d 635, 638 (Pa.Super.2003); see Tr. Ct. Op., 5/6/02, at 6. The Superior Court disagreed, however, that this conclusion was supported by the facts of record. Rather, it found that Father\u2019s discussions with then-fourteen-year-old Manda constituted \u201ca vigorous attempt at moral suasion and recruitment by threats of future punishment [ie. going to hell],\u201d Shepp, 821 A.2d at 638, tantamount to the sort of threat it ruled necessary to support the entry of restrictions on conduct in the context of a custody case. It noted as well that Father\u2019s intent to \u201cinculcate in his child a belief\u201d in polygamy did not materially diverge from his intent toward Manda. Id.\nThe Majority Opinion treats this case as presenting fundamental challenges to Father\u2019s expressive rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and to his fundamental right, coequal to Mother\u2019s, to direct the education and upbringing of Child. It is imperative, however, to distinguish matters of free expression from matters of immoral and criminal conduct. Where the former amounts to indoctrination into the latter, constitutional rights begin to yield to society\u2019s interests in regulating such conduct. Compare Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 344, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890) (\u201c[Wjhile [laws] cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.\u201d) with Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 649, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996) (noting that Davis has been overruled \u201cto the extent, if any, that it permits the imposition of adverse consequences upon mere abstract advocacy of polygamy\u201d). The state also has an unquestionable parens patriae obligation to protect its children and serve their best interests.\nAccordingly, the First Amendment permits a parent to espouse to his or her child principles consistent with his or her values. Thus, a parent may discuss conduct seen by society as immoral or criminal; nothing in the law prevents a parent from extolling the abstract virtues of conduct widely perceived as odious, such as racial bias, drug use, underage drinking, or the like, so long as the discussion does not amount to an active attempt to urge the child into that conduct. However, where speech of this sort crosses the line that separates it from conduct, a threshold not unlike that between the more ordinary phenomenon of discussing a crime (\u201cI wish you would kill my boss\u201d) and taking a substantial step in that direction (\u201cHere\u2019s a gun and $20,000; kill my boss.\u201d), constitutional protections pertaining to expression without a coercive element fall away and the state may intervene.\nIn the case at hand, relying on Manda\u2019s testimony and Father\u2019s statements toward Child, the trial court found, as a matter of fact \u2014 and in isolation from its restatement of what it took to be the governing standard \u2014 that Father had crossed the line between expression and conduct, finding that Father had every intention of \u201cfollowing] through\u201d on his beliefs and, unchecked, would do whatever he could, in his position of considerable authority as Child\u2019s parent, to lead Child into a life of polygamy while still of tender years. In light of this factual finding, one entirely supported by the evidence of record, the'trial court\u2019s remedy granting father partial custody and restricting him only from teaching his daughter about polygamy is not only constitutionally tolerable, but indeed laudably restrained. The trial court\u2019s order was narrowly tailored to hedge against Father\u2019s coercive conduct in seeking to induct Child into a repugnant and criminal activity in adolescence at a time when Child\u2019s lack of autonomy and worldly sophistication would make it difficult for her to protect herself and make an informed decision. On this basis alone, I would rule that the trial court\u2019s order was constitutionally permissible and appropriate to protect Child in light of the facts of record.\nMoreover, even assuming arguendo that the trial court\u2019s order infringes Father\u2019s free expression or intrudes upon his fundamental right as a parent to direct the education and upbringing of Child, thus incurring constitutional protection, I would still find the trial court\u2019s order constitutional. The trial court, the Superior Court, and now a majority of this Court, adopted and applied the rule that only a \u201cgrave threat of harm\u201d may justify such an intrusion, relying upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 82 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). This is only half of the Yoder test. Yoder provided that \u201cparental authority in matters of religious upbringing may be encroached upon only upon a showing of a \u2018substantial threat\u2019 of \u2018physical or mental harm to the child, or to the public safety, peace, order, or welfare.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 230, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (emphasis added).\nAlthough the one-judge opinion announcing the judgment of the Superior Court in Zummo, 574 A.2d at 1138-39, quoted the full Yoder test as set forth above, it then abandoned further discussion of the second half of the test because it was not pertinent to the facts of that case. Unfortunately, Zummo restated the incomplete Yoder test numerous times, reinforcing its silence regarding the test\u2019s second component. Thus, Zummo appears to limit when the state can infringe on a parent\u2019s constitutional right to circumstances presenting \u201ca substantial risk of harm to the child in [the] absence of intervention,\u201d id. at 1140, see also id. at 1141; a \u201csubstantial threat of physical or mental harm to the child,\u201d id. at 1141 (internal quotation marks omitted); \u201ca substantial threat of harm to the child arising from [differences between competing faiths] in [the] absence of the proposed restrictions,\u201d id. at 1154; and \u201ca substantial threat of present or future, physical or emotional harm to the child,\u201d id. at 1155. Zummo culminated in the following language:\nWe hold that in order to justify restrictions upon parent[s\u2019] rights to inculcate religious beliefs in their children, the party seeking the restriction must demonstrate, by competent evidence that the belief or practice of the party to be restricted actually presents a substantial threat of present or future physical or emotional harm to the particular child or children involved in absence of the proposed restriction, and that the restriction is the least intrusive means adequate to prevent the specified harm.\nId. at 1157 (emphasis added). Gone was any mention of the second prong of Yoder\u2019s disjunctive test \u2014 the question of whether permitting inculcation in a particular religious practice presents a \u201csubstantial threat ... to the public safety, peace, order, or welfare.\u201d\nIn Yoder, by contrast, the Court found that the restrictions imposed upon the involved parents intruded upon their free exercise of religion, freedom of expression, and the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children, and thus were subject to constitutional protection \u2014 the point I assume in this case only arguendo. The Court noted that parental decisions are entitled to no peculiar respect if they \u201cwill jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.\u201d Id. at 233-34, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (emphasis added); see also Bykofsky v. Borough of Middletown, 401 F.Supp. 1242, 1262 (M.D.Pa.1975) (\u201c[T]he right of the parent to direct the upbringing of his children and the right to family autonomy are not absolute. When actions concerning the child have a relation to the public welfare or the well-being of the child, the state may act to promote these legitimate interests.\u201d).\nThe first part of this limitation, concerning the health or safety of the child, suggests the \u201cgrave\u201d or \u201csubstantial threat of harm\u201d standard focused upon by the Majority and the courts below; the latter aspect, concerning the \u201cpotential for significant social burdens,\u201d suggests a broader inquiry assessing whether exercise of those prerogatives will conflict with the state\u2019s legitimate interests in preserving public welfare and mitigating significant social burdens. The Superior Court, as well as the Majority, have failed to address this distinct inquiry in the context of this case, which I believe is squarely presented and requires us to uphold the trial court\u2019s custody order narrowly limiting Father\u2019s right to inculcate Child into a practice long-since deemed immoral and criminal in every jurisdiction of the United States \u2014 not only because it presents a \u201cgrave threat of harm\u201d to the child, but also because the practice of polygamy long has been identified as a \u201csubstantial threat\u201d to public welfare, an unsustainable burden on society, and a crime. See Maj. op. at 699-700, 906 A.2d at 1170 (enumerating cases upholding the criminalization of polygamy).\nWe would in no way depart from settled caselaw, at the state or federal level, or act contrarily to Pennsylvania law, to identify the coercion by a parent of his child into the criminal practice of plural marriage as presenting \u201ca potential for significant social burdens\u201d sufficient to invoke the second aspect of the Yoder test. Indeed, that plural marriage has been criminalized in Pennsylvania and virtually everywhere else demonstrates an overwhelming consensus of moral opprobrium regarding the practice and refuting the notion that the burden on society of the practice can legitimately be claimed to be ephemeral or inchoate. Indeed, this Court specifically has observed that polygamy presents \u201ca substantial threat to society,\u201d see In re Green, 448 Pa. 338, 292 A.2d 387, 389 (1972), echoing the language of Yoder.\nThus, I would adopt as part of Pennsylvania law the second half of the Yoder test recognizing government\u2019s need to protect society as a whole, and uphold the trial court\u2019s decision as affirmed by the Superior Court under either the first half of the Yoder test, which is already part of our law, or under the second half of Yoder, constraining individual action inimical to society as a whole.\n. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, consistently with its repudiation of polygamy and rejection of fundamentalist Mormonism as a legitimate religion, excommunicated Father for his embrace of polygamy shortly before the parties' February 2001 divorce.\n. As I must, I defer to the trial court on all credibility determinations. See Robinson v. Robinson, 538 Pa. 52, 645 A.2d 836, 838 (1994).\n. The Majority\u2019s account of the case, see, e.g., Maj. op. at 694-95 n. 3, 906 A.2d at 1167 n. 3, is not without basis in the record, but Father's testimony and the trial court\u2019s findings of fact based upon Father\u2019s testimony are to be distinguished. Notably, the trial court\u2019s general inclination toward crediting testimony that contradicted Father\u2019s is evident in its opinion as well as in the order it ultimately issued, which speaks volumes regarding the trial court\u2019s in-person assessment of Father's intentions. The Majority relies upon the trial court's statement that \u201cthere has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\u201d Tr. Ct. Op., 5/6/02, at 6. For this reason, it granted Father partial custody, a ruling I would not overturn. Nevertheless, its other observations emphasize the seriousness of Father\u2019s intention regarding inculcating the young women in his family, Child included, into a polygamist lifestyle. In sum, I believe the trial court's opinion indicates that it found a sufficiently grave threat to warrant restricting Father's ability to indoctrinate Child into criminal conduct; that it ordered the restriction in the first place, after articulating the \u201cgrave threat of harm\u201d standard, implies as much. In addition, this reading honors the trial court's broad discretion to act in Child\u2019s best interests.\n. In Zummo, the non-precedential opinion announcing the judgment of the court was authored by Judge Kelly, and Judge Rowley concurred in the result. Judge Johnson authored a dissenting opinion.\n. But see Shepp, 821 A.2d at 638 (\"The question whether we would find ... benign advocacy of drug abuse or child prostitution were they presented as foundational religious beliefs is no question at all.\u201d).\n. As noted previously, see supra n. 3, the \"we\u201d language is misleading, as the lead opinion in Zummo failure to garner an outright joinder from either of the other judges on the panel depriving Zummo of precedential effect. I discuss it here only because it accurately encapsulates the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning in other cases sub silentio neglecting the second half of the Yoder test, as does the Majority here. See, e.g., Damon B., 314 Pa.Super. 391, 460 A.2d 1196; Lotz, 188 Pa.Super. 241, 146 A.2d 362.\n. As mentioned above, the Zummo opinion addressed circumstances unlike those in the instant case, which presented little cause for the court to consider the second part of the Yoder Court's analysis. In Zummo, the question concerned whether a divorced father could be compelled to deliver the children to synagogue for religious instruction consonant with mother's Jewish faith, and similarly compelled not to bring the children to mass and celebrations of a Catholic character. In no sense did that case present any suggestion that either Judaism or Catholicism, in the conventional forms of those traditions there at issue, might constitute a threat to public welfare and safety.\n. I do not read a \"grave threat of harm\" to be equivalent to \"a substantial threat of harm to the physical or mental health\u201d of the child in question, since one readily can imagine a \"substantial threat\u201d to a child's physical or mental health, one that courts should be free to remedy in serving that child's best interests, that nevertheless does not constitute a \u201cgrave threat\u201d of harm under the plain meanings of the relevant terms. I need not delve deeper into the distinction, however, since I find the public welfare aspect of Yoder controlling to the extent that Father's coercive conduct is entitled to any constitutional protection at all.\n. The Majority, like the opinion announcing the judgment of the Superi- or Court in Zummo, properly quotes the Yoder test but then focuses solely on the first half of that test concerning the threat to the health or safety of the child. Compare Maj. op. at 704, 906 A.2d at 1173 (noting that Yoder permits restrictions \u201cif it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens\u201d (emphasis added)), 704, 906 A.2d at 1173 (same) with id. at 13 (\u201c[T]he focus of our review [under Yoder is] whether the nature of the conduct and/or speech establishes that it will not harm the child.\u201d (emphasis added)).",
