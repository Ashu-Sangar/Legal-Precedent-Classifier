Additionally, as this Court finds that the Commonwealth Court substituted its determination of the facts of this matter and the credibility of the witnesses for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge\u2019s proper assessments, the judgment of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the determination of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge as affirmed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board is reinstated.
