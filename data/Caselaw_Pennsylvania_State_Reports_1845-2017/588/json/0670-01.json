      {
        "text": "OPINION\nJustice BALDWIN.\nThe issue presented in this case is whether collateral civil consequences of criminal acts, in this instance suspensions of operating privileges (ie., driver\u2019s licenses), should be merged to accord with the merger of the underlying criminal convictions from which the collateral civil consequences flow. Although this is a question of first impression for this Court, the lower courts of this Commonwealth have merged such suspensions at least since the Commonwealth Court decided Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, 759 A.2d 953 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2000) (en banc), alloc, denied, 567 Pa. 753, 788 A.2d 382 (2001). We find that this is the result intended by the subject statute, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532. Thus we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision.\nMatthew Steven Drabic (Drabic) was involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 27, 2003. A passenger in his vehicle died as a result of the accident. Drabic pled guilty to fourteen offenses. Subsequently, the Director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation\u2019s Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT) issued the following series of suspensions, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1532 (Suspension of operating privilege), sending an individual notice to Drabic for each:\nLength of Operator's Criminal Offense Privilege Suspension\n75 Pa.C.S. 5 3735 (homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence) _ 3 years_\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1 (aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732 (homicide by vehicle) 3 years\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3742.1 (Accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731 (Driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308 (offenses related to alcohol) 2 years\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(b) (driving while operating privilege suspended) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361 (driving vehicle at safe speed) 10 days\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3736 (reckless driving) 6 months\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3362 (Maximum speed limits) 20 days\n12 years, 6 months Total: and 30 days\nOn August 11, 2004, Drabic filed an appeal with the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County for all of the suspensions except those imposed for the driving with a suspended license (\u00a7 1543(b)) and offenses related to alcohol (\u00a7 6308) violations. A de novo hearing was conducted on February 9, 2005 by the trial court, during which Drabic conceded that the suspension for \u00a7 3735, homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (homicide by vehicle-DUI), was proper. Drabic argued that all the other suspensions of his driver\u2019s license should have merged into that greater offense.\nThe trial court agreed in part and merged driving under the influence (\u00a7 3731) (DUI) and aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (\u00a7 3735.1) (AA-DUI) into homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (\u00a7 3735). The Court of Common Pleas merged the reckless driving (\u00a7 3736) violation into the homicide by vehicle (\u00a7 3732) violation. All remaining statutory appeals were denied. Based upon this, the trial court reduced Drabic\u2019s total driver\u2019s license suspension by two years and six months.\nPennDOT appealed these rulings to the Commonwealth Court. In a memorandum opinion, a panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Drabic, Nos. 738-739 CD 2005, slip op. at 7, 883 A.2d 730 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. September 9, 2005). In its opinion, the Commonwealth Court first declined PennDOT\u2019s express invitation to overrule Zimmerman. In Zimmerman, the Commonwealth Court faced an analytically identical question. \u201cThe issue before the court is whether [criminal convictions] merge for purposes of operating privilege suspension[s]\u201d. Zimmerman, 759 A.2d at 957.\nJudge Pellegrini, writing for the panel in the instant case, stated that Zimmerman \u201cremains binding, precedential law.\u201d Id. at 5. Noting that this Court denied Allocatur in Zimmer man, Judge Pellegrini explained that the Commonwealth Court had \u201cno inclination\u201d to overrule its own precedent. Id. Before this Court is PennDOT\u2019s challenge to the merger of Drabic\u2019s operator\u2019s privilege suspension imposed for his conviction of aggravated assault while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1) and the suspension imposed for his conviction of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735).\nThe parties do not dispute the facts in the case sub judice, rather, the question presented is a pure question of law. Our standard of review is de novo. Seven Springs Farm, Inc. v. Croker, 569 Pa. 202, 208 n. 1, 801 A.2d 1212, 1216 n. 1 (2002). Questions of law are accorded a plenary scope of review. McNeil v. Jordan, 586 Pa. 413, 894 A.2d 1260, 1268 (2006).\nIn the first instance, the parties disagree as to whether the doctrine of merger even applies in the instant context, i.e., when collateral civil consequences are imposed. We need not directly address this question, since we believe the plain language of the statute directs that only a single suspension can be imposed based upon a single criminal episode. Regardless of whether the Commonwealth is correct, and the doctrine of merger is not properly applied to collateral civil consequences, or whether Appellee properly directs our attention to the statutory construction act and Commonwealth v. Anderson, 538 Pa. 574, 650 A.2d 20 (1994) (holding that the doctrine of merger is a rule of statutory construction), the inquiry in either event must be based on the language of the statute at issue.\nThe key language in the subsections at issue is \u201cthe driver\u2019s conviction ... any of the following offenses.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532. Recently, in Freundt v. Commonwealth, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503 (2005), we construed \u00a7 1532(c) explaining that where the legislature used the separate terms \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d it must have intended for the words to have different meanings. Thus, while the merger of the suspensions of operating privileges under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1532(a) and 1532(a.l) is an issue of first impression for this Court, in Freundt we explained that, in the context of \u00a7 1532(e), \u201cwhen there is a conviction, the appropriate [license] suspension shall be determined by whether or not the conviction stemmed from a single criminal episode, or multiple criminal episodes.\u201d Freundt at 290, 883 A.2d at 507 (citations omitted).\nMs. Freundt (Freundt) pled guilty to sixteen counts of acquiring or obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception or subterfuge (35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(12)). PennDOT sent Freundt sixteen separate notices that her driving privileges were being suspended pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c). Freundt appealed. The Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County denied the appeal and reinstated the suspensions, indicating that it was unable to determine whether there were or were not multiple violations involved in Freundt\u2019s convictions.\nFreundt then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which concluded that with respect to \u00a7 1532(c) and its predecessor, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(m), a single criminal episode results in a single license suspension. Freundt at 290, 883 A.2d at 507. Like the instant case, in Freundt, PennDOT asserted that the plain language of the statute required it to impose separate suspensions for each conviction. Id. at 287, 883 A.2d at 505. The Commonwealth Court disagreed based upon its own line of cases that has indicated that separate criminal episodes are required in order for PennDOT to impose multiple suspensions. Freundt v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 804 A.2d 706, 710-12 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2002). PennDOT then appealed to this Court.\nRelying on our interpretation of the statute, we affirmed, because the statute said that the operating privilege of a person would be suspended after PennDOT had received a record of \u201cthe person\u2019s conviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, delivery ... of any controlled substance .... \u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c) (emphasis added). Chief Justice Cappy, writing for a majority, pointed out that we must presume that since the General Assembly used both the word \u201cconviction\u201d and the word \u201coffense,\u201d it must have meant for the words to have separate meanings. Freundt, 584 Pa. at 289-90, 883 A.2d at 506-07. This Court also noted that, while the issue of whether one or multiple suspensions should result from a single criminal episode was an issue of first impression for the Supreme Court, there was a long line of cases from the Commonwealth Court which consistently interpreted \u00a7 1532(c) as requiring that only one suspension issue for each criminal episode. Id. (citing Gregg v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 851 A.2d 253 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2004); Carter v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 838 A.2d 869 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2003); Yadzinski v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 723 A.2d 263 (Pa.Cmlthw.Ct.1999); Lauer v. Department of Transp., 666 A.2d 779 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1995); Brosius v. Department of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 664 A.2d 199 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1995); Heisterkamp v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 165 Pa.Cmwlth. 128, 644 A.2d 262 (1994); Department of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Hardy, 160 Pa.Cmwlth. 427, 635 A.2d 230 (1993)). Therefore, in Freundt, we concluded that based on the plain language of the statute \u201cconviction of any offense\u201d as used in \u00a7 1532(c) refers to a single criminal episode.\nThe same statute, \u00a7 1532, is at issue in the case sub judice, but different subsections are implicated. Nonetheless, in the subsections scrutinized here, the Legislature again discusses \u201cthe driver\u2019s conviction of ... any of the following offenses.\u201d As we did in Freundt, we find that the Legislature\u2019s use of the separate terms \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201coffenses\u201d to be significant. Specifically, \u201cconviction of ... any of the following offenses\u201d stems from a single criminal episode. We see no reason to depart from our reasoning in Freundt. We acknowledge that the analysis in Freundt was simplified by the more generalized grammatical construct of subsection (c), i.e., \u201cconviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, [etc.] of any controlled substance,\u201d as opposed to the slightly different grammatical construct of the two subsections at issue here ((a) and (a.l)), but see no reason to arrive at a different result as the key language remains constant: \u201cconviction of ... any ... offense[ ].\u201d\nMoreover, as was the case in Freundt, here again the Commonwealth Court merged the suspensions pursuant to a long line of its cases, the most prominent of which is Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, 759 A.2d 958 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2000) In Zimmerman, the licensee pled guilty to ten offenses including DUI and AA-DUI. Id. at 955. PennDOT issued both a suspension and a revocation of Zimmerman\u2019s operating privilege pursuant to the version of \u00a7 1532 then in effect. Id. The trial court concluded that because all of the elements of DUI were also elements of AA-DUI, the suspensions for those two offenses merge in the same manner as the underlying convictions merge. PennDOT appealed, relying upon a series of cases from the Commonwealth Court where license suspensions were not merged. The Commonwealth Court found these cases inapposite, indicating that \u201cthe violators in these cases either committed offenses with distinct elements or committed offenses arising from separate acts.\u201d Id. at 957 (citing Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Lescisin, 156 Pa.Cmwlth. 666, 628 A.2d 1208 (1993); Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Maddesi, 138 Pa.Cmwlth. 467, 588 A.2d 580 (1991); Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety v. Bishop, 102 Pa.Cmwlth. 483, 518 A.2d 897 (1986); Parks v. Commonwealth, 40 Pa.Cmwlth. 544, 398 A.2d 230 (1979)).\nIndeed, the Zimmerman court noted that it had applied the doctrine of merger in 1991 to the allocation of points to a licensee. Maddesi, 138 Pa.Cmwlth. at 474, 588 A.2d at 583. The Commonwealth Court recognized in Maddesi that \u00a7 1535(b) prohibited \u201cthe separate assignment of points for multiple violations arising from the same act only where proof of one violation also proves another violation.\u201d Id. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court explained that where any underlying convictions would merge, the collateral civil consequences, in this case \u201cpoints\u201d on a license, cannot be separately assessed. Id.\nThus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that \u201c[sjeparate administrative penalties for multiple convictions arising from the same transaction are prohibited where the convictions are greater and lesser included offenses.\u201d Zimmerman, 759 A.2d at 957 (citing Xenakis v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 702 A.2d 572 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1997)).\nPennDOT argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination was erroneous, in that operator\u2019s privilege suspensions should not be subjected to the doctrine of merger of related offenses, because the doctrine has no bearing on non-criminal sanctions. PennDOT encourages us to delve into the statutory construction statutes, and the legislative intent behind the license suspensions, to determine whether merger should apply-\nWithout contesting the non-criminal nature of the license suspensions, Appellee Drabic notes that the Legislature was free at the time it wrote \u00a7 1532 to provide either that merger should or should not apply to these provisions and it chose not to do that. Indeed, as Drabic noted in his brief, \u201c[i]t is presumed that members of the General Assembly and their constituents are aware that the doctrine of merger is being applied in license suspension cases. It is the function of the General Assembly to enact laws to prohibit such merger if, in fact, that is the legislative intent.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 2.\nWe recognize that the doctrine of merger of related offenses has its roots in the double jeopardy provisions of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Double jeopardy protections forbid the imposition of multiple punishments for a single criminal act that constitute greater and lesser-included offenses. Commonwealth v. Buffington, 574 Pa. 29, 39, 828 A.2d 1024, 1028 (2003). However, merger has been applied in the related context of administrative consequences in this Commonwealth for over a decade. While the underpinnings of the application of merger in this context may not lie in double jeopardy, we find that the Legislature articulated no proscription against collateral civil consequences merging along with the underlying criminal convictions.\nFinally, PennDOT also advances a public policy argument, contending that the intent of the Legislature in providing for these collateral civil consequences, unlike their criminal counterparts, is not to punish the driver but rather to protect the public from these drivers. While this argument is noble, it is unpersuasive. We cannot accept PennDOT\u2019s argument that public safety concerns militate a conclusion that, under \u00a7 1532, operator\u2019s privilege suspensions do not merge given our interpretation of the plain language of \u00a7 1532 and the Legislature\u2019s intent.\nThe sanctions at issue here, related to the convictions for AA \u2014 DUI and homicide by vehicle \u2014 DUI, cannot be construed as PennDOT suggests. Here, the suspensions derived directly from the underlying criminal convictions and there is no question that those underlying criminal convictions merge. The decision of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and BAER join the opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion in which Justice EAKIN joins.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. The charges were: (1) homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735); (2) aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1); (3) homicide by vehicle/safe speed (75 Pa.C.S..\u00a7 3732); (4) homicide by vehicle/reckless driving (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732); (5) accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3742.1); (6) involuntary manslaughter (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504); (7) driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731); (8) recklessly endangering another person (18 Pa.C.S \u00a7 2705); (9) offenses related to alcohol (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308); (10) driving with a suspended license (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(b)); (11) driving on roadways laned for traffic (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3309); (12) driving vehicle at safe speed (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361); (13) reckless driving (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3736); and (14) maximum speed limits (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3362).\n. (a) One-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for one year upon receiving a certified record of the driver's conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on any of the following offenses:\n(1) Any felony in the commission of which a court determines that a vehicle was essentially involved.\n(3) Any violation of the following provisions:\nSection 3735.1 (relating to aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence).\nSection 3742 (relating to accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed).\nSection 3742.1 (relating to accidents involving death or personal injury while hot properly licensed).\nSection 7111 (relating to dealing in titles and plates for stolen vehicles).\nSection 7121 (relating to false application for certificate of title or registration).\nSection 7122 (relating to altered, forged or counterfeit documents and plates).\n(a.l) Three-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for three years upon receiving a certified record of the driver\u2019s conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on a violation of any of the following offenses:\n(1) Any violation of section 3732 (relating to homicide by vehicle).\n(2) Any violation of section 3735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while driving under influence).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532.\n. The Commonwealth Court did not affirm the entire holding of the trial court. Rather, it determined that an additional six-month suspension for reckless driving was warranted. It modified the trial court's order to impose this additional suspension, but otherwise affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings on each of Drabic\u2019s appeals. Commonwealth v. Drabic, Nos. 738-739 C.D.2005,- slip op. at 6-7, 883 A.2d 730 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. September 9, 2005). The reckless driving suspension is not at issue in the instant appeal.\n. The Commonwealth Court also disagreed with PennDOT\u2019s contention that Zimmerman did not apply because, on the face of documents PennDOT received after Drabic was convicted, there was no way to know that the victim of the aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1) was the same victim for the homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735). In other words, PennDOT contended that it could impose the separate sanctions because, as far as PennDOT knew, there was more than one victim thus taking the facts outside of the rule in Zimmerman. The Commonwealth Court characterized these contentions as disingenuous, noting that in oral argument to the trial court it was clear that there was only one victim. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument on waiver grounds under Pa.R.A.P. 302. PennDOT did not raise this issue here.\n. U.S. Const, amend. V.\n. Pa. Const, art. 1 \u00a7 10.",

        "text": "Justice NEWMAN,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully dissent from the Majority Opinion. Additionally, I join the well-reasoned Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Saylor in his discussion of Freundt v. PennDOT, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503 (2005). I find myself bound by the plain language of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532 and, therefore, would not utilize the criminal doctrine of merger in a civil matter where double jeopardy concerns are not implicated absent an express directive to do so by the Legislature. Because the statute at issue does not contain such language, I would uphold the separate suspensions for each individual offense for which Matthew Drabic (Appellee) has been convicted.\nAt issue is the doctrine of merger of related offenses, which \u201cis a rule of statutory construction designed to determine whether the legislature intended for the punishment of one offense to encompass that for another offense arising from the same criminal act or transaction.\u201d Commonwealth v. Anderson, 538 Pa. 574, 650 A.2d 20, 21 (1994) (holding that aggravated assault is a lesser included offense of attempted murder); accord Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) (opining that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to determine whether they constitute two offenses or only one is to determine whether each provision requires proof of a fact that the other does not).\nAs this matter involves a civil consequence of a criminal act, we must start with the applicable sections of the civil sanctions provided by the Motor Vehicle Code:\n(a) One-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for one year upon receiving a certified record of the driver\u2019s conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on any of the following offenses:\n(3) Any violation of the following provisions: Section 3735.1 (relating to aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence).\n* * *\n(a.l) Three-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for three years upon receiving a certified record of the driver\u2019s conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on a violation of any of the following offenses:\n* * *\n(2) Any violation of section 8735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while driving under influence).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(a), (a.l) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the statute indicates two separate penalties for Aggravated Assault while DUI and Homicide by Vehicle while DUI. Compare 75\" Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1542(b) (requiring separate acts to sustain multiple penalties: \u201cThree convictions arising from separate acts of any one or more of the following offenses.... \u201d). Interestingly, both parties claim that the plain language of the statute renders a result in his or its favor. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d).\nPennDOT argues that the penalties are separate and distinct and that no mention of merger is made. PennDOT further avers that merger is a criminal doctrine and there is no indication that the General Assembly intended for merger to apply in the plain language of this statute, involving an agency\u2019s institution of civil sanctions.\nConversely, Appellee argues that by omitting the fact that merger does not apply, and knowing that merger applies in criminal matters, the General Assembly evinced an intent to allow merger in the civil arena of license suspensions. I fail to find favor in the plain language interpretation proposed by Appellee or adopted by the Majority. \u201cIf the Legislature intended for merger not to apply, then \u00a7 1532 would be explicit in so saying. We cannot add a provision prohibiting merger to \u00a7 1532 on PennDOT\u2019s request because the Legislature has never done so itself.\u201d Maj. op. at 678-79, 906 A.2d at 1158.\nThe omission of a negative, that is, not including language that merger does not apply, is not indicative of a desire on the part of the General Assembly for merger to apply. An action, in general, should be mandated and not implied when conducting a plain-language reading. The language differentiates the two acts and applies two different suspensions with no mention of merging the suspensions. Accordingly, the plain language of the statute weighs in favor of imposing individual suspensions for Aggravated Assault while DUI and Homicide by Vehicle while DUI.\nIn the present matter, the Commonwealth Court went beyond the plain language of the statute and instead cited prior precedent. The Commonwealth Court relied upon Zimmerman v. Department of Transportation, 759 A.2d 953 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000) (en banc), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 567 Pa. 753, 788 A.2d 382 (2001), and Xenakis v. Department of Transportation, 702 A.2d 572 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997) (imposing three separate suspensions when the three convictions were distinct and separate), in determining that convictions may merge in a license suspension action.\nIn Zimmerman, the Commonwealth Court analyzed two suspensions imposed following convictions for both DUI and Aggravated Assault by Vehicle while DUI. Notably, Aggravated Assault while DUI is defined as follows:\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 Any person who negligently causes serious bodily injury to another person as the result of a violation of section 3802 (relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance) and who is convicted of violating section 3802 commits a felony of the second degree when the violation is the cause of the injury.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1. The statute incorporates the lesser offense of DUI as a necessary component for Aggravated Assault while DUI. The doctrine of merger in criminal matters would clearly dictate that the sentences merge.\nThe Commonwealth Court, by virtue of relying on Zimmerman, erred in holding that the merger doctrine was appropriate for license suspension purposes in PennDOT proceedings. The Commonwealth Court in Zimmerman cited three cases in support of the proposition that the suspensions should merge. See Anderson, supra (holding that aggravated assault is a lesser included offense of attempted murder); Commonwealth v. Everett, 550 Pa. 312, 705 A.2d 837 (1998) (holding the same and stating that it is within the discretion of the trial court to choose to sentence for either the lesser included offense or the greater offense); Commonwealth v. Comer, 552 Pa. 527, 716 A.2d 593, 599 (1998) (\u201c[T]he elements of homicide by vehicle as charged are subsumed in the elements of involuntary manslaughter and neither offense requires proof which the other does not. Because imposing separate sentences violates double jeopardy the two offenses merge for [criminal] sentencing purposes.\u201d) (internal footnote deleted).\nHowever, all three cases may be distinguished from the instant matter since they involved the criminal aspect of the convictions rather than the civil consequences that follow.\nNeither party raised Freundt v. Department of Transportation, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503 (2005); however, the Majority notes that it is similar to a case decided this past year. In Freundt, this Court interpreted Section 1532(c) to merge drug-related charges for the purposes of license suspension. I joined the strong dissent of Justice Eakin, which Justice Saylor also joined, and wrote a separate dissent.\n[T]he majority holds an \u201coffense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1532(c) means a single criminal episode; I believe this interpretation is inconsistent with both the language and the aim of \u00a7 1532(c). Secondly, even if the statute means \u201cepisode\u201d when it says \u201coffense,\u201d the burden of establishing that 16 crimes over several months are really a single episode must fall on the party so claiming-it cannot be PennDOT\u2019s burden to establish the \u201clack of single episode\u201d when it is not a party to the underlying criminal investigation or conviction ....\nId. at 508 (Eakin, J., dissenting, joined by Newman, Saylor, J.J.). For reasons relating to the history and purpose of the doctrine of merger, discussed further infra, I. stand by my dissent in Freundt. Moreover, the plain language of the instant matter differs slightly in that it allows for the imposition of suspensions for a \u201cconviction ... based on any of the following offenses,\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(a), (a.l) (emphasis added), whereas subsection 1532(c) provides for suspension based upon \u201cconviction of any offense[.]\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c) (emphasis added). Hence, an argument could be made that the language of subsections 1532(a) and 1532(a.l) provides for a suspension based on any of the multiple offenses that follow and, thus, is different from the single suspension for a single offense involving any of the crimes listed in subsection 1532(c). However, I would find that in either case, the doctrine of merger should not apply.\nSuch a distinction starts with the nature of a driver\u2019s license suspension. In Commonwealth v. Wolf, 534 Pa. 283, 632 A.2d 864 (1993) (finding that driver was not entitled to stay of mandatory one-year suspension of his license during pendency of driver\u2019s appeal of his criminal conviction), this Court opined that:\n[t]he mandatory suspension of a driver\u2019s license upon conviction for DUI is a collateral civil penalty administratively imposed by [PennDOT] pursuant to the mandates of the Motor Vehicle Code not the Crimes Code. Thus, the mandatory suspension is not a direct criminal penalty, but rather, is a civil sanction wholly unrelated to Petitioner\u2019s appeal of the criminal conviction to the Superior Court.\nId. at 867 (internal footnote deleted). We have developed this position further and held that license suspensions are collateral civil consequences and not criminal penalties and that: (1) there was statutory authority for suspension for out-of-state offense equivalent to Pennsylvania DUI offense; (2) imposition of suspensions did not violate motorists\u2019 double jeopardy rights; (3) suspensions did not violate motorists\u2019 equal protection or due process rights; and (4) New Jersey DUI conviction of one motorist was equivalent to DUI in Pennsylvania. Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. McCafferty, 563 Pa. 146, 758 A.2d 1155 (2000); accord Commonwealth v. Duffey, 536 Pa. 436, 639 A.2d 1174(Pa.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 884, 115 S.Ct. 223, 130 L.Ed.2d 149 (1994). In fact, in Duffey, this Court expressly allowed for a license suspension for out-of-state conduct and conviction as not violating either the double jeopardy clause or 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 111 (noting when prosecution is barred by former prosecution in another jurisdiction). This Court has clearly held that an administrative agency over which a criminal judge has no control cannot be considered criminal in nature. Duffey, 639 A.2d at 1177. We opined that: (1) loss of driving privileges is a collateral civil consequence of conviction for underage drinking and, accordingly, there is no requirement that licensee know that consequence at time of guilty plea; (2) it is not proper for licensee to attack validity of criminal conviction upon which Department of Transportation (DOT) based its suspension in a civil proceeding; and (3) operating privileges suspensions for underage drinking are properly appealable to the Commonwealth Court. Id. \u201c[W]e hold today that a licensee does not have to be warned of the collateral consequences of license suspension.\u201d Id. (holding additionally that we would recommend that a defendant be informed of the collateral consequence but that it is not necessary). The Commonwealth Court has followed this reasoning and noted our decision in Duffey, stating that \u201ca license suspension is a collateral civil consequence of a criminal conviction, and there is no requirement that a criminal court advise a licensee that his or her conviction will result in a license suspension.\u201d Xenakis, 702 A.2d at 574 n. 1 (citing Duffey, supra). For that reason, PennDOT concludes that the criminal doctrine of merger is inapposite.\nUsing the reasoning in Duffey, the concerns of double jeopardy and the constitutional protections against it, U.S. Const, amend. V, XIV, are not present when the matter is solely civil in nature. For this reason, I am compelled to find that, absent express language to the contrary, Section 1532 does not mandate merger and separate suspensions may be imposed. Furthermore, the sanctions imposed are remedial and not punitive in nature. PennDOT avers that the underlying concern of the merger doctrine is absent, specifically double jeopardy. See Ponce v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 685 A.2d 607, 610 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 548 Pa. 641, 694 A.2d 625 (1997) (holding that the suspension of driving privileges is remedial and not punitive in nature); Urciuolo v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 684 A.2d 1094 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 547 Pa. 747, 690 A.2d 1165 (1997) (same).\nPennDOT notes that, in Commonwealth v. Buffington, 574 Pa. 29, 828 A.2d 1024, 1030 n. 9 (2003), this Court stated that Blockburger is to be \u201cused as a means of assessing legislative intent in the context of the double jeopardy protections against successive prosecutions and multiple punishments.\u201d\nThe United States Supreme Court has noted that the Double Jeopardy Clause: (1) \u201cprotects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal[;] ... [ (2) ] protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction[;] ... [and 3] protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), overruled on other grounds, Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989) (internal footnotes deleted). Prosecutions involve criminal matters and the punishments discussed involve the criminal sanctions and punishments imposed. License suspensions are a collateral civil consequence and not a punishment; and, as noted above, a defendant in a criminal case need not be informed of the collateral consequence, as it is not part of his or her criminal punishment. Duffey, supra.\nInstead, the measures are of a more remedial nature. PennDOT argues that the recent increase in penalties for both homicide by vehicle while DUI and homicide by vehicle, from one year to three years\u2019 suspension, indicates that the legislative intent is to increase the potential suspension for any person convicted of any offense or offenses and keep those drivers off the road. PennDOT cites a litany of statistics to show the overwhelming danger posed by drunk drivers. This Court is well aware of the horrific cost to society due to drunk driving. We agree that part, if not all, of the reasoning behind a license suspension is: (1) that a drunk driver has shown himself or herself unfit to be trusted on the road; and (2) to protect the public at large. Such reasoning comes from the viewpoint' of remediation and not from one of punishment. Accordingly, the secondary concern of double jeopardy, multiple punishments, is not at issue.\nThe plain language of Section 1532 coupled with the civil and remedial nature of the sanctions involved in the Motor Vehicle Code lead me to the conclusion that merger does not apply. Consequently, I would reverse the Commonwealth Court.\nJustice EAKIN joins this dissenting opinion.\n. If the legislature had desired for merger to apply, it would have been a simple matter to include, in language after the current subsection 1532(a.l), a statement that a three-year suspension for homicide by vehicle while DUI includes the suspension all lesser includes offenses (e.g., DUI and Aggravated Assault while DUI).\n. Paradoxically, the Commonwealth Court in this case noted that:\nIn Guidas v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 655 A.2d 228 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995), citing Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety v. Antram, 48 Pa.Cmwlth. 135, 409 A.2d 492 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1979), we held that while the lesser violation of reckless driving did, in fact, merge into the greater violation of Homicide by Vehicle and constituted one act, and where the trial court had made findings of fact or conclusions of law different from those made by PennDot, the trial court was vested with the authority to modify a penalty imposed by PennDot and order the six-month penalty for a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(b)(1) for reckless driving. \u201cSection 1532 does not require that each conviction arise out of a 'separate act.' \u201d Id. at 232. See also Richards v, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 827 A.2d 575 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 576 Pa. 727, 841 A.2d 533 (2003) [upholding the imposition of a one-year suspension and five-year suspension of drivers\u2019 license privileges based on the licensee\u2019s underlying convictions for two counts of Aggravated Assault by vehicle while DUI arising from single incident, and holding that the doctrine of merger of related offenses did not preclude imposition of both suspensions as administrative sanctions for underlying convictions arising from same incident],\nCmwlth. Ct. Op. at 6-7 (internal footnote omitted) (citations modified). As such, the Commonwealth Court affirmed its prior holding that the same criminal act may in fact result in multiple convictions. In the instant matter, those convictions, by the plain language of the statute, give rise to separate suspensions.\n. See id. at 508 (Saylor, J., dissenting) (\u201cI join the substance of Mr. Justice Eakin's dissenting opinion on the statutory interpretation point.\u201d).",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI join Madame Justice Newman\u2019s dissenting opinion, but I have a moderately different perspective on the applicability of the recent decision in Freundt v. PennDOT, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503 (2005).\nAt the outset, I recognize the effect of Freundt as precedent. Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that the binding holding of a decision must be read against its facts, see Commonwealth v. McCann, 503 Pa. 190, 195, 469 A.2d 126, 128 (1983); therefore, Freundt is not controlling relative to the distinct conduct at issue here, implicating a different subset of statutory provisions.\nFreundt construed Section 1532(c) of the Vehicle Code, imposing suspensions based on a driver\u2019s \u201cconviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, delivery, offering for sale or giving away of any controlled substance.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c). A majority of the Court found that the words \u201cconviction of any offense\u201d in this statutory provision should be read to encompass larger criminal episodes involving numerous convictions for separate offenses. See id. at 291, 883 A.2d 503 883 A.2d at 507 (\u201c[A]n offense, for purposes [75 Pa.C.S.] \u00a7 1532(c) amounts to a criminal episode.\u201d). The Freundt majority reasoned that the use of both of the words \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d in conjunction \u201cshows that the statute imposes a suspension not merely for each conviction for every violation of the Crimes Code, but for each conviction stemming from a criminal episode.\u201d Freundt, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d at 506 (emphasis added). On this basis, the majority held that the driver should be subject to a single suspension period, although she had committed numerous violations for which she received multiple convictions.\nFreundt\u2019s logic that \u201coffense\u201d meant \u201csingle criminal episode\u201d and not \u201cviolation\u201d cannot be transported to Sections 1532(a) and (a.l), because the Legislature was even more explicit in those sections in targeting violations. For example, Section 1532(a.1) requires a three-year suspension by Penn-DOT upon its receipt of a certified record of the driver\u2019s conviction \u201cbased on a violation \u201d of designated offenses. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(a.l) (emphasis added). In delineating the specific violations to which the suspension was to attach, the Legislature specified \u201c[a]ny violation of section 3732 (relating to homicide by vehicle)\u201d and \u201c[a]ny violation of section 3735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while driving under influence).\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(a.l)(l), (2) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 1532(a) requires PennDOT to impose a one-year suspension of operating privileges upon receipt of a certified record of conviction based on \u201c[a]ny violation\u201d of statutory provisions including aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(a) (emphasis added). Per force, Freundt\u2019s rationale that the Legislature was not addressing specific violations because it utilized different terminology cannot stand in the context of a statute that explicitly targets \u201cviolations.\u201d\nIn summary, I did not find the majority rationale from Freundt persuasive in the context in which it arose, and I find it even less persuasive here. Further, I agree with Madame Justice Newman that the present majority\u2019s decision to ascribe criminal-sentence-like merger to the administrative suspension context finds no support in the statute or in any decision of this Court.",
