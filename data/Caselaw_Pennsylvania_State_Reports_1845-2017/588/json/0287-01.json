        "text": "OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nIn this case, we determine whether an assignee has standing to sue an insurer where the insured assigned its interest in an insurance policy without the prior consent of the insurer, contrary to the requirement in the policy. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court that affirmed the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court), which granted summary judgment in favor of the assignee.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nOn September 5, 1997, Charles Egger (Egger) was cleaning a confined space on the roof of a scrubber unit at Philadelphia Electric Company\u2019s (PECO) Eddystone power plant. Foulke Associates, Inc. (Foulke) provided both security guard services and plant protection services to PECO at the power plant under two separate contracts.\nEgger was using a high pressure water jet to clean sulfur dioxide residue from this scrubber unit. After a sudden loss of water pressure, he lost his balance, and the water jet came to rest near the back of his knee. When the water pressure suddenly returned, the water pierced his leg and severed several arteries.\nEgger placed an emergency call to Foulke personnel, who arrived twenty minutes later, without rescue or first aid equipment. Instead of administering first aid, the Foulke staff decided first to retrieve him from the confined space. During this process, Egger bled to death.\nPatricia Egger (hereinafter Appellee or Assignee), the wife of Egger, brought suit against Foulke for, inter alia, failing to administer timely first aid, and the case went to trial. Foulke was insured for $1,000,000.00 through a primary general liability insurance policy issued by Security Insurance Company of Hartford (Security).\nIn addition to this primary liability policy, Foulke maintained an umbrella/excess general liability insurance policy issue (the excess insurance policy) issued by Appellant Gulf Insurance Company (Gulf) with a liability limit of $10,000,-00. 00. The term of the policy was from May 14, 1997 through May 14, 1998, and it provided coverage for \u201cOccurrences\u201d during that period, in the event that damages exceeded the $1,000,000.00 limit of the primary policy.\nThe policy defined \u201cOccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident ... that results in \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 that is not expected or not intended by the \u2018Insured.\u2019 \u201d Exhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy, Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Section IV H.\nA provision included in the section of the policy labeled \u201cConditions\u201d stated that \u201c[y]our rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without our prior written consent, except in the case of death of an individual \u2018Named Insured..\u2019 \u201d Exhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy [\u201cPolicy\u201d] Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, \u201cConditions,\u201d Section K, \u201cTransfer of Your Rights and Duties under This Policy.\u201d\nOn February 7, 2001, shortly before the jury verdict, Gulf denied excess insurance coverage to Foulke. Immediately after that, and prior to the jury verdict, Foulke and Appellee entered into a settlement agreement. In exchange for Appellee\u2019s agreement not to enforce against Foulke any excess judgment beyond the $1,000,000.00 that Foulke insured through its primary general liability policy, Appellee accepted $825,000.00, along with an assignment of Foulke\u2019s rights under the Gulf excess insurance policy. On February 9, 2001, the jury returned a verdict against Foulke in the amount of $3,500,000.00. Following the grant of Appellee\u2019s Motion for delay damages, the final judgment against Gulf totaled $3,837,965.75.\nOn May 18, 2001, Appellee brought suit against Gulf alleging breach of contract and bad faith in denying coverage. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, which the trial court denied on September 11, 2002.\nThe trial court determined that Foulke\u2019s assignment to Appellee of its rights under the excess insurance policy was valid, despite the fact that the required notice had not been provided. Citing the decision of this Court in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l Services v. Metro. Life Ins., 159 Pa.Super. 292, 48 A.2d 143 (1946), the trial court noted that \u201cPennsylvania courts have ... analyzed non-assignment clauses by considering the clear language used and the purposes for which the clauses were inserted.\u201d Trial Court Opinion of September 11, 2002 (Trial Court Opinion) at 4.\nThe trial court denied the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment based on its determination that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to Gulfs claim that coverage was excluded pursuant to an \u201cIncidental Malpractice\u201d provision of the policy and a Professional Liability Exclusion Endorsement.\nFollowing the parties\u2019 submission of supplemental briefs and additional argument, on July 16, 2003, the trial court vacated the portion of its previous Order denying summary judgment to Appellee on the coverage issue, and granted summary judgment to her in the amount of $3,481,849.42, which was reduced by stipulation of the parties to $3,352,370.57.\nFollowing a bench trial, on March 10, 2004, the trial court entered judgment in favor of Gulf on Appellee\u2019s claim of bad faith. Gulf timely appealed to the Superior Court, challenging the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellee.\nA panel of the Superior Court held that Appellee had standing to seek recovery from Gulf and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in her favor. Egger v. Gulf Ins. Co., 864 A.2d 1234 (Pa.Super.2004). The court noted that \u201cPennsylvania law is anything but \u2018well settled\u2019 on the issue ... [of] the validity of non-assignment clauses after a loss has occurred.\u201d Id. at 1288 (internal citation omitted). This observation was similar to one made by the trial court when it stated that \u201cPennsylvania law is unclear on this issue whether general stipulations prohibiting assignments absent an insurer\u2019s consent ... should apply only to pre-loss assignments.\u201d Trial Court Opinion at 4. The Superior Court noted that case law does not make clear when a \u201closs\u201d occurs.\nThe Superior Court rejected Gulfs argument that Fran & John\u2019s Doylestown Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 432 Pa.Super. 449, 638 A.2d 1023 (1994), and High-Tech-Enters. Inc. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., 430 Pa.Super. 605, 635 A.2d 639 (1993), mandated a finding that the assignment was invalid.\nThe Superior Court acknowledged that it could \u201conly honor [the decisions in Fran & John\u2019s and High-Tech-Enters.] to the extent that they comport with the binding law\u201d that this Court set forth in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l Services, Inc. v. Metro Life Ins. Co., 355 Pa. 155, 49 A.2d 382 (1946). Egger, 864 A.2d at 1239. It stated that in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, we noted that \u201cthere seems to be no sound reason for the insurance company to forbid or limit an assignment by a beneficiary of the amount due him or her after the death of the insured.\u201d Id. at 1240 (citing Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, 49 A.2d at 382-83). Recognizing that our holding in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l accorded with well-accepted principles of interpretation of insurance policies, the Superior Court concluded that the prohibition of an assignment after the loss has occurred would be void as against public policy.\nSimilarly, the Superior Court rejected Gulfs argument that the loss in this case was not fixed until the jury entered its verdict, which was one day after Foulke assigned its right to the excess insurance policy to Appellee. The court determined that although the exact amount of the loss was not known at the time of the assignment, the \u201crisk, although not yet quantified to the penny by a jury, was in principle triggered by the injury itself and Foulke\u2019s personnel\u2019s conduct in response thereto, matters that occurred long before Foulke\u2019s assignment of the policy to Egger.\u201d Id. at 1242.\nOn June 20, 2005, we granted Gulfs Petition for Allowance of Appeal, limited to one issue, which was \u201c[wjhether an assignee has standing to sue an insurer where an insured\u2019s assignment of its interests in an insurance policy is made to the assignee in violation of a policy restriction requiring the insurer\u2019s consent?\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court.\nDISCUSSION\nIn the matter sub judice, we determine whether an assignment of rights that did not comply with the requirement of prior written consent is fatal to Appellee\u2019s claim of standing. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the assignment was valid and that it conferred standing upon the Assignee.\nThis matter involves an appeal from a trial court order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellee on the issue of the effectiveness of the assignment of the Gulf excess insurance policy. The appropriate construction of an insurance policy poses a question of law, and our review, therefore, is plenary. Minnesota Fire Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, 579 Pa. 333, 855 A.2d 854 (2004).\nIn reviewing a summary judgment order, we \u201cwill reverse the order of a trial court only where the court committed an error of law or clearly abused its discretion.\u201d Mountain Vill. v. Bd. of Supervisors of Longswamp Twp., 582 Pa. 605, 874 A.2d 1, 5 (2005).\nGulf argues that the assignment of Foulke\u2019s excess insurance policy rights to Appellee was invalid because the policy required advance written notice, and no such notice was given. In the alternative, Gulf contends that the assignment failed because it took place prior to the \u201closs,\u201d which, in its view, did not occur until the jury returned its excess verdict.\nGulf concedes that Pennsylvania law \u201callows a post-lost assignment in spite of a non-assignment clause because a post-loss assignment cannot increase the risk to the insurer associated with an undesirable assignee, as the insurer\u2019s payment obligation is already \u2018fixed.\u2019 \u201d Brief of Appellant at 17. However, Gulf posits that this is not the situation in the in iristant matter. Gulf alleges that Foulke\u2019s assignment was a \u201cpreloss\u201d assignment because it was made prior to the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThe trial court noted that \u201cPennsylvania law is unclear on this issue whether general stipulations prohibiting assignments absent an insurer\u2019s consent ... should apply only to pre-loss assignments.\u201d Trial Court Opinion at 4. Gulfs argument that the assignment was invalid pursuant to Pennsylvania law rests almost exclusively on two Superior Court decisions, both of which ignored our holding in Nat'l Mem\u2019l Services, Inc. v. Metro Life Ins. Co., 355 Pa. 155, 49 A.2d 382 (1946).\nIn its prior holdings in Fran & John\u2019s Doylestown Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 432 Pa.Super. 449, 638 A.2d 1023 (1994), and High-Tech-Enters., Inc. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., 430 Pa.Super. 605, 635 A.2d 639 (1993), the Superior Court invalidated assignments that violated insurers\u2019 requirements for prior written consent. In those cases, the Superior Court relied on the plain language in the policies. As the Superior Court stated in the instant matter, with respect to Fran & John\u2019s:\nWe reached this ruling in keeping with our courts\u2019 oft-stated commitment to interpret the language of an insurance policy according to its plain meaning. See Lititz Mut. Ins. Co. v. Steely, 567 Pa. 98, 785 A.2d 975, 978 (2001), (\u201c[T]he goal of interpreting an insurance policy ... is to determine the intent of the policy.\u201d)\nEgger, 864 A.2d at 1239.\nHowever, in the matter before us, the Superior Court correctly acknowledged that Fran & John\u2019s and High-Tech- Enters, did not consider the holding of this Court in Nat'l Mem\u2019l. The trial court, however, did rely on our decision in that matter when it determined that Fouike\u2019s assignment of the Gulf excess insurance policy to Appellee was valid.\nIn Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, we were asked to determine whether the assignment of the proceeds of life insurance policies by the beneficiaries to an undertaker to pay for funeral costs of the insured was valid following the death of the insured. In that case, the insurance policy provided that the \u201cPolicy may be assigned to any national bank, state bank, or trust company, but any assignment ... of this Policy or of any of its benefits to an assignee other than one of the foregoing shall be void.\u201d Id. at 882. On the day that the insured died, his beneficiaries assigned the proceeds of the policies to an undertaker who subsequently reassigned his interest to a finance company, the plaintiff in the case. The defendant insurance company refused plaintiffs demand for payment of the proceeds, on the basis of its opinion that the assignments were invalid.\nBecause the undertaker clearly was not a permitted assignee, the assignment violated the policy\u2019s express terms. The defendant insurance company argued that the express terms of the policy prohibited an assignment made after the death of the beneficiary. We rejected that contention, reasoning that:\nWe ... understand why an insurer would limit the right of the insured to assign his interests in a policy as otherwise some improvident or undersirable [sic] assignee might allow the policy to lapse for the nonpayment of premiums. But there seems to be no sound reason for the insurance company to forbid or limit an assignment by a beneficiary of the amount due him or her after the death of the insured.\nMoreover, the general principles applicable to the interpretation of insurance policies further support our interpretation. Text writers and judicial decisions very generally recognize that stipulations in policies forbidding an assignment, except with the insurer\u2019s consent, apply only to assignments before loss or death of the insured or the maturity of the policy. An assignment of the policy or rights thereunder after the occurrence of the event, which creates the liability of the insurer, is not, therefore, precluded.... [A] provision in a policy, prohibiting an assignment after loss has occurred, is generally regarded as void, in that it is against public policy so to restrict the relation of debtor and creditor by restricting or rendering subject to the control of the insurer an absolute right in the nature of a chose in action.\nId. at 382-83 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\nThe general rule that we articulated in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l is that a non-assignment clause in an insurance contract is not enforceable after the loss has occurred. The parties in the matter sub judice do not quarrel with that; rather, they dispute when the \u201closs\u201d occurred. Appellee contends that \u201closs\u201d refers to the date of the tortious conduct that caused the harm. Gulf asserts that \u201closs\u201d did not occur until the jury rendered its verdict.\nThe logic behind the general rule is that post-loss assignments do not invalidate the policy, thereby changing the risks the insurer undertook to insure; rather, they assign the right to a money claim. See G. Couch, CYCLOPEDIA OF INSURANCE LAW \u00a7 35.7 (3d ed. 1995) (\u201cThe purpose of a no assignment clause is to protect the insurer from increased liability, and after events giving rise to the insurer\u2019s liability have occurred, the insurer\u2019s risk cannot be increased by a change in the insured\u2019s identity.\u201d).\nWhile Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l involved life insurance policies and the matter concerns an excess insurance policy, this distinction does not warrant a different outcome or analysis. The triggering event for coverage in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l was the death of the insured. Accordingly, we found that there was no \u201csound reason for the insurance company to forbid or limit an assignment by a beneficiary of the amount due him or her after the death of the insured.\u201d Id. at 382-83.\nHowever, with the Gulf excess insurance policy, there was no death of an insured; rather, Foulke purchased coverage to protect itself against an award of damages exceeding the limits of its primary liability policy with respect to its activities at the PECO plant. Foulke provided plant protection and security services pursuant to its contracts with PECO. Gulf insured these activities of Foulke through its issuance of an excess insurance policy, \u201cwhich provides coverage for any sum the insured is obligated to pay for bodily injury arising out of an \u2018occurrence.\u2019 \u201d Trial Court Opinion at 2. It is an \u201cOccurrence\u201d that triggers the obligation of Foulke.\nRelevant terms of the policy provided the following:\nI. Coverage\n(1) We will pay on behalf of the \u201cinsured\u201d those sums in excess of the \u201cRetained Limit\u201d which the \u201cInsured\u201d by reason of liability imposed by law shall become legally obligated to pay as damages for:\n(a) \u201cBodily Injury!,]\u201d or\n(b) \u201cProperty Damage!,]\u201d arising out of an \u201cOccurrence\u201d to which this insurance applies. This insurance only applies to \u201cBodily Injury\u201d or \u201cProperty Damage\u201d [ ] which occurs during the POLICY PERIOD stated in Item 2 of the Declarations (the \u201cPolicy Period\u201d).\n(2) We will further pay on behalf of the \u201cInsured\u201d those sums in excess of the \u201cretained Limit\u201d which the \u201cInsured\u201d by reason of liability imposed by law shall become legally obligated to pay as damages for:\n(a) \u201cAdvertising Injury!,]\u201d or\n(b) \u201cPersonal Injury\u201d\nfirst committed during the POLICY PERIOD stated in Item 2 of the Declarations (the \u201cPolicy Period\u201d).\nBrief of Appellant at 25-26.\nConsequently, in parsing the terms of the policy, the triggering event for coverage was bodily injury occasioned by Foulke, which arose out of an Occurrence during the period of the policy. The policy defined \u201cOccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident ... that results in \u2018Bodily Injury\u2019 or \u2018Property Damage\u2019 that is not expected or not intended by the \u2018Insured.\u2019 \u201d Exhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy, Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, Section IV (DEFINITIONS) at H. The Occurrence was Egger\u2019s accident.\nIt is undisputed that Egger\u2019s accident occurred on September 5, 1997, that he immediately placed an emergency call for help to Foulke personnel, that it took approximately twenty minutes for the personnel to arrive and assist him, and that they arrived on the scene without rescue or first aid equipment. Trial Court Opinion at 2. The Foulke personnel decided to retrieve Egger from the confined space in which he was working, rather than administer first aid, and, in the meantime, Egger bled to death. Id.\nIn attempting to circumvent the principle that we articulated in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l that a restriction against a post-loss assignment is void, Gulf asserts that its loss did not arise until the jury reached its verdict and awarded damages in an amount exceeding the underlying $1,000,000.00 of primary insurance coverage. Because the jury reached its verdict establishing excess damages on February 9, 2001, Gulf asserts that the assignment of the policy on February 7, 2001, prior to that verdict, was an invalid pre-loss assignment. Gulf cites the policy language stating that it \u201cwill pay on behalf of the \u2018Insured\u2019 those sums in excess of the \u2018Retained Limit\u2019 which the \u2018Insured\u2019 by reason of liability imposed by law shall become legally obligated to pay\u201d as support for its position that the loss does not occur until the time of the jury verdict: Exhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy, INSURING AGREEMENTS, I (COVERAGE), Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\nThis argument lacks merit. First, as Appellee correctly notes, the term \u201cby reason of liability imposed by law\u201d could mean, for example: (1) only after a judgment has been entered; (2) only after all appeals are exhausted and the verdict stands; (3) only after efforts to execute judgment have begun; (4) the occurrence upon which the liability is based (i.e., the death of Egger); or (5) only after the tender of primary coverage. Brief of Appellee at 22. This demonstrates the ambiguity of the clause that Gulf cites as support for its argument that this term means the jury verdict.\nWe have stated that where ambiguity exists in the interpretation of policy language, the ambiguity must be construed in favor of coverage. Standard Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Ins. Co., 503 Pa. 300, 469 A.2d 563 (1983). Further, \u201c[cjontractual language is ambiguous \u2018if it is reasonably susceptible of different constructions and capable of being understood in more than one sense.\u2019 \u201d 401 Fourth St., Inc. v. Investors Ins. Group, 583 Pa. 445, 879 A.2d 166, 171 (2005) (internal citation omitted).\nGulfs position that \u201cby reason of liability imposed by law\u201d is synonymous with the jury verdict is weak at best, due to its ambiguity and does not support its position that there was no loss prior to the jury verdict. Clearly, it was within the purview of the insurance company to draft this provision in an unambiguous manner to reflect that Gulfs obligations did not arise until the jury reached a verdict in an amount exceeding the limits of the underlying liability policy. This it did not do.\nFurther, we note that when reading all of the sections of the insurance policy, it is clear that Gulfs responsibilities and role as excess insurer did not commence at the rendering of the verdict. For example, consistent with the fact that its obligation was triggered by the injury to Egger, its policy required the insured to notify it of any \u201c \u2018Occurrence\u2019 or offense which may result in a \u2018Claim\u2019 or \u2018Suit.\u2019 \u201d Exhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy, \u201cCONDITIONS,\u201d E, Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.\nSecond, this Court has articulated that a \u201closs\u201d is \u201cthe occurrence of the event, which creates the liability of the insurer.\u201d Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, 49 A.2d at 383. The event that occasioned the liability of Gulf, was the \u201cOccurrence\u201d to which the policy applied; i.e., the bodily injury that Foulke caused to Egger on September 5,1997.\nFederal courts, when applying Pennsylvania law in analogous circumstances, have adopted our analysis and holding in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, and validated post-loss assignments made without consent of the insurer. In Viola v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., 965 F.Supp. 654 (E.D.Pa.1997), a tort plaintiff sued an umbrella liability insurer to recover under a policy issued to its insured, the individual who had attacked plaintiff, and then assigned the policy to the victim. In addressing an assignment clause that required the consent of the insurer, where no consent had been procured, the district court cited Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l and found the assignment valid because \u201cdespite the presence of a non-assignment clause in an insurance contract, \u2018[a]n assignment of the policy or rights thereunder after the occurrence of the event, which creates the liability of the insurer, is not [ ] precluded.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 658 (citing Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, 49 A.2d at 383) (emphasis added).\nFurther, the court in Viola noted that:\n[AJfter a loss has occurred, the right of the insured or his successor in interest to the indemnity provided in the policy becomes a fixed and vested right; [and] ... is an obligation or debt due from the insurer to the insured, subject only to such claims, demands, or defenses as the insurer would have been entitled to make against the original insured.\nId.\nThe trial court noted that \u201cthe great majority of courts adhere to the rule that general stipulations in policies prohibiting assignments thereof except with the consent of the insurer apply only to assignments before loss, and do not prevent an assignment after loss.\u201d Trial Court Opinion at 7 (quoting G. Couch, COUCH ON INSURANCE \u00a7 35:7 (3d ed.1995)). Courts in Delaware, Georgia, Wisconsin, Oregon, Iowa, and Texas have held that clauses that require the consent of the insurer prior to assignment prohibit only the transfer of rights prior to a loss and not after the loss has occurred. See Int\u2019l Rediscount Corp. v. Hartford Accident and Indem. Co., 425 F.Supp. 669 (D.Del.1977); Georgia Coop. Fire Ass\u2019n v. Borchardt & Co., 123 Ga. 181, 51 S.E. 429 (1905); Straz v. Kansas Bankers Sur. Co., 986 F.Supp. 563 (E.D.Wis.1997); Spare v. Home Mut. Ins. Co., 17 F. 568 (C.C.D.Or.1883); Conrad Bros. v. John Deere Ins. Co., 640 N.W.2d 231 (Iowa 2001); McLaren v. Imperial Cas. & Indem. Co., 767 F.Supp. 1364 (N.D.Tex. 1991).\nIn another federal district court opinion applying Pennsylvania law, the court found that where an injury \u201cwhich could potentially place liability upon the [insurers] ... occurred prior to the assignment,\u201d the non-assignment provision did not prohibit the insured from assigning its rights under its policies without the consent of the insurer. Continental Cas. Co. v. Diversified Indus., Inc., 884 F.Supp. 937, 948 (E.D.Pa.1995).\nIn keeping with our holding in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, the district court in Continental noted that:\nGenerally, non-assignment clauses are included in insurance policies for the protection of insurers. Such clauses are designed to guarantee that an increase of the risk of loss by a change of the policy\u2019s ownership cannot occur without the consent of the insurer. Because non-assignment clauses limit the amount of risk that the insurer may be forced to accept, courts will generally strike down an insured\u2019s attempt to assign its policy to a new insured. Consistent with the general purposes of non-assignment clauses, however, courts are reluctant to restrict the assignment of an insured\u2019s right to payment which has already accrued. Therefore, because an insured\u2019s right to proceeds vests at the time of the loss giving rise to the insurer\u2019s liability, restrictions on an insured\u2019s right to assign its proceeds are generally rendered void.\nContinental, 884 F.Supp. at 946 (internal citations omitted).\nGulf has not established in what regard Foulke\u2019s assignment of the policy to Egger increased its risk of loss. It merely suggests that, unlike the scenario in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, its policy was one for excess liability, not for life insurance. While that is true, Gulf offers no legal authority to support its notion that the assignment of a life insurance policy requires a different analysis than the assignment of an excess insurance policy. It merely concludes that \u201c[t]he assignment in this case was necessarily invalid because it was made before the jury\u2019s verdict and hence before the loss was \u2018fixed\u2019 or made a \u2018debt due\u2019 under the plain text of the policy, which is wholly in accord with the increased risk principles espoused in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l Services.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 27.\nGulf confuses loss with the subsequent fixing of a precise amount of damages for that loss. Although the dollar amount of a life insurance policy is known at the time of the insured\u2019s death, and the exact dollar amount of Gulfs liability under the excess policy was not fixed until the jury returned its verdict, this does not establish increased risk to Gulf following the assignment.\nWe find that Gulfs explanation that it \u201cdid, in fact, experience an increased risk on account of the pre-loss assignment by Foulke[,]\u201d Brief of Appellant at 27, defies logic as well as the reality of the course of action it chose to pursue during the underlying litigation. Gulf contends that when Foulke and its primary insurer settled with Egger, they \u201chad no motivation to aggressively defend against her claims because Foulke\u2019s liability was fixed by the settlement.\u201d Id. Gulf also claims increased risk as a result of \u201cFoulke\u2019s complicity\u201d in failing to call a particular witness on the same day that Foulke and its primary insurer settled with Egger. Id. at 28. According to Gulf, this meant that the \u201cjury was deprived of crucial testimony that could have diminished its award or even prompted a verdict for Foulke.\u201d Id.\nThese complaints border on the absurd, given that Gulf advised, the court and Foulke before the jury verdict that it denied coverage for all claims and chose not to participate in the trial in any way. Gulf did this, despite the right afforded to it in its policy covering Foulke, which provided that:\nWe will, at our sole discretion, have the right and opportunity to associate and participate with you or any provider of \u201cUnderlying Insurance\u201d or other insurance in the investigation, negotiation, settlement, defense or trial of any \u201cClaim\u201d or \u201csuit\u201d reasonably likely to involve us under this policy. If we exercise such light, we will do so at our own expense.\nExhibit F, Commercial Umbrella Policy, II DEFENSE SETTLEMENT, (4)(c), Supplemental Appendix to Combined Reply in Support of Defendant Gulf Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. The insurance contract furnished Gulf with the right to participate in the trial along with Security, the primary insurance carrier. Gulf elected not to do so and cannot be heard now to complain that the jury was deprived of hearing testimony that Gulf deemed favorable.\nFoulke\u2019s primary insurer had tendered its full policy limit of $1,000,000.00 on the day the jury was selected. Appellee rejected that offer and demanded $1,600,000.00, thus implicating Gulfs excess policy. Because Gulf opted to deny coverage and not participate in the proceedings, any adverse consequences arising from that decision, real or purported, do not constitute increased risk arising from the assignment of the policy.\nGulfs risk remained the same, regardless of whether Foulke or Appellee held the policy. That risk was that a jury on some date subsequent to 1997 would assess damages in an amount greater than $1,000,000.00 for the fatal injuries that Foulke personnel caused Egger on September 5, 1997. Once Foulke, the original insured, acted negligently in causing the death of Egger, the bargained-for risk was realized and was not changed by the assignment of rights to Appellee. The loss had occurred, and it remained only for that loss to be liquidated through legal proceedings.\nThe Superior Court correctly rejected Gulfs argument that the \u201closs\u201d did not occur until the jury reached its excess verdict. It determined that\nThe risk, although not yet quantified to the penny by a jury, was in principle triggered by the injury itself and Foulke\u2019s personnel\u2019s conduct in respect thereto, matters that occurred long before Foulke\u2019s assignment of the policy to Egger. We cannot let the language of the Policy outweigh the clear policy embodied by our Supreme Court in National Mem\u2019l Services.\nEgger, 864 A.2d at 1242.\nAccordingly, we determine that whether or not the assignment was made prior to the jury verdict is irrelevant, as the obligation of Gulf to provide excess coverage, in the event of damages exceeding the limits of the primary policy, arose on the date of the occurrence in 1997. The assignment changed only the identity of the party who was entitled to recover under the Gulf policy, in the event an excess verdict was obtained. Pursuant to our analysis in Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, because Gulfs risk was not increased following the assignment, since the assignment was subject \u201cto such claims, demands, or defenses as the insurer would have been entitled to make against the original insured,\u201d Nat\u2019l Mem\u2019l, 49 A.2d at 383, the Superior Court correctly determined that the assignment was valid.\nAccordingly, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court.\nJustices CASTILLE, EAK1N and BAER join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellee settled other claims against PECO and National Liquid Blasting, Inc., the manufacturer of the water jet.\n2. In the section labeled \"Introduction,\u201d the insurance policy defined a \"Named Insured\u201d as \"any person or organization identified as a \u2018Named Insured' under INSURING AGREEMENT III.\" Foulke Associates, Inc. was the \"Named Insured.\u201d Accordingly, that part of section K that permitted assignment without prior consent in the event of the \u201cdeath of an individual \u2018Named Insured'\" was not applicable where the Named Insured was Foulke and not an individual.\n. PECO received $175,000.00 of the $1,000,000.00 insurance policy as settlement for its cross-claim against Foulke.\n. Additionally, the Superior Court addressed another issue that is not before the Court in the matter sub judice regarding whether Gulfs policy covered the actions of Foulke\u2019s employees or whether those activities were subject to a Professional Liability Exclusion in the policy. The court affirmed the finding of the trial court that ambiguities in the policy required a finding in favor of the insured that the services were covered.\n. Gulf argues in the alternative that: (1) the plain language of the non-assignment clause in the policy rendered the assignment invalid; or (2) if the plain language of the policy is disregarded, the assignment was otherwise invalid because it was made prior to the loss.\n. It is true, as Appellee recognizes, that an insured or assignee potentially could engage in some type of \"illegitimate manipulation\" of the variables involved in litigation. Brief of Appellee at 9. However, Appellee correctly notes that if such manipulation were to occur, the insurer would have the full array of affirmative defenses to negate its obligation to indemnify. Id.\n. The trial court\u2019s response to the argument of Gulf that the assignment was made pre-loss, rather than post-loss, differed from that of the Superior Court. It reasoned that:\nAlthough the assignment clause in the agreement between Egger and Foulke may have existed before the jury verdict, it was merely an agreement to assign and did not become an actual assignment until after the $3.5 million jury verdict. [E]vidence of this is the written agreement attached to Egger's Complaint which shows that the execution date of the agreement was \u201cMarch 15, 2001[,]\" [] over a month after the February 6, 2001, jury verdict.... Since Foulke assigned its rights under the Gulf policy to Egger after the loss ... the assignment \"passes muster\u201d under our Supreme Court's holding in National and is therefore valid.\nTrial Court Opinion at 8. While this analysis is not without appeal, our holding that the loss occurred with the death of Egger in 1997 renders the date of the jury verdict irrelevant. Accordingly, we do not determine the merits of the trial court\u2019s construction.\n. Pursuant to the terms of the excess policy, Gulf also could have protected itself by participating in the litigation process.",

        "text": "Chief Justice CAPPY,\nconcurring.\nI join the Majority Opinion. I write separately to address the suggestion that our decision in the present appeal is merely advisory, which is raised by the inference that the assignment between Appellee Patricia M. Egger (\u201cEgger\u201d) and Foulke Associates, Inc. (\u201cFoulke\u201d), taking place on March 15, 2001 after both Charles Egger\u2019s death on September 5, 1997 and the jury\u2019s excess verdict on February 9, 2001, is necessarily post-loss. See Sgarlat v. Board of Adjustment of Kingston Borough, 407 Pa. 324, 180 A.2d 769, 771 (1962) (reiterating that our courts concern themselves with facts and actual controversies; their obligations do not include deciding moot, hypothetical, fictitious and abstract principles of law.)\nI believe that our opinion is not advisory in nature. For purposes of applying the guiding principles this Court set forth in National Memorial Services, Inc. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 355 Pa. 155, 49 A.2d 382 (1946), to determine whether an insured\u2019s assignment of its interests in an insurance policy will be upheld because it was post-loss, the pre-verdict contract that Egger and Foulke entered on February 8, 2001, wherein Foulke agreed to assign its rights under the Gulf Insurance Company (\u201cGulf\u2019) policy to Egger in the event of an excess verdict, was the legally significant transaction. It is the February 8, 2001 contract that Gulf argues changed the risk that it undertook to insure, such that under National Memorial, Foulke\u2019s assignment to Egger was essentially pre-loss and should not be validated. Thus, despite the fact of the assignment\u2019s actual execution on February 9, 2001, there was a disputed question for this court to resolve in this appeal as to whether the assignment, which arose out of the pre-verdict contract to assign, was post-loss within the meaning of National Memorial.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nI respectfully differ with the majority\u2019s decision to invoke public policy to preclude the enforcement of a contractual provision restricting the assignment of the insured\u2019s rights under an excess liability insurance policy that occurred prior to the entry of an actual judgment in the underlying tort litigation.\nIn the first instance, I note that public policy determinations are usually better suited to the legislative, rather than the judicial forum. Thus, a high threshold must be met prerequisite to judicial intervention into private contractual affairs on public policy grounds. In this regard, this Court has explained that avoidance of unambiguous contractual terms on public policy grounds requires the demonstration of an .overriding public policy deriving from the laws and legal precedents, long governmental practice, or obvious ethical or moral standards. See Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 538 Pa. 337, 347-48, 648 A.2d 755, 760 (1994) (citing Muschany v. United States, 324 U.S. 49, 66-67, 65 S.Ct. 442, 451, 89 L.Ed. 744 (1945)). Further, it is only in cases in which there is a near unanimity of opinion concerning the applicability and importance of the salient policy that action is to be taken. See id. at 348, 648 A.2d at 760 (quoting Mamlin v. Genoe, 340 Pa. 320, 325, 17 A.2d 407, 409 (1941)).\nI agree with the majority that this threshold is met relative to the disapproval of anti-assignment clauses pertaining to life and casualty insurance policies upon the accrual of a loss contemplated under the policy, for the reasons that the majority describes. See Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 293-97, 903 A.2d at 1223-24 (citing, inter alia, National Mem\u2019l Servs., Inc. v. Metro Life Ins. Co., 355 Pa. 155, 49 A.2d 382 (1946)). As the majority highlights, in the life and casualty insurance cases, there is a prevailing sentiment that the indemnity provided in the policy becomes sufficiently fixed and vested upon the accrual of a loss (the death of the insured or damage to his property), such that there is no longer any legitimate function of an anti-assignment provision. See National Mem\u2019l Servs., 355 Pa. at 155, 49 A.2d at 383. I do not believe, however, that this reasoning is readily transportable to the present setting involving a pre-judgment assignment of rights and interests under a policy of excess liability insurance.\nCases involving liability insurance are more complex than the life and casualty cases, due to the substantial and direct involvement of a third-party interest, namely, that of the plaintiff in the underlying suit (here, Appellee), thus creating an additional layer of uncertainty concerning the liability insurer\u2019s obligation to make payments under the policy, particularly in the context of an excess insurer. Further, as the majority recognizes, there is a potential for manipulation in connection with a pre-judgment assignment to the plaintiff of a defendant\u2019s rights and interests under an excess liability insurance policy. See Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 303 n. 6, 903 A.2d at 1228 n. 6. Such potential represents a form of increased risk, affording the insurer a legitimate reason to guard against it by means of a contractual provision requiring its consent as a prerequisite to assignment, at least prior to the entry of a judgment or the effectuation of a comprehensive settlement of the underlying tort litigation. I believe that this dynamic distinguishes the National Memorial Services line of cases, in which no such legitimate reasons were found.\nIn summary, since I do not believe that the circumstances of this case present the kind of extraordinary situation in which the courts should act to void a private contractual undertaking on public policy grounds, I would reverse the order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment against Gulf. \u25a0\n. The majority's explanation that the insurer has a full array of affirmative defenses in the event of manipulation does not negate the risk, in that manipulation is inherently a covert activity and, therefore, it may be difficult to prove. Further, even if proof is available, the insurer will incur additional expense (the subject of an increased risk) in establishing it.\n. I also have difficulty with the majority\u2019s decision to fault Gulf for its decision to deny coverage, see Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 302-03, 903 A.2d at 1228, since the Court declined to consider the validity of Gulf's reasons for that denial. Notably, in addition to the issue on which this appeal was allowed. Gulf also sought to raise the following question: \"If the assignee has standing and the assignment is effective, whether the negligent medical services provided by the insured were covered under the insurance policy?\u201d The Court, however, issued a limited grant order, which had the effect of denying review on that issue. See Egger v. Gulf Ins. Co., 583 Pa. 427, 879 A.2d 155 (2005) (per curiam). Further, as noted by the majority, the trial court determined that Gulf's denial of coverage was not made in bad faith. See Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 290-92, 903 A.2d at 1221.",
