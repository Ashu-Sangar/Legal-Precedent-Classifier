Accordingly, the Superior Court held that the search was unconstitutional, as Officer Fidler did not have any information in his possession at the time of his search to give him reasonable suspicion. The court emphasized that reasonable suspicion is to be determined based on information known to police before a detention and/or search, and, therefore, Mr. Thompson’s conduct in identifying himself to the arresting officer after Appellee’s arrest was irrelevant to the inquiry. <em>Wiley, </em><a href="/a2d/858/1191-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="858 A.2d 1191" data-case-ids="9163813" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/1191-01">858 A.2d at </a>1196 (citing <em>J.L., </em><a href="/us/529/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="529 U.S. 266" data-case-ids="9508406" data-case-paths="/us/529/0266-01">529 U.S. at 271</a>, <a href="/us/529/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="529 U.S. 266" data-case-ids="9508406" data-case-paths="/us/529/0266-01">120 S.Ct. 1375</a>) (“The reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search.”).</p>

Application of the ‘independent source doctrine’ is proper only in the very limited circumstances where the ‘independent source’ is truly independent from both the tainted evidence and the police or investigative team which engaged in the misconduct by which the tainted evidence was discovered.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, it is clear that had Officer Fidler not immediately run into the barbershop, or had reemerged from the barbershop without detaining and arresting [Appellee], Mr. Thompson would have approached him, identified himself, and personally provided him with the information that would have warranted the investigatory stop and protective frisk.

I agree that the Superior Court erred in applying an independent source analysis to the instant matter, even though it acknowledged that the Commonwealth argued <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>for an alternate reality where the evidence would have been inevitably discovered.

The Superior Court analyzed the evidence by asking what would have happened if the police officer had not illegally questioned the defendant about the nature of an item in his pocket. Specifically, the Superior Court found that the officer would have continued to, lawfully, frisk the defendant, and would have ultimately discovered a gun in the defendant’s pocket leading to a search incident to arrest and a full search yielding the seized drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 272.</p>
    <p id="b613-7" data-blocks='[["BL_613.6",613,[131,1359,1154,800]]]'>Presently, the trial court found that the caller was not anonymous by virtue of the fact that he appeared in court providing his name and address. Thus, the trial court concluded that Officer Fidler had the requisite reasonable suspicion by virtue of these curative facts, and that an anonymous call alone does not negate the chance of establishing reasonable suspicion. The Superior Court properly noted that it would be a fallacy to allow the Commonwealth to generate information giving rise to probable cause or reasonable suspicion after the fact. <em>Wiley, </em><a href="/a2d/858/1191-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="858 A.2d 1191" data-case-ids="9163813" data-case-paths="/a2d/858/1191-01">858 A.2d at 1197</a>. Accordingly, the Superior Court stated that, although it is possible for the searching officer to not have all the facts, e.g., when a dispatcher has the full facts but only outlines the suspect and location to an officer, somebody in the police department must have probable cause or reasonable suspicion before the stop.</p>

Rather, the caller, who had stayed at the scene to identify himself and assist with any further information, freely gave it at the first available opportunity. In all inevitable discovery cases, the actual search or seizure conducted is, at all times, improper.

For the reasons outlined above, I would allow the Commonwealth to further develop this argument at the trial court level and would remand for proceedings to examine the applicability of the inevitable discovery exception to the instant matter.</p>
