The absence of a developed record is no impediment to review of these questions because the cases pose purely legal challenges to two pieces of legislation: Act 44 of 2005,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> which tied salaries provided to the Judiciary, the General Assembly, and certain high-ranking executive branch officials to the salaries provided to federal officials by means of specific formulas, resulting in increased salaries; and Act 72 of 2005,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which repealed Act 44 in its entirety. The factual circumstances giving rise to the litigation are undisputed by the parties. Indeed, the parties assume the Court’s familiarity with, and acceptance of, certain foundational facts concerning the interplay between the two Acts and the occasion for Act 72. Thus, in the discussion that follows, and for purposes of background, we will take judicial notice of some of the relevant factual circumstances concerning the legislative process and the legislation itself.</p>
    <p id="b765-5" data-blocks='[["BL_765.4",765,[148,1160,1154,566]]]'>Act 44 was passed by the General Assembly without floor debate at approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 7, 2005. Act 44 was signed into law by Governor Edward G. Rendell on that same date. In its final form, Act 44 was twenty-two pages in length, and it, <em>inter alia, </em>removed the issue of official compensation from the political arena by adopting specific formulas for determining compensation for the Judiciary, the General Assembly, and certain high-ranking executive officials, which were based on the federal governmental salary structure. Application of the formulas resulted in compensation increases for all three branches.</p>
    <p id="b765-6" data-blocks='[["BL_765.5",765,[150,1759,1152,200]],["BL_766.1",766,[272,290,1165,1043]]]'>There was a negative public response to the legislation, focusing particularly upon its timing and method of passage and upon a provision providing for an increase in unvouchered expenses, which applied exclusively to the legislative branch.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>Governor Rendell defended the legislation, and specifically-defended the unvouchered expense provision, noting: “It’s legal — and that’s all I’m going to say about it.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Mr. Chief Justice Cappy, acting in his role as the leader of the Pennsylvania Judiciary,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> later authored two editorials for legal periodicals that defended Act 44. <em>See </em>Ralph J. Cappy, <em>Three Branches, Working Together: A collaborative effort has led to a compensation system that is right for Pennsylvania, </em>Pa. Law Weekly, July 25, 2005; Ralph J. Cappy, <em>Legislature Has Found a Compensation Plan That’s Right for Pa., </em>The Legal Intelligencer, July 27, 2005. In these editorials, the Chief Justice posited that Act 44 established a salary structure which was beneficial for good government by attracting and retaining qualified public servants. Moreover, the Chief Justice noted that, by linking the salaries paid to state officials to the federal governmental salary structure, Act 44 addressed the problem of political distraction generally associated with the mere consideration of pay raise legislation. The Chief Justice did not address the unvouchered expense provision applicable to the members of the General Assembly.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Thus, competing bills that would eventually become Act 72 were introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. A dispute between the two chambers stymied passage of the legislation before the general election took place. Following the November 8, 2005 election, however, the House of Representatives approved Act 72 on November 14, 2005; the Senate followed suit on November 16, 2005; and the Governor signed Act 72 into law on that same date. Act 72 on its face repealed Act 44 in its entirety.</p>

The first matter in order of time, <em>Stilp v. Commonwealth, </em>arose on August 1, 2005, when appellant Gene Stilp, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a Complaint in Mandamus and Bill of Equity in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction, challenging the constitutionality of Act 44. The respondents <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">

      </a>
      <em> </em>filed preliminary objections; Stilp filed an amended Complaint; and respondents renewed their preliminary objections. While those preliminary objections were pending, Act 72 was adopted as <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>law. On November 17, 2005, the Commonwealth Court stayed briefing on the preliminary objections and directed the parties to file memoranda of law on the issue of whether the case had been rendered moot by Act 72’s repeal of Act 44. On November 23, 2005, simultaneously with his Commonwealth Court submissions addressing mootness and a motion to stay the proceedings, Stilp filed an Application for Extraordinary Relief in this Court under Pa.R.A.P. 3309 requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>that we assume jurisdiction over the matter. Stilp also requested a stay of the Commonwealth Court proceedings. On November 30, 2005, the Commonwealth Court, in an unpublished, single-judge opinion by the Honorable James R. Kelley, dismissed Stilp’s challenge below on the basis of mootness and denied his request for a stay, noting that Stilp could appeal the dismissal to this Court as a matter of right. On December 22, 2005, this Court granted Stilp’s Application in part, assumed plenary jurisdiction over this matter, directed that the case be listed for oral argument at the same session with <em>Herron v. Commonwealth, </em>directed that the parties brief five issues that will be discussed later in this Opinion, and denied Stilp’s motion to stay the Commonwealth Court proceedings as moot. <em>See Stilp v.

The six participating members of this Court are not parties to these actions. However, the Justices, and indeed every member of the Judiciary in Pennsylvania, have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of these proceedings. The pecuniary interest implicated here would ordinarily require a judge to disqualify himself or herself from, the matter. That option, however, is not available here as recusals <em>en masse </em>would prevent any judicial review whatsoever of these important matters. Thus, under the present circumstance, the long-recognized common law “rule of necessity” requires this Court to proceed to discharge its constitutional duty notwithstanding any interest in the outcome. <em>See United States v.

The Judges argue that Act 72’s repeal of the Act 44 formula, a formula which led to an immediate increase in the compensation provided to the Judiciary, diminished judicial compensation during their terms of office, and that the single exceptional circumstance recognized by the Constitution which would allow for such <em>reduction </em>— i.e., where the compensation for “all salaried officers of the Commonwealth” is also diminished — is not implicated here. The Judges argue that the constitutional exception was intended only for a circumstance where governmental solvency is threatened in “a period of economic stress.” <em>See </em>Preparatory Committee’s Reference Manual No. 5, <em>The •Judiciary, </em>at 67.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_19" id="ref_footnote_1_19">19</a> Thus, the Judges contend, the Pennsylva<a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>nia Constitution sets a high bar before judicial compensation may be reduced, limited to a specific, extraordinary circumstance. If that circumstance is not implicated, the unambiguous prohibition against reducing judicial compensation is necessary to ensure the independence of the Judiciary, one of the three coordinate and equal branches of government. <em>See, e.g., Firing v. Kephart, </em><a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">466 Pa. 560</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="466 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1714961" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0560-01">353 A.2d 833</a>, 837 (1976) (“[T]he well-established purpose of the prohibition against diminishing the compensation of the Judiciary during their terms of office, contained in Section 16(a) but explicitly or implicitly present in the Pennsylvania Constitution since the Constitution of 1790, is to maintain the independence of the Judiciary from encroachment by the other branches of government .”) (footnote omitted).</p>

Act 44’s formula operated to immediately increase the compensation paid all Pennsylvania judges; Pennsylvania judges actually began receiving the new salaries as of July 8, 2005; the General Assembly reduced those salaries during the judges’ terms of office four months later with the November 16, 2005 enactment of Act 72; and, after November 16, 2005, Pennsylvania judges’ salaries in fact were rolled back to their previous levels.</p>

Instead, they assert that Act 72 was motivated by a political crisis facing the <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>General Assembly in the wake of their constituents’ reactions to certain aspects of Act 44.

Unlike the compensation increases that the Act 44 formulas provided to the legislators (in the form of unvouchered expenses) and the Judiciary, the increases in salaries provided to these named executive officers never took effect because Act 44 was repealed by Act 72 before any of these officers were either elected or appointed. Because no executive officers — including the ones specifically identified in Act 44 — had their compensation actually increased by Act 44, by definition, none saw their salaries decreased when Act 72 was adopted. For this separate and independent reason, the Judges argue, the Section 16(a) “all salaried officers” exception does not apply, and Act 72 must be deemed unconstitutional insofar as it reduced judicial compensation.</p>

Regarding Section l(b)’s declaration that Act 72 “was not intended to diminish or infringe on, or <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>otherwise interfere with, the independence of the judicial system,” the Judges assert that this is not the relevant constitutional test. To the contrary, the Judges note, the test is specifically set forth in Section 16(a) itself, and it looks to whether judicial compensation has been diminished by a law that does not apply generally to “all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” That test does not include an exception for instances where the reduction in judicial compensation ordered by the General Assembly was accompanied by a legislative declaration that it did not intend the reduction to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary; and this Court has never held that a statute diminishing judicial compensation survives constitutional scrutiny where the General Assembly claims that it did not thereby intend to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary. <em>See, e.g., Catania v.

In the Judges’ view, the Constitution does not afford the General Assembly the authority to attempt to define away a violation of Section 16(a). To grant the General Assembly the ability to do so, the Judges contend, would eliminate the Constitution’s authority to impose limitations or prohibitions on the legislative branch, in clear contravention of fundamental separation of powers principles. Further, the Judges note that the General Assembly’s declaration as to which officers constitute the “salaried officers of the Commonwealth” is inconsistent with: prior decisions of this Court interpreting the term “officer,” <em>see, e.g., Werner, supra; </em>the Constitution’s considerable guidance in determining who is an “officer,” <em>see, e.g., </em>Pa.

The <em>amici </em>also assert that the General. Assembly’s declarations in Sections 1(b) and (c) of Act 72 fail to save the Act from its patently unconstitutional effect upon judicial salaries. Indeed, the Philadelphia Bar' Association argues that the General Assembly, in seeking to bind the courts to a one-time definition of the term “salaried officers of the Commonwealth,” a definition which was obviously designed only in the. hope of insulating Act 72 against a constitutional challenge, sought to usurp the function of the Judiciary as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.

Addressing the exception, the Attorney General argues that neither the Constitution, nor the cases cited by the Judges for the definition of “officer” or “public officer,” specifically define “salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” Therefore, the Attorney General posits, the General Assembly properly filled that void and adopted what he views as a rational and legitimate definition of that constitutional term for purposes of Act 72. The Attorney General also contends that even if other Commonwealth employees not explicitly mentioned by either Act 44 or Act 72 may be considered “salaried officers of the Commonwealth,” there still is no violation of Section 16(a) because Act <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>72 applies generally, if only in the sense that it uniformly repeals all the salary increases that resulted from the Act 44 formulas.</p>

Unlike the Treasurer, however, the Speaker insists that Act 44 in fact was constitutional and, therefore, the Judges’ challenge to Act 72 must be resolved. The Speaker asserts that the values that the Section 16(a) prohibition protects are: (1) preventing the retributive act of singling out judicial compensation for reduction; and (2) preserving the Judiciary as a coequal branch of government.

The Speaker further maintains that the General Assembly’s definition of “salaried officers of the Commonwealth” in Section 1(c) is proper because, “where a position or officership is constitutionally-created but not constitutionally-defined, the General Assembly has historically defined that constitutional provision by statute.” Speaker Perzel’s Brief at 37.

Second, the Senator argues that the Judges’ contention that the exception in Section 16(a) requires that the compensation of every “salaried officer of the Commonwealth” be reduced at the same time is in direct conflict with Article III, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which prohibits the reduction of the salary of a public officer after his election <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>or appointment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> The Senator maintains that, under the Judges’ interpretation, the limited exception provided in Section 16(a) could never be exercised without conflicting with Article III, Section 27.

The Senator notes that it is not uncommon for the executive or legislative branch to interpret constitutional provisions in exercising their constitutional duties, albeit he concedes that it is ultimately the responsibility of the Judiciary to determine the proper interpretation. The Senator further argues that the General Assembly’s Act 72-specific definition of “salaried officers of the Commonwealth” is reasonable and provides certainty and predictability as it encompasses all members of the Legislature and Judiciary, and identifies some of the highest executive officers as the class to which any diminution of compensation must be applied in order to satisfy Section 16(a).</p>

The dispute in <em>Jorgensen </em>centered on the suspension of the Illinois Judiciary’s cost-of-living adjustments (“COLAs”) for the 2003 and 2004 fiscal years by the Illinois General Assembly and the Governor. Under Illinois law, judicial salaries, along with the salaries for other government officials, were determined by a Compensation Review Board (“Board”), which in turn was created by a Compensation Review Act. The Board was required to undertake periodic reevaluations of officials’ salaries, adjust them based on a variety of factors, and then submit a report to the Illinois General Assembly. After the Board filed its report, the General Assembly was <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>permitted to disapprove of it in whole or reduce it proportionately.</p>
    <p id="b792-4" data-blocks='[["BL_792.4",792,[282,424,1161,689]]]'>In 1990, the Board issued a report setting specific salaries for each of the offices and positions covered under the Compensation Review Act, and also determined that the salaries were to include automatic annual COLAs. These COLAs were deemed a component of salary fully vested if and when the Board’s report became law. The 1990 report was submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to the Compensation Review Act. The General Assembly then adopted a resolution that proportionally reduced the amount of compensation set by the Board for the various offices, but it expressly approved the portions of the Board’s report establishing automatic annual COLAs for the affected offices, including the Illinois Judiciary.</p>

In light of this legislative action, the Illinois Judiciary was not paid the COLA component of their salaries for the 2003 fiscal year. For the 2004 fiscal year, however, the General Assembly targeted funds, in an appropriation bill which was passed in the spring of 2003, to implement the COLAs for the Judiciary. The portion of the bill appropriating funds for the judicial COLAs, however, was removed via a reduction veto signed by the Governor of Illinois.</p>

The Illinois Supreme Court held that the actions by the coordinate branches of government violated the Illinois Constitution.

Given that our cases have recognized the purpose of the protective provision, it is foreseeable that Act 72 would be defended by appellees on grounds of its supposedly benign purpose. But, merely because the General Assembly salutarily claimed it did not intend to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, that does not mean that the legislation must be deemed constitutional. As correctly noted by the Judges, the constitutional test set forth in Section 16(a) is not whether the General Assembly intended to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, but rather the simpler, straightforward question of whether judicial compensation was diminished by a law that does not apply generally to “all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” Because the policy declaration announced by the General Assembly in Section 1(b) of Act 72 is not probative of the question posed by the plain language of Section 16(a), it cannot control our inquiry. Indeed, for this Court to accept the notion that legislative pronouncements of benign intent can control a constitutional inquiry concerning diminishing judicial compensation would be tantamount to <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>ceding our constitutional duty, and our independence, to the legislative branch.</p>

What can be distilled from the cases above is that certain factors are important in determining whether a person can be said to be an “officer” or “public officer,” including: (1) whether the person is appointed or elected to the position; (2) whether the person performs duties of a grave and important character; (3) whether the duties performed involve some of the functions of government; (4) whether the duties performed are for the benefit of the public; (5) whether the person receives a fixed salary paid out of the public treasury; (6) whether the person’s term is definite or fixed; and (7) whether the powers, duties, and emoluments become vested in a successor when the office becomes vacant. An evaluation of the above listed factors, as applied to the numerous officers cited by the Judges, leads to the unavoidable conclusion that Act 72 did not diminish the pay of “all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” For example, the executive officers (including cabinet members) named by the Judges are obviously salaried public officers. Therefore, Act 72’s reduction of judicial compensation does not fit within the single exception provided in Article V, Section 16(a); thus, Act 72 is unconstitutional to the extent it decreased judicial compensation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>

Thus, the formula-based salary increases provided to these named executive officers, unlike the increases in compensation provided to the Judiciary and the Legislature (through the guise of unvouchered expenses), never became effective because Act 72 repealed Act 44 before any of these executive officers were either elected or appointed. Therefore, because none of the named executive officers, and in fact no executive officers at all, had their salaries increased by Act 44, none had their salaries decreased by Act 72.

The test set forth in the constitutional provision is not whether the General Assembly intended to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary, but rather is whether judicial compensation was reduced by a law that does not apply generally to “all salaried officers of the Commonwealth.” The stated intention of the General Assembly does not and cannot supplant the mandate of the constitutional provision.</p>

Moreover, we recognize that the General Assembly obviously crafted its definition of the constitutional term in the hope of controlling this Court’s construction of Article V, Section 16(a)’s limited exception. The inclusion of the definition reflects the General Assembly’s palpable awareness that Act 72 was constitutionally suspect, to the extent that it decreased judicial compensation.

Corruption took the form of special laws legislation, logrolling, and arbitrary favoritism and was met with a demand for reform. The Constitutional Convention of 1872-73 was convened to reform corrupt legislative behavior, and to this end, the result was the constitutional strictures contained in Article III.

Stilp highlights two mechanical aspects of the allowances that, in his view, unquestionably prove that the allowances are a <em>de facto </em>salary increase. First, he notes that the unvouchered expenses authorized in Act 44 equaled the exact dollar-for-dollar amount of the increase in legislative salaries provided under the formula adopted by Act 44 and which were to take effect after the next election for each individual legislator. Indeed, the amount of the unvouchered expense allowance was <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>not expressed in dollar terms, but only with reference to the equivalent percentage of the future salary increase. Second, Stilp notes that the unvouchered expenses expired at different times, depending upon the election cycle. Thus, the expenses were available from July 7, 2005 (the effective date of Act 44) until November 30, 2006 for members of the House, all of whose seats would be up for election in the 2006 general election. For Senators, however, the expenses were made available until November 30, 2006 or November 30, 2008, depending on the term of office for each Senator. Concisely, Section 2 of Act 44, amending 46 Pa.C.S. § 1107, permitted legislators to immediately receive, as unvouchered expenses, the precise amount of their future salary increase until their actual salary increases took effect following each legislator’s next election. Furthermore, Stilp argues that the unvouchered expense allowances were not intended as compensation for actual expenses incurred by legislators; in this regard, he asserts, the $7,500 in vouchered expenses already provided to legislators each year is more than adequate to cover actually incurred expenses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_32" id="ref_footnote_1_32">32</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_33" id="ref_footnote_1_33">33</a>

There are notable distinctions, however. First, Act 44’s unvouchered expense provision does not state an absolute dollar amount of expenses to be afforded legislators. Instead, the amount of the allowance is determined by a formula that refers precisely to the future increase in legislative salary, <em>i.e., </em>the dollar difference between pre-Act 44 legislative salaries and the new salaries that would take effect following the next relevant legislative election. Second, with respect to legislative leaders, the corresponding raw dollar amount of the unvouchered expense allowance was substantially more than was at issue in any of the previous cases. Under the formula adopted by Act 44, the future salary of rank-and-file members of the General Assembly would rise over $11,000, from just under $70,000 per year to just over $81,000 per year. Thus, the mid-term “unvouchered expenses” authorized by the Act are in excess of $11,000 for each rank-and-file legislator. The amount of mid-term unvouchered expenses made available to legislative leaders and committee chairs, however, was much more dramatic. For example, Act 44 adopted a formula that raised the salaries of the Speaker of the House and the Senate President <em>pro tempore </em>by well over $30,000 per year, and made that very same amount immediately available to those legislators in the guise of mid-term unvouchered expenses.</p>

      <em>Consumer Party </em>assumed an appropriate deference to the judgment of the General Assembly with respect to midterm increases in expense allowances, in part because of the salutary presumption of constitutionality, and in part because the Court perceived the legitimate role that unvouchered expenses play where they bear a reasonable relationship to actual expenses. Indeed, the Court addressed at length the putative advantages in not requiring a dollar-for-dollar accounting of expenses. The Court’s analysis, however, did not purport to approve of any and all systems covering mid-term unvouchered expenses. To the contrary, the Court made clear that such expenses must bear a “reasonable relationship” to actual expenses. We see no constitutional infirmity in this general standard as adopted in <em>Consumer Party. </em>Expenses <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>are different from salary. There is, of course, much to be said for transparency in government, particularly when it comes to expenditures, and specific accounting procedures promote that transparency even if such a system requires an expenditure of time and money for accounting purposes. But, absent constitutional infirmity, it is not this Court’s role to dictate to a coordinate, coequal branch of government how best to approach the task of accounting for legitimate expenses. Thus, we continue to believe that, as a general matter, unvouchered expense allowances are not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. Accordingly, we reaffirm the core reasonable relationship standard which was adopted in <em>Consumer Party.</em>

To better frame the inquiry, we begin by emphasizing what the Court in <em>Consumer Party </em>did not say. In point of fact, the amount of the unvouchered expense allowance at issue in <em>Consumer Party </em>was not the same as the future legislative salary increase provided in that legislation (the salary increase was $10,000, while the unvouchered expense allowance was half that amount). More importantly, this Court never held, stated, or implied that any particular amount authorized for mid-term unvouchered expenses was constitutionally valid under the reasonable relationship standard and Article II, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Equally as important, and contrary to the present argument of the Speaker, this Court certainly did not hold, state or imply that mid-term unvouchered expense allowances for the Legislature comply with Article II, Section 8 so long as they are in the same amount as a future salary increase included in the same legislation. Thus, when the Speaker asks for a “dependable” Article II, Section 8 ruling on “the continued constitutionality of those unvouchered expense allocations in the amount of the future pay raise,” Speaker Perzel’s Brief at 26 (emphasis added), he has misperceived the inquiry. <em>Consumer Party </em>never said or suggested that such a system was constitutionally valid.</p>

Speaker Perzel, on the other hand, never acknowledges this standard set forth in Consumer <em>Pa-rty, </em>instead focusing upon the facts alone, and suggesting incorrectly that the case thereby stands for the proposition that mid-term unvouchered expenses are constitutional under Article II, Section 8 so long as they are in the same amount as the future legislative salary increase provided in the legislation.

However, it is notable that the legislative parties do not dispute his claim that the unvouchered expenses authorized by Act 44 are not reasonably related to the actual, and otherwise-unreimbursed, expenses incurred by legislators in the discharge of their public duties. Moreover, if the unvouchered expense allowance could plausibly be explained as intended to cover actual expenses, rather than to serve as additional salary, we have no doubt that this proposition would be an easy matter for the legislative parties to demonstrate. And, as the parties uniquely in a position to provide such proof, the failure to so argue, or to forward such a proffer, is significant notwithstanding Stilp’s ultimate burden. Also, with respect to Stilp’s burden of proof, we are presented with arguments that were not foiwarded or discussed in <em>Consumer Party, </em>including Stilp’s focus on the fact that the staggered timing of the expiration of the unvouchered expenses prove they serve as additional salary. Stilp also properly relies on the fact, which was not available to the challengers in <em>Consumer Party, </em>of intervening legislation, such as was at issue in <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>Stilp, </em>which tied the amount of mid-term provisions for unvouchered expenses precisely to the amount provided as a future increase in legislative compensation, and provided that the unvouchered expenses would expire once the new salaries took effect. The practice has become so fixed, indeed, that the Speaker, in this case, has misread <em>Consumer Party </em>itself as approving any amount of mid-term unvouchered expense allowance so long as the amount is the same as the future <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>increase in salary, even though the case said no such thing, and the facts could not have supported such a holding.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_37" id="ref_footnote_1_37">37</a>

The amount of unvouchered expenses provided legislative leaders (the Speaker and Senate President <em>pro tempore, </em>and the majority and minority leaders), meanwhile, was well in excess of $30,000 (three times the unvouchered expenses provided to the rank-and-file), and represented over 30% of their existing salaries.</p>

This Court has deemed the presumption in Section 1925 so fundamental to our task, when confronted with a finding that a provision of a statute is invalid, that we have invoked Section 1925 even where the parties failed to argue severability. <em>See, e.g., Mockaitis, </em><a href="/pa/575/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="834 A.2d 488" data-case-ids="630448,9080480" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0005-01,/a2d/834/0488-01">834 A.2d at 502</a>.

In Act 44, the General Assembly adopted a comprehensive new compensation system governing the three branches of government, a system which employed formulas tying the compensation paid Pennsylvania officials to that provided for corresponding federal officials, albeit in a stepped-down fashion. Insofar as the Act adopted the new compensation system for the legislative branch, that system could go into effect, without violating Article II, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, with the commencement of the next term of office for each legislative seat. A major and new perceived benefit of this system of compensation consisted in the fact that, by tying salary to the federal structure, the issue of raising official compensation would be de-politicized. This new system of compensation, however, was not “essentially and inseparably connected with” the legislative unvouchered expense provision, much less did it “depend upon” that provision. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1925. The remaining valid (but repealed) provisions are easily capable of being executed in accordance with the General Assembly’s manifest intention of providing a new and permanent compensation structure for officials in all three branches of government. In contrast, the legislative unvouchered expense provision had nothing to do with the new, comprehensive compensation system. Instead, that provision sought to avoid a constitutional limitation particular only to the legislative branch, which cannot increase its own salary or mileage during the same legislative term in which such a law is passed. Whatever may have been the motivation behind the unvouchered expense provision, it is clear that the provision was not integral to the workings of the comprehensive <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>system of governmental compensation otherwise adopted in Act 44.</p>

This is so, Stilp contends, because striking the entirety of Act 44 as unconstitutional. would render the Act void <em>ab initio; </em>and, as a result, the increase in compensation already received by the Judiciary would be deemed a legal nullity.

In arguing the unconstitutionality of the nonseverability provision, Judge Herron contends that the General Assembly has no more power to repeal Act 44’s formula which increased judicial compensation through an indirect, contingent method — inclusion of a nonseverability provision — than to directly reduce judicial compensation, as it attempted to do in regard to Act 72.

In the ordinary case, a standard-less nonseverability clause is superfluous since the Legislature, once confronted with a judicial ruling that a provision of a statute is unconstitutional, may always revisit the subject anew, irrespective of whether the court deemed the unconstitutional provision severable. Such a practice leaves it to the legislative body to assess whether the statute, as affected by the judicial interpretation, is acceptable. Indeed, this practical fact may account for the relative rarity of nonseverability provisions. Having said this, for purposes of this appeal, we may assume that, as a general matter, nonseverability provisions are constitutionally proper. There may be reasons why the provisions of a particular statute essentially inter-relate, but in ways which are not apparent from a consideration of the bare language of the statute as governed by the settled severance standard set forth in Section 1925 of the Statutory Construction Act.

L. Rev. at 1000 (arguing that severability determinations are “guesswork by definition, and it is understandable for legislators to fear that the courts might guess wrong.”).

In an instance involving such compromise, the General Assembly may determine, the court’s application' of the logical standard of essential interconnection set forth in Section 1925 might undo the compromise; a nonseverability provision, in such an instance, may be essential to securing the support necessary to enact the legislation in the first place!

    <blockquote id="b855-4" data-blocks='[["BL_855.3",855,[177,294,1115,1009]]]'>
      <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>Pay increases for government employees are never politically popular, but this bill seemed unremarkable — although one could question the propriety of having the increase in expense allowances take effect immediately, so that the legislators were in effect voting an increase for themselves. Yet the truly extraordinary feature of the bill was not the hint of self-dealing, but rather the way in which the legislators sought to clothe the self-dealing in protective garb. For the bill contained the following language: “The provisions of this act are nonseverable. If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remaining provisions or applications of this act are void.” The implications of this clause are inescapable: there was some question as to the constitutionality of having legislators increase their own expense allowances; the legislature foresaw that a constitutional challenge was possible; and the inseverability clause ensured that if a court struck down the increase in legislators’ expense allowances, the increase in judicial salaries would be sacrificed as well.</blockquote>

Kameny describes this use of a nonseverability provision as “serving] an in térrorem function, as the legislature attempts to guard against judicial review altogether by making the price of invalidation too great.” <em>Id. </em>at 1001. This sort of practice, he continues, is “especially troubling” because it “represent[s] an attempt by the legislature to prevent the judiciary from exercising a power that rightly belongs to it.... These clauses, in other words, amount to coercive threats.” <em>Id. See also </em>Friedman, <em>Inseverability Clauses in Statutes, </em>64 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 919-20 (although nonseverability clauses should generally be honored and should be shown more deference than severability clauses, “courts’ deference to the plain meaning of inseverability clauses should not be unlimited. If giving effect to an inseverability clause would result in overstepping the bounds of legislative or judicial authority, then the clause should not be followed.”). <em>Accord Brown, </em><a href="/sw2d/664/0907-01" class="citation" data-index="196" data-cite="664 S.W.2d 907" data-case-ids="11764927" data-case-paths="/sw2d/664/0907-01">664 S.W.2d at 920</a> (declining to enforce nonseverability clause because “[t]he restriction placed on the execu<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>tive by [the nonseverability clause] effectively and unconstitutionally limits and interferes with the governor’s mandated duties.”).</p>

And, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>given the separation of powers concerns that arise from inclusion of the clause in a statute such as Act 44, which includes compensation provisions for the Judiciary, we hold that the clause is ineffective and cannot be permitted to dictate our analysis. Although we have confidence that no member of the Pennsylvania Judiciary in a position to pass upon the statute in fact would allow the effect of the clause to influence the analysis of any constitutional challenge, the fact remains that the clause, if deemed effective, acts as an incentive to engage in a less exacting constitutional inquiry. As the <em>Jorgensen </em>Court noted, in discussing the importance of the separation of powers, “[r]etribution against the courts for unpopular decisions is an ongoing threat.” <a href="/citations/?q=811%20N.E.2d%20652" class="citation" data-index="197" data-cite="811 N.E.2d 652">811 N.E.2d at 660</a>. In this case, the potential “retribution” is built into the statute itself in the would-be automatic effect of the nonseverability provision. It is improper, to say the least, for the Legislature to put a coequal branch of government in such a position. Whether this effect is the sole or primary purpose of the nonseverability provision, and whether it is entirely deliberate, is of less importance than the fact of its existence in such legislation, and the obvious influence such a provision might be designed to exert over the independent exercise of the judicial function.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_47" id="ref_footnote_1_47">47</a> In a case such as this, we conclude, enforcement of the clause would intrude upon the indepen<a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>dence of the Judiciary and impair the judicial function.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_48" id="ref_footnote_1_48">48</a> Accordingly, we will not enforce the clause but instead we will effectuate our independent judgment concerning severability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_49" id="ref_footnote_1_49">49</a> Therefore, and consistently with our severability analysis above, we hold that the unvouchered expense provision, which plainly and palpably violates Article II, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, is severable from the otherwise-constitutionally valid remainder of Act 44.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_50" id="ref_footnote_1_50">50</a>

We also find that the unconstitutional provision is severable from the remainder of the Act. Accordingly, we enjoin Act 72 in <a id="p644" href="#p644" data-label="644" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*644</a>part. The effect of our finding that the Act 72 repeal is ineffective in this limited respect is that Act 44’s provisions amending 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 1801-1809, which relate solely to the formula to determine compensation paid to the Judiciary, remain in force.</p>

The Judges further note, however, that in 1978, the Office of the Attorney General issued an official opinion concluding that the Attorney General himself and the Secretary of the Commonwealth were “officers” under the Constitution even though neither position at that time carried a definite term. <em>See </em>Pa.

Alternatively, Stilp argues that if this Court does not find the unvouchered expense provision unconstitutional, the portion of the provision which allows for additional unvouchered expenses for legislative leadership and committee service must independently be deemed unconstitutional under Article II, Section 8. This argument is premised on that part of Act 44 which provides higher salaries for leadership and committee service on top of the formula which increased the salaries provided to rank-and-file legislators. See Act 44, § 2 (amending 46 Pa.C.S. § 1103). Stilp notes that, because legislative officers and leaders receive higher salaries than rank-and-file legislators, the amount of unvouchered expenses provided to them is also greater since the unvouchered expenses are based on each legislator's future salary. In light of our disposition of these matters, we do not reach this distinct argument.</p>

Our reaffirmation of <em>Consumer Party's </em>recognition that mid-term unvouchered expenses are not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional, and the reasonable relationship standard as the constitutional measure of such legislation, is not an endorsement of the Court’s application of the test in that case. Mr. Justice Saylor’s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion — which emphasizes the sheer amount of the unvouchered allocation at issue in <em>Consumer Party </em>and the Court’s lack of concern with whether the allotments were reported as income or expenses on federal tax returns — ably outlines the strong argument that could be made that the <em>Consumer Party </em>Court’s application of the test it announced was excessively deferential, perhaps even implausible under the circumstances. We could add, to the points offered by Justice Saylor, the circumstance that the unvouchered expenses expired once the legislative salary increases took effect. As we explain below, however, the circumstances in this case are not at all the same as in <em>Consumer Party, </em>and thus, to discharge our duty in the case <em>sub judice </em>it is not necessary to speculate as to whether we would approve the mid-term unvouchered expense legislation at issue in <em>Consumer Party, </em>if faced with it again.</p>

As a matter of law, the <em>Consumer Party </em>Court rejected only the constitutional challenge and argument it identified as having been presented to it; no case purports to reject all possible arguments. In assessing the persuasiveness of a prior decision, a later court necessarily is confined to the arguments and discussion which are identified in the decision. Thus, the excessive deference now apparent in <em>Consumer Party </em>may well reflect the narrowness or insufficiency of the argumentation forwarded in the case, or it could represent the Court’s failure to address or appreciate all arguments forwarded.</p>

We find further support for our conclusion in the fact that none of the arguments in favor of enforcing this nonseverability provision offer any persuasive explanation of how it served some benign legislative purpose other than to attempt to influence and burden judicial review. For example, Speaker Perzel suggests that the provision merely shows that the General Assembly sought to ensure a ‘‘complete review and overhaul of public officials’ compensation” and not to tackle the task in ‘‘piecemeal fashion.” But the unvouchered expense provision obviously was not necessary to the comprehensive overhaul itself; that was already complete. Moreover, it is notable that here, unlike in <em>PAGE, </em>for example, the General Assembly included a global and boilerplate nonseverability provision, and not a partial, targeted, or specific one.</p>

Mr. Justice Saylor suggests that, unless this Court expressly overrules the approach in <em>Consumer Party, </em>we should apply a similar level of deference respecting the nonseverability provision as the <em>Consumer Party </em>Court applied to Act 39’s adoption of mid-term unvouchered expenses. But, as we have noted, our reaffirmation of the rational relationship rule in <em>Consumer Party </em>does not encompass reaffirmation of the application of that test, including the level of deference shown. More importantly and fundamentally, we do not believe that there is an equivalence between deference to legislative judgment concerning the manner of defraying and accounting for legislative expenses, and deference to a legislative attempt to dictate to the Judiciary the interpretation of a statute addressing the subject of judicial compensation.</p>

I also agree that Act 44’s mid-term “unvouchered expense” allocations violated Article II, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, in that they facially represented an unconstitutional mid-term salary increase for legislators. My primary point of difference with the majority concerns the decision to negate the application of Act 44’s non-severance provision in the circumstances as they have unfolded, thereby resuscitating judicial salary increases that are otherwise a component of void legislation.</p>

In this regard, I also agree that, although Act 44’s non-severance clause is entitled to a presumption of constitutionality in the first instance, it need not be regarded as an inexorable command.</p>

Certainly, I appreciate that the unvouchered allotment that was at issue in <em>Consumer Party </em>is distinguishable from Act 44’s formula-based, dollar-for-dollar image of a next-term salary increase. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 618-22, 905 A.2d at 966-67. Nevertheless, it is my considered perspective that the $5,000 unvouchered allocation at issue in <em>Consumer Party </em>(constituting approximately one-fifth of legislators’ then-prevailing salary rate, payable over and above ordinary expense allowances) represented too great a non-transparent conveyance to pass even the loose reasonable relation test that the Court applied in assessing its constitutional validity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> As the majority relates, the decision subsequently has been taken to its logical extreme in the enactment and defense of further mid-term, unvouchered allotments couched as expenses that were a dollar-for-dollar match for next-term salary increases. <em>See Stilp v.

Simply put, <em>Consumer Party’s </em>approach to midterm “unvouchered expenses” left open too substantial an opportunity for further erosion of the constitutional prohibition, which, unfortunately, has continued in the aftermath, most recently in Act 44. Compounding this, the present case involves a situation in which members of the judiciary are called upon to adjudicate a matter touching on their personal financial interests under the rule of necessity. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 556-59, 905 A.2d at 928-29. Against this landscape, it does not seem to me that the Court can sufficiently guard against all appearances of self-interest and/or involvement, while acting to negate an expression of legislative will (namely, Act 44’s non-severance clause) to maintain any part of the tainted Act 44 legislation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>
