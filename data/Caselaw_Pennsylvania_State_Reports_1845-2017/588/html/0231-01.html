By failing to confront these questions today, we simply delay the task and allow the lower courts to continue to follow, what I believe is, an incorrect application of this statutory claim. The current case presents an excellent vehicle to consider all aspects of these issues. The trial court developed a complete record with well-articulated findings as to the conduct of Appellant, Erie Insurance Exchange, on the initial processing of the insurance claim, and during the course of the litigation on the bad faith suit. The <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>trial court admitted that the conduct of Appellant during the litigation formed, in part, the basis of the award of punitive damages under § 8371.

During the course of the bad faith litigation, the trial court found Appellant behaved in a manner intended to obfuscate the litigation process. (Trial Court Findings of Fact, ¶¶ 154-57). The conduct of Appellant during discovery and throughout the course of the trial was found lacking in professionalism. In fact, the trial court found the testimony of Appellant’s principal witnesses to be so lacking in credibility as to constitute blatant attempts to undermine the truth determining process. (Trial Court Conclusions of Law, ¶ 80). After entering judgment in Appellee’s favor on the bad faith claim, the trial court specifically considered the actions of Appellant during the course of trial in setting the amount of the award of punitive damages.

The Superior Court rejected Appellant’s argument that the trial court erred in considering the conduct of the insurer during the course of the litigation of a bad faith claim as relevant to a finding of bad faith on the underlying insurance matter, and as a factor in the subsequent award of punitive damages. In reaching its conclusion the Superior Court discussed its previous decisions in <em>O’Donnell v. Allstate Ins.

During the course of the bad faith litigation, the insured objected to the tactics of the insurer throughout the discovery process, and requested that the jury be instructed to consider the conduct of the insurer in the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>course of the litigation as relevant to a finding of bad faith.

C.S.A. § 1921(c)(5). A review of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act reveals that it was intended to create administrative oversight of the insurance industry for the protection of the public as a whole, with provision for civil penalties to be imposed on insurance companies and agents for violating the act by the Insurance Commissioner. 40 P.S. §§ 1171.7, 1171.9 and 1171.11. Pertinent to the issue before us herein, the Unfair Insurance Practices Act displays a focus on the conduct of the insurer and the insured in the context of insurance policies. Absent a contract between the parties, there would not be a reason to implement the Unfair Insurance Practices Act. This point is of importance as the scope of the two pieces of legislation is in harmony on the question of the boundaries of the relationship between the insurer and insured wherein the insurer owes a duty to the insured. The boundary is clearly a policy of insurance, for without that feature there is no relationship between the insurer and the insured.</p>
    <p id="b453-5" data-blocks='[["BL_453.5",453,[137,1480,1152,361]]]'>Finally, the only remaining point of statutory construction relevant to this particular case is 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c)(6), “the consequences of a particular interpretation.” The interpretation currently endorsed by the Superior Court, and sub silentio by this Court, is one that expands the concept of duty flowing from insurer to insured past the point of their contractual relationship. This interpretation is fraught with disaster.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.6",453,[137,1864,1152,462]],["BL_454.1",454,[265,283,1162,514]]]'>Specifically, a bad faith lawsuit is established when the insured proves a breach of the duty of good faith in fair dealing that the insurer owes the insured when processing or settling a claim under a policy of insurance. The relationship between the parties is defined by the insurance policy. Once that policy has been terminated, the claim paid, or the claim denied the relationship is over. In its simplest terms, the duty to act in good faith has been dissolved once the insured and insurer become adversaries in a bad faith suit. To find <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>otherwise extends the duty of the insurer to an untenable limit. When a patient files a malpractice action against his physician, the doctor/patient relationship has been severed; when a client dismisses his attorney and files a malpractice action the attorney/client relationship is severed. Innumerable examples of this nature exist and do not need to be listed herein. When the relationship has been severed, there can no longer be a duty to act in good faith flowing from one to another; the actions of the parties must be measured by a different instrument.</p>
    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.4",454,[264,830,1163,362]]]'>In fact, the law currently provides other means for regulating the civility and professionalism of parties during the course of litigation. The rules of civil procedure, the disciplinary process, and the contempt powers of the courts, have always been sufficient instruments to harness the behavior of the litigants.

The conduct of the insurer during the course of the litigation on the bad faith claim itself is not relevant to the conduct in dealing with claims under a policy of insurance. In my opinion, once the insurer is asked to defend an action under the statute, there can no longer be a relationship with its insured subject to a duty to act in good faith; adequate means exist to control the behavior of the insurer, or any party, during the litigation. Because I would find that the Superior Court erred in affirming the finding of bad faith, insofar as that conclusion considered the conduct of the insurer during the course of the litigation itself, I would reject the decision of the Superior Court on that point.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> Furthermore, because the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>trial court considered the behavior of Appellant during trial within the factors used in awarding punitive damages that award must be vacated and the matter remanded for a new assessment of punitive damages.
