Further, as the majority recognizes, there is a potential for manipulation in connection with a pre-judgment assignment to the plaintiff of a defendant’s rights and interests under an excess liability insurance policy. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 303 n. 6, 903 A.2d at 1228 n. 6. Such potential represents a form of increased risk, affording the insurer a legitimate reason to guard against it by means of a contractual provision requiring its consent as a prerequisite to assignment, at least prior to the entry of a judgment or the effectuation of a comprehensive settlement of the underlying tort litigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> I believe that this dynamic distinguishes the <em>National Memorial Services </em>line of cases, in which no such legitimate reasons were found.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

The majority's explanation that the insurer has a full array of affirmative defenses in the event of manipulation does not negate the risk, in that manipulation is inherently a covert activity and, therefore, it may be difficult to prove. Further, even if proof is available, the insurer will incur additional expense (the subject of an increased risk) in establishing it.</p>

I also have difficulty with the majority’s decision to fault Gulf for its decision to deny coverage, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 302-03, 903 A.2d at 1228, since the Court declined to consider the validity of Gulf's reasons for that denial. Notably, in addition to the issue on which this appeal was allowed. Gulf also sought to raise the following question: "If the assignee has standing and the assignment is effective, whether the negligent medical services provided by the insured were covered under the insurance policy?” The Court, however, issued a limited grant order, which had the effect of denying review on that issue. <em>See Egger v. Gulf Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/583/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="583 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="687771" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0427-01">583 Pa. 427</a>, <a href="/pa/583/0428-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="879 A.2d 155" data-case-ids="687730,687771,8932495,8932620" data-case-paths="/pa/583/0428-01,/pa/583/0427-01,/a2d/879/0155-01,/a2d/879/0155-02">879 A.2d 155</a> (2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>Further, as noted by the majority, the trial court determined that Gulf's <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>denial of coverage was not made in bad faith. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 290-92, 903 A.2d at 1221.</p>
