Child lived with his mother (Mother) and Father from his birth in 1994 until his mother died in May 2002 after battling cancer for several years. Prior to Mother’s death, Child had frequent contact with Grandmother, especially during the last two years of his mother’s illness, when they saw each other on an almost daily basis. Grandmother often transported Child to and from school and cared for him when Mother attended doctors’ appointments or was too ill to provide care. Further, Grandmother took on the task of preparing Child for Mother’s death. The trial court found credible the testimony that Child <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>and Grandmother enjoyed spending time together, showed a great deal of affection toward one another, and shared a very close relationship.</p>

    <p id="b559-6" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[128,828,1155,421]]]'>Eventually exasperated with the situation, Grandmother filed for partial custody pursuant to Section 5311. The court granted her temporary partial custody in April 2003 following a non-record custody conference, after which Father filed for modification. After extensive pre-trial activities, the court held a two-day hearing in July 2003. At its conclusion, the trial court granted Grandmother partial custody one weekend per month and one week each summer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In compliance with the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em><a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">530 U.S. 57</a>, <a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">120 S.Ct. 2054</a>, <a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">147 L.Ed.2d 49</a> (2000), discussed in detail <em>infra, </em>the trial court applied the presumption that a fit parent acts in the child’s best interests. Further, the court noted that a grandparent seeking to compel partial custody carries the burden of proof.</p>
    <p id="b559-8" data-blocks='[["BL_559.7",559,[128,1742,1155,314]],["BL_560.1",560,[281,292,1158,86]]]'>With these premises established, the trial court examined the facts of the case. As specifically required by Section 5311, the court first considered the contact between Child and Grandmother prior to Grandmother’s petition. First, the court noted that Child’s parents had permitted significant contact with Grandmother prior to Mother’s death, and that a <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>strong and affectionate relationship had formed between Child and Grandmother.</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.4",560,[273,416,1164,1231]],["BL_561.1",561,[131,295,1152,142]]]'>Next, in accordance with <em>Troxel, </em>the court considered the likelihood and amount of contact that Father would provide to Grandmother absent a court order. As previously discussed, Grandmother had seen Child only three times between May 2002 and April 2003. Moreover, according to the trial court, Father’s position on acceptable partial custody or visitation changed dramatically- during the course of the proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> After one custody conference, Father agreed to limited periods of partial custody without overnight stays. One month later he changed his mind and asserted that Grandmother should not be provided any court-ordered visitation. Father changed his position yet again at trial, where he stated that he would permit partial custody one day per month without overnight stays. Parenthetically, the court also found Father’s various accusations regarding his concern’s for Child’s safety in Grandmother’s care lacking in credibility and devoid of evidentiary support: “Given the fact that none of these concerns have any merit, the court must conclude that either [Father] is grasping at straws and inventing reasons to keep [Child] away from his grandmother, or he actually believes the allegations, which shows he is under serious delusions concerning [Grandmother] and his judgment regarding her is polluted.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 5. Accordingly, with ample <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>factual support, the trial court concluded that, absent a court order, Father would not provide Grandmother the opportunity to see Child.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.6",561,[128,487,1156,1339]]]'>The court then turned to the statute’s requirement that the court find that visitation or partial custody with Grandmother would be in the child’s best interests, even when applying the presumption that a parent’s decision limiting contact is in the child’s best interests. The court found that Father’s proposed arrangement of one day per month “is not enough time to maintain the bond [Child] has established with his grandmother and her side of the family, especially given his extensive contact in the past.” Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 6. Specifically, the court noted that Grandmother is warm and loving and has developed a “longstanding, very close relationship” with Child, and that Child enjoyed spending time with her, engaging in many activities with her, and visiting with his many maternal relatives during the family gatherings that occur during the court-ordered periods of partial custody. Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 6. Significantly, the court observed that “when [Child] is with [Grandmother], he seeks and receives emotional support regarding the death of his mother.” Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 6. This finding is particularly resonant because “[Father] himself expressed concerns regarding [Child’s] ability to express his emotions regarding his mother’s death.” Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 6. Thus, the court concluded, “contact with his mother’s side of the family is highly beneficial emotionally for [Child] in helping him deal with the loss of his mother.” Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 6.</p>
    <p id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.3",562,[270,286,1163,307]]]'>
      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>As dictated by the statute, the trial court next considered whether the court-ordered partial custody would interfere with Father’s relationship with Child. Father argued that it would interfere because of the animosity between Grandmother and .him, which, he noted, had led to the legal proceedings. The trial court, however, aptly commented:</p>
    <blockquote id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[310,609,1121,307]]]'>If the mere existence of animosity and dislike between parent and grandparent were enough to prevent grandparent custody, surely there would be very few court ordered periods of grandparent custody. For after all, if the parties were able to get along together, they would not be in court to begin with.</blockquote>
    <p id="b562-6" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[266,937,1164,622]]]'>Tr. Ct. Slip Op. at 7. Instead, the court distinguished this case from those where grandparent partial custody would have either distressed the child or adversely impacted the parent’s ability to parent him. Moreover, the court found credible Grandmother’s assertion that she would not express negative feelings about Father to Child, or create a situation that would negatively impact Child. The court also expressed confidence that Father would not let his animosity toward Grandmother cause harm to Child, as the court found it clear that Father was a capable father who loved his son. Additionally, the court noted that there had been no incidents of problems in the visits thus far.</p>
    <p id="b562-7" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[264,1589,1163,418]]]'>The court therefore found that Grandmother had met her burden of demonstrating that partial custody would be in Child’s best interests and would not interfere with the parent-child relationship, and thereby, had rebutted the presumption that Father’s decision limiting or eliminating Grandmother’s contact with Child was in Child’s best interests. Tr. Ct. Slip. Op. at 8. The court thus granted partial custody to Grandmother one weekend per month and one week per summer.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

      <em> </em>Moreover, the court held that the trial court complied with Pennsylvania precedent by placing the burden of proof on the petitioning grandparent due to the deference given to the decisions of fit parents.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Finally, the Superior Court concluded that the trial <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>court properly applied the statute with the necessary presumption that Father’s decisions were in the best interests of the Child and that the record supported the trial court’s conclusions that Grandmother overcame the presumption by demonstrating that partial custody was in Child’s best interests and that it would not interfere with Father’s relationship ■with Child. The Superior Court therefore affirmed the trial court’s decision, finding the application of Section 5311 constitutional.</p>

Unlike Mr. Chief Justice Cappy, we decline to demand a specific finding of harm by the trial court prior to a grant of partial custody in the case at bar. Moreover, we observe that consideration of harm resulting from the denial of grandparent visitation or partial custody is to some extent implicit in the statute because the statute is triggered only when a child has suffered the loss of a parent, and visitation or partial custody is allowable only when the court concludes that the grandparent relationship is in the best interests of the grieving child. It is beyond cavil that the child's loss of an additional beneficial relationship will result in some degree of harm. Nevertheless, we recognize that a demonstration of significant harm could certainly strengthen a grandparent's argument that visitation or partial custody is in the best interests of the child and acknowledge that the justification supporting a grant of visitation or partial custody should be correspondingly more convincing as the extent of the custody granted increases, because greater periods of custody present greater infringement on a parent’s constitutional right to the direct the care, custody, and control of the child.</p>

Security, continuity, and stability in an ongoing custodial relationship, whether maintained with a biologic or adoptive parent and/or with a grandparent is vital to the successful personality development of a child. The law finally needs to recognize that the child, as the focus in various types of proceedings, has the same inalienable rights to the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness as an adult. Therefore, I write to emphasize that it is time to regard the best interests of the child as a fundamental and momentous right. Further, I am convinced that this Court needs to provide some guidance toward ascertaining a child’s fundamental best interests.</p>

Children are vulnerable, impressionable, and in need of guidance and support. This is particularly true when a child experiences the loss of a parent. That support may spring from the child’s relationship with a parent, a grandparent, a teacher, or a stranger, but will nearly always be provided by a parent or a grandparent. Situations like the instant matter in which a grandparent cares for a child during the parent’s illness and is instrumental in preparing the child for the death of his or her parent are all too common. It is the emotional health of a child concomitant with the emotional bonds formed during childhood that determine whether the child ultimately becomes a productive member of the community.</p>

This Court propounded the <em>parens patriae </em>doctrine as the rationale by which the Commonwealth could accomplish child behavioral “reformation, by training [children] to industry; by imbuing their minds with principles of morality and religion; by furnishing them with means to earn a living; and, above all, by separating them from the corrupting influence of improper associates.” <em>Crouse, </em><a href="/whart/4/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="268" data-cite="4 Whart. 9" data-case-ids="1835019" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0009-01">4 Whart. 9</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=1839%20WL%203700" class="citation" data-index="269" data-cite="1839 WL 3700">1839 WL 3700</a> at *2.

The Pennsylvania grandparent custody and visitation statute does not suffer from these infirmities. The General Assembly has narrowly tailored Section 5311<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> to limit grandparent standing to only those grandparents who have experienced the death of their own child and seek to maintain contact with the children of that deceased child.

First, under the Due Process Clause, parents do enjoy the constitutionally protected fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 358-59, 904 A.2d at 885. Second, because the trial court infringed upon Appellant Sháne Fausey’s (“Father”) fundamental right to make decisions concerning the custody of his son Kaelen, the trial count’s actions taken pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 5311 must survive strict scrutiny. <em>Cf id. </em>at 358-59, 904 A.2d at 885. Third and lastly, in order for the trial court’s actions taken pursuant to Section 5311 to survive strict scrutiny, its actions must promote a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest. <em>See id. </em>Unlike the Majority, these principles lead me to conclude that the trial court unconstitutionally applied Section 5311 in this matter.</p>

Rather, the court found Father to be a fit parent but nevertheless concluded that Ms. Hiller presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that Father’s decisions regarding Kaelen’s contact with Ms. Hiller are in Kaelen’s best interest and, based on this finding, granted Ms. Hiller partial custody.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> By acting in this manner, the court supplanted Father’s constitutionally protected decision to limit or preclude contact between Kaelen and Ms. Hiller. In place of Father’s constitutionally protected decisions, the court injected its and Ms. Hiller’s ideas of Kaelen’s best interests. The state simply has no compelling interest to interfere with a fit parent’s fundamental right to make decisions regarding a child’s contact with a grandparent simply because the grandparent or anyone else, including a state court, thinks that a different decision is better or more desirable for the child.

I would place the burden of proving such harm on the grandparent. Given the fundamental nature of the constitutional right involved in these types of cases and the presumption that a fit parent acts in the best interest of his or her child, <em>see Troxel, </em><a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="332" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">530 U.S. at 68</a>, <a href="/us/530/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="333" data-cite="530 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="9413198" data-case-paths="/us/530/0057-01">120 S.Ct. 2054</a>, I would require a grandparent to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that absent an order granting the grandparent custody and/or visitation, the child is being or will be harmed. <em>See Santosky v.

If a grandparent is able to meet this standard of proof, then the trial court must craft an order that is narrowly tailored to protect the welfare of the child. Only then is a court’s infringement upon a fit parent’s right to make decisions regarding his or her child’s contact with a grandparent constitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

Because I believe that no compelling state interest is implicated in this matter, I need not express my thoughts as to whether the trial court order is narrowly tailored. I, however, respectfully note my disagreement with the Majority’s scrutiny under the narrowly tailored prong of its analysis. Most importantly, this is an "as applied” constitutional challenge and not a “facial” constitutional challenge. Therefore, the proper focus of our scrutiny should be on whether the Commonwealth's action taken pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 5311 — i.e., the trial court order— is narrowly tailored to promote the state's compelling interest. Our focus should not be on whether Section 5311 is, itself, narrowly tailored. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion at 360-61, 904 A.2d at <em>887.</em>
