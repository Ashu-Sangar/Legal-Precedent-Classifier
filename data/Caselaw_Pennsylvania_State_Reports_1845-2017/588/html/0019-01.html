    <p id="b244-5" data-blocks='[["BL_244.4",244,[262,897,1162,951]]]'>The evidence presented at trial revealed the following. Appellant and Robin Little met and began dating, while the two were students at Schenley High School in Pittsburgh. Entries from Robin’s diary, which were admitted at trial over Appellant’s objections, chronicled their volatile relationship and Appellant’s violent behavior toward her. Appellant and Robin often argued and, in September 1996, Appellant threatened to kill her, if she ever left him. The couple’s son Malik was born in January 1997, and the two were married in April 1997, when Robin was eighteen and Appellant was nineteen. Notwithstanding the marriage, Robin continued to live apart from Appellant with her mother, Debra King, on Hamilton Avenue in the Homewood section of Pittsburgh, until Appellant came to stay with them in the late spring of 1997. Mrs. King testified that she often heard Robin arguing with Appellant on the phone about his drinking, smoking, and failure to get a job, as well as the lack of time he spent with the baby and her.</p>

Robin told her that Appellant and she had gotten into a fight and that he had punched the wall. Fearing further violence, Robin ended the <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>relationship in July 1997, telling Appellant to leave. That same month, Robin took Malik and moved to her brother’s home in Lancaster. During that time, Robin told her sister-in-law, Timberlin King, that she feared Appellant, and believed that one day he would kill her. Because she was homesick, however, Robin returned to Pittsburgh in August 1997, and moved back into her mother’s Hamilton Avenue home.</p>
    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[146,720,1154,993]]]'>On September 1, 1997, Appellant was working at the People’s Natural Gas Company (People’s) near Robin’s home when he telephoned her. During their conversation, Robin asked to use Appellant’s bus pass. He told her that she could use it, but had to come to People’s to get it. After her arrival at People’s, the two began discussing a man named Brian, whom Robin was seeing. Robin told Appellant that she and Brian had engaged in sexual relations. Appellant became angry and dragged Robin into a supervisor’s office and raped her. As Robin screamed and begged him to stop, he threatened that if she continued screaming or told anyone about the rape, he would “snap her neck.” N.T. Trial at 373. Appellant finally let Robin go and returned to work. Later that evening, Mrs. King drove Robin to the Pittsburgh Zone <em>5 </em>Police Station where she reported the attack. Mrs. King then took Robin to Magee Women’s Hospital for an examination. Hospital personnel prepared a rape kit, and when Robin returned home, her mother took pictures of the bruises on her arms and thighs.</p>

Appellant was charged with rape, terroristic threats, unlawful restraint, and simple assault for the September 1 attack on his estranged wife.

Appellant first met Ms. Britton through school, and remained in contact with her even after Appellant transferred out of Schenley and Ms. Britton was no longer employed by the Pittsburgh School Board. After graduation, Appellant had several conversations with Ms. Britton, and she was aware of the couple’s problems. In fact, Appellant called Ms. Britton from jail after he was arrested for raping Robin on September 1,1997. Robin also called Ms. Britton prior to the preliminary hearing to ask for advice on whether she should drop the charges. Robin told Ms. Britton that she was afraid Appellant would retaliate if she pursued a PFA order against him. At the trial of this case, the court allowed Ms. Britton’s testimony concerning her conversations with both Robin and Appellant over the defense’s objection that they were privileged communications.</p>

      <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>Robin and her mother were present at the preliminary hearing and thus aware of this arrangement. Robin agreed believing that Appellant’s hospitalization would protect her from him. At trial, the defense claimed that Appellant reported to St. Francis as required, but was immediately released; whereas the Commonwealth claimed that he never reported to the hospital. Regardless, Appellant was never admitted to the hospital for treatment on September 9, 1997 as required by the agreement. Instead, he went home and began calling Robin.</p>
    <p id="b247-5" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[132,829,1154,525]]]'>During the afternoon of September 9, 1997, Robin reported to her mother that Appellant was out of jail, that he was never admitted to the hospital for alcohol treatment, and that he had called her several times. Appellant continued to call until he convinced Robin to allow him to come to her home. After his arrival at 4:15 p.m., the conversation quickly turned to Brian, the man Robin was seeing. Appellant became angry when Robin indicated that Brian was better than Appellant. The couple argued until Appellant left the home shortly after 6:00 p.m.</p>
    <p id="b247-6" data-blocks='[["BL_247.5",247,[130,1377,1157,406]]]'>Appellant later confessed to Detective Dennis Logan that he went out that evening with friends and had “a couple of drinks.” N.T. Trial at 377. At some point during the evening, he called Robin and continued to argue with her over the phone. When he returned home at 1:00 a.m. on September 10, 1997, Appellant called Robin, apologized, and convinced her to let him come to her home again, so that they could talk about their son.</p>

He said Robin had “disrespected” him and he repeated his threat several more times even though Ms. Britton told him that going after Robin would not resolve anything. N.T. Trial at 326. Appellant replied that he was going to dress in black, go to Robin’s home, and “do what he had to do.” N.T. Trial at 326-27. Ms. Britton told Appellant just to go to bed. When he abruptly ended the conversation and hung up, she tried to call back, but Appellant’s mother <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>answered. When Ms. Britton explained why she was calling Appellant, his mother dismissed her concerns and told her that she did not have time to worry about it, so Ms. Britton gave up. Ms. Britton could not call Robin because she did not have her number. At trial, Ms. Britton testified that during her conversation with Appellant, he did not slur any of his words and he spoke in coherent sentences.</p>

When he arrived at 1:30 a.m., Robin was sitting on the porch with a man who quickly left after Appellant said, “Who the f — k is this?” N.T. Trial at 380. Appellant argued again with Robin about her seeing anyone else. He punched Robin in the face and stomach, causing her to fall against the door. When she tried to run, Appellant grabbed her and said he would stop hitting her if she walked with him. When she resisted, Appellant dragged her toward an empty lot near her home and continued to punch her as she tried to break free. At that point, Robin screamed for help, yelling, “He’s going to kill me.” N.T. Trial at 383. Appellant put a hand over Robin’s mouth and continued to drag her.</p>

At first, he walked past the house, but then stopped and punched Robin several more times, temporarily disabling her while he returned to the porch to get the knife. When Robin attempted to pull herself up off the ground, Appellant pushed her down and stabbed her in the stomach. Then, Appellant removed Robin’s clothes, wrapped his hands around her neck, and raped her, first vaginally and then anally. When Robin vomited blood, Appellant wiped her mouth with a rag and continued raping her. When he finished, he turned her over and stabbed her multiple times in the neck.</p>

Appellant admitted, however, that when he got up later that morning, he took the clothes he had been wearing, including a black Steelers’ football shirt, black pants, a black tank top and black boots, put them in a garbage bag, and threw them into an abandoned house. Appellant then went to court for his final PFA hearing.</p>

After searching outside and becoming even more upset, she contacted police and explained the situation between Robin and Appellant. At approximately 10:00 a.m., an officer arrived at her home to take a report. Mrs. King was still talking to police, at 10:15 a.m., when the fire station located a block down the street from Mrs. King’s home received a call that a woman’s body was discovered in a nearby backyard. Several firefighters walked to the lot and saw the victim’s naked body lying face-up in the weeds. When Mrs. King saw the police car and an ambulance arrive, she ran to the vacant lot to find her daughter’s body. Police later discovered Robin’s clothes in a <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>sewer a few blocks away.

The police went to St. Francis’ emergency room, where they were .informed that Appellant was being evaluated and that they could .wait for him. When Appellant was released fifteen or twenty minutes later, the detectives approached him in the waiting area and asked him if he would accompany them to their office. Appellant agreed. He drove with detectives to the homicide offices where he made a full statement to Detective Logan admitting that he raped Robin Little on September 1, 1997, and that he raped her again and murdered her on September 10, 1997. Detective Logan noted that Appellant appeared in full control of his faculties and provided a remarkably detailed account of his turbulent relationship with Robin, as well as a full explanation of how and why he raped her twice and then murdered her.</p>

Finally, at CC No. 9711609, Appellant was charged with one count of criminal homicide for the September 10 strangulation and stabbing death of Robin Little. The Commonwealth then filed and served a timely notice of its intention to seek imposition of the death penalty.</p>

The Commonwealth also presented testimony from the doctor who examined Robin after the first rape, the nurse who prepared the rape kit, the police officer who took the initial report after the first rape, the police officer who took Appellant’s first confession to the September 1 rape, and court personnel who explained that the PFA order was in effect when Robin was attacked and murdered. Additionally, the Commonwealth offered testimony from a firefighter who initially found Robin’s body, police wTho investigated the murder scene, and Detective Logan, who took Appellant’s confession to both rapes and the murder. Finally, the Commonwealth presented testimony from Dr. Leon Rozin, the Chief Forensic Pathologist from the Allegheny County Coroner’s Office, who concluded that the cause of death was multiple stab wounds to the neck, as well as compression of the neck, more commonly referred to as strangulation, and the manner of death was criminal homicide.

He further determined that Robin had multiple contusions on her face and a pattern injury on her left shoulder. Dr. Rozin concluded that the cause of death was compression of the neck, more commonly referred to as strangulation, as well as multiple stab wounds to the neck and a deep stab wound to the abdomen.

Dr. Bernstein also testified that alcoholism ran in Appellant’s family, and that these two risk factors might have affected Appellant’s mental state. Premised on this information, Dr. Bernstein told the jury that a fetus exposed to alcohol in the womb has a higher prevalence of neurological and psychiatric abnormalities, such as poor attention span, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, attention deficit disorder, and depression, and may suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[145,1370,1154,841]]]'>On cross-examination, however, Dr. Bernstein conceded that Appellant did not suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome. He further acknowledged that the hospital records from Appellant’s two admissions in 1992 did not support the claim that Mrs. Mitchell drank while pregnant with Appellant. According to the family history Mrs. Mitchell provided during Appellant’s admission to St. Francis Hospital in April 1992, she said that she had been a heavy drinker only since 1987, when Appellant was already ten years of age. Dr. Bernstein further acknowledged that according to the April 1992 records, Appellant resulted from a “planned pregnancy with no complications” and “attained all developmental milestones without difficulty.” N.T. Trial at 562. Consequently, the Commonwealth cast considerable doubt on Dr. Bernstein’s conclusion that Appellant was born with a predisposition to neurological and psychiatric abnormalities due to his mother’s drinking.</p>

According to Dr. Bernstein, Appellant reportedly <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>began drinking at age eleven. Dr.. Bernstein testified that regular drinking at that age causes changes in the brain that increase the risk for psychiatric and behavioral problems, which increase both the likelihood of a person being more violent and participating in unplanned aggressive acts and the risk of becoming clinically depressed or psychotic, <em>i.e., </em>hearing voices or hallucinating. Dr. Bernstein testified that his review of Appellants records led him to conclude that the reason for Appellant’s first hospital admission in 1992 was his drinking and having homicidal thoughts, and that the second hospitalization in 1992 was related to drinking' and his “aggressive acting out.” N.T.

Instead, intake notes indicated that Appellant had been caught at school with weapons and had threatened to kill a person he had accused of raping his girlfriend. Appellant was.given the option of going to Allegheny County’s Shuman Detention Center for delinquent juveniles or St. Francis Hospital for a medical evaluation and in-patient treatment. Appellant opted for the latter. During his hospital stay, Appellant stated that he wanted to kill the man he asserted had raped his girlfriend, but changed his mind and realized “that would be first-degree murder because I had a plan and a motive.” N.T. Trial at 571. In the second incident, Appellant was accused of threatening an assistant principal with a knife. According to his intake records, Appellant was given the alternative of going to the hospital and he agreed.

Trial at 575. As noted above, Dr. Bernstein diagnosed Appellant with <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>a condition called alcoholic hallucinosis, wherein chronic use of alcohol induces auditory hallucinations. However, he conceded that the records indicated that Appellant provided inconsistent responses to different doctors concerning whether he had ever experienced a blackout.

According to this record, Appellant never told the nurse that he had blacked out and he denied having any psychiatric problems. His mental status was listed as “[a]lert, impulse control good, cooperative,” and his diagnosis was “adjustment order with depressed mood” and “rule out antisocial personality disorder.” In fact, according to hospital records, Appellant was discharged from St. Francis shortly after being evaluated.

Dr. Bernstein also said that while he reviewed the confession, he did not review any of the details in it with Appellant. Additionally, Dr. Bernstein said that defense counsel had not informed him that a half-hour before the murder, Appellant had called Ms. Britton and specifically told her that he was going to kill Robin, nor had he been provided with any letters Appellant had written to Ms. Britton from jail following the murder, in which he referred to Robin as “a whore” who had “gotten what she deserved.” N.T.

Afterwards, in an attempt to cover-up the murder, he immediately discarded Robin’s clothes and the murder weapon in a sewer. He went home and called Ms. Britton at 4 a.m. to say that “Robin Little was no more” and that he needed to establish an alibi. N.T. Trial at 330. By 9 a.m., Appellant discarded his clothes in a vacant house and went on to attend a previously scheduled PFA hearing, presumably to alleviate any suspicion that he knew Robin was dead. He later admitted to Detective Logan that he feigned surprise when told that Robin’s body was discovered, that alcohol had nothing to do with the murder, and he killed Robin because she disparaged him and had found someone else.

They were then instructed not to give it undue weight and to consider it along with all other evidence presented at trial by both the prosecution and the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 753.

In support of the Commonwealth’s argument for the aggravating factor found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5) (victim witnessed a felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing her future testimony), Detective Logan was called to testify regarding Appellant’s confession, wherein Appellant specifically admitted to threatening Robin that if she told anyone about the September 1 rape, he would “snap her neck.” Appellant does not question the relevancy of this testimony to the aggravating factor that the Commonwealth sought to prove.

If the Court were writing on a clean slate, the dissenting opinion's perspective as to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 (e)(l)'s meaning would be worthy of consideration.

Wharton, </em><a href="/pa/542/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="542 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="459078" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0083-01">542 Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/pa/542/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="145" data-cite="665 A.2d 458" data-case-ids="459078,7865662" data-case-paths="/pa/542/0083-01,/a2d/665/0458-01">665 A.2d 458</a>, 461 (1995), which is on all-fours as to the meaning of Section 9711(e)(1), would also be over-ridden.

Since we decided <em>Haag </em>on July 10, 1989, the General Assembly has amended 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 on five occasions, including October 11, 1995, November 17, 1995, April 25, 1997, June 25, 1997, and October 12, 1999. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711.

The Court in <em>Laich </em>ruled that the victim’s state of mind inexplicably lost its relevance once the defendant admitted his intention to kill, leaving it to the jury to decide what degree of murderous intention the defendant held. <em>Id. </em>at 1062. In contrast, the present victim’s state of mind, as reflected in her prior relationship with appellant, certainly remained relevant because appellant disputed whether he in fact had the specific intent to kill.</p>

The indisputable point, as I see it, is that there is no absolute jurisprudential bar against what I propose; indeed, there is ample precedent in favor of it. Moreover, as I have noted in another context, since the affected party is unlikely to be so bold as to squarely ask for reconsideration of apparently-controlling precedent, it oftentimes falls upon this Court, or individual Justices, to notice the issue. <em>See Commonwealth v. Rogers, </em><a href="/pa/578/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="235" data-cite="578 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1329441" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0127-01">578 Pa. 127</a>, <a href="/pa/578/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="236" data-cite="849 A.2d 1185" data-case-ids="1329441,9244120" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0127-01,/a2d/849/1185-01">849 A.2d 1185</a>, 1193 n. 2 (2004) (Castille, J, joined by Eakin and Baer, JJ,, concurring) (suggesting need to reconsider review paradigm in cases involving canine searches). <em>Accord Commonwealth v.

The need for corrective action in cases such as <em>Albrecht, Grant, Freeman, </em>and <em>Collins </em>became apparent precisely because of this Court’s problematic experience with settled doctrine. Ultimately, of course, it is a matter of collective judgment in an individual case whether the issue so recognized is important enough, or meritorious enough, that a Court majority proves willing to engage in the reconsideration or action posed. Thus, I accept that a majority of the Court is. not obliged to deem my point worthy of consideration. But that does not make the point any less legitimate a basis for dissent. I respectfully continue to believe that this aspect of the <em>Wharton/Haag </em>rule should be reconsidered, and I believe that the stakes involved in a capital case, and the unlikelihood <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>that any entity but this Court will act to correct a mistake of our own making, warrant acknowledging and addressing a precedent that would permit imposition of an arbitrary sentence of death.</p>

The federal circuits have generally applied the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception in cases where a defendant, either through murder or through some form of coercion, has precluded a witness from testifying against him on some criminal matter distinct from the illegal act that the defendant committed to silence the witness.
