Wholaver, Jr., was charged with multiple sexual offenses for alleged conduct involving his two daughters, Victoria and Elizabeth, the latter of whom was still a minor at the time the charges were lodged. On behalf of Elizabeth, Appellant’s wife, Jean Wholaver, obtained an order under the Protection From Abuse Act, <em>see </em>23 Pa.C.S. §§ 6101-6122, which included provisos that Appellant was evicted from the family’s Middletown residence, with no right or privilege of entry, and was prohibited from possessing or acquiring firearms. Appellant subsequently took up residence with his mother, father, and younger brother, Scott Wholaver, in Cambria County.</p>

While his brother waited in the vehicle about a block away, Appellant approached the house; cut telephone and other wires leading to it; forcibly gained entry; and shot Jean, Victoria, and <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>Elizabeth to death with a pistol, leaving Victoria’s nine-month-old girl, Madison, alive but alone and unattended. Appellant and his brother then drove to Clearfield County, where Appellant discarded the pistol, a shotgun,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and other potentially incriminating items at a remote location.</p>
    <p id="b436-5" data-blocks='[["BL_436.4",436,[271,566,1160,467]]]'>Following the discovery of the bodies and Madison (who survived) approximately twenty-eight hours after the killings, police obtained search warrants for the Middletown residence to gather evidence. They later executed warrants to search Appellant’s person, his vehicle, and the Cambria County home where he was living. Appellant was arrested and charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with three counts of first-degree murder, and the Commonwealth furnished notice that it intended to pursue imposition of the death penalty.</p>

The common pleas court refused to suppress the evidence obtained from the Middletown residence, <em>inter alia, </em>based on Appellant’s lack of any reasonable expectation of privacy in a place from which he was barred under an extant protection-from-abuse order.

He then described the brothers’ nocturnal trip to the Middletown residence on December 24th, indicating that Appellant had claimed that he wished only to retrieve his dog. The trip involved furtive activities and was corroborated by a surveillance video obtained by police from a convenience store located mid-way between Cambria County and Middletown. Scott Wholaver testified that, upon arrival in Middletown, he was told to stop the vehicle to permit Appellant to access the rear seat; Appellant then directed him to proceed to a location about a block from the Wholaver residence; he parked the vehicle there and waited as Appellant proceeded toward the residence; Appellant returned five to ten minutes later appearing shaken; Appellant instructed him to drive to the remote Clearfield County location where he saw the shotgun in the rear of the vehicle and watched Appellant shuttle from the vehicle to the woods; and Appellant told him to repeat a false story if asked about his whereabouts during the time period spanning these activities. The Commonwealth also offered testimony from several prisoner-witnesses, who described various incriminatory statements by Appellant, as well as evidence of Appellant’s jail-based efforts to hire a West Virginia man to kill the father of Victoria’s child, Francisco Ramos, and to fabricate evidence suggesting that Mr. Ramos had killed Jean, Victoria, and Elizabeth Wholaver.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ballistics evidence was presented to connect the pistol found in Clear-field County to the killings (although the association could not be made firmly, because both the firearm and bullets were degraded). Further, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the pistol was registered to Appellant’s uncle.

      <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>In the present case, the evidence offered at trial by the Commonwealth is plainly sufficient to support the first-degree murder convictions and death sentences. The prosecution presented expert testimony from a forensic pathologist concerning his examination of the victims’ bodies and his opinion that the manner of the deaths was homicide. Although no eyewitnesses to the actual killings were available, evidence was adduced concerning both intent and opportunity through Scott Wholaver, who testified that Appellant indicated that he would kill his wife and described Appellant’s activities connected with his unlawful entry into the Middletown residence contemporaneous with the time of the victims’ deaths as determined by the pathologist. As noted, the fact of the brothers’ trip from Cambria County to the Middletown residence on December 24th was corroborated by a surveillance videotape and was ultimately acknowledged by the defense in closing argumentation at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Further, evidence was admitted concerning a number of acts evidencing consciousness of guilt on Appellant’s part, including his concealment of firearms and other items in Clearfield County after the killings, and his documented and undisputed efforts to solicit the murder of Francisco Ramos and to fabricate evidence suggesting that Mr. Ramos had killed Jean, Victoria, and Elizabeth Wholaver. The manner in which the victims were killed, each having been shot in the head from close range, also serves as circumstantial evidence of malice and specific intent to kill on Appellant’s part. <em>See Collins, </em><a href="/pa/550/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="550 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="281282" data-case-paths="/pa/550/0046-01">550 Pa. at 51</a>, <a href="/a2d/703/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="703 A.2d 418" data-case-ids="11881059,281282" data-case-paths="/a2d/703/0418-01,/pa/550/0046-01">703 A.2d at 420</a> (“Specific intent to kill may be proven by circumstantial evidence, such as the accused using a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body.”).</p>

In this regard, burglary is established, <em>inter alia, </em>by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant entered an occupied structure, without license or privilege, with intent to commit a crime therein. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 3502. As described above, the evidence was that Appellant entered the Middletown residence with the intention to kill his family; further, the absence of license or privilege of entry on his part was evidenced by the admission of the protection-from-abuse order barring him from the house. <em>See </em>N.T., August 23, 2004, at 52-54, Ex. C-32. As noted, this evidence, although initially admitted in the guilt phase of trial, was incorporated into the penalty phase. To prove that Appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person for purposes of the aggravating circumstance at Section 9711(d)(7), the Commonwealth presented evidence that Victoria’s nine-month-old baby, Madison, was found unattended near her mother’s body approximately twenty-eight hours after she and her mother and sister were killed. A medical doctor also testified that, in the absence of a caregiver for nearly thirty hours, Madison was significantly at risk of death due to an untreated infection; dehydration; and the possibilities of ingestion of toxic household substances, falling down stairs, or drowning in the toilet. <em>See </em>N.T., August 23, 2004, at 99-101. Further, the Commonwealth also argued that the child’s location near her mother’s body when she was found by police served as circumstantial evidence her mother was shot as she held Madison in her arms. The Commonwealth advanced the aggravating circumstances entailing multiple murders, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll), and Appellant’s status as the subject of a protection-from-abuse order relative to the killing of Elizabeth, <em>see </em>'42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(18), through the evidence already summarized above.</p>

In this regard, if Appellant’s waiver occurred by virtue of a knowing and intelligent decision on his part, it is unlikely that a federal court would attribute its consequences to a withholding by the state of an adequate opportunity to litigate claims. Conversely, if the waiver was without Appellant’s approval and on account of a dereliction of counsel, Appellant should be entitled to a reinstatement of his right to direct appeal in the post-conviction review process. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In its brief, the Commonwealth suggested that the remedy of reinstatement of direct appellate rights under <em>Halley </em>should not apply in a death case, because the Court will automatically review the sufficiency of the evidence and guard against the impact of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h).
