Corporal Stevens asked Larry Jr. if there was anyone in the house, and Larry responded that his parents and sister were inside. Corporal Stevens attempted to enter the home but was unable to do so due to the fire. An ambulance arrived, and one of the attendants began tending to Larry Jr., who told the attendant that “Marky” had assaulted him.

There was no evidence that Larry Sr. was alive at the time of the fire. Dr. Wecht found that Joanna’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck with damage to the critical nerves and blood vessels supplying the heart and the lungs. Joanna’s examination revealed no evidence that she was alive at the time of the fire. Dr. Wecht testified that Krystal’s cause of death was a transection of her spinal column, which resulted from a gunshot wound with its point of entry in her cheek. Krystal had also expired by the time the fire was set. Krystal’s autopsy also revealed a twenty-eight-week-old viable male fetus in útero, which died because of a lack of oxygen after the death of his mother.

After the robbery, Bobish began paging appellant and, when appellant called the residence, he was told that the Bobish family was planning to call the police if appellant did not pay for the drugs.

Following the robbery and throughout the next day, Larry Sr. paged appellant, seeking to be paid for his illicit goods and threatening to call the police. Appellant told a friend he was planning to go to the Bobish home, ostensibly to pay for the stolen drugs, but with the actual intention of killing Larry Sr. In the early morning hours of Sunday, April 14, 2002, appellant did just that: he went to the Bobish residence, armed with a gun, and then shot and killed Larry Sr. Appellant then proceeded to shoot the remaining members of the Bobish family, killing Joanna Bobish and her pregnant daughter Krystal, and seriously wounding Larry Jr., whom he also stabbed. Finally, after leaving all of his victims for dead, appellant set the home on fire and fled. Larry Jr. told a state trooper and a paramedic at the scene that “Marky” committed the murders and he later identified appellant, whom he knew, as the perpetrator.</p>

There is no question that the victims were unlawfully killed and that appellant committed the murders. The fact that the victims were assaulted with deadly weapons on vital parts of their bodies, combined with the evidence that appellant told his friend, Brooke Porter, that he planned to kill Larry Sr. and was overheard by Recardo Williams to say that he intended to kill an entire family by shooting until he ran out of bullets and then stabbing them, was sufficient to permit the jury to find that appellant harbored the specific intent to kill the entire Bobish family.

Without attempting to account for the applicability of <em>Batson’s </em>three-part test, the reasons the prosecutor stated on the record for challenging the prospective juror, and the trial court’s ruling or its discussion of the issue in its opinion, appellant then simply declares <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>that the prosecutor’s reasons were “flimsy.” Brief of Appellant at 15-16.

    <p id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[260,507,1167,1698]]]'>The Commonwealth responds by noting, first, that, the record does not demonstrate that the juror was African-American; instead, the juror simply checked the category “other” on his jury questionnaire. The Commonwealth reviews the juror’s testimony, noting that he. expressed concern that he would be finishing his Master’s degree program on Friday of the week scheduled for trial; that his last class was that Wednesday and he did not know what would happen if he missed it; that he worked as a counselor for troubled youth; that it would be nerve-racking to serve as a juror while wondering of the effect his service would have upon finishing his degree and participating in graduation; and that these concerns might affect his ability to give the case the attention it deserved. The Commonwealth relates that, in light of the juror’s concerns, the prosecutor challenged him for cause, noting that she wanted jurors who would be able to listen attentively. Although the trial court denied that challenge, the Commonwealth notes that, after the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge, the trial judge in fact excused Juror 293 from further service on other cases given his concern over his impending situation. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that, when asked to state for the record the reason for her peremptory challenge, the prosecutor cited the pressure of school, the juror’s probable inattention, and the fact that the juror worked as a youth counselor with persons close in age to appellant. In light of these facts, the Commonwealth argues, the trial court did not err in rejecting appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim. The Commonwealth, like appellant, never attempts to square its argument with the tripartite <em>Batson </em>test; thus, for example, it neither concedes nor disputes whether appellant proved a <em>prima facie </em>case under <em>Batson </em>with respect to this single peremptory challenge.</p>

In explaining its ruling, the court did not state whether it found (and if so, why) that appellant had met his burden of proving a <em>prima fame </em>case, thus warranting a further direction that the prosecutor state the reasons for her strike on the record. Moreover, during voir dire, neither the court nor the parties discussed whether appellant had established a <em>prima fame </em>case. Instead, at a sidebar conference immediately following the prosecutor’s exercise of her peremptory challenge, the prosecutor offered her reasons for challenging the prospective juror. Both at trial and in its opinion, the court either appeared to assume the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case or simply omitted that step of the analysis and proceeded to analyze the prosecutor’s explanation for the strike.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The trial judge found that the prosecutor’s reasons for challenging the juror — specifically, her concerns that the juror would not be able to give the case his full attention in light of his anxiety over his impending graduation and plans— were race-neutral.

The trial court held a hearing on May 10, 2004, prior to the commencement of the penalty phase of appellant’s trial, to rule on the demurrer. Specific to the issue of multiple deaths under Section 9711(d)(ll), appellant claimed that the notice, by combining in a single sentence multiple deaths with the death of an unborn child, and by failing to cite to Section 9711(d)(ll), did not provide him with notice that the Commonwealth intended to proceed on the Section 9711(d)(ll) aggravator. At the May 10th hearing, the trial court held that appellant had constructive notice that the Commonwealth intended to proceed on that aggravating circumstance, given that appellant was charged with three murders and the notice referred to multiple deaths.

Rule 802 requires that, in a case where it intends to seek the death penalty, the Commonwealth must file a “Notice of Aggravating Circumstances that the Commonwealth intends to submit at the sentencing hearing” and to provide the defendant with a copy of the notice. In forwarding his argument, appellant relies upon the language of the Comment to Rule 802, which states: “For purposes of this rule, the notice requirement is satisfied if the copy of the notice to the defendant sets forth the existing aggravating circumstances substantially in the language of the statute.” Here, appellant argues, the notice did not conform to the language of the statute; the Commonwealth did not move promptly to amend the notice; and at no time prior to trial did the Commonwealth state to the defense that it intended to pursue the (d)(ll) aggravating circumstance. Appellant acknowledges that the trial court deemed the Commonwealth’s notice to be sufficient to put the defense on constructive notice respecting the multiple murder aggravator but, he argues, constructive notice should not be deemed sufficient in a death penalty case, and defense counsel should not have to anticipate, or guess at, the aggravating circumstances the prosecution intends to pursue. Appellant argues that where, as here, there is no good cause shown for the Commonwealth’s lapse, the Commonwealth should be “sanctioned” by not being permitted to pursue the aggravating circumstance.</p>

Here, by contrast, the trial court found that the Commonwealth did not seek to include a new aggravating circumstance but rather simply referred to the incorrect numerical subsection while paraphrasing the wording of the appropriate subsection.

The defendant claimed that the failure to provide notice denied him a fair trial. The Commonwealth responded that the defendant was at all times aware of the potential aggravating circumstances, and was not prejudiced in any way by the failure to receive specific written notice of the relevant aggravating circumstances because they were inherent in the charges against the defendant. As to the male victim in the case, the Commonwealth pursued the aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed during the perpetration of a felony (robbery), multiple homicides, and endangering another; as to the female victim, the Commonwealth pursued the aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed during the perpetration of a felony (rape), multiple homicides and torture.</p>

There is no question that the notice in this case lacked the specificity envisioned by Rule 802, and the Commonwealth offered no valid explanation for its lapse.

      <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>Again citing to Criminal Rule 802, appellant argues that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to proceed on the aggravating circumstance relating to the death of Krystal’s unborn child because the notice did not “substantially follow the statute as required.” The Commonwealth’s notice stated that: “(1) The offense was committed by means of multiple shootings and causing multiple deaths, including the death of an unborn child, the defendant knowing that the victim was pregnant.” Appellant’s challenge focuses on the Commonwealth’s failure to include the language of (d)(17) which states that the victim was in her third trimester of pregnancy. Because the notice lacked that language, appellant claims that he was only given notice to defend against the portion of (d)(17) involving a defendant’s knowledge that the victim was pregnant. Appellant argues that there was no evidence presented that appellant was aware of Krystal’s pregnancy, and it was only after the guilt phase concluded and before the penalty phase commenced that appellant became aware that the Commonwealth intended to proceed on the alternate theory that Krystal was in her third trimester of pregnancy. Appellant then reiterates his argument related to the (d)(ll) <em>aggravator </em>— i.e., that the Commonwealth should be held to the notice provided to appellant.</p>
    <p id="b406-5" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[259,1543,1165,635]],["BL_407.1",407,[127,287,1154,357]]]'>The’ Commonwealth counters that this is an argument of form over substance because appellant had actual and constructive notice that the Commonwealth was proceeding on the aggravator involving the death of an unborn child. According to the Commonwealth, Larry Jr. testified that his sister was visibly pregnant, and the coroner, Cyril Wecht, estimated the gestational age of the baby at twenty-eight weeks. The Commonwealth again argues that the (d)(17) aggravator is inherent in the charges against appellant, which included the death of Krystal’s unborn baby. Citing to <em>Carson, </em>the Commonwealth notes that, in that case, this Court allowed the Commonwealth to proceed on an aggravating <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>circumstance that was omitted entirely from its notice because the charges filed provided the' defendant with constructive notice of the aggravator. Here, by contrast, appellant was actually provided with notice that the Commonwealth intended to pursue the (d)(17) aggravator, and the charges against him included a murder charge arising from the death of the unborn child.</p>
    <p id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[126,675,1159,1096]]]'>The trial court found that, although the Commonwealth’s notice did not reference the first clause of (d)(17) relating to a victim who is in the third trimester of pregnancy, appellant had actual notice that the Commonwealth intended to pursue the (d)(17) aggravator. The court further concluded that the Commonwealth’s notice was sufficient to provide appellant with constructive notice of the Commonwealth’s intent with regard to that aggravator. We agree with the trial court that the Commonwealth provided appellant with actual notice of its intent to proceed under (d)(17) generally, and, at the very least, constructive notice that the Commonwealth intended to pursue the first part of the aggravating circumstance involving a victim in her third trimester. Furthermore, as the Commonwealth notes, the coroner’s testimony clearly established that Krystal was in the third trimester of her pregnancy, and other evidence established that she was visibly pregnant. Additionally, appellant was charged at the outset with the death of Krystal’s unborn child. On this record, we are satisfied that appellant was not prejudiced by the notice given, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting this claim.</p>

This case involves three death sentences arising out of three murders, and therefore, we have reviewed each of the <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>sentences relating to the three separate murders. Our review of the record establishes that the sentences of death imposed upon appellant in each case were not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. In addition, we find that the evidence presented in each case was sufficient to support the jury’s finding of two aggravating circumstances as to all threé victims — appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7)) and appellant was convicted of another murder committed at the time of the offense at issue (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll)), and the additional aggravating circumstance relating only to Krystal — that the victim was in her third trimester of pregnancy or appellant knew she was pregnant (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(17)).

Applying these factors, the court found that: the entire interview process lasted slightly more than two hours, during twenty-six minutes of which appellant prepared a handwritten statement; appellant, who was nineteen years old and quit school in ninth grade, could read and write the English language; appellant was in good health and not impaired by alcohol or drugs; he was advised of the seriousness of the charges and the officers did not use threats or intimidation to secure the statement; he was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights three times, after which he acknowledged his understanding of the rights; and he signed two waiver of rights forms. Based upon the totality of the circumstances, the suppression court concluded that appellant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived his rights to remain silent and to counsel. We note that appellant does not challenge these findings or this analysis; instead, his claim is limited to his preliminary contention that it was not he, but Corporal Tobin, who initiated the conversation after he initially invoked his right to counsel and that, in doing so, the Trooper violated his right to counsel.</p>
