    <p id="b531-7" data-blocks='[["BL_531.7",531,[125,911,1153,96]]]'>In 1972, the General Assembly promulgated the HMO Act, 40 P.S. §§ 1551-1584. Section 1552 of the Act provides:</p>
    <blockquote id="Ay1" data-blocks='[["BL_531.8",531,[167,1027,1114,472]]]'>The purpose of this act is to permit and encourage the formation and regulation of health maintenance organizations and to authorize the Secretary of Health to provide technical advice and assistance to corporations desiring to establish, operate and maintain a health maintenance organization to the end that increased competition and consumer choice offered by diverse health maintenance organizations can constructively serve to advance the purposes of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and access.</blockquote>
    <p id="b531-8" data-blocks='[["BL_531.9",531,[126,1524,1155,682]]]'>40 P.S. § 1552. Consistent with this goal, the General Assembly enacted Section 1560(a) of the Act, which provides that an HMO operating pursuant to the Act shall not be subject to “the laws of this State now in force relating to insurance corporations engaged in the business of insurance nor to any law hereafter enacted relating to the business of insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization.” Aetna asserts that the plain language of the relevant statute exempts it from the anti-subrogation provisions of Section 1720 of the MVFRL because Section 1720 does not provide “specifically and in exact terms that it applies to a health maintenance organization.”</p>
    <p id="b531-9" data-blocks='[["BL_531.10",531,[127,2236,1154,98]],["BL_532.1",532,[277,288,1163,1003]]]'>Wirth, however, contends that the “plain, expansive and all-inclusive” language of Section 1720, which provides for “no <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>right of subrogation ... with respect to ... benefits paid or payable by a program, group contract or other arrangement,” supports his position that the anti-subrogation provision applies. (Brief of Appellant at 11.) He asserts that the broad term “program, group contract or other arrangement” includes HMOs, as well as “every conceivable type of healthcare arrangement.” <em>Id. </em>In support of this, he notes the following: (1) Aetna itself uses the words “program” and “group agreement” in the Certificate of Coverage (R.R. 26a) and Group Insurance Certificate (R.R. 97a) it issues to subscribers such as Wirth’s father; (2) Section 1554(b) of the HMO Act, 40 P.S. § 1554(b), states that HMOs shall provide basic health care services either “directly or through arrangements” with others; (3) Section 1558 of the HMO Act, 40 P.S. § 1558, authorizes HMOs to enter into group contracts; and (4) 31 Pa.Code § 301.62 requires HMOs to file group and non-group contract forms with the Insurance Department. Based on these four factors, Wirth maintains that Section 1720 “specifically and in exact terms” applies to HMOs.</p>
    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[273,1315,1163,523]]]'>He further asserts that Section 1560(a) of the HMO Act does not exempt HMOs from the provisions of Section 1720 of the MVFRL because, “in common usage, the phrase ‘program, group contract or other arrangement’ is a specific and exact term that ‘applies’ to HMO plans.” (Brief of Appellant at 15.) Because Aetna, the HMO Act, and the regulations use the words “program, group contract or other arrangement” to describe the HMO agreement in this case, Wirth argues that it is logical to conclude that Section 1720 of the MVFRL “specifically and in exact terms” applies to HMOs.</p>
    <p id="b532-5" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[271,1863,1160,470]],["BL_533.1",533,[128,287,1155,370]]]'>Aetna notes that “[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.” Section 1903(a) of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). “The common and approved usage of the words ‘specifically’ and ‘exact’ includes a shared requirement of particularity, which is antithetical to the generalized language of Section 1720.” (Brief of Appellee at 8.) Accordingly, it asserts that the reference in Section 1720 to “benefits paid or payable by a program, group con<a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>tract or other arrangement” is not sufficiently particular to apply to HMO benefits. Aetna also contends that Wirth errs when he contends that the words “program” and “group contract,” as used in Section 1720, refer to HMOs. Such terms are not specific and exact, because as Wirth states, they apply to “every conceivable type of healthcare arrangement.” (Brief of Appellant at 11.)</p>

Accordingly, application of the rule of statutory construction that “[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage,” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a), leads us to conclude that Section 1720 does not apply to HMOs.</p>

Wirth asserts that to the extent that the HMO Act and the MVFRL are in conflict, the antisubrogation provision of the MVFRL should control over the earlier adopted HMO Act. Section 1936 of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936, provides that whenever statutes enacted by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the latest enactment prevails. However, the position of Wirth directly conflicts with the intent of the General Assembly as set forth in Section 1560(a), which provides that an HMO is exempt from laws “hereafter enacted relating to the business of insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization.” (emphasis added). Thus, it is clear that in this instance the Legislature intended that statutes promulgated after 1972 would not apply to HMOs unless they so provided in specific and exact terms.</p>
