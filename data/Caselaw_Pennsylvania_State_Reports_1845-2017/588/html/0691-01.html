Smith and Black applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which the Employment Division denied because their employer had discharged them for work-related misconduct. The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed based on its conclusion that the denial of benefits violated the free exercise rights of Smith and Black as protected by the First Amendment. The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the criminality of the use of peyote was irrelevant because the purpose of the misconduct provision, pursuant to which the Employment Division denied relief, was not to enforce criminal laws, but to preserve the financial stability of the unemployment compensation fund. The Oregon Supreme Court held that this purpose did not justify the burden that denial of compensation placed on the religious practice of Smith and Black.

The Majority’s account of the case, <em>see, e.g., </em>Maj. op. at 694-95 n. 3, 906 A.2d at 1167 n. 3, is not without basis in the record, but Father's <a id="p710" href="#p710" data-label="710" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*710</a>testimony and the trial court’s findings of fact <em>based </em>upon Father’s testimony are to be distinguished. Notably, the trial court’s general inclination toward crediting testimony that contradicted Father’s is evident in its opinion as well as in the order it ultimately issued, which speaks volumes regarding the trial court’s in-person assessment of Father's intentions. The Majority relies upon the trial court's statement that “there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.” Tr. Ct. Op., 5/6/02, at 6. For this reason, it granted Father partial custody, a ruling I would not overturn. Nevertheless, its other observations emphasize the seriousness of Father’s intention regarding inculcating the young women in his family, Child included, into a polygamist lifestyle. In sum, I believe the trial court's opinion indicates that it found a sufficiently grave threat to warrant restricting Father's ability to indoctrinate Child into criminal conduct; that it ordered the restriction in the first place, after articulating the “grave threat of harm” standard, implies as much. In addition, this reading honors the trial court's broad discretion to act in Child’s best interests.</p>
