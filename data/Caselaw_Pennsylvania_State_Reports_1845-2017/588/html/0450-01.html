I therefore have difficulty with the conclusion that a third and parallel reference was intended by the Legislature to serve a much more expansive purpose. Second, nowhere else in the statute (and, at least to my knowledge, in the Election Code) did the General Assembly use the word “petition” to generically include both nomination petitions and papers, let alone nomination petitions, nomination papers, and objections to nomination petitions and papers. Indeed, the General Assembly was otherwise very careful in Section 977 to specify both nomination “petitions and papers” in every proviso in which the candidates’ filings are addressed. Further, a broad, generic use of the word “petition” to address three discrete forms of documents under the Election Code spanning both candidate and objector submissions is not only uncharacteristic, but also seems to me to be unnatural. Moreover, the more natural construction of the statute is consistent with the precept that the Election Code should be construed liberally, in favor of candidates’ ballot access. <em>See In re Nomination Petition of Driscoll, </em><a href="/pa/577/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="577 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="91673" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0501-01">577 Pa. 501</a>, 507, <em><a href="/pa/577/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="847 A.2d 44" data-case-ids="91673,91704,9254909,9255001" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0501-01,/pa/577/0500-01,/a2d/847/0044-01,/a2d/847/0044-02">847 </a></em><a href="/pa/577/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="847 A.2d 44" data-case-ids="91673,91704,9254909,9255001" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0501-01,/pa/577/0500-01,/a2d/847/0044-01,/a2d/847/0044-02">A.2d 44</a>, 48 (2004). Fourth, in delineating the consequences of the filing of defective nomination petitions and papers, Section 977 indicates that these documents should be “set aside” upon appropriate and meritorious challenge, 25 P.S. § 2937, whereas the assessment of costs is authorized by the statute only when a petition is “dismissed.” <em><a href="/pa/577/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="847 A.2d 44" data-case-ids="91673,91704,9254909,9255001" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0501-01,/pa/577/0500-01,/a2d/847/0044-01,/a2d/847/0044-02">Id.</a> </em>The phraseology of “setting aside” attaching to the treatment of nomination petitions and papers comports with their filing with the Secretary of the Commonwealth or county boards of elections as opposed to in courts of law, <em>see 25 </em>P.S. §§ 2873, 2913, whereas, the use of the term “dismissal” in the cost-assessment provision more properly <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>aligns with the disposition of documents submitted to the courts, here, objection petitions.</p>
