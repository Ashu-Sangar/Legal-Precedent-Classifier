In performing that review, we must determine whether the evidence admitted at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, are sufficient to establish the elements of first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Bridges, </em><a href="/pa/563/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="563 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1366900" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0001-01">563 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/a2d/757/0859-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="757 A.2d 859" data-case-ids="11243658,1366900" data-case-paths="/a2d/757/0859-01,/pa/563/0001-01">757 A.2d 859</a> (2000). Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction of first-degree murder when the Commonwealth establishes that (1) a person was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused did the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. <em>Commonwealth v. Spotz, </em><a href="/pa/563/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="563 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1366976" data-case-paths="/pa/563/0269-01">563 Pa. 269</a>, <a href="/a2d/759/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="759 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11235770,11235819,1366970,1366976" data-case-paths="/a2d/759/1280-01,/a2d/759/1280-02,/pa/563/0268-01,/pa/563/0269-01">759 A.2d 1280</a>, 1283 (2000). An intentional killing is one committed by means of poison, lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated actions. <em>Commonwealth v.

And, the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body is sufficient to establish the requisite specific intent to kill. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b937-4" data-blocks='[["BL_937.4",937,[136,418,1155,906]]]'>The evidence presented at trial established that at approximately 3:00 p.m. on June 3, 2001, a short, stockily built man wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt with the hood drawn over his head, walked onto a basketball court in Yalenia Park in the city of Allentown, Pennsylvania and shot the victim, Armondo Rodriguez, several times at close range. After the victim fell to the ground, the assailant stood over him and shot him several more times. The assailant then ran towards a parking lot, turned around, and shot back towards the crowded park where the victim lay. At the time the first officer arrived, there were approximately twenty to thirty people in the immediate vicinity. There were several shell casings lying in the area where the victim lay and several more casings were found in or about the adjacent streets. The victim was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival. The autopsy revealed a total of six gunshot wounds, all but one of which were fatal wounds.</p>

Mr. Jose Aquino testified that he saw Appellant standing near the court just prior to the shooting, talking on his cell phone and looking in the direction of the victim. He was able to see Appellant’s face before and at the time Appellant came charging onto the court. He testified that he had seen Appellant a few days prior to the shooting, wearing the same hooded sweatshirt, but not with the hood over his head.</p>

His gun, however, failed to discharge. As the police arrived, Mr. Rosario placed the gun in the car. The police eventually-recovered that gun and when Mr. Rosario admitted ownership thereof, he was charged with possession of a firearm. At the time of the instant trial, Mr. Rosario had completed his sentence for that charge. With respect to the identity of the shooter, Mr. Rosario testified that while he initially told police that he did not see the shooter because he was afraid, he, in fact, saw the shooter and identified Appellant as that shooter.</p>

After being provided descriptions of the suspects, the police proceeded to a given location in the West-brook Village section of Hartford. .When they arrived, they observed two individuals, one of whom matched the description they had been given of Cantalino Morales, apparently trying to jump-start a vehicle. When the individuals were successful in starting the vehicle, the police, believing the subjects were about to leave, moved in on them, announcing their presence and ordering the two people to “get down.” One of the individuals, later identified as Morales, pulled a gun and began shooting towards the officers. At about the same moment, a man, later identified as Appellant, and a female companion exited the rear of the building. Both Appellant and Morales fled on foot, with Morales shooting towards police as he fled. As he was running, Morales was observed dropping an object which police later recovered and identified as a 9mm Ruger. Both individuals were apprehended a few moments later, Appellant as he attempted to dive into a wooded area, and Morales who, after pointing another gun towards police, fell only a short distance away from Appellant when he was hit by police gunfire. The gun Morales was holding at the time he was shot was recovered from the scene and identified as a Standard Arms. At the time of his arrest, Appellant’s person was searched and, among other things, a handcuff key <a id="p725" href="#p725" data-label="725" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*725</a>and a magazine containing live bullets were discovered in his pocket.</p>
    <p id="b939-4" data-blocks='[["BL_939.4",939,[130,411,1157,735]]]'>The Commonwealth presented a ballistics expert, John Curtis, Jr., who testified that the casings and bullets recovered from the basketball court and properties adjacent to the park were all discharged from the same two firearms found at the time of Appellant’s and Morales’ arrest. Specifically, he found that fifteen shell casings recovered from the scene of the murder and two adjacent streets were discharged from the Ruger semiautomatic pistol, as were the bullets removed from the victim’s body, one bullet found embedded in a wall in a nearby garage, and another bullet lodged in a wall in a .second floor room of a nearby home. Four additional shell casings which were found behind a building a short distance further from the scene were fired from a Standard Arms semiautomatic pistol.</p>

Detective Effting testified that he had interviewed two eyewitnesses, Jessica Brown and Julio Santiago, who indicated that persons other than the shooter possessed guns at the time and may have also been shooting. According to Detective Effting, at the time he interviewed Ms. Brown she told him that she had seen the shooter and thought that possibly as many as three other persons had guns in the park that day. Ms. Brown testified for the Commonwealth, however, • that she observed no one but the assailant with a gun but had assumed that someone other than the fleeing assailant was shooting because the assailant was shooting back towards the crowd. As for Mr. Santiago, Detective Effting testified that when interviewed, Mr. Santiago told him that he thought an individual behind a Jeep may have also been shooting, and that he saw an unidentified individual chasing the shooter as he fled. However, when he testified for the Commonwealth at trial, Mr. Santiago denied having given Detective Effting any such information.</p>

He testified that he did not even know the victim and did not know Mr. Morales before meeting him in Connecticut.

Here, not only does Appellant concede the inadequacies of this claim, but our independent review of the record also fails to demonstrate that the verdict shocked one’s sense of justice. As summarized above, the evidence presented at trial clearly demonstrates an intentional killing, and while Appellant testified to an alibi, he offered little, if any, support for that claim. Given this weak evidence of alibi, the jury’s decision to credit the four Commonwealth eyewitnesses’ testimony claiming that Appellant was, indeed, the shooter certainly does not shock one’s sense of justice. Accordingly, this claim provides Appellant no relief.</p>

The facts adduced at the Rule 600 hearing establish that Appellant appeared on February 21, 2002, for the scheduled preliminary hearing without counsel. The record does not establish that either party requested a continuance, only that the court granted a continuance so that Appellant could obtain counsel. In its May 20, 2003, order denying the Rule 600 motion, the trial court explained that it found the delay occasioned by Appellant’s failure to have counsel present on the date originally scheduled for the preliminary hearing to be excludable against Appellant since notwithstanding that Appellant did not expressly request a continuance, he nevertheless acquiesced in the delay which was solely for his benefit. Presently, Appellant argues that since the continuance was not “requested” by him, the delay should not be attributable to him.

The Commonwealth submits that the rule itself does not apply to capital defendants since such defendants are not entitled to bail or dismissal of charges. The Commonwealth posits that inapplicability of Rule 600 in capital cases makes sense given the gravity of the case which calls for a more in-depth and <a id="p729" href="#p729" data-label="729" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*729</a>lengthier preparation by all parties. Because, pursuant to Article 1, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution a defendant charged with a capital crime is not entitled to bail, the Commonwealth submits that Rule 600’s remedy of dismissal cannot apply to capital defendants. To support its claim, the Commonwealth presumably relies upon the language of subsection (G) of the rule which provides for the remedy of dismissal only for those defendants out on bail after the expiration of the 365 days. The Commonwealth further submits that in <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, supra, </em>this Court held that the remedy of dismissal under the speedy trial rule does not apply to capital defendants.</p>

Thus, the fact that Appellant did not expressly seek the continuance is not determinative of whether the delay is attributable to him; rather, the focus is whether his failure to obtain counsel on his behalf was the direct cause of the delay. <em>See <a href="/pa/503/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="503 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1785893" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0482-01">id.</a> </em>Also, there is no record of Appellant having waived his right to counsel nor does Appellant contend <a id="p732" href="#p732" data-label="732" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*732</a>that he had, in fact, waived his right to counsel.

Subtracting these 360 days from the 707 days between the filing of the complaint and the date of trial leaves only 347 non-excludable days between the filing of the complaint and the start of trial.

After being advised by the court to get the testimony clarified, the prosecutor, via further testimony of Detective Simock, made clear that Appellant was wanted for this murder only and that the press conference also dealt with other incidents in which Appellant had no involvement. Because Appellant takes no issue with the trial court’s summation of what testimony is at issue here, we assume for purposes of this argument that it is, indeed, this testimony of Detective Simock to which Appellant refers.

Certainly the photographs were relevant to demonstrate the number and location of the bullet holes, and also to bolster the Commonwealth’s forensic evidence indicating that although the victim was shot at close range, the excessive blood loss rendered it difficult to obtain residue samples on the victim’s shirt that would have enabled the prosecution to determine the precise distance from which the bullets were fired, all of which weighs in on the element of intent. Our review of the photographs in which pools of blood are visible leads us to a similar result. As the trial court noted at the time it overruled the objection, notwithstanding the amount of blood visible, the photographs depict the close proximity of several shell casings to the victim and thus, were also relevant to the Commonwealth’s theory <a id="p737" href="#p737" data-label="737" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*737</a>that the victim was shot at close range.

    <p id="b951-5" data-blocks='[["BL_951.4",951,[130,721,1159,1388]]]'>Finally, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3), we are required to affirm the sentence of death unless we determine after review that the sentence was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, or that the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating factor. Here, the jury unanimously found that in the commission of this murder, Appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(7). Several eyewitnesses testified at trial that in retreating from the victim, Appellant fired several shots towards the crowd gathered in the park. Additionally, Angel Rolon, who at the time of the shooting lived in a single family dwelling adjacent to the park, testified that shortly before 3:00 p.m. on June 3, 2001, he heard shots being fired and ran to a second floor playroom where his four children were playing. He ran into the room and immediately gathered his four children under him as he lay on top of them. Seconds later, a bullet came through the door to that room and lodged in the wall. He testified that before he gathered his children, one of them had been sitting in a chair in direct line of the path of that bullet. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of this particular aggravating factor. Further, our independent review of the record reveals no evidence of passion or prejudice or consideration of any other arbitrary factor on the part of the jury in the rendering of this sentence.</p>

While our state speedy trial rule, of course, emanates from the constitutional right, both federal and state, of an accused to a speedy trial, the procedural rule and the constitutional guarantees provide independent bases for asserting a claim of undue delay in appropriate cases. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Nevertheless, the remedy of dismissal for a violation of either appears universal, the only variation being whether it is dismissal with or without prejudice. For instance, in <em>Barker v.

Otherwise, the right to a speedy trial would be rendered meaningless. Further, we noted that several states had already enacted statutes setting forth specific time limits in which an accused must be brought to trial and noted that while some enforce those time limits by barring subsequent prosecutions altogether, others bar subsequent prosecutions in particular classes of cases only. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="297 A.2d 127">id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20127" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="297 A.2d 127">at 130, 133</a>.</p>
