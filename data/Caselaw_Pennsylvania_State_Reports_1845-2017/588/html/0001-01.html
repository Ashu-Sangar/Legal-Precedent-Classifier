The sole question for our review is whether the trial court conducted <em>voir dire </em>in a manner so inadequate as to effectively deny Appellant his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>
    <p id="b218-9" data-blocks='[["BL_218.8",218,[255,1147,1166,1166]]]'>On September 7, 1997, Appellant was arrested for forcing a woman, at gunpoint, to perform oral sex upon him in an alleyway. He was subsequently tried, convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven to fifteen years. He appeals from the Order of the Superior Court affirming his judgment of sentence, asserting that the trial court denied him his fundamental constitutional right to trial by an impartial jury. Specifically, Appellant contends that during the jury selection process, the trial judge conducted <em>voir dire </em>in a manner so inadequate as to make it impossible to assess the prospective jurors’ qualifications or ability to be fair, thereby denying him the right to trial by a jury free from partiality. He argues that the trial court’s reliance on a Juror Questionnaire in directing questions to the prospective jurors rendered <em>voir dire </em>cursory and superficial thereby preventing him from being able to adequately examine the jurors to determine their qualifications. Appellant further contends that voir dire was inadequate because the trial court failed to question the prospective jurors specifically about their attitudes towards crimes involving sexual violence, since Appellant was charged with a crime of that nature.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.3",219,[133,283,1155,625]]]'>
      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>The Superior Court reviewed Appellant’s contentions and concluded that while Appellant expressed general dissatisfaction with his inability to participate in the questioning, the record revealed no request by Appellant to either have more specific questions posed to jurors whose examination he found inadequate, or to have those jurors stricken for cause. Therefore, Appellant’s claim that <em>voir dire </em>was inadequate could be found to be waived. Nevertheless, the Superior Court concluded that even if Appellant’s claim was not waived, Appellant’s contention still lacked merit, and the trial court had exercised its discretion appropriately in conducting its examination of the jurors.</p>
    <p id="b219-5" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[133,932,1158,1113]]]'>Specifically, the Superior Court determined that during <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court questioned all prospective jurors about any potential bias reflected in their answers to the jury questionnaire, affording particular attention to those jurors whose questionnaire responses suggested the possibility of prejudice. Having reviewed the record, the Superior Court found no indication that the trial court’s manner and scope of <em>voir dire </em>was inadequate. Additionally, the Superior Court noted, with regard to Appellant’s contention that <em>voir dire </em>was cursory, the examination of the forty potential jurors spanned eighty-five pages of testimony. With respect to jurors 23 and 5, whose responses to the questionnaire suggested no apparent impartiality and whose examination Appellant found particularly inadequate, neither juror indicated that they could not be fair or could not serve. Juror 3, whose examination Appellant also specifically contests, testified that there was no reason she could not be fair. With respect to Juror 37 who did not indicate whether or not she could be fair, the Superior Court noted that the record contained no evidence that she could not be fair and impartial, and that Appellant failed to demonstrate any such impartiality.</p>

Finding no abuse of discretion, as well as determining that Appellant failed to demonstrate any juror prejudice or impartiality, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court.

      <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>Appellant contends that the trial court relied principally on the answers provided in the Juror Questionnaire in examining the jurors, directing its questions to the jurors based on those items of the Questionnaire that were answered in the affirmative. Appellant argues that the court’s follow-up inquiries were brief and inadequate, and where jurors had answered in the negative to questions on the Questionnaire, the court’s examination was even less thorough. He argues that the fact that <em>voir dire </em>was conducted exclusively by the court, despite his request to participate, compounded the inadequacy of the <em>voir dire </em>examination and contributed to the denial of his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[141,932,1156,1268]]]'>Appellant additionally asserts that the trial court erred in denying his request to include in its oral examination a question to elicit juror attitudes towards sexually violent crimes. As a result, Appellant argues that he was unable to determine juror attitudes towards crimes such as the one for which he was charged. Because of the sensitive nature of sexually violent crimes, Appellant asserts that the Questionnaire which asked whether the jurors themselves or anyone close to them had been a victim of a crime was insufficient to elicit information about juror exposure to crimes of a sexually violent nature. Appellant cites studies to the effect that sexually violent crimes are notoriously underreported and that the incidence of sexual assault victims in the general population makes it likely that one or more of the prospective jurors had exposure to such crimes. Therefore, he concludes that the fact that not one person from the entire <em>venire </em>volunteered information about exposure to sexually violent crimes demonstrates the need for more probing examination of juror attitudes towards sexually violent offenses. Appellant alleges that the failure of the court to explore jurors’ attitudes towards the offense specific to his case, in combination with a generally deficient <em>voir dire </em>examination, deprived him of meaningful <em>voir dire </em>and infringed upon his right to trial by an impartial jury.</p>

The jury selection process is crucial to the preservation of that right. <em>Commonwealth v.

It is well settled that the sole purpose of examination of jurors under <em>voir dire </em>is to secure a competent, fair, impartial and unprejudiced jury.

Again, however, Appellant <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>made no request for additional questions, and - after considering the jurors’ answers and observing their demeanor, the court found further inquiries unnecessary.</p>

The trial court made use of the Juror Questionnaire as an aid to the oral examination of the prospective jurors and to facilitate and expedite <em>voir dire, </em>without infringing upon Appellant’s right to supplement oral examination. We do not find that the trial court erred in rejecting Appellants’ proposed supplemental questions where the court determined that such questions were unnecessary or improper. While the parties are permitted to supplement the court’s examination, this grant is not unrestricted but rather is subject to limitations as the judge deems proper. The fact that the court overruled Appellant’s objections is not enough for <em>voir dire </em>to be held inadequate, absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion in rejecting Appellant’s requests, which Appellant has failed to demonstrate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> At no time was Appellant restricted from requesting supplementary questions when he was concerned that the trial court’s examination was insufficient. All selected jurors demonstrated the requisite ability to give fair and impartial consideration to the evidence and render a verdict accordingly to the judge’s satisfaction.

While acknowledging that the Juror Questionnaire required the jurors to disclose whether they or anyone close to them had been the victim of a crime, Appellant argues that the <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>Questionnaire did not ask whether they or anyone close to them had been the victim of a <em>sexually </em>violent crime.

The response in our Criminal Procedural Rules of affording the trial courts substantial control to maintain the central focus upon the fair and expeditious selection of an impartial jury seems to me to be the appropriate one, and is consistent with that pertaining in the federal courts. <em>Compare </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 631(D), <em>with </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(a). The rules, however, contemplate some meaningful participation by counsel in the process, via the prescription that, if the trial judge elects to conduct the examination of prospective jurors, “the judge shall permit the defense and the prosecution to supplement the examination by such further inquiry as the judge deems proper.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 631(D).</p>
    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[262,1176,1161,634]]]'>Here, the record does not suggest the allocation by the trial judge of any meaningful role to the attorneys; indeed, the court’s commentary reflects an apparent discounting of the function of <em>voir dire </em>in providing counsel with some sense of perspective on individual venire persons so that peremptory challenges might be exercised in an intelligent fashion. While I share in the general reluctance to disturb decisions of the trial courts as to the appropriate scope of <em>voir dire, </em>here, I believe that the trial judge abused her discretion by refusing a few modest requests for some relevant questioning, in particular, to inquire into prospective juror attitudes concerning sexually violent crimes in a case of such nature.</p>

Contrary to the Superior Court’s opinion, in light of the above, I believe that the relevant request was reasonably preserved as a matter of record. Further, I disagree with the majority to the degree that it suggests that counsel was not constrained from posing questions concerning the nature of the offense on his own. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion 588 Pa. at 11-13, 902 A.2d at 426. It seems clear from the record that the attorneys were simply not permitted to ask questions, and, even if this were not the case, I do not believe that counsel should be charged with an obligation subsequently to pursue lines of inquiry that a trial court has expressly foreclosed.</p>

I also have difficulty with the degree of emphasis that the majority places, throughout its opinion, upon the general questions posed by the trial court to venirepersons concerning their ability to be fair in the abstract. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion 588 Pa. at 11 &amp; n. 6, 902 A.2d at 425-26 &amp; n. 6. To me, the majority’s approach seems to be in tension with the governing principles that it otherwise identifies in its opinion, such as the role of <em>voir dire </em>in providing a meaningful opportunity to assess juror qualifications, and the "considerable latitude” that is to be made available in the process, <em>id. </em>at 6-8, 902 A.2d at 423. <em>Cf.
