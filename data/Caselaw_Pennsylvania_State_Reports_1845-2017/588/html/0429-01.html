    <p id="b645-7" data-blocks='[["BL_645.6",645,[129,606,1155,1125]]]'>This appeal arises from the suspension of appellant’s operating privilege for refusing to undergo chemical testing pursuant to the Implied Consent Law, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547. The lower courts disagreed over the authority of a municipal police officer to invoke the Implied Consent Law outside the officer’s defined territorial jurisdiction, as provided in the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8951 <em>et seq. </em>(“MPJA” or “Act”). The trial court found that the officer lacked authority under the MPJA to pursue and arrest appellant in an adjoining jurisdiction; that the lack of authority rendered the officer’s invocation of the Implied Consent Law invalid; and, thus, that appellant’s operating privilege was not subject to suspension under the Implied Consent Law. A divided panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed, with the panel majority holding that the officer had acted within his MPJA authority in pursuing appellant into a neighboring jurisdiction, stopping her, and then invoking the Implied Consent Law. We agree with the trial court that the officer in the situation <em>sub judice </em>exceeded his authority under the Act and, therefore, we reverse the order below and reinstate the trial court’s order invalidating appellant’s license suspension.</p>

Bayley, are as follows: On November 27, 2003, at approximately 1:45 a.m., Hampden Township Police Officer James Sollenberger was on uniformed patrol in a marked Hampden police cruiser when he observed appellant’s vehicle on Trindle Road in Hampden Township, Cumberland County. Believing appellant to be exceeding the posted 40 mile per hour speed limit, Officer Sollenberger followed her at a steady distance for approximately 100 yards, clocking her speed (by use of his own speedometer) at 53 miles per hour. Appellant then reduced her speed and, while still on Trindle Road, <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>entered the neighboring Borough of Camp Hill. Appellant properly signaled a right-hand turn and then made a wide right turn onto April Drive. There was no other traffic except the police cruiser on either Trindle Road or April Drive at the time and, at the point of appellant’s turn, there were several large potholes on the right berm of Trindle Road and the right driving lane of April Drive.</p>
    <p id="b646-5" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[266,685,1167,1280]]]'>As appellant continued in the right lane on April Drive, Officer Sollenberger, now in Camp Hill, turned onto April Drive and activated his patrol car’s lights to initiate a traffic stop. Appellant stopped her car and got out. The officer exited his vehicle and asked appellant to get back inside her car, and she complied with his request. The officer then asked appellant to produce her driver’s license, vehicle registration and proof of insurance, which she provided after some initial difficulty in locating the documents. During this exchange, Officer Sollenberger smelled an odor of alcohol coming from inside appellant’s car and noted that appellant had red, bloodshot eyes and slurred her speech. The officer then requested that appellant exit her car; when she did, he detected the odor of alcohol coming from her person. Officer Sollenberger asked appellant to perform field sobriety tests, whereupon she swore at him and started walking toward a nearby house.' The officer ordered appellant to stop, but she continued walking, causing him to physically seize appellant and arrest her for driving under the influence (“DUI”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He placed appellant in his patrol car and drove her to the booking cénter where he read to her instructions relevant to the Implied Consent Law from a DL-26 form.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellant refused to provide two valid breath test samples, which was deemed a refusal to submit to chemical testing.</p>

Appellant filed a statutory appeal to the trial court challenging Officer Sollenberger’s authority to enforce Section 1547 of the Motor Vehicle Code (commonly referred to as the Implied Consent Law), outside his territorial jurisdiction. The dispute arose from the statute’s language regarding the role of a “police officer:”</p>

    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[278,514,1163,582]]]'>The trial court sustained appellant’s appeal and reversed her license suspension, finding that Officer Sollenberger lacked statutory authority to stop and arrest appellant outside the officer’s territorial jurisdiction and, therefore, he was not then lawfully acting as a police officer for purposes of the Implied Consent Law. The court reasoned that, as a municipal police officer, Officer Sollenberger had authority beyond the territorial limits of his jurisdiction only in those instances specifically set forth in the MPJA.

    <p id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[129,467,1155,1069]]]'>The trial court concluded that Officer Sollenberger’s arrest of appellant was not an authorized extra-jurisdictional arrest under subsection (a)(2)’s hot pursuit provision because probable cause to arrest her did not arise while she was in the officer’s primary jurisdiction of Hampden Township. This was so, the trial court reasoned, because the officer did not clock appellant’s speed for a sufficient distance to generate probable cause to believe that she was speeding. Under the Motor Vehicle Code, an officer attempting to ascertain a motorist’s speed using a speedometer (as opposed to, for example, a state police officer employing radar) must time the speed for at least three-tenths of a mile. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3368(a). Here, Officer Sollenberger only clocked appellant’s speed for 100 yards while still in Hampden Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The trial court further noted that appellant did not weave or cross into the lane of oncoming traffic in Hampden Township. Thus, Officer Sollenberger lacked probable cause to arrest appellant for any criminal acts or violations of the Motor Vehicle Code occurring in Hampden Township, a fact which negated any hot pursuit claim.</p>

From these facts, the trial court concluded that Officer Sollenberger did not witness or have probable cause to believe that appellant had committed a felony, misdemeanor, breach of the peace or other act which presented an immediate clear and present <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>danger to persons or property while he was in the Borough of Camp Hill.

Confining its analysis to the officer’s authority under MPJA Section 8953(a)(5), the panel majority found that Officer Sollenberger was on official business both before and during his encounter with appellant, as he was on routine patrol in a marked police cruiser in his primary jurisdiction, he was in uniform, and he was clearly identifiable as a police officer. The majority concluded that, while in Hampden Township, the officer witnessed appellant commit a traffic offense, <em>i.e., </em>speeding, noting that even if appellant could not be charged with speeding because the officer did not follow her for a sufficient statutory distance, the officer did clock her speed at a rate exceeding the posted speed limit. The majority further concluded that Officer Sollenberger witnessed a second traffic offense “on the geographical boundary [of Hampden Township and the Borough of Camp Hill] when [appellant] made a wide turn onto April Drive and crossed over the opposing lane.” <a href="/a2d/870/0982-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="870 A.2d 982" data-case-ids="9020496" data-case-paths="/a2d/870/0982-01">870 A.2d at 986</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Based upon appellant’s speeding and her wide turn, the <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>majority concluded that: “[tjogether, these acts of erratic driving presented an immediate clear and present danger to persons or property and further investigation was warranted.” <em><a href="/a2d/870/0982-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="870 A.2d 982" data-case-ids="9020496" data-case-paths="/a2d/870/0982-01">Id.</a> </em>The majority thus held that Officer Sollenberger had statutory authority to stop appellant and accordingly could invoke the Implied Consent Law.</p>

Once in Sandycreek, the officer followed the vehicle to clock its speed, doing so for one-half of a mile during which time the vehicle left Sandycreek and reentered Franklin. Two-thirds of the officer’s clocking occurred in Sandycreek and one-third in Franklin. The clocking in Franklin was only for two-tenths of a mile, and thus was insufficient on its own to establish speeding in the officer’s home jurisdiction because, as we have noted above, the Vehicle Code requires clocking for three-tenths of a mile when a determination is made via a speedometer. 75 Pa.C.S. § 3368(a).

First, the Bureau argues that, even if Officer Sollenberger’s extraterritorial pursuit and arrest of appellant for DUI was deemed illegal, her remedy is limited to the criminal suppression court because the illegality of the arrest is irrelevant to the propriety of her license suspension under the Implied Consent Law. According to the Bureau, this Court’s decision in <em>McKinley TV </em>“did not change” an alleged “longstanding rule” that an illegal arrest for DUI does not affect the Bureau’s ability to suspend a license for failing to comply with the arresting officer’s request under the Implied Consent Law. Second, the Bureau argues that Officer Sollenberger had reasonable grounds to believe that appellant was operating and in actual physical control of the movement of her vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
