Several people were killed, and another suffered serious injuries. The consolidated actions were commenced in the common pleas court in 2001 by Appellees, representatives of the crash victims and/or their estates, against Appellants, Textron Lycoming Reciprocating Engine Division, Textron, Inc., and AVCO Corporation, as well as others. Appellants were described in the complaints as the “designer, manufacturer, seller, supplier, over-hauler, repairer, maintainer, and product support servicer of the Lycoming engine installed on the [accident] aircraft.” Amended Complaints ¶ 10. The complaints asserted identical claims of negligence, strict liability, and breach of express and implied warranties. Appellees did not dispute that the original engine assembly was installed on the accident aircraft more than eighteen years before the accident. They alleged, however, that the crash was caused by a failure of engine and fuel system components that were replaced and overhauled within eighteen years of the date of the accident. Further, the complaints <em>averred </em>that Appellants had knowledge of the alleged defects and engaged in intentional misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding relative to them. These sets of <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>allegations were obviously included at least in part to implicate exceptions to GARA’s statute of repose.</p>

Appellants highlighted that more than eighteen years had elapsed between the date on which the enginé was installed and the date of the accident, and that they did not manufacture or supply any of the allegedly defective parts that had been replaced within eighteen years of the 1999 accident.</p>

In this regard, the common pleas court found that whether Appellants should stand in the shoes of the actual manufacturer for the replacement parts was a disputed factual question precluding the grant of summary judgment.

As to separability, Appellants argue that motions under GARA are materially distinct from many other motions for summary judgment, in that their subject (the age of an aircraft and the date of its first sale) is separate from and collateral to the underlying controversy in aviation tort' litigation, whereas the subjects of most summary judgment motions are inherently intertwined with the merits of the underlying dispute. In terms of the importance element, Appellants invoke the federal policy underlying GARA to ameliorate the. impact of long-tail liability on a declining American aviation industry, thus fostering regeneration of essential domestic enterprises, creating employment opportunities for citizens, and favorably affecting the balance of trade between the United States and its trading partners. <em>See generally </em>H.

Because we believe that the status of type certificate holder and/or designer fall under the umbrella of manufacturer conduct for purposes of GARA, it would wholly undermine the general period of repose if original manufacturers were excepted from claims relief for replacement parts under the rolling provision by virtue of that status alone. <em>Cf.

Under this theory, the court reasoned, regardless of whether or not a claim could be asserted against Appellants for replacement parts in their capacity as manufacturer, the rolling provision operates to preserve any accountability that Appellants may bear for replacement parts of a type that they hold out as their own. <em>See Pridgen, </em>No. 4008, July Term, 2001, <em>slip op. </em>at 6-8. We do not believe, however, that Section 400 of the Restatement should be interpreted to displace GARA repose by preserving design-defect claims against a manufacturer that are associated with original design and/or type certification merely because the manufacturer maintains a store of replacement parts, at least in the absence of a creditable allegation that the components alleged to have caused injury to the plaintiffs were actually supplied by the defendant/manufacturer and installed within the eighteen year period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Nota<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>bly, as well, other courts have rejected similar efforts to apply state-law theories in a way that would circumvent GARA. <em>See, e.g., Mason, </em>653 N.W.2d at 550 (rejecting a plaintiffs efforts to avoid GARA by focusing on state-law duties arising out of the sale by a manufacturer of maintenance materials); <em>cf.

Jones </em>is not binding on us in terms of our application of the state collateral order doctrine, the state formulation initially derives from the United States Supreme Court’s approach, and we see good reason to adhere to that approach as concerns the legal/factual distinction made in <em>Johnson v. Jones. </em>As the United States Supreme Court has explained, the distinction is consistent with the "separateness” element of the collateral order doctrine and serves a rational narrowing function in terms of which issues may be considered as of right on interlocutory appellate review. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20202" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="82 Cal.

As noted, at various points in its supplemental opinion the common pleas court couched its orders in terms of the finding of material factual disputes. The court’s opinion, however, otherwise demonstrates its understanding that Appellants were subject to the rolling provision relative to replacement parts that they did not actually manufacture, aud that such understanding was a necessary underpinning to the finding of factual controversies related to the application of the GARA repose scheme. <em>See Pridgen, </em>No. 4008, July Term, 2001, <em>slip op. </em>at 4, 6-8.</p>

Appellees' concern with repetitive appellate review is ameliorated by the narrowing of the present appeal as of right to central legal issues, and the application of sound jurisprudential principles, such as the law of the case doctrine, in any subsequent appeal. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

We are aware of the recent decision in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Hartzell Propeller, Inc., </em><a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">454 F.3d 163</a> (3d Cir.2006), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a summary judgment order finding material issues of disputed fact in the application of GARA’s misrepresentation, concealment and withholding exception did not qualify for interlocutory appellate review as of right under the federal collateral order doctrine. Certain aspects of our decision here reflect a respectful disagreement with the Third Circuit's reasoning, particularly as concerns the weight that our respective courts have attached to the Congressional intent to ameliorate litigation costs (as opposed to merely creating a defense to liability) via a federal statute of repose applicable to the aviation industry. <em>Compare supra </em>at 421-23, 905 A.2d at 433, <em>with Robinson, </em><a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">454 F.3d at 173</a>. Significantly, however, our rationale aligns with other aspects of the Third Circuit’s dispositive reasoning, as the Court of Appeals expressly rested its holding on the fact that the appeal in <em>Robinson </em>did not raise a question of law, but rather, merely represented a challenge the district court's decision that material factual issues were in dispute concerning GARA's misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding exception. <em>See <a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/454/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="454 F.3d 163" data-case-ids="5560559" data-case-paths="/f3d/454/0163-01">at 173-74</a>. Here, we have found that the present challenge to the common pleas court's summary judgment orders centers on dispositive legal issues arising from the court’s opinion; indeed, the common pleas court has not yet made a determination in this case concerning whether there are material facts in dispute regarding the misrepresentation, concealment, and withholding exception.</p>
