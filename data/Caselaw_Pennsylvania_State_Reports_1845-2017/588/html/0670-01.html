PennDOT cites a litany of statistics to show the overwhelming danger posed by drunk drivers. This Court is well aware of the horrific cost to society due to drunk driving. We agree that part, if not all, of the reasoning behind a license suspension is: (1) that a drunk driver has shown himself or herself unfit to be trusted on the road; and (2) to protect the public at large.

      <em>Freundt </em>construed Section 1532(c) of the Vehicle Code, imposing suspensions based on a driver’s “conviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, delivery, offering for sale or giving away of any controlled substance.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(c). A majority of the Court found that the words “conviction of any offense” in this statutory provision should be read to encompass larger criminal episodes involving numerous convictions for separate offenses. <em>See <a href="/pa/503/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="503 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1785955" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0190-01">id. </a></em><a href="/pa/503/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="503 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1785955" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0190-01">at 291</a>, <a href="/a2d/883/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="883 A.2d 503" data-case-ids="8908231,988570" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/0503-01,/pa/584/0283-01">883 A.2d 503</a> 883 A.2d at 507 (“[A]n offense, for purposes [75 Pa.C.S.] § 1532(c) amounts to a criminal episode.”). The <em>Freundt </em>majority reasoned that the use of both of the words “conviction” and “offense” in conjunction “shows that the statute imposes a suspension <em>not merely for each conviction for every violation </em>of the Crimes Code, but for each conviction stemming from a criminal episode.” <em>Freundt, </em><a href="/pa/584/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="584 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="988570" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0283-01">584 Pa. 283</a>, 883 A.2d at 506 (emphasis added).

      <em>Freundt’s </em>logic that “offense” meant “single criminal episode” and not “violation” cannot be transported to Sections <a id="p690" href="#p690" data-label="690" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*690</a>1532(a) and (a.l), because the Legislature was even more explicit in those sections in targeting violations. For example, Section 1532(a.1) requires a three-year suspension by Penn-DOT upon its receipt of a certified record of the driver’s conviction <em>“based on a violation </em>” of designated offenses. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(a.l) (emphasis added). In delineating the specific violations to which the suspension was to attach, the Legislature specified <em>“[a]ny violation </em>of section 3732 (relating to homicide by vehicle)” and <em>“[a]ny violation </em>of section 3735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while driving under influence).” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(a.l)(l), (2) (emphasis added). Similarly, Section 1532(a) requires PennDOT to impose a one-year suspension of operating privileges upon receipt of a certified record of conviction based on <em>“[a]ny violation” </em>of statutory provisions including aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1532(a) (emphasis added). <em>Per force, Freundt’s </em>rationale that the Legislature was not addressing specific violations because it utilized different terminology cannot stand in the context of a statute that explicitly targets “violations.”</p>
    <p id="b904-4" data-blocks='[["BL_904.4",904,[276,1429,1160,365]]]'>In summary, I did not find the majority rationale from <em>Freundt </em>persuasive in the context in which it arose, and I find it even less persuasive here. Further, I agree with Madame Justice Newman that the present majority’s decision to ascribe criminal-sentence-like merger to the administrative suspension context finds no support in the statute or in any decision of this Court.</p>
