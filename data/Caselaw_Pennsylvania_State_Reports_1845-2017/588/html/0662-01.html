    <p id="b877-4" data-blocks='[["BL_877.4",877,[143,466,1154,728]]]'>This matter involves the Driver’s License Compact, 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 1581-1586, in particular suspension of a driver’s license based upon a driving under the influence (DUI) offense and conviction in the state of New York. Appellant Barnas was charged in New York with DUI on September 23, 2003, and convicted of that offense in New York on February 13, 2004, his first DUI conviction. Subsequently, Barnas was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT) that his driver’s license would be suspended for one year due to the New York conviction. This case turns on whether Barnas’ driver’s license should be suspended pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3804 based on the date the DUI <em>conduct </em>occurred, or the date of the <em>conviction </em>based on that conduct.</p>
    <p id="b877-5" data-blocks='[["BL_877.5",877,[144,1225,1154,1007]]]'>Pennsylvania’s DUI law changed between the date of Barnas’ DUI conduct and the date of his conviction with the enactment of Act 24 of 2003. Effective September 30, 2003, after Barnas’ DUI conduct, the minimum blood alcohol content (BAC) required for a DUI violation pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 3802(a) was reduced from .10% to .08%. The New York driving under the influence statute under which Appellant Barnas was convicted was similar to the current .08% blood alcohol content provision in 75 Pa.C.S. § 3801(a). Effective February 1, 2004, 75 Pa.C.S. § 3804 established new graduated levels of penalties based in part on BAC levels. Pursuant to § 3804 revised by Act 24 of 2003, there is no suspension of a driver’s license for a first time conviction where the driver’s BAC was at least .08% but less than .10%. Therefore, as of the date of Barnas’ conviction, the statutes in effect would not require that his driver’s license be suspended because his conviction was a first DUI conviction and his BAC was at least .08%, but less than .10%. As of the date of his offense, the statutes in effect required suspension for a first offense.</p>

In <em>Schrankel, </em>the licensee was arrested on suspicion of DUI in 1995 in Ohio. The Driver’s License Compact did not become effective in Pennsylvania until December 1996. The licensee was convicted in Ohio in March 1997. Ohio reported the conviction to Pennsylvania pursuant to the Driver’s License Compact. As in the instant case, the issue was whether the date of <em>conduct </em>or date of <em>conviction </em>should be used in determining whether a Pennsylvania statute applies. In <em>Schrankel, </em>the question was whether the language of the Driver’s License Compact concerned the conduct date or the conviction date.
