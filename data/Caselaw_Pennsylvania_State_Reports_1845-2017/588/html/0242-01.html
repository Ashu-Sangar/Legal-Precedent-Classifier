Fuller held a significant first mortgage on the property in the amount of $3,075,850.00 and later granted WBF a $300,000.00 line of credit secured by a second mortgage. WBF planned to build a planned residential development (PRD) of 1,488 residential units. Before taking title, WBF entered into a joint venture agreement with Lanid Corporation (Lanid), a New Jersey developer that had successfully constructed twelve planned residential communities <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>at other locations. Lanid was to supply seed money and $250,000.00, at the time it entered the joint venture. WBF was obligated to raise $1,700,000.00, and then, if Lanid chose to continue the joint venture after five years, Lanid was obligated to supply approximately $1,700,000.00. By early 1994, WBF and Lanid obtained zoning changes and approvals from two of the three townships in which the property is located, and WBF spent considerable sums on development costs including retaining architects, engineers, and designers for the project.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.4",463,[127,831,1156,1157]]]'>In January of 1994, the Airport Authority publicly announced the proposed expansion of the Airport, which involved acquiring approximately 1,500 acres located north of the Airport. The 1,500 acres included the property of WBF in its entirety. Following the announcement and attendant publicity, the Airport Authority began acquiring properties within the 1,500-acre expansion area. These acquisitions also received considerable publicity. It did not seek to acquire the WBF property, but did acquire nine properties immediately adjoining the WBF property. Because of the announcement and the acquisition of properties by the Airport Authority, Lanid terminated its joint venture agreement with WBF prior to its required infusion of funds, and WBF was unable to attract new investors due to the imminent condemnation of its property. WBF, which had been financially sound prior to the announced airport expansion, could not move forward with its development project due to lack of funding. WBF subsequently defaulted on its first and second mortgages. The mortgagee, Fuller, filed a successful foreclosure action in June of 1997. In September of 1997, the property was listed for upset tax sale, but WBF was able to pay the 1995 taxes to avert the sale.</p>

      <em>Conroy-Prugh Glass, supra, </em>is closely analogous to the present matter in that extensive publicity regarding the construction of a parkway resulted in the property owner losing substantial revenues from tenants in its building to the point where it was no longer able to meet operating expenses and faced the loss of the property. The property owner was unable to rent out its property because tenants feared the impending condemnation. The property owner petitioned for the appointment of a board of viewers pursuant to Section 502(e), 26 P.S. § l-502(e), even though the Commonwealth filed no formal declaration of taking. This Court reasoned that, because the publicity generated by the Commonwealth had deprived the property owner of substantially all of the use of his property, a <em>de facto </em>condemnation had occurred. Here, the Airport Authority made a public announcement of its expansion plans, and the property needed for the expansion clearly included the property of WBF. As a result of the announcement, WBF lost a funding partner in its development project, was unable to find alternate investors to fund the project, and ultimately faced the loss of the property due to its inability to develop it. This is the same scenario presented in <em>Conroy-Prugh Glass </em>where we found that a <em>de facto </em>taking had occurred and that to hold otherwise would deprive a property owner of her property without due process of law. <em>Conroy-Prugh Glass, </em>821 A.2d at 602.</p>

WBF valued the property at $17,000,000.00 and indicated that the outstanding mortgages totaled approximately $9,000,000.00. Section 1-609 of the Eminent Domain Code provides that, “[w]here proceedings are instituted by a condemnee under section 502(e), a judgment awarding compensation to the condemnee for the taking of property shall include reimbursement of ... other costs and expenses actually incurred.” 26 P.S. § 1-609 (emphasis supplied). Therefore, WBF is entitled to all mortgage interest from the date of taking to the date of the EJC payment, plus all mortgage interest from the date of EJC payment to the date of the award that it has actually incurred. Obviously, the mortgage principle must be adjusted to reflect the EJC payment to Fuller, which will also result in a payment recalculation. However, we believe that WBF is also <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>entitled to mortgage interest incurred by it from the date of the award to the date of award payment. The Airport Authority paid EJC of $3.5 million on November 2, 2000, and tendered the money to Fuller as mortgage holder, ostensibly to reduce the principal amount of the mortgage. However, payment of EJC by the Airport Authority did not fairly reflect the value of the property or the amount of existing liens sufficient to relieve it of the obligation to reimburse WBF for mortgage interest continuing after that date as a component of damages. There would have been no need for WBF to pay mortgage interest if the Airport Authority had acknowledged a taking of the WBF property when it publicly announced the airport expansion and began acquiring by condemnation the properties surrounding that of WBF. The failure of the Airport Authority to file for the condemnation required WBF to initiate proceedings pursuant to Section 502(e). During Section 502(e) proceedings, ownership of the property is placed at issue. Pursuant to Section 402, 26 P.S. § 1-402, title passes to the condemnor after a taking, but title remains with the property owner until the court decides whether a taking has occurred in a Section 502(e) proceeding.</p>

Section 609 contemplates payment of all costs and expenses actually incurred, rather than only those related to the condemnation proceedings as directed by Section 408, and presumes the entire course of the litigation as its terminal point. The Commonwealth Court clearly erred when it departed from the principles established in <em>Gross </em>in concluding that WBF’s entitlement to interest ceased on the date that the Airport Authority tendered its EJC, and we reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court with respect to this portion of its decision.</p>

WBF argues that permitting the Airport Authority to present additional evidence on the highest and best use for the property is contrary to well-established principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and the law of the case. It remarks that Judge Gardner based his ruling on a voluminous record, with both parties having a full and fair opportunity to litigate that issue, and that his determination that a PRD constitutes the highest and best use is pivotal to his conclusion that a <em>defacto </em>taking occurred. WBF asserts that a final and conclusive finding of the highest and best use by the trial court in a <em>de facto </em>taking case should be binding in the damages portion of the litigation involving the same parties and the same property. It notes that this Court has not previously addressed this issue and argues that the view of the Commonwealth Court on this matter is a substantial departure from well-established principles of finality of rulings and findings.</p>

Before Judge McGinley, the Airport Authority argued that it was error to hold that it was precluded from discovery and presenting evidence on the issue of highest and best use. It counters that Judge McGinley was not bound by the November 3, 2000 Order of Judge Gardner because it was erroneous.

Preliminary objections raised by the condemnee pursuant to the strictures of Section 407 do not permit a challenge or determination of highest and best use.

She proffered as her only reasoning that a trial judge has the discretion to determine what evidence is admissible at trial. The actual issue, the highest and best use of the property, was the same in both instances, and the highest and best use of property for purposes of ascertaining a taking is the same as the highest and best use for purposes of setting the fair market value.

Unfortunately, years may elapse between the date of the announcement and the project’s consummation. Even the final plan may differ substantially from that originally disclosed as public opinion (and opposition) is tested. However, consideration must be afforded to those whose property is placed in the fish bowl and entrapped in the mire of public and political bickering. Thus, when a public entity, acting in furtherance of a public project, directly and substantially interferes with property rights and, thereby, significantly impairs the value of the property, the result is a taking and compensation must be paid. When public hearings and resultant publicity cause the owner of a commercial property to lose investors to such an extent that there is a threatened loss of the property, that property owner has a right to the appointment of viewers to award it compensation for its property. Concomitantly, the loss of property is the greatest deprivation a landowner can suffer, far exceeding loss of profits or diminution of the meaningful, beneficial use of the property. Although a sum of money equivalent to estimated fair market value does not provide the perfect yardstick with which to measure the worth of a landowner’s property, the condemning authority must seek, as nearly as possible, to replace the land that has been earmarked for public use with equivalent public funds. Here, WBF was unable to proceed with its development, remained without a market for its land, but was still required to make its mortgage payments.

Although some individuals will attempt to take advantage of a condemnation, the fact remains that the owner is unable to dispose of the property while under the threat of condemnation and is forced to continue mortgage payments that would otherwise terminate had the condemnation been declared by the condemning authority and just compensation tendered. In the majority of instances, the mortgage lien will predate the threat or occurrence of condemnation. In those instances where a mortgage is obtained after a <em>de facto </em>condemnation arises, such as where the property owner must secure a mortgage rather than lose the property to a tax sale or otherwise, the purpose for the mortgage can be scrutinized.

      <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>Regarding Part I of the majority opinion and the issue of delay compensation, at the outset, I would treat the issue as narrower than the question considered and resolved by the majority. In the relevant portion of its brief as the appellant in this case, the Airport Authority takes as settled the proposition that there was a constitutionally significant <em>de facto </em>taking as of September 30, 1996, the date on which WBF Associates filed its petition for appointment of a board of viewers. Presumably, it does so as the issue was the subject of a prior appeal in which WBF Associates prevailed, <em>see Lehigh-Northampton Airport Auth. v. WBF Assoc., L.P., </em><a href="/a2d/728/0981-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="728 A.2d 981" data-case-ids="11627826" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0981-01">728 A.2d 981</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1999), and this Court did not accept that appeal for further review. <em>See In re Lehigh-Northampton Airport Auth., </em><a href="/citations/?q=560%20Pa.%20751" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="560 Pa. 751">560 Pa. 751</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=747%20A.2d%20372" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="747 A.2d 372">747 A.2d 372</a> (1999) <em>(per curiam). </em>Thus, the Airport Authority expressly frames the relevant question as whether a condemnee’s entitlement to delay compensation under Section 611 of the Eminent Domain Code may start on a date sometime after a <em>de facto </em>taking. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 4. The framing of the issue in the majority opinion, however, appears to effectively subsume the question presented in the initial appeal, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 254-55, 903 A.2d at 1199 (“The threshold issue before is what constitutes the date of taking for purposes of computing delay damages.”), and the majority’s analysis on the merits seems to revisit and approve the Commonwealth Court’s holding in that regard. <em>See, e.g., </em>Majority Opinion, 588 Pa. at 257-58, 903 A.2d at 1201 (“This is the same scenario presented in <em>Conroy-Prugh Glass </em>where we found that a <em>de facto </em>taking had occurred and that to hold otherwise would deprive a property owner of her property without due process of law.”).</p>

Mortgage expenses are not created by or connected to the condemnation of that property; in fact, the initial proceeds of a mortgage may or may not relate to the encumbered property itself — proceeds may be used for any purpose at all, not just the acquisition or improvement of the property encumbered. The obligation to repay the mortgage is required only because of the terms of the mortgage itself, not by reason of the condemnation. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20581" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="160 A. 581">id.</a> </em>While the ability to repay mortgage interest may be affected by the taking, that does not convert mortgage interest itself into part of the “costs and expenses” caused by the condemnation.</p>
