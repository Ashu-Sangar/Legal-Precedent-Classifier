An involuntary severance “requires an act which effectively divests the joint tenant’s interest, such as an attachment execution on a joint tenancy, or an assignment in trust or by judgment and execution.... ” <em>Sheridan v. Lucey, </em><a href="/pa/395/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="395 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1282736" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0306-01">395 Pa. 306</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=149%20A.2d%20444" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="149 A.2d 444">149 A.2d 444</a>, 445-46 (1959) (citation omitted). A voluntary severance, such as is alleged here, occurs when one of the joint tenants takes affirmative steps to create a tenancy in common. For example, “[a] joint tenant may obtain a severance or separation of the property or a decree granting partition and obtain thereby an undivided fee interest in one-half of the property.” <em>In re Estate of Larendon, </em><a href="/pa/439/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="439 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="1931030" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0535-01">439 Pa. 535</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20763" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="266 A.2d 763">266 A.2d 763</a>, 766 (1970). “[Although a voluntary act on the part of one of the joint tenants is adequate to work a severance, that act must be of sufficient manifestation that the actor is unable to retreat from his position of creating a severance of the joint tenancy.” <em>Sheridan, </em>at 446; <em>see also Clingerman v.

As the trial court observed, the record is devoid of any action by either Bean or Quick which would signify the intent to destroy the joint tenancy. Trial Court Opinion, 11/9/01, at 22. The separate dates on which the leases were signed is not determinative, for the parties may very well have intended to execute the leases contemporaneously. The same corporation was seeking the gas and oil rights, and obviously knew the permission of both tenants was needed before drilling could begin. Both leases were executed in favor of the same party, and neither was recorded until the other was signed — both were recorded on the same day. Both were simultaneously assigned to the same third party. The difference of execution dates of the oil and gas leases by the geographically distant owners does not evince an intent to sever the JTWROS. This is not a situation where each tenant changed the use of the property without the other’s agreement. The difference in dates of the leases is simply not the definitive factor it might be in other scenarios.</p>

Fax machines had not attained ubiquity in 1979, and overnight mail delivery was not then a routine means of sending business documents. Teleconferencing and the like, a staple today, was not the norm 27 years ago. Simultaneous signings by parties 1500 miles apart could not be expected, and more importantly, it was not legally significant, as nothing happened until both leases were executed. Taken in the context of technology and business practices in 1979, the time separating the execution of the leases is not indicative of differing visions of the owners, much less a desire to fundamentally alter the way the two held title.</p>

The only difference in the two leases — an additional single type-written clause in the Bean lease — is hardly determinative of an intention to sever the JTWROS. The clause states the lessor agreed to take “full responsibility” for questions of ownership and “disbursements” — what “responsibility for questions” means is anyone’s guess, but there is no reason to guess that it had anything to do with the way Bean wanted to hold title.

Further, the leases were not signed on the same day; instead, they were signed three months apart. This leads me to conclude that the leases were separate from each other and, as a result, failed to meet the essence of a JTWROS, which is four unities: interest, title, time, and possession. <em>Gen.

Although it recognizes that the Bean lease contained an additional clause not found in the Quick lease, the Majority concludes that what that clause means “is anyone’s guess, but there is no reason to guess that it had anything to do with the way Bean wanted to hold title. The extra clause is so vague and ambiguous as to be meaningless, and is no basis for finding the leases are really different at all....” Majority Opinion at 494, 905 A.2d at 476 (emphasis added). I find the reasoning of the Majority to be internally inconsistent and curious, at best. First, the Majority states that it is impossible to discern what the clause means; nevertheless, despite this impossibility of interpretation, the Majority concludes that the clause cannot have “anything to do with the way Bean wanted to hold title.” <em>Id. </em>Next, the Majority finds that the additional clause, which could mean anything or nothing, is “so vague and ambiguous as to be meaningless.” Finally, the Majority posits that the impossibility of interpreting the clause means that the two leases are not “really different.”</p>

Although the language could have been crafted more artfully, the fact is that the Bean lease includes a: substantive obligation that the Quick lease does not. The lease is different because of the additional clause, and the Majority merely speculates that it is “meaningless” in order to reach its preordained conclusion that the difference is of no import. The terms of the obligation contained in the clause encumbered Bean with full liability for any dispute relating to property ownership or royalty payments. This disparity, rather than being meaningless, plainly involves important legal obligations.</p>

The Majority then proceeds to analyze the intent of the parties in executing the leases and notes that the record does not contain evidence demonstrating that the parties intended to destroy the joint tenancy. While the record was silent with respect to evidence indicating the parties’ intent to sever the tenancy, the Majority fills in the gap by surmising that “the parties may very well have intended to execute the leases contemporaneously.” <em>Id. </em>at 6, <a href="/pa-super/415/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="415 Pa.

The unity of time was destroyed by the three-month gap between the parties’ signing of the leases. Thus, after Robert Bean leased his interest to Gerrie, both Robert Bean and Robert Quick owned undivided one-half interests in the property as tenants in common.
