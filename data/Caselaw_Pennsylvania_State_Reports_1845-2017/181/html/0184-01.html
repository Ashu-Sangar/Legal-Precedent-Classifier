    <p class="summary" id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.12",207,[182,900,1165,456]]]'>The walk in question was out of repair and had been in an unsafe condition for a long time, as appears clearly from the evidence, and sufficient time had elapsed to visit the borough officials with constructive notice as also appears. The evidence of the plaintiff’s intoxication was very slight, and there was very little, if anything, to warrant a jury in finding that he was guilty of contributory negligence by reason of the manner in which he passed over this boardwalk. So there can be no complaint of the jury having found with him on those questions.</p>

There was no pavement on the opposite side of the street over which he could have gone. He could have avoided this pavement only by taking the wagon road around it. Had the danger been apparent to him this would, of course, have been his duty. Whilst he knew that the material of which the walk had been constructed was more or less rotten, and that some of the boards had become loosened, yet it does not appear that there was manifest danger in attempting its passage. The walk had been in this condition for a long time. Others had been constantly using it and no accidents had occurred, so far as we know. The boards were in place and there was nothing to indicate to the plaintiff that he could not safely pass over it, as he had clone many times before. We do not understand that it is, under all circumstances, the duty oí a pedestrian to go out of his way to avoid a defective pavement. Such is unquestionably the rule where the danger is apparent. Where, however, as in this case, the <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>risk is not obvious, it becomes a question of fact for tbe determination of the jury whether or not there is contributory negligence in the attempted passage.</p>

But it is contended that the evidence of plaintiffs contributory negligence was such as to make it the duty of the court to withdraw the case from the jury by directing a verdict for defendant. This position is untenable. While there was some testimony tending to show that plaintiff failed to exercise that degree of care that an ordinarily prudent man would have done in the circumstances, it was clearly for the consideration of the jury, and to them it was rightly submitted. The state of the evidence was not such as would have justified the court in declaring as matter of law that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The questions involved were both questions of fact which the jury alone could legally determine; and they were accordingly submitted to them with substantially correct and adequate instructions. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
