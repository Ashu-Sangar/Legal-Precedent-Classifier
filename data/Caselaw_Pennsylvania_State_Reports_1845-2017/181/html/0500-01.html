They formerly and for a great many years lived in Renovo, Penna., where they accumulated considerable property — consisting entirely of real estate, excepting the household goods and furniture of the family. The proceeds of the sale of this real estate comprise the fund now for distribution. The legal title •to this real estate was taken in the name of Nancy Hogan, the wife, with the exception of one property. This merely happened so. There was no reason for it particularly. At the time of the several purchases Edward Hogan was solvent, and his money or earnings paid for all the property purchased in Renovo. He was a contractor or mechanic, principally employed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. By virtue of this employment he was continually away from his home and had little of the oversight of his property. On this account, as well as for other reasons, probabty, the entire management and care of the family and property fell to the lot of Nancy Hogan.’ It is a fact fully established, and so found by the auditor, that on this account Nancy Hogan became the purchasing agent of that family. She looked after all the property, made all contracts for repairs, contracted all bills, whether for necessaries or otherwise, and it is possible, became the head of the family in all respects. Having been given full sweep to contract debts, she appears to have exhausted her credit in Renovo and the family moved to Lock Haven.

It is nowhere claimed by the evidence or in the argument of counsel that there was any indebtedness due jointly to Daniel Hogan and Edward Gallagher.

McCormick, Esq., at a time when he was being consulted and requested to accept the office of assignee, and upon the eve of an assignment for the benefit of creditors. It is not claimed, or at least not a fact, that the amount of this note was determined upon any written evidences of indebtedness. There were no notes produced at the-time, and no other evidences of indebtedness'. It is now claimed that the plaintiffs in this judgment had given to the Hogan family at different times checks and money which would aggregate the amount fixed in the note. But there is no allegation on the part of either Daniel Hogan or Edward Gallagher that at the time the money was given there was any promise to repay it. It was a gift between relatives. There was no promise to repay, no note taken as an evidence of indebtedness, and in fact no debt contracted to be paid at the time any of these donations were made. Daniel Hogan is candid about the matter. He does, not allege that there was any promise to pay any of these sums at the time they were given. He testified: “ I never kept any account with the exception of what I had in a diary. ... I always gave my money to my father and mother until I was married. They always said that all would be mine sometime, or something to that effect. . . . Nothing more than what my father always told me, that I helped to support the family and that I would come in for the property. It will be yours. . . .

It was not such an agreement or understanding as would substantiate a debt. Then when we couple with this the fact that Daniel’s parents, in 1884 or 1885, deeded a house and lot in Renovo to him, which he swears was worth about $600, there is good reason to believe that these payments of money made by him to his parents were gifts and not loans. On December 2, 1892, he did loan to his parents the sum of $400, 'and took a judgment for the same to No. 97, January term, 1893. This was only ten days before the <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>giving of tbe large note, and if his parents owed him at that time a so much larger sum of money he would naturally have taken a judgment for the whole amount, because it was then apparent, or must have been, that his parents were insolvent. This is a circumstance not material in itself, but it goes, as the auditor thinks, to the bona tides of the transaction of the large judgment. In relation to the claim of Daniel Hogan, his father testifies that Daniel frequently gave his mother, Nancy Hogan, money, but says, I don’t know whether they were gifts or loans. But he never loaned his father any money excepting $100, unless it might be trifles. Mrs. Nancy Hogan is not called in support of this large judgment.</p>

In this connection it is proper to state that the auditor finds as a fact that the $400 judgment of Daniel Hogan was meant to be included in the larger judgment of $2,500, and that the testimony of S.

Hogan and wife executed and acknowledged a mortgage before James H. Ferguson, a notary public of Eenovo, Penna., on April 5, 1889, for a contemplated loan of $1,800, upon a lot of ground owned by Nancy Hogan in her own right. The given name of Schroeder, as well as the penal and just sum were left blank. In no place in the mortgage where an amount was to be filled in, was an amount written by Ferguson, who acted as the scrivener. These blanks were all left to be filled up when the mortgage came to the lender. Mrs. Nancy Hogan brought this mortgage to the residence of Mrs. Schroeder, and there in the presence of Nancy Hogan and Elizabeth Schroeder, and with <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>the full knowledge and consent of both, William F. Schrader, Esq., filled in the amounts, terms and conditions of the loan, and it was well understood by all of the parties. It is true .that he included a former judgment to be collaterally secured by this mortgage, but that judgment was the first lien against all of the real estate of both Edward and Nancy Hogan, and was at the time an ample security and protection for the former loan of $1,000. In this transaction the auditor finds as a fact there was neither fraud nor wrongdoing of any kind practiced upon the Hogans. It is true that interest for one year at the rate of ten per cent on both the $1,000 loan and the $1,800 loan was deducted from the amount at that time paid or loaned to Mrs. Hogan, but these amounts haye been credited on this mortgage and will so appear in the distribution. The interlineation was clearly a mistake of the party filling in the blanks, and has been explained by him to the satisfaction of the auditor. If it had been an intention to change the amount of the mortgage from eighteen to twenty-eight hundred dollars, the same thing would haye occurred in filling in the amount on the last page of the instrument where the amount is plainly and clearly “ Twenty-eight hundred dollars.”</p>

S. McCormick, Esq., but whether in his own behalf or at the instance of the plaintiffs in the Gallagher and Hogan judgment, the auditor cannot say. Nancy and Edward Hogan and the plaintiffs in that judgment seemed to be so closely connected together through all the hearings that the auditor is unable to separate them in this instance. Surely the fact is lost sight of in this request, that Mr. McCormick did ask Mr.. Hogan in chief the question whether he had signed more than one mortgage in the presence of Mr. Stevenson. To this he replied as follows: A. “No sir, nor in the presence of anybody, only the one to Mrs. Schrader and this,” (meaning the Jas. A Wensel mortgage). After this it was that he was cross-examined by Mr. Hippie in regard to the Grugan mortgages. Mr. Hogan was not called by the attorney for the Grugan estate as for cross-examination. In this connection the auditor finds as a fact that at the time of the taking of this testimony of Edward Hogan that Coleman Grugan, the mortgagee and claimant, was dead, <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>and had been for some considerable time before that.

In legal proceedings it is never assumed that one man is creditor of another. The law provides a way for the determination of such rights, and the party asserting a claim against another, stands in the attitude of a claimant merely, until in some appropriate judicial proceeding his claim has been established. The process does not create the relation of debtor and creditor, but it declares it, so that it is no longer disputable. Until judg<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>ment has been obtained, or a specific lien acquired, it cannot be definitely known that the claimant is a creditor. This, as we understand, is the reason of the rule, which obtains generally restricting the right of contest in such cases to those whose claims are in judgment, or who have a specific lien upon the fund. ... A creditor by simple contract is within the protection of the statute as much as a creditor by judgment, but until he has a judgment and a lien, or a right to a lien upon the specific property he is not in condition to assert his rights as a creditor.”</p>

In support of this proposition the counsel cites the case of Moore v.

There are no erasures or alterations in the bond accompanying the mortgage, and the erasure of the amount in every one of the blanks in the mortgage, shows conclusively that it was a clerical error. “ A person who offers in evidence a bond with erasures and alterations upon its face, is bound to explain the erasures and alterations to the satisfaction of the jury: ” Nesbitt v.

Moore, vol. 29, No. 9, National Reporter, 1032, the execution of a mortgage with the consideration in blank at the time the mortgage was executed and delivered to the plaintiff (mortgagee), it was held by the Supreme Court of New York that the plaintiff became the agent for the defendants to fill in the amount, and that as it was not filled up fraudulently, it was a <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>valid instrument and binding against the mortgagors. Edward Hogan was not the principal in the mortgage. It was to become a lien against the separate real estate of Nancy Hogan, and she was present and acquiesced in the amount for which it was given. There was no fraudulent amount inserted in it, and the usury having been credited upon it, it comes exactly within the ruling in the case last cited.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[172,1003,1173,1171]]]'>The auditor finds as a fact that Edward Plogan was not called by or in the interest of Coleman Grugan’s estate and was therefore not a competent witness to deny the validity of a lien regular upon its face and upon the records. Judgment was entered on the Anderson bond, and that judgment stands unattacked and unimpeached. The only persons competent to do this were Edward and Nancy Hogan, and their only mode was by an applicati on to the court in which the judgment was entered. These mortgages were duly recorded, and so stand to this day. Neither Nancy Hogan nor Edward Hogan attacks them, and neither would be competent as witnesses to do so, because of the death of Coleman Grugan. It is not alleged that either is fraudulent, and therefore they cannot be attacked collaterally. A mortgage, with duly certified acknowledgment, and duly recorded, cannot thus be collaterally or inferentially attacked or impeached. It is not even argued or intimated that Nancy Hogan had not duly executed and acknowledged these mortgages, and that the mortgagees or one of them, had not received all the money called for therein. Consequently, these parties are estopped, or at least Nancy Hogan is, from setting up that the mortgages are irregular, or were not properly acknowledged. Equity will not allow them, or either of them, to receive money and not repay it: Adam v. Mengel, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.%20606" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 A. 606">8 Atl.

If in such a case an issue be not demanded, or be waived, the question whether the judgment was collusive, and therefore void as to creditors defrauded thereby, is a proper one for the auditor’s determination. “ An auditor is not always bound therefore to distribute to the liens as they appear on the records. A collusive judgment may be attacked before him, and in the absence of a proper application for an issue, that question is one for his determination.” This doctrine is laid down in Meckley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0536-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="102 Pa. 536" data-case-ids="502707" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0536-01">102 Pa. 536</a>, and the numerous cases there cited.

Douglass, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20415" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="62 Pa. 415">62 Pa. 415</a>, that a judgment confessed voluntarily by an insolvent or an indebted man for more than is due is prima facie fraudulent within the statute of 13 Elizabeth, C. It follows that the burden of proof is upon defendants and creditors in whose favor such judgment is confessed, to overcome this presumption by competent proof, and show the judgment is not fraudulent. In the present case, this presumption arises against the $2,500 judgment, which was clearly shown to be for more than due, (1) to Gallagher and Hogan jointly, or (2) to either Gallagher and Hogan individually, or (3) to both together for separate or individual accounts. The presumption of a fraudulent judgment was not overcome by any proof, but was in fact rather strengthened. “Although a judgment to cover existing liability, the amount of which is unascertained, may not be fraudulent as to other creditors because of being for more than may actually prove to be owing; yet it may become fraudulent by being sought to be enforced for more than is actually due or owing.”</p>
