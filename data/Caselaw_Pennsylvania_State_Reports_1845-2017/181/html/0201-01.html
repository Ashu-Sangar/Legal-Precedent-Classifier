There was no evidence that the defendant had employed the agent of the association as his agent for the purpose of executing the mortgage, and he denied knowledge of its execution; but after the execution of the mortgage, on information that the loan had been secured and the ground rent paid, he made payments to the building and loan association on account of his shares and on account of interest. <em>Held, </em>that a .verdict and judgment for the defendant should be sustained.</p>

The defendant denies that he ought to pay the mortgage, alleging that it is a forgery. He has testified here that he did not sign the mortgage — did not put his mark to it — and never authorized anybody to put his mark to it. He has testified that he did not acknowledge it, and that <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>he never saw it and had no knowledge of it until long after the date which it bears. The building association contends, in the first place, that the circumstances surrounding the case led to the belief that Walton, the defendant, did sign the mortgage, or did execute it by his mark, and in the second place, that even if he did not, his subsequent acts were such as to make the mortgage binding on him whether it was forgery or not— that is-to say, whether his mark was put to it by somebody else or not.' [I say to you as a matter of law that if you find that the mortgage is a forged instrument, no act of Walton’s thereafter could make that mortgage binding on him, the policy of the law being opposed to the ratification of a forgery.] [1] As to the question: Did Walton make this mortgage or not, I am going to review the testimony briefly, and leave that question to you for determination. [Walton, the defendant, attended the meeting of the association in January, 1892, and subscribed for five shares of stock. He bid for a loan on the five shares of stock — that is, he bid for a loan of $1,000. He denies that James E. Magee bid for the loan for him, but Mr. Fay, the secretary, and Mr. Murphy, the solicitor, both swear positively that James E. Magee did bid for that loan for the defendant. Mr. John Magee, the father of James E. Magee, says that previously to the meeting, both the Waltons — father and son— called at the son’s house and spoke to both of them about this loan, and asked the son to apply for the loan for him. To my mind, that testimony has more to do with the credibility of the defendant than it has to do with the merits of this controversy otherwise.] [2]</p>

Subsequently James E. Magee produced the paper here in evidence, and it bearing upon its face evidence of being authentic — that is, being regularly acknowledged before a notary public, Mr. James E. Magee being a notary public, being signed by a mark, and properly describing the property which was offered to the association — the secretary of the <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>building association drew an order upon the treasurer, in payment of the face of the mortgage. That order was subsequently presented by James E. Magee to his father, and the father paid to James E. Magee nine hundred and eighty odd dollars in a check to the order of James Walton, deducting a small amount, some fifteen dollars and odd cents, for dues then due to the association. [No authority was shown to the treasurer for the payment of the money to James E. Magee, either as attorney or agent for Walton, the defendant.] [3] [At asubseqent meeting, according to the testimony of Mr. Fay and Mr. Murphy— and they are both positive on this point — Mr. Walton objected to the payment of a certain sum, stating that when he settled with James E. Magee, Magee had deducted that particular sum of money from the sum of money coming to Walton, and that he ought not to pay that particular sum of money to the association. Those points are proper for your consideration upon the question as to whether Walton did or did not sign the mortgage. They are not proper for your consideration upon the question of whether they amounted to a ratification of the mortgage.] [4]</p>

Magee’s office some time after-wards, and Magee informed Mm that he had secured the money from the association, and with it he had paid off the ground rent upon Walton’s property. Walton says that in the belief that the ground rent had been paid off, and that he owed the money to the association, he went to the association and he paid for twenty months. He says eighteen months, but the books show twenty months. He paid regularly his five dollars per month on five shares, and his five- dollars interest per month on a thousand dollars, which would be the regular monthly interest upon $1,000, at the legal rate of interest. He continued those payments until August, 1893. August, 1893, is the time when James E. Magee disappeared. According to Mr. Walton’s testimony, August, 1893 is the time when the ground rent landlord sent him the first bill he had received since January, 1892, for ground rent upon the property described in the mortgage. Then ascertaining, upon the receipt of that bill for ground rent amounting to $81.00 for eighteen months, that Mr. James E. Magee had not paid off the ground rent, he made inquiries and <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>ascertained that the ground rent had not been paid, and his counsel, taking a look at the mortgage, discovered that it was a forgery, and that he then, for the first time, learned that his property was encumbered by a mortgage to the building association.</p>

The right to avoid a contract on the ground of fraud is a privilege given to the injured party for his own protection, and it maybe waived; but he cannot give validity to an illegal contract. The earlier cases which held that all contracts vitiated by fraud are insusceptible of confirmation are in effect overruled by Pearsoll v. Chapin, <a href="/pa/44/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="44 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="484287" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0009-01">44 Pa. 9</a>, and Negley v.

Forgery does not admit of ratification. A forger does not act on behalf of, nor profess to represent, the person whose handwriting he counterfeits, and the subsequent adoption of the instrument cannot supply the authority which the forger did not profess to have. “ A forged bond or note obviously wants the essentials of a contract because the intention is not to bring the minds of the obliger and obligee together, but to practice a fraud on both.” Hare on Contracts, p. 285.</p>

There can be no doubt of the correctness of the first part of this instruction, and in view of the evidence the whole of the instruction was free from error. Magee, who committed the fraud, was the accredited agent of the building association, and represented it in the preparation of the mortgage. He may have represented the defendant in other matters, but there was not the slightest evidence of his agency for the purpose of executing the mortgage. Nor was there evidence of any act of the defendant upon which to base an equitable estoppel. The attempt to bring the case within the principle of the decision in Garrett v. Gonter, <a href="/pa/42/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="42 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="481483" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0143-01">42 Pa. 143</a>, that a deed or contract executed by a professed agent acting under a pretended authority may be confirmed, failed for want of proof.</p>
