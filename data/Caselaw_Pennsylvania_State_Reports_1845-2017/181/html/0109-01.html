Windrim, architect, the same to be built under his superintendence, of a granite to be selected by said architect. For his services, I direct that he shall receive as compensation, five per cent upon the- expenditure .for its erection and completion, or, if he be not living, his son John T. Windrim, I next designate to be employed in like manner and in his father’s stead to complete the said works in all particulars ; or, if he be not living, by such architect as the said trustee may select, who will continue to complete the erection of the said monumental memorial in strict accordance with the original design. The model of said design I have approved, and the same is placed in the safe keeping of the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, photographs of which I have approved by my signatures thereon. The said memorial is to include equestrian statues in bronze of Major-Generals George B. McClellan and Winfield S. Hancock and colossal statues in bronze of Major-Generals George G. Meada and John F. Reynolds; the niches in the right and left wings of the design to have pedestals to receive bronze busts of the following distinguished Pennsylvanians, namely: Governor Andrew G. Curtin, Major-General John F. Hartranft, Admirals David D. Porter and John A. Dahlgren, General James A.. Beaver, Major-General S. W. Crawford, and in addition thereto the Architect James H. Windrim and my executor John B. Gest. A mural tablet in bronze will be placed upon the pedestal stage of one of the main columns with the inscription. ‘ This Monumental Arch presented by Richard Smith, Tjqpe Founder, of Philadelphia, in memory of Pennsylvanians who took part in the Civil War, whose strife was not for aggrandizement, but when conflict ceased, the North with the South united, again to enjoy the common heritage left by the fathers of our country, resolving that thereafter all our people should dwell together in unity.’</p>

I would prefer that male children over ten years of age be excluded from said playground and building, so that it may be safely used for the recreation of the young. The building herein provided to be erected must contain a mural tablet in bronze with the inscription lettered thereon ‘ Erected by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Smith in memory of their son Stanfield Smith.’ The number of acres to be enclosed I leave to the discretion of said trustee and the said Park Commissioners.

Smith, appeared and raised the question that the gift <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>for the monumental arch was not a charity, and therefore the bequest to keep the same in repair and good order was void, because it violated the rule against perpetuities. The auditing judge, however, was of opinion, and so adjudicated, that the will of the testator created valid charities, and that even if they should fail by reason of the refusal of the proper authorities to permit the erection of the structures, a cy pres application should be made under the acts of assembly relating to the subject.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b134-4" data-blocks='[["BL_134.4",134,[284,876,1163,96]]]'>Exceptions to adjudication were dismissed, Hanna, P. J., filing the following opinion:</p>

And as they contemplate an indefinite and perpetual retention, accumulation and expenditure of the income, it is a violation of the law against perpetuity, and consequently the testator must be held to have died intestate. But it is too late to suggest such a proposition. The whole current of authorities, remote as well as recent, approve and sustain such a disposition of his estate as is directed by Mr. Smith, and settles the same to be, beyond all dispute, a charitable use. It is true the gift does not provide for the hungry, naked, sick or homeless, nor for the scholastic or scientific education of the general public, but, with an equally exalted benevolence and love for .mankind, has in view, by the foundation <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>of an almost imperishable magnificent memorial, far excelling in beauty any creation of the sculptor’s art heretofore erected within the limits of the park, the pleasure resort of hundreds of thousands of our population, which for generations yet unborn will tend to the elevation and refinement of the people, cultivate a love for the beautiful in art and architecture, and keep alive their patriotism and remembrance of the martial prowess and good deeds in statesmanship and civil life, of heroes, patriots and citizens worthy of perpetuation. And not only this, but furnishes a secure place for the comfort and gratuitous healthful amusement and recreation of young children, amid pure and attractive rural surroundings, removed from the dangers of the streets and contaminated atmosphere of a great city. We cannot conceive of any more strictly charitable use within its legal definition than the purposes and objects contemplated by the testator in this disposition of his large estate. The memorial monument is for the beautifying and adornment of the city, and for these reasons alone the gift would be upheld as charitable. In England such bequests have frequently been sustained. Also those for the establishment of botanical gardens. And the British Museum was also held a public charity. In our own state, in Cresson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/30/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="30 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="415562" data-case-paths="/pa/30/0437-01">30 Pa. 437</a>, the legacy was to the mayor and councils of Philadelphia in trust as a perpetual fund, the income to be annually forever expended in planting and renewing shade trees, and this was held to be a charitable bequest. Without referring particularly to the numerous cases, both in England and in this country, upon the subject, it will suffice to again refer to one of our own authorities — Fire Insurance Patrol v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">120 Pa. 624</a>, where it was held that the insurance patrol, incorporated to save life and property in and contiguous to burning buildings, being without money capital, but supported by voluntary contributions, making and dividing no profits or dividends, etc., is a public charity. Nor does the fact, as was also earnestly contended, that testator directed to be placed upon the main column of the memorial a bronze statue of himself, with his name underneath in large letters, and that the building to be erected as a general hall for a playroom and shelter for children must contain a mural tablet, with the inscription, “ Erected by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Smith, in memory of their son, Stanfield Smith,” detract from the chari<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>table character of the bequest. This question has also been determined, and was settled in Miller v. Porter, <a href="/pa/53/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="53 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1004752" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0292-01">53 Pa. 292</a>, where the testator established by his will a college, to be known as “Porter University,” and in Fire Insurance Patrol v. Boyd, <a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">supra,</a> where Paxson, J., says: “ The motive of the benefactor is of no moment, and is not to be sought after, but the purpose and object of the gift determines its character as religious, charitable, or otherwise.”</p>
    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[279,791,1168,1628]],["BL_137.1",137,[159,365,1167,1227]]]'>But in the view we take, it is scarcely necessary to consider whether the provisions made by testator are valid as charitable uses, for the reason, we think, he had full power and authority to direct the expenditure of his estate as he deemed proper, either for the erection of a monumental memorial, or children’s playhouse, or both, in the park or elsewhere, and to provide for their maintenance as he considered advisable. He left no children or other descendants who were thus deprived of their inheritance and disappointed in their expectations of enjoyment of so large a fortune. Testator was disposing of his own money. This is a right assured to him by law, and restrained only by those enactments and principles of public policy which, for the good order and welfare of society, have been established by the legislature or the courts. Gifts for the erection of monuments and construction of vaults or tombs in cemetery lots, and inclosing the same, and providing for their future care and adornment, together with other similar mortuary gifts, have ever been recognized, and the wishes of the donor or testator carried out by the courts. And, to remove all doubt upon the subject, the legislature, by the Act of May 26, 1891, P. L. 119, expressly declared that no disposition of property hereafter made for the maintenance or care of any cemetery, churchyard, etc., or monument or other erections on or about the same, “ shall fail by reason of such disposition having been made in perpetuity, but shall be held to be made for a charitable use.” Nor are we aware it has ever been suggested that, in the absence of any express statute, the courts will regulate the amount the testator may direct to be thus expended. We see no reason why he may not bequeath his entire estate for such purposes. In Bainbridge’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="97 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="444775" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0482-01">97 Pa. 482</a>, a testator directed his executor to appropriate and use for and in the erection and construction of a suitable monument at my grave such as the amount of funds <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>in his hands will warrant.” The executor expended for the purpose nearly the entire residuary estate, and it was held he had the right under the will, in his discretion, to expend the whole or any part in the erection of the monument, Mercur, J., saying such was the clear intention of the testator, and “ may not the testator have said to the appellant, as the good man of the house said to the laborer, ‘ is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? ’ He had the right to make such a disposition of his estate. We see no cause to set at naught his will or to impair its force.” If a testator has this unlimited power of disposition of his estate, and can thus perpetuate his memory in costly structures, upon which may be inscribed his name, genealogy and biography, why may he not devote his fortune to beautifying and adorning his birthplace with works of art such as memorial arches, statues, fountains, picture galleries and conservatories, or zoological gardens, and providing the means for the innocent and healthful diversion and recreation of the people, whether children or adults, by the construction of amusement halls, playgrounds, gymnasiums, or natatoriums. And such a catholic, broad-minded public spirit on the part of our citizens of wealth, whether men or women, should not only be commended, but encouraged, and the objects they had in view be. considered as the most benevolent and beneficent public charity.</p>
