I can only give an approximate figure of the estimated value of the machinery placed in the mill, for the manufacture of these jersey garments ; that is in the neighborhood of $10,000, probably more, I don’t know., I think we continued making the jersey garments about one and one half years after we came to East Stroudsburg ; at this time we discovered that the jersey business was going out of style, and as a side issue we began the manufacture of hosiery, which necessitated getting other machinery, such as ribbed machines, knitters, loopers, and a steam press. . . . . The jersey business went out altogether, but we continued the hosiery and added ladies’ cloaks and suits. The cloak and suit business was started in the fall of 1892.

If we find these machines to be personalty, the fund for distribution, less costs of this audit, must be distributed to Frank H. Muehling, the execution creditor; but if we find that the same are fixtures and attached to the realty, the-fund must, under the agreement, be distributed to James H. Shotwell, mortgagee. . . . Before they were placed in the mill they were personalty. If by being placed in the mill they became realty, what made them so ? What constitutes a legal incorporation or conversion of a chattel into the realty ? Unquestionably, in a case of this kind, the intention to annex, whether rightfully or wrongfully, is the true legal criterion. Mere physical annexation is no longer the <em>test; </em>and such annexation can only be considered in so far as it may go to show what the intention, if any, to annex was, as the secret purpose of - the actor cannot be known, but upon the inferences to be drawn from what is external and visible. The intention to be sought is not the undisclosed purpose of the actor, but the intention implied and manifested by his act. These machines were purchased by Muehling and Johnson, and placed in their mill at East Stroudsburg. On April 3, 1894, the firm of Muehling &amp; Johnson was dissolved, Johnson withdrawing from same. In the agreement <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>of dissolution entered into that day the said John H. Johnson did grant, assign, transfer, sell and set over unto the said Chas. Muehling, his heirs and assigns, all the right property, and interest whatsoever which he, the said John H. Johnson, has or should have in all and singular the lands and tenements, the buildings erected thereon, the machinery and fixtures therein, constituting their factory in the said borough of East Stroudsburg, and also all goods, wares, merchandise, bank account, stocks, debts and bills receivable belonging to or owing to the said firm of Muehling and Johnson, wheresoever the same may be or be situate. According to this agreement of dissolution made April 3,1894, the machinery and fixtures in the mill constituted the factory on the land covered by the mortgage. The partners themselves seem to have treated these machines and fixtures as part of the factory, or rather as realty. No bill of sale passed between them at that time or any other time. Mr. Johnson says they dissolved partnership April 7,1894; on that day Johnson and his wife deeded the equal undivided one half interest in the knitting mill premises to Muehling. No other paper seems to have passed between them in relation to the dissolution of the firm, save the agreement of April 3, 1894.</p>

That the said sewing machines, hosiery knitters, steam press, button-hole machines and ribbers were so placed in said mill as to become affixed to .the freehold. The intention of the said Muehling and Johnson being at the time of placing them in the mill to have them to constitute a part of their factory, we think that the machinery sold by the sheriff was realty, and not personalty, and therefore, nothing remains but to make distribution in accordance with these views. What has been said in relation to the machines may also practically be said in relation to the dynamo. This dynamo was purchased by Mr. Johnson, of the firm of Muehling &amp; Johnson, in the fall of 1892, a few months after the firm began operating the mill, and was <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>used constantly for the purpose of lighting the mill in operating the same, up to the time of the levy and sale by the sheriff. In the agreement of dissolution between Muehling and Johnson entered into April 3, 1894, the said John H. Johnson agreed to grant, assign, transfer, set over unto the said Muehling, his heirs and assigns, all the right, property and interest, which the said Johnson has or should have in the lands, tenements and buildings erected thereon, machinery and fixtures therein, constituting their factory in the said borough of East Stroudsburg, and that the said Johnson and his wife will make and execute a good and sufficient deed, conveying to the said Muehling, his heirs and assigns, the equal undivided one half interest of said Johnson, to and in the real estate, buildings, machinery and fixtures connected therewith.</p>

      <em>We </em>think there can be no question that the parties themselves intended this dynamo, as well as the machines in dispute, to constitute a part of their factory at the time of dissolution. We find nothing that Muehling did from that time to the time of issuing execution, the levy and sale by the sheriff, to change this condition of things. Moreover, we believe that the machines and dynamo were so placed in the mill and affixed to the freehold as would justify anyone about to purchase the factory to believe, from the circumstances surrounding the machines and the dynamo that it was the owner’s intention to leave the machines and dynamo, and not take them away.</p>

    <p id="b512-8" data-blocks='[["BL_512.11",512,[254,1334,1173,601]]]'>The question to be determined on this appeal is whether the hosiery knitters, ribbers, steam press and dynamo purchased for and placed in the lmitting mill, by the owners thereof, were intended by them as component parts of their factory, and subject to the lien of the mortgage upon it, or as personalty subject to removal by them at their pleasure and against the protest of their mortgagee. The learned auditor to whom the question was referred found as a fact that it was their intention in placing this machinery in the mill to place it there as fixtures and a constituent part of their factory. This finding was approved by the learned court below, and, if there was a sufficient warrant for it in the evidence, we cannot reverse it.</p>
    <p id="b512-9" data-blocks='[["BL_512.12",512,[255,1947,1171,456]],["BL_513.1",513,[154,370,1176,2045]],["BL_514.1",514,[308,377,1164,97]]]'>We have carefully read and considered all the evidence oral and documentary, and our conclusion from it accords with the finding in question. The agreement of September 11, 1889, under which the money for the erection of the factory was furnished, and in pursuance of which the factory was mortgaged, contained a requirement by the mortgagee and a promise by the mortgagors which bound the latter to place in the factory for the proper operation of it, machinery worth at least 110,000, and to maintain an adequate insurance thereon for the protection <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>of the former. It seems to us that this agreement is in clear accord with the view that it was the intention of the mortgagors that all the machinery employed in the operation of the factory should constitute a component part of it. The manner in which the machinery was connected with the factory and the fact that it was deemed essential to the proper performance of the work done there are circumstances corroborative of this view. The mortgage was executed in conformity with the agreement, and the parties to it seem to have understood that it included the machinery as well as the buildings with which it was connected. When Johnson withdrew from the partnership of Muehling &amp; Johnson he agreed to convey to Muehling his interest in the real estate, buildings, machinery and fixtures connected therewith, subject to the mortgage. This agreement shows that he considered the machinery and fixtures as real estate on which the mortgage was a lien. The learned counsel for the appellant appear to concede that the machinery in the factory when the mortgage was executed was included in and bound by the latter, but they claim that the machinery in question was put in the factory subsequent to the execution of the mortgage, and is not subject to the lien of it. As sustaining this view they cite Tillman v. DeLacy, <a href="/ala/80/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="80 Ala. 103" data-case-ids="3386209" data-case-paths="/ala/80/0103-01">80 Ala. 103</a>, and Clare v. Lambert, <a href="/ky/78/0224-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="78 Ky. 224" data-case-ids="4393166" data-case-paths="/ky/78/0224-01">78 Ky. 224</a>. These cases are referred to as authority for the proposition that “ where the chattel is annexed after giving the mortgage, and is of doubtful character, there must be stronger evidence of intention to make a permanent accession to the freehold than if it were annexed prior to or at the time of giving the mortgage.” ' But this proposition, if sustained by the cases cited, furnishes no ground for reversing the finding in question, because the evidence to support it is ample. Besides, our own cases seem to hold a different view. In Roberts v. The Dauphin Deposit Bank, <a href="/pa/19/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="19 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="970588" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0071-01">19 Pa. 71</a>, a steam engine and boilers were detached from a property covered by a mortgage, and it was sought to justify the severance on the ground that they were attached after the property was mortgaged, and it was held that “ though the engine and boilers were put up after the mortgage to the plaintiff was given they constituted a part of the mortgage security, and they were not liable to removal by the mortgagor or her assigns if such removal was injurious to the mortgagee, who has a right to benefit from any appreciation of the mortgaged <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>premises arising from any cause.” See also on this point Morris’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/88/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="88 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1061152" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0368-01">88 Pa. 368</a>.</p>
