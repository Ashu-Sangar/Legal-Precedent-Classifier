Smith on February 10, 1876, took out a policy in the company defendant, No. 113,293, in the sum of $5,000 on the renewable term plan, the terms being ten years each. At the expiration of the first term, in February, 1886, he took a second renewable term policy, numbered 152,009. The only provision in that policy looking towards a cash payment was the seventh clause, which provided that if default should be made in the payment of any premium during the running of the policy the holder should be entitled to receive in cash two-thirds of the accumulations of reserve and surplus. He did not default on the payments, but in 1896, instead of taking out a third term policy, he decided to surrender the policy then held and to take one of another kind, to wit: the ordinary terminal endowment plan, which was issued February 10, 1896, and which is the policy sued out in this case.</p>
