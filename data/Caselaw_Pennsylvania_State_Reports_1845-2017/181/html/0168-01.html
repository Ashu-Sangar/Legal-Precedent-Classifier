This action of the directors was taken <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>in supposed pursuance of the Act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 618, which, among other things, provides that: “ If any person having taken upon himself the duties of his office as director, shall neglect to attend any two regular meetings of the board in succession, unless detained by sickness or prevented by absence from the district; or to act in his official capacity when in attendance, the directors present shall have power to declare his seat on the board vacant, and to appoint another in his stead to serve until the next regular election.” It is not denied that Howley, Jordan and Brown failed to attend the meetings of the board held on the 17th, 20th and 24bh of August, 1896. If these were “ regular ” meetings in contemplation of law, then the action taken was within the jurisdiction of the directors, and their discretion cannot be impeached in this proceeding. All official deliberative bodies have the inherent right to assemble in pursuance of a previous adjournment. Where the. record of minutes of a previous meeting shows an adjournment to a time and place certain, then such adjourned meeting will be considered regular. But it is claimed in the present case that the general rule applicable to deliberative bodies is qualified in the case of boards of school directors, by the Act of April 11, 1862, P. L. 471, which in section 3, provides that “ the term stated meetings or regular meetings .... shall hereafter be taken to mean the first meeting thereof for organization, after the annual election of directors or controllers, or the monthly or other periodical meetings held thereafter, in accordance with the standing regulations of the board.” This act, however, contains the following additional provision: “ But if there are no standing regulations, then every meeting held in succession from the said first meeting for organization by adjournment to a time and place' certain, and so entered on the minutes of the proper board, shall be to all intents and purposes regarded as a regular meeting.” The board of directors of the .Pittston township district has never adopted any standing rule or regulation in reference to the time for holding regular monthly meetings. It seems to have been their practice to meet from time to time, •at the call of the chairman. This is shown by the minutes. The meetings of the 3d of August, of the 17th, and of the 20th all seem to have been held in a regular manner, — -the first at the call of the chairman, and the others in pursuance of adjourn<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>ment properly noted on the minute book. Ata meeting on the 20th, there being but two directors present, an adjournment was ordered to the 24th at 7:30 p. M. in the Morgan Lane schoolhouse. This also appears on the minutes. It would seem, therefore, that the adjourned meeting held on the 24th of August, 1896 was regular in all respects. And it appears from the depositions that Howley, Jordan and Brown were duly notified of the meeting, but did not see proper to attend it.</p>
