She died seized and possessed of certain real estate which the plaintiffs contend, by virtue of the statute, was subject to the lien of this unscheduled debt. The lien has been regularly revived and continued according to the directions of the statute. Some of tbe defendants were terre-tenants by purchase from the trustee named in the decedent’s will. There is no question as to the <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>amount due. The defendants, however, contend that by the terms of the will, her lands became converted into personalty and that, -by the power of sale contained in the will, the lien of this debt was divested. The defendants rely chiefly upon the cases of Willing v. Peters, <a href="/pa/7/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="957806" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0287-01">7 Pa. 287</a>, and Cadbury v. Duval, <a href="/pa/10/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="962685" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0265-01">10 Pa. 265</a>. These two cases decide that a sale by an executor, either for the payment of debts or for distribution, by virtue of a positive direction in the will of the decedent, either by public or private sale, made in good faith, discharges the lien of unscheduled debts, and that the purchaser takes free from the lien of the debt and is relieved from all liability to see to the application of the purchase money. It must be conceded, under these authorities, that where the direction in the will is clear, positive and imperative to sell, either for the payment of debts, or for the purpose of distributing the estate, it works a conversion of the land into money, and unrecorded liens are discharged. Cadbury v. Duval so decides, and it does not seem to have been doubted or reversed by any subsequent case. This case, however, is certainly upon the verge, and must not be extended beyond what it decides. In that case there was no question of insolvency. The history of the case states that Mrs. Duval, the trustee, was rich at the time the sale was made. In the present case insolvency of the trustee as well as of the cestui que trust, has been hinted. It may be true that Maggie Mcllvain, the daughter of the cestui que trust, was only a “ man ” of straw to represent her father, and that the lands,she devised were in equity his property, and the intention was to cover the same from claims of his creditors, but this does not appear in the testimony, and must therefore be banished from the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[184,1843,1165,553]],["BL_308.1",308,[272,354,1173,296]]]'>In Cadbury v. Duval, the order in the will was positive to sell the land, and it directed that the net proceeds should be first applied to the payment of the testator’s debts; secondly, that the surplus should be distributed among his children. Here was a clear and undoubted conversion by a positive direction in the will to sell. The danger to be feared from extending the principles decided in that case must be obvious to all lawyers. If an insolvent testator, having no debts of record against him, can be permitted to direct an irresponsible executor without any security to protect creditors, to sell all the testator’s lands at private sale, according to his own discretion, and <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>thereby discharge the liens of all his debts, the purchase money could be in the trustee’s pocket before the creditors would know of the sale or could come into court and demand security. In this case the terms of the trust intimate the insolvency of the trustee as well as of the executor and cestui que trust, all three being one person.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.4",308,[272,659,1166,1056]]]'>The will in the case now before us, directs, first, “ Item, I direct all my just debts and funeral expenses to be fully paid by my executor.” This is the only direction to the executor. There is nowhere-in the will a direction to him to sell any of her lands for the purpose of the payment of her debts. As executor, therefore, no power was given to sell her land for the payment of debts or for distribution. True, she directed him to pay her debts, but under our law it was his duty to pay them from the personal estate. And where no directions are given to sell real estate for that purpose, the executor on exhausting the personal estate, must apply to the orphans’ court for power to sell lands. The lands of the decedent are not assets for the payment of debts until the personal estate is exhausted. Our law has provided a simple and safe proceeding in such a case. It makes it the duty of the executor when there is no personal property to pay debts, to petition the orphans’ court and to prove to the court that the decedent had left debts and.not sufficient personal estate to pay them. Then, and not till then, does the land become assets for that purpose. Nor can the order of the court be carried out until adequate security has been entered.</p>

Instead of ordering the property to be sold, she gives specific directions for its preservation during the life of her father. True, she directs her trustee (her father) and his heirs after her death, to divide and pay over the corpus of said trust estate to the remaindermen. The word “ pay ” clearly relates to the accumulated money from the estate. The word “ divide ” means to make partition of the remaining real estate. The <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>proper word, if the estate were then all personalty, would be “ to distribute ” the residue, etc.</p>

In such case we would have four independent interests before us. First the executor, who could have done nothing but take charge of the personal estate, pay the debts and hand over the balance to the trustee; or, if there was not sufficient estate to' pay the debts, to make that matter known by petition to the orphans’ court and sell the lands for that purpose. The second person before us would be the trustee, who could but carry out the trust and preserve the trust estate for- the cestui que trust. The third person interested would be the cestui que trust, who could only see that his trustee, properly managed and preserved his estate, and gave him the rents, issues and profits thereof, and if there was any personal estatedo see that it was safely invested. The fourth person in interest would be the remaindermen, who would have the right to see that their estate was not wasted.</p>

Duval, <a href="/pa/10/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="10 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="962685" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0265-01">10 Pa. 265</a>, it was ruled that a purchaser, under an absolute testamentary direction to sell land, was bound to see -to the payment of scheduled debts because he had notice; but that he was not bound to see to the payment of general debts because other means for the satisfaction of that class of claims were-provided by statute. In contemplation of law, conversion takes place immediately on testator’s death, and claims which were not then liens on his land attach to the <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>proceeds as personal estate and become payable as in ordinary course of administration. But it is insisted that discretionary powers of sale stand on a different footing; that because conversion takes place from the date of execution of the power, general debts have in the meantime acquired a lien on the deceased debtor s land which can only be divested in the mode provided by the statute. No case precisely in point has been cited, but analogous eases (Taylor v. Haskell, <a href="/pa/178/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="178 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="885504" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0106-01">178 Pa. 106</a>; Drayton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/61/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="61 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="428597" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0172-01">61 Pa. 172</a>) show and it is practically conceded, that this position is wrell taken. This much premised leads up to the question involved in this case, whether or not the power contained in the will of Miss Mcllvain was absolute or discretionary. Analysis will certainly show that it was not absolute. There is no express direction, — peremptory in character, — that the executor shall in any and every event sell the land; and it seems just as clear that there is no necessary implication. The provision for payment of debts is no more than the law would have implied. It does not follow that sale of the land will be necessary. The personal estate is the primary fund for payment. The presumption, arising under the act of 1882 which requires an allegation of insufficiency and the exhibition of an inventory as conditions precedent to the grant of an order of sale, is that the personal estate is sufficient; and there is every reason for the application of this presumption here. There is not only no proof of insufficiency, but the allegation of the filing of an inventory of personal estate, of which no account appears to have been filed nor distribution made, far in excess of the debts, remains uncontradicted. In any event, only so much of the land as may be necessary to make up the insufficiency can be sold, and the burden is on those representing the estate to show how much, which they have failed to do. So far as appears, there was no necessity for sale even assuming the power related to payment of debts. The will shows on its face that testatrix herself had no thought of insufficiency ; for the specific direction “ to invest the proceeds of every such sale or exchange in such real or personal security or securities,” as the trustee “may deem proper and right,” excludes its use for other purposes.</p>

It too is what would <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>have been implied without a will. It embraces no more than the “surplusage” which the law sets apart to heirs and next of kin. The general expression “ divide and pay,” per se includes, and the context shows it was intended to include, real and personal estate. Land, as well as personalty, may be the subject of division in.kind. Following the detailed direction “to pay over,” which prima facie relates to personalty, there is an independent provision “ respecting ” real estate which clearly individualizes it, and leaves the question of its conversion solely to the trustee’s discretion. The expression “ authorize and empower” in itself implies discretion: Hill on Trustees, 485. If in his judgment it appears that it is not “ for the best advantage ” of the estate, the trustee may refuse to sell; there is no authority that can coerce him; and the land may therefore never be sold. The question of conversion lies wholly in the discretion of the trustee.</p>
