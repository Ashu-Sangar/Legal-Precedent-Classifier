The first wife’s children were parties to this proceeding, some of them by attorney, and the others by their respective guardians. The trustees duly appointed by the court under the special trust above quoted were also made parties thereto, and united with said children in denying that appellant, as executrix, etc. of her late husband, or otherwise, had any right to or interest in the corpus of said trust in their hands or any part thereof; and their contention was fully sustained by the court below. Hence this appeal.</p>

Any other construction of the will would not only defeat the manifest inten<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>tion of the testator, but it would do great violence to the-language employed by him in creating the trust as to the share of his son Peter. The second and third items of the will must be read and considered together. When so considered, it is. quite clear he never intended that the one sixth of his estate given to Peter in the second item should go to him absolutely, to be disposed of as he might see fit. On the contrary, he clearly intended that it should go into the hands of a trustee or trustees appointed by the court to be invested in the manner specifically directed in the third item, and that the income, interest and dividends thereof should, from time to time as received by the trustees, be paid to his son Peter during his natural lifetime, etc., and from and after his decease, the principal or corpus of the trust should be “ to and for the only proper use and benefit of ” Peter’s children by his first wife. In other words, as to the share in question, the testator created an active special trust, for and during Peter’s natural life with limitation over of the corpus of the trust to his children by his first wife. That intention being clearly and distinctly expressed, and being at the same time unquestionably lawful, there is no reason why it. should not be given full effect.</p>
