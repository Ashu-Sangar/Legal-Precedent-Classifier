She died on October 30,1894. The evidence for the plaintiff tended to show that there had been a block of cars on Thirteenth street; that two cars had passed at a high rate of speed; that the third car which was the one which struck the girl was run at a high rate of speed, without stopping at either side of Reed street, and without making any signal. • As the car passed Reed street a passenger signaled the car to stop, and the motorman looked at him and laughed, without obeying the signal. The child was struck at the time when the motorman’s attention was temporarily diverted to the passenger. The court charged in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b414-7" data-blocks='[["BL_414.13",414,[225,1657,1171,759]],["BL_415.1",415,[148,382,1175,2048]],["BL_416.1",416,[306,380,1168,862]]]'>In this case it is contended that this child was crossing a street and that, while so crossing, this car of the company came on it at an unusual rate of speed, did not hold up as was the custom to hold up, did not slow up even sufficiently to allow a passenger who was waiting to get on, but went on, without ringing a bell, and without notice, and ran down and injured this child in such a way that she subsequently died from the injury. Now the highways of the city do not exclusively belong to the traction company. They are the highways of the state, and all people have equal rights to their use, and everybody must use them in such a way as to have regard to the rights of their neighbors — using them prudently and carefully. Especially is it the duty of these cars to stop or to slow up at the places where it is naturally expected that people would be crossing the streets, and especially in places where they are in the habit <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>of stopping, where it is known that they do slow or stop — where people have a right to expect that they will stop, and where they act in accordance with that idea. The allegation is that none of these precautions were observed which ought to have been observed and for which, if they were not observed, the defendant is liable. I leave out of the account one, two or three persons who have given testimony about the accident, but will call your attention to Mr. Armstrong who has been referred to as a gentleman of intelligence, and who gave an accurate account of what occurred. You had their testimony before you. I think counsel for the defendant was mistaken in saying that Mr. Armstrong did not see the accident. My recollection is distinct that he said he saw the accident, and he repeated, on cross-examination, that he had seen the accident. So I do not think it can be said under the evidence that nobody saw the accident which happened. I speak of him, without reference to the others whose testimony you will also recollect upon the same point. Now, in answer to this allegation the motorman and the conductor have been called before you, and they contend that they did all that the law required them to do; that they did sound the bell; that they were not going at an unusual rate of speed, and that this child suddenly sprang up-in such a way as to make it impossible for them to prevent the accident, although they had taken every precaution that the law required. Of course if you are satisfied of those facts — as it has been asked of me to say to you that this was an unavoidable accident, and that no care on their part could have prevented it — then they are not responsible. But if you should consider that this is a case where there is responsibility on the part of the company, then the next question for you to consider is what compensation you think the plaintiff is entitled to receive. [Unfortunately the young lady is not here to receive whatever sum you should think her due, but she is represented by her personal representatives. They of course can do nothing for her. The trouble in all these cases is that most of them tend very much to excite one’s feelings particularly in a case where an accident like this happens to a young and attractive girl. Our sympathies are so excited that when we have listened to eloquent counsel we can hardly come down to consider the matter as we are bound to consider it, as a matter of business ; and the law very wisely <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>requires us to be slow about giving a verdict,-according to the evidence, not allowing our minds to be inflamed when we consider such a question, but only to consider it as a business question. Undoubtedly if this young lady were here in person she would be entitled to compensation for the injury she had received and for the pain and suffering she had undergone and for whatever disability she had sustained for her future life, which the accident caused, and for whatever diminution of earning power there was due to the accident. If you — in regard to this question about earning power, were to die, or any other citizens, the question would be how much ought to be paid to the family or to the circle dependent upon you for support. This young lady was six years of age. You will have to determine her earning power — how much it was. You will have to consider that question without prejudice or feeling one way or the other, and whatever sum you think would be a proper and reasonable compensation you have a right to give her.] [8]</p>

The injuries having resulted in plaintiff’s death on October 30,1894, after the cause was at issue, her personal representative was afterwards duly substituted as plaintiff under the act of April 15, 1851, and article III. section 12, of the constitution, as construed by this court in Birch v.

On the other hand, if they believed the evidence of defendant’s witnesses, of which its first and second points for charge are predicated, they would have been justified in finding for defendant.

The language of the court below on this point was used by way of illustration, and indicates the measure of damages with sufficient accuracy.</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[268,1119,1169,814]]]'>In Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Zebe, <a href="/pa/33/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="33 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="988378" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0318-01">33 Pa. 318</a>, Mr. Justice Thompson, at page 329, referring to the case of Railroad v. McCloskey, <a href="/pa/23/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="23 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="974049" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0526-01">23 Pa. 526</a>, says: “ While it adheres to the rule of giving damages only upon such bases as are susceptible of a pecuniary estimate, it seems to regard the value of the life lost as the basis of the estimate rather than the injury resulting from it to the survivor entitled to sue. This conclusion flowed from the form of, and parties to, the action, and naturally led to the result. It was a suit by the personal representatives for the benefit of the estate. Treated in this light, and as the plaintiffs — the administrators — were not damaged by the death, but were recovering for the estate, the only estimate, it seems to me, that could be made was of the value of the life. The wrong-done to it survived, by virtue of the statute, to the estate, and gave the personal representatives their right of recovery co-extensively with its value.”</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[271,1939,1168,454]],["BL_421.1",421,[124,361,1168,304]]]'>In an action that has survived to and is prosecuted by the personal representative, under the statute, there can doubtless be a recovery, not only for mental and physical suffering of the injured decedent, but also for the value of his life. This necessarily follows from the fact that the action brought by him survived to and is prosecuted by his personal representative. It was so decided in Muldowney v. Railway Co., <a href="/iowa/36/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="36 Iowa 462" data-case-ids="2301265" data-case-paths="/iowa/36/0462-01">36 Iowa, 462</a>; and the reason why it was held otherwise by the English courts is (as stated in the early case of Blake, Administratrix, v. Mid<a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>land Railway Co., 10 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 437) because the English act w does not transfer this right of action to his representative, but gives to his representative a totally new right of action on different principles.” With us, however, the right to recover a solatium necessarily follows from the fact that the action, as brought by the injured party, is continued by the statute.</p>
    <p id="b421-3" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[125,669,1169,148]]]'>We find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining either of the specifications. They are therefore overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
