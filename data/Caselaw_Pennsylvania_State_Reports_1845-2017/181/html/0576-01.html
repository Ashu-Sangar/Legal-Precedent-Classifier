The rule was granted as prayed for.</p>

It admits the submission but denies that there was any understanding that the two arbitrators chosen should serve. It avers, inter alia, that said Boyd as attorney for Augustine, long after the execution of the submission, prepared an answer to a bill in equity filed in this court by Wolf against Augustine, and <a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>others in which answer, sworn to by Augustine, this submission was set up as a defense to said suit in equity and as a reason why the same was withdrawn and should be dismissed; that by reason of the preparation and filing of said answer, Augustine and Boyd are legally estopped from alleging that Boyd did not agree to act as one of the arbitrators, and especially from alleging that the submission was contingent upon Thompson and Boyd accepting the position of arbitrators; that it is denied that the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator under the terms of the submission for the reason that Wolf is willing to concede to Augustine the right to select an arbitrator instead of Mr. Boyd. It is further averred in the answer that the submission is a contract, with a consideration, and irrevocable by either party, and that the court has no jurisdiction in the premises to discharge or annul the rule of court to arbitrate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-5" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[257,1145,1169,902]]]'>Both parties have taken testimony and on it, the record, petition and answer, the matter must be determined. There is nothing in the testimony that would warrant us in finding that Mr. Boyd accepted the position of arbitrator. It may be conceded that he did not at once, nor for some time after his appointment, refuse to act, but he was not compelled to do so. Until he accepted, he could decline, and no length of time of itself could estop him from refusing to perform the duties of his appointment. Nor would the fact that he, as attorney for Augustine, prepared the answer in equity compel him to act or estop him from refusing to act. His position as arbitrator, mutually chosen by the parties in the case, must be distinguished from that as counsel for Augustine in the other case. Unless there was collusion or fraud between him and Augustine, of which there is no evidence, Mr. Boyd’s professional services in the preparation of the answer in the equity suit cannot control his action, individually, in accepting or declining the position of arbitrator in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b600-6" data-blocks='[["BL_600.5",600,[256,2066,1167,353]],["BL_601.1",601,[131,397,1169,197]]]'>Nor can we agree with the plaintiff that Augustine is es-topped from alleging or setting up Boyd’s refusal to act. At the time the answer in the equity suit was prepared, Augustine, without consulting Boyd, may have thought that Boyd would act as an arbitrator. If, as he did, Boyd subsequently declined, Augustine should not be prohibited from alleging the fact as a reason for the revocation of the submission. It may <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>well be, and presumably is tbe fact, that Augustine reposed special confidence in Mr. Boyd’s ability to protect and secure his interests under this submission, and that he is unwilling to trust those interests, under this agreement, to another person.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[129,603,1170,1019]]]'>We agree with the counsel for plaintiff that this submission is not revocable by either of the parties to it. If this were the only or controlling question in this case, the solution of it must result in a decision favorable to the plaintiff. While it is true that a naked power to submit controversies to arbitration is revocable, it is equally well settled that when the agreement partakes of the nature of a contract, whereby important rights are gained and lost reciprocally, and the submission is the moving consideration to these acts, a different rule prevails : Paist v. Caldwell, <a href="/pa/75/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 166" data-case-ids="1036700" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0166-01">75 Pa. 166</a>. Such is the character of this submission and, hence, it is irrevocable by either party. But another question arises here. From the testimony submitted, we find that Mr. Boyd refused to accept and act as one of the two arbitrators mutually chosen by the parties to this contract. We know of no authority in the court to compel him to act. Has the court the authority under this submission to compel Mr. Augustine or him and Mr. Wolf to select another arbitrator to act in Mr. Boyd’s place or, he and they failing or refusing, to appoint an arbitrator for that' purpose ? That, in our opinion, is the question to be determined.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b601-6" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[125,1631,1173,813]],["BL_602.1",602,[281,389,1168,197]]]'>By this submission, the parties have contracted to have their differences settled by Mr. Thompson and Mr. Boyd, and, should they fail to agree, a third party is to be chosen by these two. The terms of this submission must control the court and the parties. There is no provision in it for filling a vacancy in this tribunal, whether occasioned by death or refusal to act of one or both of the arbitrators. The statute does not provide for filling such vacancy. Where no provision is made in the submission it is settled that a vacancy by death in the board of arbitrators, amicably chosen, revokes the submission: Huggins v. Neill, <a href="/pa-super/2/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Pa. Super. 103" data-case-ids="270700" data-case-paths="/pa-super/2/0103-01">2 Pa. Superior Ct. 103</a>; Potter v.

In this latter case the Supreme Court says: “ A submission to arbitration is like a delegation of any other power. Neither an agent nor an arbitrator can delegate his power unless expressly authorized by his constituents. An authority given to two cannot be executed by one, although the other die or <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>refuse; nor if given to three can it be executed by two, although the three be authorized to act jointly and severally. A power is terminated by the death either of the party receiving it or of the party conferring it.”</p>

The effect is the same, namely, to deprive the parties of the tribunal created by them for the adjustment of their differences.

That power exists solely in the parties, and if they refuse, the submission is revoked and the arbitration is at end.</p>
