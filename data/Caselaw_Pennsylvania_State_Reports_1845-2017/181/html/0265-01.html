Breck, one of the appellants, filed the following affidavit: That as a member of the bar of Crawford county where this case was tried he was firmly of the conviction and belief that unless the decree of the court of common pleas of said county was modified the defendants would be compelled to pay more money than was justly due and owing to the plaintiff, and that upon his judgment and that of H. L. Richmond, Esq., counsel in the trial of the case, who died after the trial of the case in the court below, this appeal was taken. That a subsequent and more thorough investigation and examination' of the facts and law in the case after the appeal had been taken led affiant to the conclusion and belief that the expense that would be incurred in the printing of the record which was very voluminous, and in procuring competent counsel to argue the case in <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>Philadelphia, would be equal or greater than any benefit to be gained from the prosecution of the appeal even if the decree were modified, and he thereupon so notified his codefendant some forty days before the return day of the writ issued in this case, but expressed his willingness to prosecute the appeal, to which notice affiant had no response; that affiant’s codefendant is at present somewhere in the West, his address being unknown to affiant, and is not expected to return until May 8, the return day of this rule, and affiant is not informed as to whether he has had notice of this rule and had opportunity to prepare any answer.</p>
