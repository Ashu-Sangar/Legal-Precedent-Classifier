    <p class="summary" id="b452-6" data-blocks='[["BL_452.5",452,[274,831,1169,1573]]]'>There is no doubt that this mortgage of John Dutton to Robert Singleton standing by itself without any explanation, would bind nothing, as at the time it was given, John Dutton’s interest in his father’s land had passed to George G. Dutton by a proceeding in partition which had been confirmed by deed from John Dutton. If therefore, it is to operate as an equitable assignment of John Dutton’s interest in the recognizance, it must be, because of the intentions of the parties at the time it was given, and this depends entirely upon the testimony of Charles C. Larkin, taken in connection with the description in the mortgage and the fact that the only interest Dutton had in his father’s estate, was what would be due him out of the recognizance at the death of his stepmother, Lydia F. Dutton. Larkin says : “ I made the loan of one thousand dollars. John Dutton wanted a loan of one thousand dollars, and made an application to me for a loan on his interest in his father’s estate coming to him on the death of his stepmother, Lydia F. Dutton. I prepared the mortgage. He said his interest at the death of his mother would be fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars, which I thought ample. I went to Media and told H. T. Walter what I wanted to do. He got the book, opened it to the place, and said that is just what you want, and I copied the same description as is in the mortgage to Singleton. It was something connected with or part of the same estate of Jonathan Dutton, deceased. Mr. Walter’s assertion that it was all right, made me think it was all right. Two years’ interest has been paid on the mortgage by John Dutton. I paid it to Singleton. I paid the money I got from Singleton to Dutton. Mr. Singleton afterwards made demand for the amount of the mortgage, and then Mr. Broom all came, and I paid Singleton for the mortgage. I am owner today. Mr. Broomall drew the assignment.</p>

For if he did not, then there is no question that the Singleton mortgage is entitled to be paid out of the recognizance, before the judgment of <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Beatty. It is claimed on the part of Beatty’s estate that their holding is for consideration, because the assignment of the collateral was part of a simultaneous transaction, by which a prior indebtedness of Dutton was extinguished and a new obligation taken, payable in thirty days. Now what are the facts ? Dutton was indebted to Beatty on certain notes and on a judgment which was entered on June 6, 1881, and which was a lien on Dutton’s real estate. On January 17, 1884, they had a settlement of accounts, a balance was struck, and it was found that Dutton owed Beatty $1,436.12, for which he gave him a new judgment payable in thirty days, which was entered on January 21,1884, and also assigned the recognizance to Beatty as collateral security for the payment of the judgment. The notes were surrendered and the judgment of $1,000 was satisfied on January 28, 1884. There is no evidence that the recognizance was assigned as collateral in consideration of the giving of time, or that it was contracted between them that said assignment should be made in consideration of the giving of additional time. Neither is there any evidence that Beatty was put in a worse position by the taking of- the new judgment and the giving of additional time, and while it is true that it has been held that an extension of time upon the original obligation is sufficient consideration for a promissory note given as collateral security therefor: VanGorder v.

They are (1) whether Larkin was a competent witness to testify to matters occurring between himself and Dutton and Singleton in the lifetime of Beatty, (2) whether the mortgage from Dutton to Singleton on October 31, 1882, operated as an equitable assignment of the former’s interest in the recognizance and (3) whether Dutton’s assignment to Beatty on January 21,1884, was subject to the equity of Singleton founded upon the loan and mortgage. Questions 1 and 2 were not discussed on the argument at bar, nor in the appellant’s paper-book. Prom this we might infer an abandonment of the assignments of error which raised them. The auditor held that Larkin was a competent witness, that the <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>mortgage operated as ail equitable assignment of Dutton’s interest in the recognizance, and that Dutton’s assignment to Beatty was subject to Singleton’s equity. In so holding he was sustained by the court below. He cited Kuhns’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/163/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="163 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="859053" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0438-01">163 Pa. 438</a>, as authority for his ruling upon the first question. This case appears to sustain the ruling. As authority for his ruling upon the second question he referred to a number of cases among which we note Hay v. Mayer, <a href="/watts/8/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="8 Watts 203" data-case-ids="1848432" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0203-01">8 Watts, 203</a>, Costen’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/13/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="13 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="965010" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0292-01">13 Pa. 292</a>, Horner’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/56/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="56 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1009200" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0405-01">56 Pa. 405</a> and Bailey v.

These cases, together with the testimony concerning the transaction of October 31, 1882, make it clear that as between Singleton and Dutton the former was entitled to the latter’s interest in the recognizance as security for the loan. That Larkin now has Singleton’s equity with whatever rights he had to enforce it against’Dutton or Beatty is also clear.</p>

In considering it we must not lose sight of the fact that the assignment of the recognizance to Beatty was made as collateral security for a pre-existing debt, and that it was not shown that there was a.consideration for it. The appellant, however, contends that inasmuch as the assignment and the bond conditioned for the payment of the debt in one month from the date thereof were executed on the same day, the auditor should have found as a fact that there was an extension of the time for the payment of the debt, and that such extension was the consideration for the assignment. But this was not a necessary sequence from the facts. “ Consideration like every other part of a contract must be the result of agreement. The parties must understand and be influenced to the particular action by something of value or convenience and inconvenience recognized by all of them as the moving cause. That which is a mere fortuitous result flowing accidentally from an arrangement, but in no degree prompting the actors to it, is not to be esteemed a legal consideration: ” Kirkpatrick v. Muirhead, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20126" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="16 Pa. 126">16 Pa. 126</a>. The cases cited by the auditor as bearing upon the question under consideration sustain his conclusion that “in order that an extension of time shall be a good and valid consideration it must be contracted for.” Besides, whether the extension of time was the consideration of the assignment <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>was a question of fact in determining which, the nature of the transaction and the circumstances surrounding it, as well as the extension itself were to be taken into account. The cases cited by the appellant show that where the question arises in an issue before a jury the decision of it rests with them. In the case at bar the auditor as to questions of fact involved in it was in place of the jury, and his findings in regard to them were as conclusive as a verdict. He virtually found that the extension of time was not the consideration of the assignment, and as it was not claimed that there was any other consideration for it he held that it was subject to the equities founded upon the prior assignment to Singleton. In this conclusion we concur.</p>
