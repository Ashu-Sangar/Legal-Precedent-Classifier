The warrant was that if J. and R., executors, did not pay the notes of R. at maturity then any attorney was authorized to appear for them, their heirs, executors or administrators, at the suit of the bank, and confess judgment thereon against them, their heirs, executors and administrators.

It is not clear from tbe evidence and tbe confused and tangled account filed whether tbe estate of testator was solvent at bis death; it is very clear that when the first account was filed, more than ten years after-wards, it was largely insolvent. There was for distribution, after adding a surcharge of $2,905 and deducting counsel fees and expenses, a balance of $24,867. But two creditors claimed payment out of this fund; Mrs. Emma C. F. Keller, who-demanded $36,344.34, with interest from May 1, 1894, and tbe Commercial National Bank, $4,300, with interest from March 22,1894. The court below allowed both claims and directed a distribution of tbe balance pro rata. From this decree Mrs. Keller appeals, assigning for error tbe allowance of tbe bank’s claim. It follows, if her appeal be successful, tbe payment to her will be increased $4,300, with interest from March 22, 1894. Her averment is, no valid claim against tbe fund was exhibited before the court below by tbe bank, therefore it was error to allow it.</p>

Wallace, 15 S. &amp; R. 231, iu each of which it was taken for granted as said by Gibson, G. J., in Fritz v. Thomas, <a href="/whart/1/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Whart. 66" data-case-ids="1829021" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0066-01">1 Wharton, 66</a>, that an acknowledgment of the debt by the personal representative would take the case out of the statute, but the point was not adjudged. So in the last named case the court felt at liberty to decide the case directly, and it was held that the executor or administrator “is answerable in his official character for no cause of action that was not created by the decedent himself.” And further, that the administrator “ cannot charge himself personally without a new consideration; he ■cannot charge the estate on the foundation of the old one to the prejudice of creditors whose fund might be materially lessened by it. He is not bound to plead the statute; because he may know the debt to be a just one; and for that reason, the matter is left to his discretion; but it follows not that he may tie up his hands from using it when the time comes, by a mistaken concession, or an engagement which had no consideration to bind him personally or officially. . . . Indeed there is no course open to us but to follow the principle out.or abandon it altogether; for to be consistent we must either return to the doctrine of revival without qualification, or maintain that an action on his own promise lies not against an executor or administrator in his official character.” This decision has.either been followed or recognized in every case in which the point has been raised since, commencing with Reynolds v. Hamilton, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20420" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="7 W. 420">7 W. 420</a>, down to <a href="/pa/46/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="46 Pa. 239" data-case-ids="420615" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0239-01">46 Pa. 239</a>.</p>

It does not bind the estate; they, under the authorities, were not even bound not to plead it on distribution, but might then have set it up in the face of their original promise. They do not do so, but a creditor, this appellant, does. Would it avail her when the executors waived the right to plead it? Fritz v. Thomas, <a href="/whart/1/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="1 Whart. 66" data-case-ids="1829021" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0066-01">supra,</a> by plain implication, holds the promise of the executors would not bar her right. But in Kittera’s Estate, <a href="/pa/17/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="17 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="967627" data-case-paths="/pa/17/0416-01">17 Pa. 416</a>, the point is directly decided. It was there held that distribution of an estate of a decedent in the orphans’ court is, under the act of assembly, to be made “ to and among the persons entitled to the same; ” that the right ■of each creditor to be heard in support of his claim and in <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>■opposition to every claimant who interferes with it is necessarily involved in the right to demand payment ont of the fund. “ Each creditor or claimant has a right to appear and to be heard, so far as may be necessary for the protection of his own interest ; and of this proceeding the administrator has not the control, nor is he responsible for errors in the distribution so decreed. At a time when the statute of limitations was not in favor it was held that an executor or administrator was not bound to plead it. This was only applicable to actions in which the personal representative of the decedent was entrusted with the management of the defense, and in which the pleading was necessarily regulated by his own discretion. It has no place in a proceeding before the orphans’ court. ... It follows that when the fund is not sufficient to pay all, each creditor has a, right to oppose any other claimant, by showing payment of the debt or that it is barred by the statute of limitations.” This was followed by Hoch’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/21/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="21 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="411518" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0280-01">21 Pa. 280</a>, and Ritter’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/28/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="28 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="981550" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0095-01">28 Pa. 95</a>. In this last case it was said that where the personal representative had in good faith actually paid a debt barred by the statute, without protest by legatees or creditors, equity would not refuse him credit therefor in his. account. But it was expressly decided he could not bar distributees from pleading the statute by refusing to plead it himself.</p>
    <p id="b629-3" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[151,1547,1175,597]]]'>It will be seen from these most explicit decisions that the personal representative is not answerable for a cause of action not created by the decedent; that if by a new promise he revive •a debt already barred, or prolongs the life of one not yet barred, the contract is his own, and he is personally answerable.' And, although he is not bound to plead the statute where he believes the debt unpaid, yet in the distribution of a fund, creditors whose interests are affected can plead it. Where, however, a suit is brought against him in his representative capacity on a debt barred by the statute, and he waives his right to plead it, the judgment is de bonis testatoris, and cannot be questioned thereafter on distribution of the estate.</p>
    <p id="b629-4" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[156,2163,1170,248]],["BL_630.1",630,[257,368,1171,237]]]'>It is argued that to disallow the bank’s claim is to question collaterally the conclusiveness of a judgment of the common pleas. But this is a mistake.

It is not questioning a judgment collaterally to ascertain from the record against wbom it is rendered, and whether it can be legally paid out of the fund for distribution.</p>

And further, that appellee pay the costs of this appeal.</p>
