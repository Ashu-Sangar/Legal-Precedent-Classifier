It does not appear in the evidence when Spooner turned over to the defendant the $1,000 of the $1,500 which he had received <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>and tbe notes for $10,500, bnt it would seem that the defendant did not at once repudiate the transaction and demand back his notes. In the defendant’s letter to the plaintiff, dated August 10, 1892, he says: “I now want the four notes of $3,000 each, and am in position to return all the paper which was given and the $1,500 in cash, as Mr. Spooner now states that was the amount of cash he received, although I was led to believe at the time that it was only $1,000 in cash. It was not understood by me that I was to receive any paper, but it was merely taken temporarily, it being all to be turned into cash,” etc. As late as June 24, 1892, about one month after the sale of the note in suit by Spooner, Spooner wrote to Coke-fair : “ I have yet remaining two notes of Roehm’s, of $1,000 and $1,500,” and proposed to exchange them for other notes and cash, and he further intimated that he expected to sell two of the notes which he had received for the Roehm notes; “ The smaller notes of $1,000 and $1,500 of Swift &amp; Hotchkiss.” It does not seem to the referee that the defendant’s case is assisted by the evidence of Spooner, who was called for the purpose of showing that the sale bjr him was made directly to the plaintiff. It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff was doing business as a banker at 31 and 33 Broadway, New York, under the name of Hotchkiss &amp; Company, and that Philo P. Hotchkiss was the manager of this business, that Spooner had desk-room, from “ January till August,” in the office of Hotchkiss &amp; Company, and that Spooner had a notice upon the heading of his letters in the following words: “ With Hotchkiss &amp; Company, Bankers, 31 and 33 Broadway, New York.” These facts, it is claimed, show such an intimacy between Spooner and Hotchkiss as to indicate the probability of a sale directly to the plaintiff. Of all the letters by Spooner submitted to the referee, but two show the said notice, one dated May 24, 1892, and one dated June 28, 1892. Hotchkiss, the manager for plaintiff, testified that Spooner had no authority to use the name of Hotchkiss &amp; Company, that as soon as he heard that Spooner was using that name he requested him to stop it, which he did. This testimony of Philo P. Plotchkiss was given January 11, 1892, and when Spooner subsequently (June 12, 1894) testified, he did not deny this, but on the contrary testified that his only connection with Plotchkiss was that he “ rented desk-room from him.” Neither did Spooner contradict Hotchkiss’s allegation <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>that he (Spooner) practically did not occupy the said desk-room,' and that Hotchkiss seldom saw him. An examination of the evidence of Spooner leads the referee to the conclusion that but little, if any, weight should be given to it. He starts out by saying that of the four notes received from the defendant he (Spooner) was to have the use of two, and further explains that in consideration of his getting for Roehm $1,000 in cash, he (Spooner) was to have the proceeds of two notes for $3,000 each for his own use, to do with as he pleased, and without liability to account for it to the defendant. If this story be true the defendant is not entitled to much consideration, and if it be false the same may be said of the defendant’s witness, Spooner. Spooner testified that the direct transfer was made to Cokefair; that he made the sale to Cokefair; that he understood that the notes were for Hotchkiss, again that he understood that the notes were for Hotchkiss from what was said between Hotchkiss and himself. “ Q. Mr. Hotchkiss knew of the delivery of the paper? A. Undoubtedly to my belief.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b90-4" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[239,1290,1176,1173]],["BL_91.1",91,[160,360,1173,556]]]'>The witness finally does say that he believes that the deal which was carried out was entered into between Hotchkiss and himself. He is contradicted by both Cokefair and Hotchkiss, and his letters to Cokefair dated May 28 (within a day or two of the transaction), June 24 and 28, make no mention of Hotchkiss as being a party to this sale, and clearly indicate a sale to Cokefair, and that Spooner thought that, on June 28, 1892, Cokefair still had possession of at least three of the Roehm notes. Spooner states in his evidence at least four times, that part of the agreement he made with Hotchkiss was that Coke-fair’s note for $500 was to be discounted by Hotchkiss an l placed to the credit of Spooner. He is contradicted in this by his own letter written May 28, 1892 (within a day or two of the transaction), in which he says that the discount of the $500 note was no part of the contract of sale, but that he had his (Cokefair’s) assurance that he would do all he could to effect the said discount. He makes no mention in the letter of Hotchkiss as having anything to do with the sale, or as having promised the discount. The witness Spooner is not supported by any of his letters offered in evidence by the defendant. His letter of May 10, 1892, before he received the note in suit, and when he had apparently another note for $10,000 (see receipt dated May 4, -1892) made by the defendant is addressed to <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>Cokefair. No mention is made of Hotchkiss, but he offers to sell to Cokefair. It is to be noticed that the offer itself is not to sell for cash, but “75 cents cash and 25 cents in some good paper.” He also states in the letter that defendant will only accept certified check and paper unquestionably good. He suggests Swift paper (Swift’s name is on the notes which he received to the extent of $4,000), and adds, “ There is no question but what he will pay his paper, and I cannot afford to see him take anything about which there will be any doubt.” In his evidence he states that he undoubtedly felt that all the paper which he took was good at the time he took it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b91-5" data-blocks='[["BL_91.4",91,[159,925,1176,969]]]'>C. A. Wendell, Esq., an attorney, testified that on May 17, he called on defendant on behalf of the plaintiff, and stated to him that the notes had been offered the plaintiff for sale. That he (Wendell) had one of the notes in suit with him at the time, and desired to know of the defendant whether they were genuine and would be paid: that he was assured by the defendant on both points, and that the defendant said that he was obliged to help his customers pay the increased liquor license, and that for that purpose it was necessary that he should put out his paper. The defendant denies having had any such interview with Wendell, or at least claims not to remember it. It does not appear from this interview, if it occurred as stated, that Wendell said that the plaintiff proposed to purchase the notes from the defendant. It is just as consistent with this alleged interview that plaintiff contemplated the purchase of the notes from some one who had already bought them from the defendant, indeed the certificate of even date with the notes and attached to each would lead one to suppose that they had already been sold by the defendant.

It does not appear to the referee that this is a necessary consequence. If on May 17 (prior to any purchase by Spooner), Spooner could have delivered the notes to Hotchkiss for the purpose of investigations as to their genuineness, it is equally true that Spooner could have delivered the notes to Cokefair for the same purpose, and Coke-fair intending to purchase on condition that he could sell the notes to the plaintiff could have delivered the notes to Hotchkiss. In view of the fact that the defendant denies this interview, and if it occurred made no explanation of the certificate attached to the notes, failed to say in effect, “ it is true that the notes appear to have been sold by me but as a fact they have not been, but are only held by Spooner for sale,” it appears to the referee that the weight on this point is with the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[261,1325,1176,1013]]]'>It is argued by counsel for defendant that there was no reason for plaintiff to discount a single-name paper of a Philadelphian in New York, when he at once had them discounted in the Columbian Bank. That the transaction was unbusinesslike and the story improbable. Cokefair explains why the plaintiff purchased the notes in suit, and says that the plaintiff was induced to purchase the notes on his (Cokefair’s) promise to have discounted in the Columbian Bank for the benefit of the plaintiff a batch of notes including one of those in suit, in an amount exceeding #22,000, and he offered in evidence a letter from the Columbian Bank, showing the transaction. The letter was excluded as not being legal evidence, but the offer to read the same is an answer to the argument. It also appears to the referee that if at that time Hotchkiss knew the banking concern he' was in charge of to be insolvent, and if he was the swindler claimed, he failed to take advantage of the greatest opportunity afforded by the transaction when he took up the note or notes which he had had discounted in the Columbian Bank. The plaintiff has the notes now and must have taken them up if they were discounted.</p>

The sum mentioned, $2,972.50, as having been paid “ for the second note,” represents the value of either of the notes about a month later than May 26. This witness did not appear before the referee, but testified as above, according to the notes of evidence taken at the second trial of the case and submitted to the referee. It is <em>to </em>be regretted that the attention of the witness was not called to the fact that the notes mature at the same date. The notes were in court, or at least copies of them in the statement, and it then might have appeared in the evidence why the sum of $2,972.50 was named by the witness. It does appear from the evidence that the checks which the witness claimed to have given for the notes were not in court, but it does not appear whether the’witness was speaking from memory, or by the assistance of memoranda, or from a calculation made at the time.</p>

But later in his evidence it appears that he must have received at least four checks, for he received three checks for one of the notes. He said that for one of the notes he received from Hotchkiss a check for $1,500, a check for $1,370, and a check to bearer, which he had cashed, for about $100. He also produced his deposit book in the Plainfield National Bank showing two credits on June 2, 1892, one for $3,000, and one for $1,370, and he explains that $1,500 of the $3,000 and the credit for $1,370 represent the two checks for those amounts which he received from Hotchkiss. These checks he says he received for the note No. 8,457, and he adds that for the other note, No. 8,489, he received from Hotchkiss “ either one or two checks.” The referee is not able to find in the evidence that Hotchkiss testified as to the number of checks he gave for the notes, or that his attention was called to the number of checks as distinct from the amount thereof. <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>In his re-examination at the second trial, he uses the words “check” and “checks” indiscriminately.</p>

In the meantime the business of the plaintiff passed into the hands of a receiver, and Hotchkiss, the plaintiff’s manager, was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment; the latter fact probably accounts for the nonappearance of Hotchkiss before the referee, and Cokefair testifies at length as to the efforts he made to obtain from the receiver of the plaintiff's business an opportunity to examine the books and papers of Hotchkiss &amp; Company.</p>

If Hotchkiss and Cokefair were in collusion, as claimed by the defendant, the notes in suit were before them, and such a palpable mistake as that made by Hotchkiss (who, it was not denied, was in the banking business for at least ten years) relative to the maturity of the notes, or his intimation that of two notes of even date the one- first maturing was of less value than the other, is hardly consistent with a prepared story to carry out a fraud. The referee is inclined to account for this evidence on the ground of inadvertence, and the fact that the attention of the witness was not called to the very apparent mistake. The evidence of the defendant suggests the same consideration. He testified at one time that the face value of the notes he received was $10,000, at another $5,000. It is conceded that they amounted to $10,500. In the evidence of January 11, 1894, the defendant was asked: “ Q. Did you sign any other paper at the same <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>time? (as the notes). A.

He cannot hold on to the fruits of the contract and at the same time repudiate it. He cannot at one time affirm and deny. He must, as soon as he discovers what he deems a fraud on his rights, take his position either for or against the contract and maintain that position without change. When the defendant ascertained that Spooner had sold his notes in part for notes, it was his duty at once to have sought out the holders of the notes made by himself and offered to return whatever Spooner had received and demanded the return of the notes Spooner sold. This he does not appear to have done. On the contrary, from the defendant’s letter of August 10, 1892, it seems that he assented to the sale with the understanding that the paper was taken temporarily. The sale by Spooner was made on or about May 26, 1892. No evidence was given before the referee as to when the defendant first heard that his notes had been sold in part for other notes. There was no offer by the defendant to show that as soon as he learned of the terms of sale he attempted to rescind it. The only evidence of a desire on the part of the defendant to repudiate the sale is in the correspondence. The letter from Hotchkiss to defendant, dated August 8,1892, would indicate that there had been some previous correspondence on the subject of a sale by Hotchkiss of the notes received by Boehm from Spooner. The defendant’s letter of August 10,1892, offers <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>to return the $1,500 in cash and all the notes received by Spooner. In view of the silence of the defendant as to when he first Imew of the terms of the sale, and what efforts, if any, were at once made by him to regain possession of his notes, the referee is of the opinion that his offer of August 10, 1892, came too late.</p>

    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[135,631,1172,300]]]'>This action to recover the amount of two promissory notes made by the defendant to his own order and by him indorsed, etc., has been thrice tried in the court below, and uniformly resulted in favor of the plaintiff. The last trial was before a referee under the act of 1874, the others were each before a jury.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[135,939,1171,456]]]'>From the testimony before the referee he found that the notes in suit were sold by defendant’s agent to Charles C. Cokefair of New York City, by whom they were sold before maturity to the plaintiff “ who paid for them by checks and without knowledge of the consideration given by Cokefair.” The consideration moving from Cokefair in his purchase was part cash and residue in notes of himself and others, the greater part of which afterwards proved worthless. Among these were two indorsed by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.8",101,[134,1405,1170,864]]]'>The referee was requested by the defendant to find that the plaintiff “had full knowledge of the consideration” aforesaid; but he refused to do so. Exceptions to his report were dismissed and the report confirmed by the court below. In such circumstances the findings of fact by a referee, or what is the same thing, his refusal to find, cannot be reversed where there is evidence to support the finding, or, in the case of his refusal to find as requested, there is no evidence that required him to do otherwise. While it is not ordinarily the province of an appellate court to decide on the preponderance of evidence in such cases, it may not be amiss to say that, as it appears to us, the referee was right in refusing to find as requested, and also to suggest that the evidence of collusion between plaintiff and Cokefair is unsatisfactory and inconclusive. The discrepancy, as to dates and other details, as narrated by the witnesses, bears quite as strongly against the allegation of conspiracy as it does in support of it.</p>
    <p id="b101-8" data-blocks='[["BL_101.9",101,[135,2278,1165,188]]]'>The offer to rescind was too late. It was not made until more than a month after the maturity of Cokefair’s note. If the defendant did not authorize the exchange of notes he should have said so as soon as the new notes came into his hands.</p>
