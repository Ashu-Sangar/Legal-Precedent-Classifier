No scienter is averred in the statement, nor does it appear that there was any offer to make proof thereof on the trial. On the contrary, the defendant, called as on cross-examination, testified positively that she had no knowledge of the alleged false statements.\nThe recital of the premises conveyed in the deed, executed and delivered by the defendant, as \u201c all that certain tract or piece of ground, with the messuages or tenements and barns, stables and sheds thereon erected,\u201d etc., \u201ccontaining about three and twenty-four hundredths of an acre, be the same more or less,\u201d is no evidence of deceit. The facts recited were literally true. The quantity of the land was stated only approximately, the true contents being given by courses and distances; and the deed did in fact convey \u201c barns, stables and sheds,\u201d but not all that the plaintiffs supposed they were buying.\nThe question of ratification is not involved in the case, because the action for deceit is not founded on the contract, but on the alleged fraudulent representations and guilty knowledge on the part of the defendant. In the absence of any evidence of such knowledge, on her part especially, there could be no recovery: Freyer v. McCord, 165 Pa. 539.\nFurther elaboration is unnecessary. The evidence introduced by the plaintiffs was insufficient to carry the case to the jury, and hence the nonsuit was properly ordered, and there was no error in refusing to take it off.\nJudgment affirmed.",

The deed described the land as \u201c all that certain tract or piece of ground with the messuages or tenements and barns, stables and sheds thereon erected,\u201d etc., \u201ccontaining about three and twenty-four hundredths of an acre, be the same more or less.\u201d There were barns, stables and sheds upon the land. There was no evidence that defendant had knowledge of the alleged misstatements of the agent. Held, that a nonsuit was properly entered.\nDeceit \u2014 Misrepresentation by agent \u2014 Ratification.\nIn an action of trespass for deceit to recover damages for alleged false representations made by defendant\u2019s agent in the sale of land, no question of ratification can be raised, as the action is not founded on the contract.\nArgued April 1, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 60, Jan. T., 1897, by plaintiffs, from order of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., Sept. T., 1890, No. 460, refusing to take off nonsuit.\nBefore Steeeett, C.

J.\nThe facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nError assigned was refusal to take off nonsuit.\nJames O. Sellers, for appellants.\nPrincipals, whether individuals or corporations, are, as a rule, although not criminaliter, yet civiliter, hable to third parties for the fraud and deceit of their agents when committed in the course of principal\u2019s business. For, since somebody must be the loser by the deceit, it is more reasonable that he who employs and puts confidence in the deceiver should be a loser than a stranger: 1 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, tit.

App. 394.\nHe who puts it in the power of another to commit a fraud must bear the consequence; where one of two parties who are equally innocent of actual fraud must lose, the one who by misplaced confidence in an agent or attorney has been the cause of the loss, shall not throw it on the other: Penna.
