        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chibe Justice Stebbett,\nThis appeal from the refusal of the court to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense is resisted on two grounds: (1) plaintiff\u2019s statement is insufficient in that it does not comply with the requirements of the procedure act of May 25, 1887; (2) the averments contained in the affidavit of defense are sufficient to prevent a summary judgment for plaintiff.\nIf either of these propositions is sustained the appeal must be dismissed: Byrne v. Hayden, 124 Pa. 170; Bank v. Ellis, 161 Pa. 241. In the latter, it was said: \u201c To entitle plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidavit or a sufficient affidavit of defense, the statement of his demand .... must be self-sustaining, that is to say, it must set forth, in clear and concise terms, a good cause of action, by which is meant, such averments of fact as, if not controverted, would entitle him to a verdict for the amount of his claim. . . . All the essential ingredients of a complete cause of action must affirmatively appear in the statement and exhibits which are made part thereof.\u201d In the action of assumpsit, the procedure act in express terms requires that the statement \u201c shall be accompanied by copies of all notes, contracts, book entries, . . . upon which plaintiff\u2019s claim is founded.\u201d This is not merely directory; it is absolutely imperative; and if the copy of the written or printed contract on which the action is founded, or any part thereof, does not accompany the statement, and its absence is not satisfactorily accounted for, the omission cannot be supplied by averments of the contents or the substance of the missing paper. Without the defendant\u2019s consent, such averments cannot be accepted as the legal equivalent of the \u201c copy \u201d or \u201c copies \u201d required by the act, except in the case of papers shown to have been lost or destroyed.\nPlaintiff\u2019s demand in this case is founded on an undated contract or -undertaking, signed and sealed by the defendant, of which the following is a copy: \u201c In consideration of one dollar paid me by the Acme Manufacturing Co. ... I do hereby guarantee to the Acme Manufacturing Co. the prompt fulfillment of all covenants and conditions of the within contract on the part of Leo Schlaudecker, and that the said Leo Schlaudecker will make the payments therein specified according to the terms thereof.\u201d Accompanying this copy of the defendant\u2019s undertaking is what purports to be a \u201c copy \u201d of the paper on which the undertaking is indorsed. On inspection of the so-called \u201c within contract,\u201d it proves to be merely a blank form of order for \u201c Stormer Bicycles,\u201d etc., addressed to the plaintiff company, containing blank spaces evidently intended to be used in specifying the kind, quantity, value, etc., of the goods to be ordered.\nIn and of itself, with the blanks unfilled, it cannot in any proper sense of the term be considered a contract. By properly filling the blank spaces therein, the paper is susceptible of being made a contract; but, as presented, it is a misnomer to call it a \u201c contract.\u201d With the exception of the words \u201c quantity and specifications already set it \u201d parenthetically inserted in the first sentence, and the name, Leo Schlaudecker, signed at the end of the paper, the blank order remains unfilled, and is therefore lacking in the essential features of a contract. It is entirely silent as to the kind, quantity, value, etc., of goods ordered or intended to be ordered. It contains no \u201c covenants and conditions,\u201d nor does it specify any \u201c payments \u201d to which, defendant\u2019s undertaking indorsed thereon can apply. The only reference to any of these essential matters is found in the words above quoted from the first sentence of the blank order, viz: \u201c quantity and specifications already sent in.\u201d These words clearly indicate that Leo Schlaudecker, whose name is signed at the end of the blank order, had \u201c already sent in,\u201d and the plaintiff had received his order for bicycles and bicycle goods to which defendant\u2019s undertaking was intended to refer. This is the only meaning of which the words quoted are susceptible. That order \u201c already sent in \u201d is presumably in the possession of plaintiff company, and the copies of papers set out in the statement should have been \u201c accompanied by \u201d a \u201c copy \u201d of the order to which the words above quoted evidently refer. That order, embodying \u201cquantity and specifications,\u201d etc., and the blank order on which defendant\u2019s undertaldng is indorsed, together constitute the \u201c contract \u201d to which said undertaking refers. In the absence of explanation, and without a \u201c copy \u201d of the paper to which defendant\u2019s undertaking refers and upon which it depends, plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim is incomplete and insufficient, and defendant was not bound to answer it. In other words, plaintiff was in default, and therefore not in a position to ask for a summary judgment. It is therefore unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether defendant\u2019s affidavit presents a meritorious defense or not. The rule for judgment was rightly discharged, not for the reason suggested by the court, but because plaintiff\u2019s statement does not sufficiently comply with the requirements of the procedure act.\nAppeal dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs, but without prejudice, etc.",
