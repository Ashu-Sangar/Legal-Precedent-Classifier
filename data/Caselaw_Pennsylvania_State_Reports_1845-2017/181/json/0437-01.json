        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice McCollum:,\nTlie decision, of the question raised by the case stated depends upon the interpretation or construction of the will of John P. Wilkinson, deceased. The question is whether under and by virtue of the will, his wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, became at his death the owner in fee of the real estate in dispute. The plaintiff claims that the devise to her was of a life estate only, while the defendant as devisee of all her estate claims that it was of the fee. The devise in question is contained in item 2 of the will, and the operative words of it are: \u201c I give to my wife Hannah A. Wilkinson for a home my one half undivided interest in the real estate on which I now reside.\u201d The description of the real .estate which follows the operative words need not be inserted here. The claim of the plaintiff is based on the presence in the devise of the words \u201c for a home.\u201d Without these words there would be no room for a contention respecting the nature of the estate devised. Do these words in, the devise have the effect claimed for them ? There is no provision in the will which strengthens the claim founded upon them. The authority given to the executor in item 3 cannot be construed as extending to and including lands specifically devised in items 2 and 5. A construction of it which would enable the executor to defeat specific devises of real estate cannot be sanctioned. The reasonable and proper construction of it is that which limits it to property not specifically disposed of by the will. This construction obviously accords with the intention of the testator in conferring the power to sell or lease.\nThe claim that the wife took an estate in fee by the devise in item 2 has some support in the fact that there was no devise over. This is not necessarily a controlling fact, but it is entitled to consideration in ascertaining the testator\u2019s intention in disposing of the, land in suit. That he knew how to create s life use of or in his property when he desired to do so clearly appears in item 7 of his will.\nThe words \u201cfor a home\u201d as used in the devise were not sufficient to restrict it to a life estate. They do not qualify in any degree the absolute gift to the wife of all the testator\u2019s interest in the land described in item 2. This view of the case is not opposed to the decision in Oyster v. Oyster, 100 Pa. 538. In that case the testator devised land to his son \u201c for his support,\u201d and tben over to his children who were to take as purchasers. The only question was whether the word \u201c children \u201d in the third clause of the will was a word of limitation or of purchase. It was held to be a word of purchase, and as a sequence that the son took but a life estate in the- land. The third clause of the will, standing alone, evidenced an intention to give a life estate to the son. It was construed as a whole, and the strongest if not the only indication of the intention was the limitation over which was included in it. Oyster v. Knull, 137 Pa. 448, involved the construction of a similar clause of the same will, and the decision in it accords with the decision in the preceding case, and rests upon substantially the same grounds. Upon due consideration of the language of the devise and of all the provisions of the will, we concur in the conclusion of the learned court below \u201c that Hannah A. Wilkinson took an estate in fee simple in the real estate described in the second item of the will of John P. Wilkinson, deceased.\u201d It follows from this conclusion that judgment was properly entered for the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Held, that the wife took an estate in fee simple in the lands specifically devised to her.\nArgued Feb. 11, 1897.\nAppeal, No. 34, Jan. T., 1897, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. Chester Co., for defendant, on case stated.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nCase stated in amicable action of ejectment. Before Wad-dell, P. J.\nThe case stated was as follows:\nIt is hereby agreed by and between the attorneys for the parties to the above action respectively, that an amicable action in ejectment in the above form be entered in said court, and that the following facts be agreed upon as a case stated for the opinion of the court in the nature of a special verdict:\nThat John P. Wilkinson died July 22, 1896, aged about seventy-eight years, seized amongst other real estate of an undivided half interest in fee of a dwelling house, lawn and garden, and adjoining tannery buildings and lot, containing altogether five acres and seventeen perches, more or less, which had been conveyed from Levi Hayes, Eli Logan and Isaac Jefferis to Francis Wilkinson, John P. Wilkinson and Samuel Wilkinson, March 31, 1856, and the interest of Francis Wilkinson in said real estate was subsequently conveyed by him to said John P. Wilkinson and Samuel Wilkinson.\nThe undivided half interest of John. P. Wilkinson in said real estate is worth about $4,000, as appears by assessment for taxes and by the collateral appraisement.\nJohn P. Wilkinson never had any children, but he and his wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, had resided in the dwelling house aforesaid from the time of the purchase thereof, and they continued to reside there until his death, and after his death his widow continued to reside there.

Wilkinson for a home, my one half undivided interest in the real estate on which I now reside, viz: The Tannery lands and building and all my right claim and interest in the real estate included in the purchase from and embraced in the deed from Levi Hayes, Eli Logan and Isaac Jefferis to Francis, John and Samuel Wilkinson, said property being in the village of Unionville, Chester county, Pennsylvania, together with the household and kitchen furniture, including contents of the cellar, all provisions and all articles belonging to me in the house, my horse, two carriages, all my harness, cutter, stable furniture, bay, feed, feed chests, cutting box, chickens, all money in the house and bank or on hand at the time of my death.\n\u201c 3. I authorize my executor to sell or rent any property of which I am in whole or part possessed at the time of my death, and to make deed or lease to the best interest of my estate, and others who may have part interest in said property with me.\n\u201c4. I bequeath to Anna T. Chambers, wife of David I. Chambers, five hundred dollars in her own right.\n\u201c 5. I give to John W. Anderson, son of Dr. David and Eliza H. Anderson, my land (one hundred and twenty acres,) viz: N \u00a3 of NW ( and SW \u00a3 of NW 1 in Acola county, Florida, sec. 5, Township 25, Range 27, the deed of which I hold from the United States, and I direct my executor to transfer the same to him.\n\u201c 5. I give to my sister, Mary W. Pusey, wife of John Pusey, fifty dollars.\n\u201c 6. To my nephew, Francis, son of my brother, Morris Wilkinson, my watch and chain.\n\u201c 7. I direct my executor to pay all money not herein disposed of, to . In trust, nevertheless, the interest and rents to be paid to my wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, during .her life, and at her death, after deducting expenses and commissions, to pay to my nephews and nieces, share and share alike, the net balance, viz.: To Marshall F. and Mary P.

Wilkinson and Frank Wilkinson, children of my brother, Morris R. Wilkinson, Newlin F. Wilkinson, son of my brother, Marshall P. Wilkinson.\n\u201c 8. If any of my nephews or nieces named should not outlive my wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, and not have children, their share is to be divided amongst the other nieces and nephews named in item 7.\n\u201c9. If either of the aforesaid nieces or nephews should not outlive my wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, and have child or children, his or her share shall go to their children, share and share alike.\n\u201c 10. Should any of my heirs give trouble to my executor or my wife, causing expense or outlay, such expense or outlay to be charged to and deducted from the share of the person or persons causing said outlay or giving such trouble.\n\u201c11. I hereby appoint my wife, Hannah A. Wilkinson, my executor of this, my last will and testament, and authorize her with full power and authority to execute the same, as herein devised, and I do not require her to give security for the trust. She to have the privilege to call anyone to her assistance that she may desire, and authorize them to act for her or with her.\n\u201c (Signed) John P. Wilkinson.\n\u201c2dmo. 8th, 1894.\u201d\nThe aforesaid will was duly proved July 31, 1896, and letters testamentary were on the same day granted to Hannah A. Wilkinson.\nSaid Hannah A.
