The impact occurred between the right front of the Lojeski vehicle and the left rear of the Whitner automobile. At the time of the accident, both cars were traveling south on Route 309, a three-lane highway in Bucks County. The car driven by Lojeski was owned by Margaret Von Hintz, and Herald Evans was a passenger in the right front seat of the Lojeski automobile.</p>

Whitner filed suit against Lojeski and Von Hintz seeking damages for personal injuries, loss of earnings, and property damage. Evans brought suit against 'Whitner and Lojeski claiming damages for personal injuries and loss of income; following Evans’ death in January, 1965, his wife, as administratrix of his estate, was substituted as plaintiff and continued to prosecute the action. The two actions were consolidated and' jointly tried in the Common Pleas Court of Bucks County. In the Whitner suit, the court entered an involuntary nonsuit in favor of Von Hintz upon her motion, and the jury returned a verdict against Whitner and in favor of the remaining defendant Lojeski. In the Evans suit the jury returned a verdict of $12,000 in favor of the Evans estate and' against Whitner and in favor of Lojeski. Lojeski thus- was relieved of liability in both cases. Both Whitner and Evans filed motions for new trial; both motions were denied after argument. The appeals now before ns <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>were taken by Whitner from the judgments subsequently entered on the verdicts.</p>

Whitner, according to his account, had hoped to visit a gun shop located on the west side of Route 309 on the evening of the accident. ' Uncertain whether the store was open, Whitner drove north on Route 309, passing the shop on his left across the highway. Discovering that it was still open, he drove some two-tenths of a mile further north and there pulled off the road onto the shoulder opposite a motel. He checked for traffic, noticed a car roughly one mile away coming south toward him, and realizing he had ample time, he executed a U-turn. He then drove south' until he again approached the shop in question, which was now on his right. Intending to stop but uncertain as to where he should park, Whitner slowed down and eased his car off the highway. When he was almost entirely on the berm at the side of the road, and while he was still attempting to decide where he would park, Whitner’s car, according to his testimony, was struck from behind; the force of the collision caused it to roll over until it came to rest against a pole in front of the gun shop. Whitner estimated that at the time of the accident his car was roughly 90%;on the berm of the road, although he acknowledged that his left rear wheel might still have been on the paved highway surface.</p>

Suddenly, the 'Whitner vehicle, which had <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>been proceeding north on Route 309, executed a U-turn in front of his own car. Lojeski was not aware of the Whitner car until it passed in front of him at an angle roughly one car length away, and he was unable to avoid the collision because of the suddenness of Whitner’s turn. Lojeski’s version of the accident was confirmed in substance by Evans in a deposition taken before his death, parts of which were read into evidence at trial, and by Walter Gilliam, a second passenger in the Lojeski car who escaped the accident without injury, although both men’s accounts differed from Lojeski’s in several particulars, not of relevance here.</p>

As it is stated in <em>Burrell Twp. v. Uncapher, supra, </em>the rule is the obverse of the Restatement formulation as found in §432(1): “. . . [T]he actor’s negligent conduct is not a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another if the harm would have been sustained even if the actor had not been negligent.” We think the Restatement formulation is preferable for three reasons: it speaks not just of defendant’s “negligence”, which is subject to varying definitions, but to his “negligent conduct,” which denotes the physical act or omission involved as well as <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>the legal concept of negligence; it relates this negligent conduct to the element of substantiality in bringing about the result, which is a requisite of legal cause as stated in §431 (a) ; and it says that substantiality is not present if the harm would have been sustained irrespective of the negligent conduct. In other words, it provides that if the harmful result would have come about even had the actor not been negligent, the negligent conduct, even though contributory, is not a substantial factor; hence no legal causation, and no liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Pennsylvania “but for” formulation, on the other hand, says that there is liability if the harmful result would not have come about but for the negligent conduct. That is, if the conduct were the <em>causa, sine qua non </em>of the result, there is responsibility, given close connection with the injury “in the order of events.” The meaning of the qualifying phrase is not entirely clear, and a <em>causa sine qua non </em>does not necessarily result in liability.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> As comment <em>a </em>to §431 of the Bestatement says, “In order to be a legal cause of another’s harm, it is not enough that the harm would not have occurred had the actor not been negligent. <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>Except as stated in §432(2)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> this is necessary, but it is not in itself sufficient.

See Eldredge, Yol. II of Pennsylvania Annotations to the Eestatement, §§431, 432 (1938). Without attributing infallibility to the Eestatement,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> we would think it better, in the interest of consistency and hopefully of clarity, to utilize its approach to the problem of legal causation.</p>

While language such as that used can be found in the cases, the deficiency here is that, with one exception, there is nothing to qualify the <em>sine qua non </em>concept. The third paragraph, where the “but for” words are used, is devoid of the qualifying language in <em>Burrell Twp. v. Uncap her, supra, </em>and other cases, to the effect that “both circumstances” must be “closely connected with the injury in the order of events.” Thus, the explanation of proximate cause as given in the charge before us is couched almost entirely in terms of cause-in-fact or physical cause, not proximate or legal cause. As indicated above, the two are not the same; legal cause frequently does not follow as far as cause-in-fact would lead.</p>

Despite the inadequacy of the treatment of proximate cause, as above indicated, we think that the charge on liability, taken as a whole, was fair and balanced, and that on the evidence before it the jury could not have been misled by the charge to Whitner’s prejudice.-</p>

This part of the charge was directed to the Whitner version of the accident, viz., that after he completed his U-turn and headed south on the highway a considerable distance ahead of the Lojeski automobile, he had slowed down and was driving partly on the berm and partly on the highway preparatory to stopping at his destination, the gun shop, when hit from the rear by Lojeski. The court stated that if the jury should find that Whitner was negligent in driving in this fashion, and also that Lojeski was negligent in running into Whitner, “Lojeski’s negligence would supersede that of Whitner only if Lojeski were aware that Whitner was in a dangerous spot and was aware <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>of that in sufficient time to avoid the accident. . .” The court then charged that if Lojesld’s failure to see Whitner’s car in time to avoid it was due to inattention, “then both of their negligences would concur; in other words, Whitner would not be excused and neither would Lojesld.”</p>

Section 447 of the Restatement (Second) provides that a subsequent negligent act (such as Lojesld’s inattentive driving, accepting arguendo the Whitner account of the events here in question) will not relieve the original actor of liability if (among other things) it is “a normal consequence of a situation created by the actor’s conduct, and the manner in which it is done is not extraordinarily negligent.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> While the Pennsylvania cases have sometimes conditioned an intervening actor’s sole liability on his awareness of the danger to be avoided at a time when avoidance was still possible, this is but another way of saying that negligence in the face of a known danger is extraordinary.

In the first case, the intervenor’s negligence may be called ordinary, and as to the first actor, a risk reasonably to have been foreseen; in the second case, negligence in the face of peril is properly denominated “extraordinary” and as in §447 excuses the original actor of liability for the harm brought about by the intervening negligence.
