In 1919 the house was remodeled, pursuant to a building permit, to accommodate two families. As remodeled it had, and still has, 3 stories and 22 rooms, and is 2.38 feet from the westerly lot line. There was evidence tending to show that since 1922 the house has been occupied by two or more families.</p>

In 1958 the present City zoning ordinance was adopted. This requires two side yards of 10 feet each for side yards not abutting streets. It also provides that one parking stall shall accompany each dwelling unit.</p>

The question arises because of an uncertainty whether the lower court did or did not take additional evidence. If it did not take evidence, that court’s function is only to review the action of the Board on the record made before that, body in order to determine whether the Board committed a manifest abuse of discretion or error of law. On appeal to this Court, our scope of review is the same. <em>National Land and Investment Co. v.

On the other hand, if the Court of Common Pleas received additional testimony or other evidence, it then had a duty to decide the issue presented on its merits. This is founded on a recognition that additional facts brought out before the court could require a result different than that reached by the Board on the different record before it. When this occurs, this Court’s role is to review the lower court’s decision, as distinguished from the Board’s. <em>Rogalski v.

    <p id="b580-4" data-blocks='[["BL_580.5",580,[204,1202,1147,854]],["BL_581.1",581,[125,385,1148,687]]]'>We turn now to the merits. As provided by the Pittsburgh zoning ordinance, Mr. DePasquale, the owner, undertook to obtain an occupancy permit to evidence his right to the use of the property in question for two families. In connection with his application to do so, and in aid of it, he requested a variance as to the side yard width requirement. The first question, therefore, is whether he established nonconformity in the technical zoning sense. Declaratory of the law, Section 202 of the 1958 Pittsburgh zoning ordinance defines nonconforming use thus: “A use of a structure or land other than a sign, lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment hereto, which does not completely conform to the use regulations applicable in the district in which it is located.” In the same section, the ordinance defines <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>nonconforming structure: “A structure or a portion thereof, other than a sign, lawfully existing on the effective date of this Ordinance or subsequent amendment hereto, which was erected or altered for a use that does not completely conform to the use regulations applicable in the district in which it is located.’’ Section 2703-2-b of the ordinance provides that a nonconforming use may be continued in a nonconforming structure. Under these definitions the questions before the Board were whether the structure as altered to accommodate two families and the use of it by two families were lawful prior to the adoption of the 1958 ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.5",581,[123,1094,1152,359]]]'>Since the property here in question had been initially zoned for single-family dwellings by the 1926 amendment to the original 1923 Pittsburgh zoning ordinance, the lawful existence of the structure as altered for the nonconforming use and the lawfulness of the use itself depended upon their existence prior to 1923.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The record contains the separate listings of occupants of the house under two separate addresses corresponding to the two entrances of this house which appeared in the Pittsburgh Directory as early as 1922. It appears that a family named Steinmeyer, who were the 1919 owners, continued to live in one of the apartments in <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>this house from at least 1922 to 1946, while their daughter and her husband, a Mr. and Mrs. Coyle, lived in the other.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> That there were indeed separate dwelling units is indicated not only by the fact that they had separate exterior entrances but also by the fact that after Mrs. Steinmeyer’s death, the apartment which had previously been occupied by her was leased to two successive tenants and their families. Between 1949, when the property was sold by the Steinmeyer’s daughter, Mrs. Coyle, and 1962, when Mr. DePasquale purchased it, the two intervening owners divided it into as many as five dwelling units.</p>
    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.5",582,[187,1037,1146,313]]]'>Upon this evidence the Board was fully justified in its findings as to use and occupancy and in its conclusion that the use of this house as a two-family dwelling constituted a lawful nonconforming use in a nonconforming structure as those terms are defined by the zoning ordinance.</p>

Recently, in the case of <em>O’Neill v. Zoning Board of </em>Adjustment, <a href="/pa/434/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="434 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1922608" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0331-01">434 Pa. 331</a>, 334-35, <a href="/citations/?q=254%20A.2d%2012" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="254 A.2d 12">254 A. 2d 12</a> (1969), we restated the principles governing the disposition of variance cases, referring to numerous past decisions. As relevant here, those principles are: (1) in order to obtain a variance, the petitioner must prove (a) that the variance will not be contrary to the public interest and (b) that un<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>necessary hardship will result if the variance is not granted; (2) a variance will not be granted solely because the petitioner will suffer an economic hardship if he does not receive one; and (3) a variance is especially not to be granted when the petitioner purchased the property with the knowledge of the existing zoning regulations, or when he should have been aware of the zoning regulations.</p>
    <p id="b583-4" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[115,822,1151,1350]]]'>Applying those principles to the facts of this case, we have no doubt that all but the last are satisfied. The circumstances here are exceptional: Mr. DePasquale would be prevented from making not a more remunerative use of this structure, but from making any use of it without the variance. Because the 2.38 foot westerly side yard has existed since at least 1919 and so predates any zoning yard requirements, it is not here in question; but, at the same time, its existence would prevent Mr. DePasquale from undertaking even the onerous task of moving this structure to the west 7/10 foot to comply with the 10 foot requirement on the east side. The only other possibility would be for DePasquale to remove 7/10 of a foot from the east side of this structure. This is a practical impossibility and to impose such a requirement on him would indeed be to cause him an unnecessary hardship; yet because of the insignificance of the deviation (8.4 inches, or 7/10' of the required 10 foot width), no concomitant benefit would be conferred upon the public. Had Mr. DePasquale played no part in creating this situation, we would affirm the Board’s action without hesitation. Because, however, he did create this situation by his action in subdividing the property, we must consider it in light of other decisions concerning self-created hardships.</p>
    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[115,2182,1147,206]],["BL_584.1",584,[195,393,1151,1456]]]'>The situation here is readily distinguishable from those considered in almost all of the decisions cited to us by appellants because it involves a variance from lot size requirements rather than a use variance. While <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>both types of variances are controlled by the same principles, the effect upon the public interest of a use variance usually is greater than the effect of a variance necessitated by only a minor deviation from a lot restriction.

      <p id="b582-6" data-blocks='[["BL_582.7",582,[185,1895,1145,488]]]'> Appellants argue that the close family relationship between the occupants of the two apartments in this house requires the conclusion that it was only a single family dwelling. Section 202 of the 1908 zoning ordinance defines “Family” as “either an individual, or two (2) or more persons related by blood or marriage or adoption, . . . living as a household in a dwelling unit.” The error in appellant’s argument is that, under the definition given, to be a single-family the persons need not only be related but must also be living as a single household in a single dwelling unit. Here the Steinmeyers and the Coyles lived as two households in two dwelling units.</p>
