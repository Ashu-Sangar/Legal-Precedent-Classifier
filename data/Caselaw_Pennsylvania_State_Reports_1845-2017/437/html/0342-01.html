On April 16, 1965, a dispute arose between agents of Raymond and Solomon concerning removal of certain items known as “the cleaning plant” from the property. Appellees denied the cleaning plant was included in the sales order, appellant disagreed, claiming it owned the “cleaning plant.” Because of the dispute, appellant’s work was halted periodically until November 16, 1965, when a large earthen mound was constructed around the Breaker, which hindered appellant’s entry thereto and removal of materials therefrom. Appellant was inside the mound but full-scale dismantling did not take place and shortly after appellant last worked at the Powderly Breaker, the property was entirely destroyed by fire.</p>

    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[148,649,1147,751]]]'>The chancellor found that appellant had failed to prove that it was entitled to the “cleaning plant” under the Sales Order and, therefore, that the interference on the part of the appellees, in constructing an earthen wall so as to hinder access to the property, was justified. The chancellor also ruled that appellant, having failed to establish that it owned the “cleaning plant,” had failed to establish an oral contract under which it was entitled to an accounting for coal processed through the “cleaning plant.” As to the third count, the chancellor found that appellant had failed to prove what property was removed, what its value was, or any agreement to pay for property removed; accordingly, the complaint was dismissed.</p>

    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.7",440,[177,815,1147,640]]]'>Appellant argues that the words “conveyor line housings and supports” specifically include the cleaning plant located under the conveyor and therefore argues that it is error on the Chancellor’s part to exclude the cleaning plant on the basis of oral testimony. However, the words “conveyor line housings” are ambiguous. Although as appellant argues, they could reasonably be construed to include all structures which are attached to the conveyor line, whether or not they function as part of that line, they could also be construed to apply only to structures which function as part of the conveyor.</p>
    <p id="b440-7" data-blocks='[["BL_440.8",440,[176,1469,1146,263]]]'>Accordingly, parol evidence is admissible to explain what the parties intended by the use of the phrase “conveyor housings and supports” as it was used in the sales order. <em>Lipsie v.

Evidence in this case is sufficient to support a finding that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the phrase “conveyor line housings and supports” includes the “cleaning plant.” In saying this, we especially take note of evidence in the record that the cleaning plant was constructed long after the conveyor line was <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>constructed, completely separate from the conveyor line, as a replacement for a building previously located there, evidence that Gillen, president of appellee Raymond Colliery Go., Inc., with full knowledge of appellant, entered into the “cleaning plant” and made extensive and costly repairs to make it usable in his business, and evidence that other buildings which had specific numbers were referred to in the Sales Order by number but there is no reference to the specific number of the cleaning plant.</p>
    <p id="b441-3" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[144,922,1148,631]]]'>The fact that the cleaning plant was not included in the sales agreement between appellant’s assignor, Cohen &amp; Sons, and Glen Alden Corporation is not conclusive on the question of whether appellees are liable for conversion of appellant’s property. Although the court en banc pointed out that there was no direct proof as to who constructed the earthen mound around the Powderly Breaker, the construction of an earthen ramp was admitted in appellees’ answer. Moreover, the cleaning plant was not the only property located within the mound. Property belonging to appellees was also located there.</p>
    <p id="b441-4" data-blocks='[["BL_441.6",441,[143,1575,1148,410]]]'>If that earthen mound were built to keep appellant away from its property, and succeeded in that purpose, under Section 221(c) of the Restatement of Torts, a dispossession would have occurred and the appellees would be liable for the loss of the property resulting from the fire which occurred while appellant was barred from the property.

    <p id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.7",441,[143,2006,1147,263]]]'>However, there is no evidence that the earthen wall was built for any purpose other than preventing appellant from dismantling the cleaning plant, which did not belong to it. There is no evidence that appellant was barred from dismantling its own property.</p>

Appellant’s employee <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>Maeiejewski’s testimony indicates that although appellee Raymond Colliery’s employee, Toolan, had that road blocked with his automobile on November 18, he permitted Maciejewski to enter to remove some tanks. Solomon testified that he had been inside the wall. There was no evidence that appellant was barred from removing any property except the cleaning plant, which did not belong to it. Moreover, the fact that appellees had permitted appellant to be inside the wall and the fact that appellees had permitted appellant’s man, Maciejewski, to remove the tanks, are both inconsistent with a desire on the part of appellees to convert appellant’s property. <em>Druckenmiller v.
