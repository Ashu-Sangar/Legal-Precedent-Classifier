Food Fair denied the allegations and moved for summary judgment, arguing that the only allegations in Rose’s complaint which could <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>produce a genuine issue as. to a material fact were rendered incapable of proof by the parol evidence rule, and that the complaint thus stripped stated no cause of action.

Pood Fair argues that, regardless of the accuracy of Rose’s allegations, he is debarred from proving them by the parol evidence rule.

Any understanding by Rose that he would enjoy an unrestricted ability to sell the stock within a relatively short period of time is inconsistent with his declarations in the investment letter. Further, had Rose’s version of the transaction actually been set forth in the letter, Food Fair would have been subject to prosecution for violating the Securities Act of 1933. Because the alleged oral representations would directly contradict the clear meaning of the written contract we agree with the trial court that the parol evidence rule precludes proof of the oral representations and that the case was a proper one for summary judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> We further believe that summary-<a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>judgment was entered in favor of the appropriate party and therefore affirm that judgment.</p>

In order to register an offering the corporation must make public certain information about its financial affairs, the bulk of which is prepared as a “prospectus” which must be sent to every purchaser of the securities. Of course, not all sales of corporate securities have the same potential effect on the public, and certain exemptions were written into the law. One of these is the “private offering” provision, which provides that “[t]he provision of Section 5 [requiring registration] shall not apply to . . . transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.” Securities Act of 1933, Section 4(1), <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A777" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="15 U.S.C. §77">15 U.S.C. §77</a>(d)(l). It is obvious that this exception could devour the rule if it were not carefully controlled, so a private distribution will not qualify for this exemption if the private purchaser takes the securities with a view to subsequent resale or distribution. It is this requirement which serves as the genesis of the “investment letter” concept.</p>
