The remittitur was accepted.</p>

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>■ The plaintiff, a structural ironworker, was injured while working for Acme Welding and Erection Co. at the Mayfair Shopping Center in Bethel Park, Pa. Acme was the project’s subcontractor for the erection of the structural steel. At the time, the shopping center building was only partially erected; only the steel columns, together with the steel beams which connected them, were in place. The structure was divided into a number of forty-eight foot square bays. Spanning each bay, from beam to beam, were “bar joists”, steel members which were to support the roof. These bar joints’were not of the same weight or strength as the steel beams and were intended to support only the roof and whatever snow might accumulate on it. The roof was to be constructed by first placing steel decking upon the bar joists and then placing insulation on top of the decking.</p>
    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[134,1320,1150,587]]]'>■' Although the bar joists were laid in place, they were not initially secured to the beams; they were to be secured at a later stage of construction. Approximately one week prior to March 22, 1968, the date on which plaintiff sustained his injuries, bundles of steel decking were placed upon the bar joists under the direction of Sylvan (a sub-subcontractor under defendant Funk for the installation of the decking) by a crane and crew which it had hired. Because of the weight of these bundles of steel decking and their placement away from the supporting beams, the bar joists sagged and bowed.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.6",365,[132,1919,1149,418]]]'>Shortly before the accident, the plaintiff was told by his foreman, a Mr. Dawson, to get a ladder from the far side of one of the bays. In doing so, he walked beneath five or six bar joists on which were resting two bundles of steel decking. While he was walking back with the ladder, the bar joists gave way and, together with the bundles of decking, fell upon the plaintiff causing him serious bodily injury.</p>
    <p id="b366-3" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[181,397,1144,806]]]'>
      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>Appellant contends initially that a judgment n.o.v. should have been entered in its favor because the plaintiff failed to prove any negligence on its part. As noted in the opinion of the court below, this case was given to the jury on the theory that either the conduct of Sylvan in having the bundles of decking placed on the bar joists too far out from the beams or the conduct of Acme in not securing the bar joists to the beams before allowing the bundles of decking to be placed on them, or both, could have been negligent and the proximate cause of the collapse which injured the plaintiff. The jury apparently found that negligent placement of the decking caused the accident, and so found against Sylvan. We are of the opinion that the evidence supports this verdict.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[179,1214,1148,1076]]]'>Mr. Dawson, an experienced ironworker and Acme’s foreman supervising plaintiff at the time of the accident, testified that the further from the beam the decking bundles are placed, the more strain is placed on the bar joists. He also testified that the bundles should have been placed on the joists closer to the points where they rested on beams in order to afford more support. From this testimony, which was uncontroverted, the jury could infer that the decking was negligently placed. We have often said that in cases of falling objects the proof necessary to establish negligence under the circumstances need be only slight. <em>Stewart v. Morow, </em><a href="/pa/403/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="403 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1299546" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0459-01">403 Pa. 459</a>, 462, <a href="/citations/?q=170%20A.2d%20338" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="170 A.2d 338">170 A. 2d 338</a> (1961); <em>Rucinski v.

Prom the testimony of Mr. Dawson it appears that he and the members of his crew, including the plaintiff, were aware prior to the accident that the bar joists under the decking had bowed. Under these circumstances, appellant argues, plaintiff knew or should have known that a dangerous condition existed, and, by voluntarily entering the place of danger, he was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

First, as we have often stated, “[contributory negligence will be declared as a matter of law only where it is so clear that there is no room for fair and reasonable disagreement as to its existence.” <em>Szukics v. Ruch, </em><a href="/pa/367/0646-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="367 Pa. 646" data-case-ids="1228329" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0646-01">367 Pa. 646</a>, 649, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20A.2d%20903" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="81 A.2d 903">81 A. 2d 903</a> (1951) and cases there cited. For a more recent enunciation of the same principle see <em>Gregorius v. Safeway Steel Scaffolds Co., </em><a href="/pa/409/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="409 Pa. 578" data-case-ids="1883266" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0578-01">409 Pa. 578</a>, 582, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20A.2d%20646" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="187 A.2d 646">187 A. 2d 646</a> (1963) and cases there cited. Second, “[w]here a person, having a choice of two ways, one of which is perfectly safe, and the other of which is subject to risks and dangers, voluntarily chooses the latter and is injured, he is guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.” <em>DeFonde v. Keystone Valley Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/386/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="386 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1268303" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0433-01">386 Pa. 433</a>, 434, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.2d%20439" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="126 A.2d 439">126 A. 2d 439</a> (1956) and cases there cited. Third, <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>“[i]n determining the standard of conduct of one who is injured in the performance of his employment, the working conditions and all of the circumstances incident thereto, including his obligation to do his job, must be considered.” <em>Gregorius v. Safeway Steel Scaffolds Co., supra, </em>at 584. And fourth, “[w]hen a workman in the discharge of his duties proceeds from a place where it is necessary for him to be to another place where it is necessary for him to go, the law will not proclaim him guilty of contributory negligence if he moves over a route unknown to him, in the exercise of his normal faculties, to be dangerous.” <em>Cooper v. Heintz Mfg. Co., </em><a href="/pa/385/0296-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="385 Pa. 296" data-case-ids="1267103" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0296-01">385 Pa. 296</a>, 307, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20A.2d%20699" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="122 A.2d 699">122 A. 2d 699</a> (1956).</p>

He could not, therefore, testify as to his motivation in choosing to walk under the bar joists or his assessment of the danger involved. Mr. Dawson, who was present at the time of the accident, testified, however, that plaintiff had chosen to walk beneath the bar joists because a ridge of higher ground existed there running between puddles of water on each side. Thus, this route was the most convenient. Because he was acting pursuant to an instruction from his foreman in obtaining the ladder, it may be inferred that this route was also the most expeditious. In his trade as a structural ironworker, plaintiff had had considerable experience around and upon unfinished steel skeletons, including precarious climbing on structural steel framework. He was required to exercise only due care under the circumstances of his employment and his experience. <em>Powell v. T. Bruce Campbell Construction Co., </em><a href="/pa/412/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="412 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1887262" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0456-01">412 Pa. 456</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20883" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="194 A.2d 883">194 A. 2d 883</a> (1963). Appellant contends that plaintiff’s experience should have heightened his appreciation of the danger presented by these sagging bar joists. At the same time, however, his experience would have made him less timid around and upon <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>structural steel work and better qualified than a non-steelworker to assess the degree of danger presented by a particular situation.</p>
    <p id="b369-4" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[140,555,1148,315]]]'>Plaintiff had little reason to appreciate that these bowed bar joists represented a significant danger to him. They had remained stationary and, though bowed, had supported the decking bundles for a week. In going to get the ladder almost immediately before the accident, he had taken the same route without mishap.</p>
    <p id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.6",369,[141,881,1146,424]]]'>Applying the legal principles summarized above to the facts of this case, we believe that reasonable minds could well have differed as to whether the plaintiff unreasonably placed himself in a situation known to him to be dangerous.

He also sustained a concussion and a ten-inch laceration of the scalp. He was hospitalized for 38 days and unemployed for almost a year. The testimony concerning the extent of plaintiff’s future disability as a structural ironworker was conflicting, but both medical experts agreed that he would be unsuited to working very far above the ground, a disability which would limit the amount of work available to him in his trade.</p>

The court noted, however, that plaintiff was employed at the time of the trial as a welder and foreman for Acme and was earning more per hour than he had before the accident. The court’s doubt as to the diminution in the plaintiff’s future earning power led it to consider the verdict excessive, and to order the remittitur.</p>

We of course have no way of knowing how much the jury allotted to these two important items, and we need not speculate. Suffice it to say that the injuries were undoubtedly serious and painful, and that although a good recovery was had, there was impairment of ability as a structural ironworker to work above the second story level, a limiting factor over plaintiff’s work-life expectancy of approximately twenty-eight years. We cannot say that the award shocks our sense of justice. <em>Weed v.
