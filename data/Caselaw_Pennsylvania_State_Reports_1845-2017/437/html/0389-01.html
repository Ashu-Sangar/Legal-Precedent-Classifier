Central System (herein collectively referred to as “the Railroad”) jointly for damages-for breach of an alleged contract to sell to Wise for the sum of $15,000 certain real estate owned by the Railroad in the Borough of Clearfield, Pennsylvania, and not needed for railroad purposes (“the property”). The defenses of the Raib road were that no contract had been entered into; that, if .there were a contract, it was made by agents, who had no authority to bind the Railroad; and that,• assuming an otherwise valid contract it did not meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. These inat: ters were left to the jury by the trial judge, who overruled the Railroad’s motions for compulsory nonsuit and for binding instructions. The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $23,500.

Unfortunately for the Railroad, however, the defense was not raised in the motion for new trial. No,error was claimed with regard to the court’s rulings on the points for charge. The new trial motion states (point 4) that “[t]he court erred in its charge to the jury”, but this is obviously too general to merit attention. The subject of the Statute of Frauds is not men: tioned in the lower court’s opinion, and presumably was not argued before it.

All the terms of the sale, including the purchase price of $15,000, were apparently agreed upon by Wise and the Railroad personnel with whom he dealt, and were set forth in a written offer signed by Wise on a form submitted by the Railroad. Wise’s check for $1,500 “earnest money”, being 1/10 of the proposed purchase price, accompanied the offer and was deposited by the Railroad. The Railroad made no formal reply to the offer and no deed was ever tendered; In August, 1958, Mr. A. C. Fullerton, the Railroad’s Real Estate Manager, Eastern Section, wrote to Wise stating, in effect, that his offer was inadequate and could not be further considered. At a later date the hand money was returned. In the two and a half years which intervened between the submission of the • offer and its attempted rejection, several events took place:</p>

At trial, officers of the Railroad testified as to the formal procedures employed by the Railroad during the relevant period in effecting a sale of real estate owned by the corporation. In general, the Land and Tax Agent (later called Real Estate Agent), upon favorable review of a firm offer from a prospective purchaser, submitted, the proposal to other interested departments, primarily the Operating Department, Engineering Department and Freight Sales Department. If these departments had no objections to the transaction, the agent then referred the matter to the Vice President in charge of the Railroad’s real estate department. With his concurrence, the proposal went to the Board of Directors for authorization, which would be granted as'a matter of course. Without action by the Board <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>of Directors, no railroad official enjoyed the express power to complete a sale of any railroad property.

      <em>•■■■■ </em>In pretrial discovery proceedings, Wise came upon various letters and other inter-office and inter-departmental ■ correspondence within the Railroad organization referring to the Wise-Railroad transaction. A number of these were introduced into evidence at trial. As stated above, the Railroad strenuously argues that this was error. It contends that since these documents were entirely intra-mural, or in any event not communicated to Wise-, they could not be the basis of the conclusion that the offer was accepted by the Railroad, or the corollary conclusion that the Railroad agents had apparent authority to accept the offer, either by word or deed.

Preparation of a formal deed has been delayed pending agreement with the Borough for additional lands to be used for street purposes, abutting the proposed conveyance on the north and west.” On November 18, 1957, Mr. Fullerton, a key figure throughout the transaction, and by this time second in command to Mr. Boisi for the eastern area, wrote to Mr. <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>Clothier as follows: “In your letter of November 7, you cite an interest in purchasing by Woolridge- Coal Company. • I. have discussed this possibility with Industrial-Engineer Marshall and he concurs with me that the sale; to-E.

      <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[168,1770,1145,583]]]'> The new trial motion of the Railroad also assigned as error the refusal of .the Railroad’s point for binding instructions. This is npt a ground for a new trial, but only for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 286, §1, as amended, 12 P.S. §681. These are alternative motions seeking mutually exclusive remedies, and it is not proper to join them as one motion. <em>Manone v. Culp, Exr., </em><a href="/pa/350/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="350 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="461168" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0319-01">350 Pa. 319</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%201" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="39 A.2d 1">39 A. 2d 1</a> (1944); <em>Campdon v. Continental Assurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/305/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="305 Pa. 253" data-case-ids="1134593" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0253-01">305 Pa. 253</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20A.%20464" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="157 A. 464">157 Atl. 464</a> (1931). Here the Railroad filed no motion for judgment n.o.v. and is not entitled to have the record searched as if it had. We may say in passing, however, that our review of the record convinces us that the court was right in allowing the jury to pass on the questions of coutract, agency, and authority.</p>

        <em> </em>Clearly the mere fact that the letters were still retained by the Railroad as part of its records involved in this transaction was not a reason for their admission into evidence, bnt the court’s advancement of this inadequate reason was not prejudicial if the exhibits were otherwise admissible.</p>
