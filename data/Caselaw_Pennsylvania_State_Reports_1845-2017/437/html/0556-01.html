The filing of such praecipe, irrespective of whether the Prothonotary issued the writ or the Sheriff served it, constituted the “commencement” of an action under <em>Pa. R. Civ.

By reason of the provisions of <em>Pa. R. Civ. P. </em>1007(1) and (2), we must consider this complaint as a “pleading” and not a “process”. See: <em>Yefko v.

On July 21, 1967, Ehrhardt then secured a rule to show cause why Costello’s personal representative should not be substituted in the action against Costello. On July 31, 1967, Costello’s personal representative again filed preliminary objections and, shortly thereafter, by leave of court, filed an answer. On November 29, 1967, the preliminary objections of Costello’s personal representative were sustained by the court below and later, at the instance of Ehrhardt, the judgment from which the instant appeal stems was entered in favor of Costello’s personal representative and against Ehrhardt.</p>
