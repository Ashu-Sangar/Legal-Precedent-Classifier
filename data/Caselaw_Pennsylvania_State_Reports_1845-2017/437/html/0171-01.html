By written agreement dated May 18, 1947 Milton agreed to main<a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>tain as Ms last will and testament Ms then existing will which bequeathed his entire estate to Lena, and in consideration of such promise, Lena agreed to bequeath three-fourths of the estate which she owned at the time of her death to certain relatives of Milton and to their issue, per stirpes. In explanation of such action, the agreement stated that Milton had received a substantial portion of his existing estate from his parents, that he desired Lena to have entire ownership of the income and principal during her lifetime, and that whatever was left should be returned to Milton’s family line.</p>
    <p id="b267-4" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[161,1075,1153,645]]]'>Milton’s will did bequeath his entire estate to Lena. At ■ the time of his death, the value of assets owned jointly by Milton and Lena had an approximate value of $260,000 while the value of assets owned by Milton individually was approximately $1900. As of January 22, 1965, the date of Lena’s death, the value of her estate, including the assets of a trust created by her on- February 11, 1963, was approximately $786,000.

The will further provided for the annulment and revocation of the bequest to any beneficiary who sought to enforce the 1917 agreement. . Lena’s executor, appellant, took the position that the 1917 agreement was invalid and unenforceable because of the failure of the actual intended consideration and that any claim based on the agreement would cause the forfeiture of any bequest to the claimant. .

In Section 601 it states, “[t]he only deductions from the value of the property transferred shall be those set forth in this Article.” Section 631 says “[a] 11 liabilities of the decedent shall be deductible, subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth.” Section 632 represents one of those limitations and states: “Except as otherwise provided in sections 638 and 639 [not relevant to this action], the deductions hereinafter set forth for indebtedness of the decedent, when founded upon a promise or agreement, shall be limited to the extent that it was contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth.” The purpose of this section and the similar provisions of the federal estate tax law, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A72053" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="26 U.S.C. §2053">26 U.S.C.A. §2053</a> (c), is to prevent the depletion of a decedent’s taxable estate by the creation of indebtedness intended as a substitute for a taxable bequest. “The purpose <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>of the phrase under discussion was, in our opinion, to prevent a man from diminishing his taxable estate by creating obligations not meant correspondingly to increase it but intended as gifts or a means of distributing it after his death.” <em>Commissioner v.

    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[127,952,1150,908]]]'>• ■ It is appellant’s contention that he is not subject to the limitation contained in Section 632 because that section “has no application to damage claims for breach of an alleged contract whose validity is repudiated by decedent and her executor and not established, or to a payment made by decedent’s executor, not in compliance with such agreement, but in compromise of litigation involving its validity.” In dealing with the claimants, it was appellant’s position that the agreement was invalid and unenforceable because of :a failure of the intended' consideration in ¡that Lena was going to receive $260,000 of the $262,000 by operation of law regardless of what Milton provided in his will. It is not necessary for us to determine whether appellant was correct in taking that position. He has chosen to assert the inapplicability of Section 632<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and is bound by that choice.</p>

He states “[t]he deduction for such payment, therefore, was not subject to the limitation imposed by Section 632, but was authorized as a <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>payment made in good faith in settlement of damage claims for breach of an agreement whose validity was contested and not established.” Before a taxpayer is entitled to a deduction, he must indicate what section of the statute provides for that deduction. Appellant nowhere states what section would permit the deduction of a payment made in compromise of a claim that the executor contends is spurious. Appellant assumes that a deduction follows naturally and automatically from a finding that Section 632 does not apply. Section 639 provides that liabilities arising from the decedent’s torts are deductible, but there is no hint that a tort was involved in this situation. The only section upon which appellant could rely is Section 631 which provides for deducting all liabilities of the decedent. He, however, can not assert simultaneously that the contract was invalid and unenforceable and hence not subject to Section 632, and that a payment in compromise of that claim (although invalid and unenforceable) is deductible as a liability of the decedent.</p>

L. 373, 72 P.S. §§2485-101 to 2485-1201. It is my opinion that the claim presented by Milton Lazar’s designees was a liability of Lena Lazar’s estate within the meaning of §631, 72 P.S. §2485-631, and that the payment made in satisfaction of that claim was therefore deductible <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>unless otherwise excludable. The mere fact that a claim or debt is contested does not render it any less a liability, which I define as any obligation which may be enforeable through legal compulsion. The settlement, which I assume to have been made in good faith, did nothing more than fix a value for and discharge a previously unliquidated liability.</p>
    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[162,800,1148,864]]]'>However, it is my view that §632 of the act, 72 P.S. §2485-632, disallows any deduction for the payment made in satisfaction of this liability. Section 632 provides that: “Except as otherwise provided in sections 638 and 639, the deductions hereinafter set forth for indebtedness of the decedent, when founded upon a promise or agreement, shall be limited to the extent that it was contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s Avorth.” I think it clear that this liability was “foundded upon a promise or agreement” Avithin the meaning of §632. The designees’ claim Avas grounded in and dependent upon the 1947 agreement between Milton and Lena, and I cannot believe that the intervening negotiations and litigation in any way affected the genesis of the asserted liability.</p>

But it is clear to me that §632 requires more than just legally sufficient consideration. Ninety-nine percent of Milton Lazar’s property Avas held by the entireties with his <em>Avife; </em>therefore the only consideration which he could have passed to Lena as compensation for her promise to leave his designees seventy-five percent of her estate was the right to possibly inherit some $2,000. Since this is hardly <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>“adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth,” I believe that the fl50,000 payment was nondeductible.</p>

This Court construed the same statutory language which is involved in this case in <em>Hitchcock Estate, </em><a href="/pa/385/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="385 Pa. 569" data-case-ids="1267091" data-case-paths="/pa/385/0569-01">385 Pa. 569</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.2d%20360" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="124 A.2d 360">124 A. 2d 360</a> (1956). The facts there were very much the same as those here, except that the promise of the surviving spouse to provide for the heirs of the deceased husband was contained in a “joint will and contract” instead of in a separate agreement. The widow, by a codicil after her husband died, limited the bequests to her husband’s side of the family to one-half of the joint estate as it existed at the date of his death. The value was greater at the time of her death, and the husband’s heirs asserted a claim against the estate for one-half of the higher value. The claim was compromised at 43%. The widow’s executor contended that the amount paid in the settlement of the testamentary claims was a proper deduction in calculating the clear value of the estate subject to inheritance tax. The Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Charles Alvin Jones, held that the payments were not supported by adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth; that they were in effect “testamentary, bene<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>factions and not debts.” The reciprocal promises between husband and wife were sufficient to support the agreement and to constitute it an enforceable contract, but not adequate under the Act to qualify as a deduction. The fact that a “genuine dispute” existed as to the amount payable to the claimants did not convert the amount paid to damages for breach of contract, and so a deductible item; “whatever the husband’s relatives were entitled to receive of the estate remaining after Mrs. Hitchcock’s death they took under and by virtue of the joint will and not otherwise.”</p>
