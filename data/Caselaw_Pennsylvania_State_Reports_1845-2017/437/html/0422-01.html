Pretrial, Reece filed a timely motion to suppress certain evidence, i.e., a quantity of marijuana seized by the police in connection with his arrest. After a hearing, this motion was denied. Later, the challenged evidence was introduced at trial over objection. The jury returned a guilty verdict. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment or for a new trial were dismissed, and a sentence was imposed. An appeal to the Superior Court resulted in an affirmance of the judgment by an equally divided court. We granted allocatur and now reverse.</p>

A thorough search revealed only a minute residue of amphetamine powder found in a small ball of cotton.</p>

      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>During the course of the evening (between 8:00 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. of the following morning) approximately fifteen people arrived at the apartment—all of whom were searched by the police. Some were found to be carrying narcotic drugs, while others were not. Charges were preferred against those who were found to be in possession of such drugs.</p>
    <p id="b519-3" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[126,764,1150,1073]]]'>The critical minutes in this case began at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of December 10, 1967, with a knock on the apartment door. The door was slightly ajar and after the knock, Reece and a friend entered the apartment. A police lieutenant, dressed in street clothes, was standing directly inside the doorway. One of the two told him that they were looking for some friends who were supposed to be at the apartment. Thereupon, the lieutenant identified himself by name, rank and position in the police department, read to them from a printed card the “Miranda” warnings<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and asked them if they understood what he had said (while his words were addressed to both, we will focus hereinafter on what was said and done to Reece). Reece acknowledged that he understood his rights. The lieutenant next told him that his clothing and person would be searched. At this point, the lieutenant took possession of the coat Reece was <em>wearing. </em>(By his own testimony the lieutenant is uncertain whether he asked Reece to remove his coat or simply took it from him.)</p>

      <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>The police lieutenant then proceeded to search the coat while another officer searched Reece’s person. In a pocket of the coat a small amount of marijuana was found. Reece was immediately placed under arrest. On the basis of the marijuana found in the coat, a search warrant was subsequently secured authorizing a search of the apartment where Reece resided. In the course of a search of this apartment, additional marijuana was found and seized. The marijuana seized in the two searches, before related, was used as evidence against Reece at trial. The central question for decision is whether or not the searches and seizures were constitutionally valid, for if such were not the case, evidentiary use of the seized evidence would violate due process of law. <em>Ker v.

There was nothing about his demeanor or conduct which would in any way suggest that he was “on drugs”, or that he had drugs in his possession; in reality, the only possible basis for the arrest was his appearance on the scene, where a “pot party” was expected to occur.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[128,924,1146,259]]]'>We have previously held that mere presence at the scene of a crime, coupled with a prior criminal conviction, does not constitute probable cause for an arrest. <em>Commonwealth v.

Evidence of this fact is of some weight in proving substantive crimes where the inference might be drawn that an accused was in some way involved in the commission of the crime. But here, the crime which had been committed in the apartment was the possession of narcotic drugs. Reece’s appearance there could in no way implicate him in that crime since such a’crime by its very nature is unique to the individual; By definition, the possessor is the only person who could commit this crime. Guilt by association thus becomes the rationale of the arrest here. This is unacceptable.</p>

He had <em>observed Sibron continually during an eight-hour period </em>during which time he saw Sibron in conversation with six or eight known narcotics <em>addicts. </em>Toward the end of this eight-hour period, the officer observed Sibron enter a restaurant and converse with three more known narcotics addicts there. Sibron was subsequently arrested and searched. The United States Supreme Court (speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Warben) stated that the prosecution “quite properly abandoned the notion” that probable cause existed at the time of the arrest: “The inference that persons who talk to narcotics <em>addicts </em>are engaged in the criminal traffic in narcotics is simply not the sort of reasonable inference required to support an intrusion by the police upon an individual’s personal security.
