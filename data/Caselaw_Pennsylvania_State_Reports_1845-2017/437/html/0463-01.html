A cause of action in. assumpsit was brought by General Electric Credit Corporation (GECC) to recover on seven fire insurance policies, each issued by a different insurance company but through the same agent, for damage to personal property caused by a fire on October 28,. 1963. The personal property, of which GECC was conditional vendor, consisted of equipment in the Silver Spur. Restaurant in Monroeville, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The jury returned a verdict in favor of GÉCC for f50,000 -against five of the seven insurance companies involved, and the other two insurance: companies were held not liable. A subsequent motion for a new trial by GECC was denied. GECC now brings one appeal, asserting errors in the trial and in' the charge of the court below, which it alleges entitle it to a new-trial, as'to all seven defendants.</p>

This status was known to the insurance agent, but he nevertheless designated First National Bank as a mortgagee in the Standard Mortgagee Clause in the policy issued. The Court held there that a provision in a policy insuring an owner of property, making loss payable to a third person as first mortgagee, imports a condition that, to be entitled to receive the amount of the loss or damage, such beneficiary must have a mortgage upon the property. It went on to say, however, that where the insurer has knowledge at the time of the issuance of the policy that the interest of the beneficiary is other than that of mortgagee, it is estopped from asserting a breach of the condition in an action by the beneficiary. Knowledge of the facts by the agent authorized to issue the policy was there deemed knowledge by the insurance company.</p>

The Court limited the application of the enunciated doctrine to those situations where the inserted incorrect condition is advantageous to the insurer. The rule was held not applicable where the inserted provision is intended to operate in favor of the insured or one who derives his claim through the insured, by enlarging the insurer’s liability. Previously, First National Bank had only been insured under a beneficiary loss payable clause<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> (under which the beneficiary’s rights are derivative from the insured’s and any defense against the insured can be set up against the beneficiary), had expressed no <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>clear intention of increasing its coverage so as to protect itself against acts or neglect of the insured, and could not have done so because such a provision was not authorized by statute in the case of judgment creditors. Therefore, First National Bank could not take advantage of the provision in the Standard Mortgagee Clause protecting a mortgagee despite any act or neglect of the insured, because this would have enlarged the insurer’s liability from that which would have existed had no mistake occurred. As such, the Newark Fire Insurance Co. was not estopped from raising the defense against First National Bank of the fraudulent burning perpetrated by the insured.</p>

Thus the mistaken inclusion of GECC as mortgagee instead of lender’s loss payee did not increase the insurers’ liability nor aid GECC. It solely operated to the advantage of the insurers by restricting recovery to mortgagees. GECC could not satisfy this status condition, and the insurers through their agent, Mr. Mattey, were allegedly aware of this. In addition, by Attorney Makoroff’s uncontradicted testimony, GECC clearly intended to protect itself despite any acts or neglect of the insured. The inclusion of the Lender’s Loss Payable Clause in five of the seven policies corroborates this intent. In this case, therefore, the general rule enunciated in <em>First National Bank v. Newark Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, is applicable. Attorney Makoroff’s testimony was admissible to attempt to establish the <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>facts as alleged, and tlie jury should have been instructed that if they believed the testimony of Attorney Makoroff, as a matter of law, The American Insurance Company and The American Casualty Company are es-topped from asserting the condition of mortgagee in avoidance of their liabilities.

Parol evidence is generally admissible for the purpose of showing that, by reason of a mutual mistake, a written instrument does not truly express the intention of the parties. But to obtain the reformation of a contract because of mutual mistake, the moving party is required to show the existence of the mutual mistake by evidence that is clear, precise and convincing. This requires evidence by two witnesses or by one witness and corroborating circumstances: <em>Bugen v. N. </em>Y. <em>Life Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Easton v. Wash. Co. Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>

Wash. Co. Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Broida v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>supra. Attorney Makoroff’s credibility is enhanced by the very substantial corroborating circumstances in this ease. The Lender’s Loss Payable Clause allegedly requested by GECC was in fact included in five of the seven insurance policies issued to GECC. The clause so inserted in all five policies was a standard form clause, Form No. 544-Edition Date 6/54. No reasonable justification is raised in defense why GECC would ever have wanted different coverages in the seven policies, and the designation of GECC as mortgagee only in some policies, as lender’s loss payee in one and as both in others supports Attorney Makoroff’s testimony concerning Mr. Mattey’s belief, or at least uncertainty, over the proper clause to adequately protect GECC. Attorney Makoroff’s intent seemed clear, however. This evidence, therefore, met the standard of being clear, precise and convincing so as to support a reformation of the insurance contract for mutual mistake, if the jury believed the testimony of Attorney Makoroff.
