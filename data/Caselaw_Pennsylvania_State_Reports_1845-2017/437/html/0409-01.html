The writ of summons was issued but never served on Becker.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Up to the time of oral argument of this appeal, appellants did not reissue the writ and Becker died, unserved with the writ of summons, on March 25, 1968. At the time of his death, Becker was not a <em>party </em>to any action instituted by appellants. On February 24, 1969, appellants filed <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>a complaint in trespass<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> to the same term, and number against Becker. That complaint was never, nor could, it have been, served upon Becker. On April 21, 1969, appellants then sought to proceed under <em>Pa. R. Civ. P. </em>2077(a)(1) and 2079 (a)(1) and (2) by serving, by registered mail, the Secretary of the Commonwealth and Becker at his last known address.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

O’Brien, a nephew of Becker, the presently-styled “amicus curiae,” appeared in the court below and filed a pleading termed “Preliminary Objections to Complaint Against and Service on Deceased Defendant,” on the basis of which the court below entered its order sustaining such objections. O’Brien, although not a party of record, filed the preliminary objections above referred to in the court below, Which objections led to the order from which the instant appeal was taken and, in fact, was the “moving party” in the court below. O’Brien appeared, through counsel, in. our Court, as amicus curiae and, at oral argument, it was made evident that his intervention into the litigation was inspired by Becker’s insurance carrier.</p>
