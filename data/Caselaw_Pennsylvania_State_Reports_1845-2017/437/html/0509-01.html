The Restatement (Second), Torts, §314 (1965) states that as long as the actor’s conduct has not placed another in peril “[t]he fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another’s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.” This Court, in <em>Yania v. </em>Bigan, <a href="/pa/397/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="397 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1286270" data-case-paths="/pa/397/0316-01">397 Pa. 316</a>, 321-2, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.2d%20343" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="155 A.2d 343">155 A. 2d 343</a>, 346 (1959), stated: “Lastly, it is urged that Bigan failed to take the necessary steps to rescue Yania from the water. The mere fact that Bigan saw Yania in a position of peril in the water imposed upon him no legal, although a moral, obligation or duty to go to his rescue unless Bigan was legally responsible, in whole or in part, for placing Yania in the perilous position.” Behind this is the “rugged individualism” approach of the common law and “the feeling that it is a more serious restraint on personal freedom to require a person to act than it is to place limits on his liberty to act.” McNiece and Thornton, <em>Affirmative Duties in Tort. </em><a href="/citations/?q=58%20Yale%20L.J.%201272" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="58 Yale L.J. 1272">58 Yale L.

Usually the <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>basis for the departure from the general rule has been the existence of a special relationship between the parties which, it is felt, is sufficient to transform the moral duty into a legal one. 2 Harper and James, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>§18.6 at 1048 (1956); Note, <em>Good Samaritans and Liability for Medical Malpractice, </em>64 Col.

Appellant does not contend that appellee refused to offer assistance after she suffered her injuries. Rather, she states that appellee did not act to protect her financial interests. This is a step towards making a common carrier the guardian of all its passengers’ interests that no court has yet taken. “The courts seem to have been somewhat more willing to impose liability on this basis when there has been physical injury to persons or property than where the injury is to the interest in financial advantage.” 2 Harper and James, supra, §18.6, n. 7 at 1046.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The interest in the passenger’s physical well-being is sufficiently import<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>ant to require the carrier to act to protect it even when the injury is no fault of the carrier’s.

The penalty for violating that section is a fine of $10 or a maximum of five days in prison. The dissent would have us transform that duty to one in favor of any person injured in the accident and impose as a penalty for noncompliance not the nominal fine of $10 but the total amount of damages suffered by that individual.

Stupka, was a passenger in a taxicab operated by Peoples Oab Company [Peoples] when it was struck in the rear by another vehicle. The taxicab was stopped at the time of the accident and there is no claim that the accident was in any way caused by the actions of the cab driver. <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>Plaintiff averred, in her complaint that, immediately after the accident, the taxicab driver got out of his cab and spoke with the driver of the other vehicle, but did not secure that driver’s name or license number before the unknown driver left the scene of the accident. On these facts, plaintiff sought recovery from Peoples [Peoples]. Her theory was that the taxicab driver owed her a duty to secure the hit-and-run driver’s name and license number, and that his failure to perform that duty constituted such negligence so as to permit her to recover from Peoples for her injuries.</p>
    <p id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[185,974,1146,367]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, in passing upon People’s preliminary objections to the complaint of plaintiff, held that the carrier owed no duty to the passenger to investigate the facts of the accident so as to aid the passenger in possible future litigation and, therefore, sustained People’s preliminary objections. Plaintiff then appealed to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.6",608,[185,1354,1147,357]]]'>Initially, it should be mentioned that this appears to be a totally unique claim by the plaintiff. Our research fails to locate any case in any jurisdiction even vaguely apposite to the case at bar.

Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/417/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="417 Pa. 610" data-case-ids="1893962" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0610-01">417 Pa. 610</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=209%20A.2d%20261" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="209 A.2d 261">209 A. 2d 261</a> (1965). The facts pleaded by the plaintiff clearly establish that her injuries were caused by the apparently negligent driving of an unknown third party. Even if this were to create a duty on the part of the taxicab driver to secure the other driver’s name and license number, the breach of that duty in the case at bar was still not the proximate cause of the appellant’s injuries. Such a breach, at most, prevented plaintiff from suing the unknown driver. However, we have no <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>basis to conclude that the suit would have been successful. It would, therefore, be impossible to assess damages against the appellee in any case. If the measure of damages were taken to be the amount of plaintiff’s injuries, this Court would effectively be making either one of two unjustified findings: (1) the Court would be declaring that plaintiff would have won her action against the unknown driver, and we have no power to so declare; (2) the Court would be stating that appellee’s breach <em>caused </em>the injuries of the plaintiff, which it' did not.</p>
    <p id="b609-3" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[123,976,1152,805]]]'>' The reason for such an unsatisfactory dilemma is that there is no causal relationship between the appellee’s failure to act and the plaintiff’s injuries. Even in jurisdictions which permit recovery where a carrier has failed to assist a passenger who has been injured en route, any recovery is limited to the aggravation of injury which is directly attributable to the carrier’s delay or failure to render assistance. Annot., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20A.L.R.%202d%20656" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="92 A.L.R. 2d 656">92 A.L.R. 2d 656</a>, 658 (1963). Recovery must be limited to compensation for the physical injuries directly caused by the carrier’s action or inaction. In the case at bar, plaintiff’s injuries were not caused by any act or omission to act on the part of the appellee and consequently, plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient grounds upon which to base a cause of action against the appellee.</p>

    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[201,807,1146,748]]]'>I do not contend that Peoples had a duty “to investigate the facts of the accident so as to aid the passenger in possible future litigation”, but I do believe that Peoples had a simple duty to ascertain the identity of the other driver when he was readily available and did, in fact, converse with Peoples’ driver subsequent to the accident. Such a duty on behalf of its passenger is surely not too much to impose upon a common carrier. When Peoples failed to perform this simple duty, it rendered impossible a recovery by the plaintiff against the unknown driver. It is for this reason that I believe Peoples is liable and not because there is a causal connection between Peoples’ negligence and the plaintiff’s physical injuries.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[201,1566,1145,689]]]'>The majority opinion refuses to recognize this duty, labelling it a “moral” duty as opposed to a legal one. It reasons that, despite the trend in the law towards the conversion of moral duties into legal ones where a special relationship, such as common carrier and passenger, exists between the parties, such a trend should only be followed where the interest being protected is the passenger’s physical well-being as opposed to his financial well-being. It argues that the interest in a passenger’s financial well-being is outweighed by an interest in not imposing an affirmative duty to act on the carrier where it was not responsible for placing the passenger in the original position of peril.</p>

L. 58, §1217, as amended June 2, 1965, P. L. 93, §1, 75 P.S. §1217, requires the operator of any motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in <em>inter alia, </em>bodily injury, to furnish a report of the accident to the Department of Motor Vehicles, upon forms furnished by the Department. These forms, of course, require the identity of the operators to be supplied. The fact that the penalty for violation of this duty is small does not make it any less a duty. Where the carrier already has the duty, albeit to the Commonwealth, to ascertain the identity of the other driver, it is nonsense to contend that the court is protecting individual freedom by denying plaintiffs recovery for the carrier’s failure to act.</p>
