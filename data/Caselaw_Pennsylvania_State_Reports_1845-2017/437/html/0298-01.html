The Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, on January 30, 1967, appointed a board of view, which, after hearing, made an award to the Water Company in the amount of $81,668.00, the report of the board of view being Hied on March 5, 1968. On March 28, 1968— twenty-three days after the filing of the award of the board of view—the Commonwealth, acting through the Department of Highways, filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Although the record indicates that this letter—sent by certified mail, return receipt requested—bore the notation on the envelope thereof, “Notified April 6, 1968,” the notice was given not less than nine days and not more than eleven days after filing the appeal.</p>

Nothing therein mandates that service should be made other than within a reasonable time. See: Snitzer, <em>Pennsylvania Emi: nent Domain, </em>p. 229, wherein it is stated that failure ■to properly notify should result in an extension of the right to demand a trial by jury but “[i]t should not have any effect whatsoever upon the efficacy of the original appeal.”</p>

We disagree. While the delay in filing the affidavit of proof of service for such an unreasonable time cannot be condoned, we believe that, under the instant circumstances, the court below was proper in permitting the Commonwealth to file such affidavit <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>In <em>Miller, </em>we said: “In the absence of a time requirement for the filing of proof oí service of the copy of the appeal, such filing must be accomplished within a reasonable time subsequent to the filing of the appeal [citing authorities].” (<a href="/pa/424/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="424 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1904984" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0477-01">424 Pa. at 482</a>) “[T]he purpose, of the service, as well as the proof of service, is to insure that the opposing party is advised of the appeal, and whether a jury trial had been demanded. §516 (a) (5) gives fifteen days to the opposing party after being served with the notice to demand a jury trial if it has been waived.” Snitzer, <em>Pennsylvania Eminent Domain, </em>pp. 228-229.</p>

The requirement that an affidavit be filed in proof of service is of importance only in the instance of a challenge to service of a copy of such appeal. The Water Company had appropriate notice that the Commonwealth had filed its appeal and did not then nor does it now challenge the fact that it was served with notice of the appeal within a reasonable time after filing. The contention that the untimely filing of the affidavit in proof of the <em>unchallenged </em>service in this case would nullify the appeal is without merit.</p>
