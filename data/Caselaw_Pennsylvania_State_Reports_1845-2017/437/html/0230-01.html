    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.9",325,[128,759,1148,747]]]'>On May 19, 1962, at about 10:15 p.m., an automobile which was owned and operated by Dr. Anthony C. Gagliano collided with a tractor and hay wagon owned by Benjamin F. Hitchens, Jr. and operated by his employee, Richard Ditzler. Gagliano and his passengers (his wife and four children) instituted a suit in trespass in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County against Ditzler and Hitchens, which resulted in a verdict for Gagliano in the amount of $650 and verdicts for the five passengers in the amounts of $170 each. The other plaintiffs accepted their verdicts, but Gagliano filed a motion for a new trial. On November 16, 1967, the court en banc granted a new trial limited to the issue of damages.</p>
    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.10",325,[126,1517,1149,266]]]'>On appeal, a majority of the Superior Court modified the lower court’s order and granted a new trial generally, rather than limiting the new trial to the issue of damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We granted allocatur on February 20, 1969.</p>

L. 58, §801, as amended, 75 P.S. §801 (g) (1) (Supp. 1969). On the other hand, Ditzler testified that, when he saw Gagliano’s car approaching, he pulled his rig off to the side of the road and was actually-stopped, approximately three feet off the road, when the accident occurred, Gagliano’s car* striking the left front corner of the hay wagon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus, Ditzler claimed that it was Gagliano who was driving in the center of the road.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[196,865,1146,422]]]'>Extensive testimony was presented at trial as to the seriousness of Gagliano’s personal injuries. His car suffered about |500 worth of damage. The record indicates that the questions of whether Ditzler was negligent and, if so, whether such negligence proximately caused Gagliano’s personal injuries were sharply disputed in the court below. Conflicting direct evidence was offered by both sides on virtually every point.</p>
