Said premises, together with several other properties, were condemned by the Redevelopment Authority of the City of Oil City as a part of an urban renewal project. The condemnation was prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of che Eminent Domain Code, Act of June 22, 1964 (1964 Special Session) P. L. -84, 26 P.S. §1-101 et seq.

The case was then tried before a judge without a jury, and a judgment was finally entered in Singer’s favor in the sum of $60,-790.50, allocated as follows: $55,000 for damages to real estate; $5,000 for business dislocation and loss of patronage under Section 609 of the Eminent Domain Code; and $790.50 for moving expenses under Section 610 of the Eminent Domain Code. In the court below, Singer claimed that certain items of machinery and fixtures used in the operation of the grocery store constituted part of the real estate taken under the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine, and if this were so, he was entitled to be compensated in an additional amount of $22,855<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> for damages to the real estate. In the alternative, Singer contended that if the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine did not apply, he was en<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>titled to additional damages of $17,725 for the reasonable expenses of removing, transporting and reinstalling the machinery, equipment and fixtures under Section 608 of the Eminent Domain Code.

Under Section 609 a condemnee is entitled to damages for dislocation of a business located on the condemned property where he shows that the business cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of patronage.

On that basis the rights and duties of each must be determined. It is intolerable that the State, after condemning a factory or warehouse, should surrender to the owner a stock of second-hand machinery and in so doing discharge the full measure of its duty. Severed from the building, such machinery commands only the prices of second-hand articles; attached to a going plant, it may produce an enhancement of value as great as it did when new. The law gives no sanction to so obvious an in: justice as would result if the owner were held to forfeit all these elements of value.”</p>

It is too narrow in that there seems no logical justification for preserving the <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>economic position of industrial plants while giving no such protection to commercial, service and other economic units. While this distinction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> may have merit in ¡the areas of industrial mortgages and municipal taxation, the reasoning behind the distinction does not extend to eminent domain where a forced sale affects all economic units equally. We feel compelled, therefore, to abolish the distinction as it relates to eminent domain, and formulate what is in essence an Assembled Economic Unit Doctrine, the same theory of the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine adapted to supplement the Eminent Domain Code. That there is a need for such we will later demonstrate.</p>
    <p id="b159-3" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[131,1111,1150,692]]]'>The reasoning in <em>Jackson, </em>supra, is too broad, when viewed in conjunction with the Eminent Domain Code, in that it considers all condemnations to be enforced sales. The Eminent Domain Code attempts to limit the enforced sale to only the building and land on which the business is located. By making provision for removal, transportation and reinstallation compensation for the other elements of the business, the condemnation becomes merely an enforced relocation of the business. Only when such relocation of the business, as a unit, cannot take place does the injustice pointed out by Judge Cardozo result. A few examples will illustrate this distinction.</p>

The economic position of the condemnee is preserved in this case, without the applicability of the Assembled Economic Unit Doctrine, for the Code provides: (1) in §608 for the reimbursement of expenses incurred in removing, transporting and reinstalling machinery, equipment and fixtures <em>not forming </em>a part of the real estate of the condemned structure; (2) in §610 for the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in moving personal property other than machinery, equipment and fixtures (inventory would be included in this category) ; and (3) in §609 for damages resulting from a substantial loss of patronage due to the relocation. Being, in addition, compensated under §602 for the land and building taken, the condemnee is left in the same economic position he would have been in had there been no condemnation, except he is in a new location.</p>

He always has the option of relocating the business until such time as the market becomes favorable. In addition, if a significant portion of the value of his business is derived from his steady patrons, he may still receive damages under §609, even if he chooses not to relocate and sells the business to another.</p>

To hold otherwise would leave condemnee only with scattered pieces of second-hand machinery, equipment arid fixtures, most probably significantly depreciated in value when severed from the economic unit. Since the condemnee cannot maintain his economic position by moving to a new location, the statutory scheme will not grant him “just compensation” without the applicability of the Assembled Economic Unit Doctrine.</p>

The condemnor-appellee thereafter presented to the lower court its request for Statement of Facts and Conclusions of Law for the purpose of filing exceptions to or taking an appeal from the decision of the lower court! The plaintiff made no such request.</p>

(2) The plaintiff was not entitled to damages under §608 of the Eminent Domain Code, specifying no reasons for the latter. Appellee excepted to the first conclusion of law. Ap<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>pellant made no exceptions. Upon reconsideration of the issue, the lower court sustained the appellee’s exception, without referring to any possible change in result in the second conclusion of law. The appellant appealed from the sustaining of the exception, and that issue is properly here on appeal. But is appellant precluded from appealing the denial of damages under §608 by his failure to except to the findings of the lower court as is. required by the Act of 1874, as amended, supra?</p>
    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[225,934,1148,1184]]]'>Although it does seem to be a technical violation of the statute not to have excepted to the lower court’s finding against the appellant on the law concerning §608, it must be remembered that a finding that the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine applied negatived any recovery under §608. The ‘two theories were of necessity exclusive. If the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine applied, any machinery and equipment forming an essential and necessary part of the plant which Avas a permanent installation therein is considered a part, of the realty. Such a finding negatives any recovery under §608, because this section only permits recovery for machinery and equipment “ not part of the real estate.”- In such a situation, it is not practical to require the appellant to except to one of the findings of the lower court. If the reason for the denial of the compensation under §608 Avas the finding by the court of the applicability of the Assembled Industrial Plant Doctrine, - when the loAver court later reversed itself on this issue, appellant should not be precluded from arguing a basis of possible recovery that had been argued beloAV as an alternative.</p>

The appellant did not remove, transport and reinstall the equipment and machinery here at issue. Instead he terminated his business, removed the majority of the equipment, disposed of it by sale on the premises to third parties, who transported it from the premises for whatever use they might have for it, or removed some to his storage and abandoned the remainder. The appellant contends that he should be awarded, as damages, what his reasonable expenses <em>might have been </em>had he chosen to remove, transport it and reinstall it in a new place of business. It is not clear that this is compensable under the statute, nor is it clear that this was not an additional basis for the trial court’s denial of recovery under §608.</p>
