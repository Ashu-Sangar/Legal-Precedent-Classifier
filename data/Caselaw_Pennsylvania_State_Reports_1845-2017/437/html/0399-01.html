Reed, supra. </em>The ministerial act here sought to be compelled was the issuance of a building permit. Appellants alleged facts which, in their opinion, éstablish the invalidity of the zoning ordinance, and further alleged that “[t]here are no [other] restrictions or regulations on the use of the aforementioned land. . .” Assuming the truth of these allegations and the soundness of appellants’ legal position as to the ordinance,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> what need did appellants then have <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>for a building permit which was a requirement of the invalid ordinance? None is set forth in the complaint. On the other hand, if the facts alleged do not establish the legal invalidity of the ordinance, then appellants have no right to the permit.

More importantly, the court below was also correct in holding that appellants had another adequate, statutory remedy available and that mandamus, therefore, would not lie. This remedy was that provided in Section 2007 of the Second Class Township Code, Act of May 1, 1933, P. L. 103, as amended, 53 P.S. §67007. That statute provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that any person aggrieved by a zoning officer’s decision could appeal to the Board of Adjustment, and, thereafter take a further appeal to the Court of Common Pleas if not satisfied by the Board’s action. Although repealed as of January 1, 1969, by The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P. L. , 53 P.S. §10101 et seq. (The Planning Code), the Second Class Township Code was in effect and available to appellant at the time of the denial of the building permit, and also on December 11, 1968, when the present suit was commenced.</p>

Moreover, Section 910 of The Planning Code goes on to provide: “Recognizing that challenges to the validity of an ordinance may present issues of fact and of interpretation which may lie within the special competence of the board, and to facilitate speedy disposition of such challenges by a court, <em>the board may hear all challenges wherein the validity of the ordinance presents any issue of fact or of interpretation. . . </em>At the conclusion of the hearing the board shall decide all contested questions of interpretation and shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact which shall become part of the record on appeal to the court.” (Emphasis supplied.) Section 910, read in its entirety, <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>evinces a legislative intent to preclude the hoard from making a determination of the legal validity of the ordinance; it appears that the legislature believed the resolution of a legal challenge of this sort would be better made initially by a court. But the section does not eliminate all functions of the board in such appeals; rather, it transforms the function into one of fact-finding, preparatory to a court determination as to validity.</p>
