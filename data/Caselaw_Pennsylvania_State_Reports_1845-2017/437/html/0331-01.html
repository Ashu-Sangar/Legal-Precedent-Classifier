    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[200,871,1147,798]]]'>On January 2, 1969, Fine visited the police precinct at 22nd Street and Hunting Park Avenue, again at the instance of the police, to witness another lineup. This line-up included D’Angelo, who had legal counsel present, and four other male Caucasians. During the proceedings, all were stripped to the waist. Among the five were three policemen who were wearing at the time police regulation dark blue trousers with a stripe of a lighter blue color running down the outside.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> D’Angelo was the only one wearing a mustache. No one wore sunglasses. Before the line-up commenced, D’Angelo’s counsel requested that the participating officers don civilian trousers and that his client be permitted to shave off his mustache. Both requests were denied.</p>
    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.8",428,[199,1690,1147,153]],["BL_429.1",429,[130,379,1148,373]]]'>Following this line-up, Fine was asked by the police lieutenant who arranged the proceedings if there was anyone in the line-up he could identify and, ac<a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>cording to the lieutenant’s testimony, Fine replied, “Number two man [D’Angelo] looks like the hold-up man but I can’t be sure.” The lieutenant then said, “You have to be sure: yes or no.” Fine replied, “No, I can’t be sure.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Whereupon, the lieutenant informed D’Angelo’s line-up counsel that his client would be released from custody.</p>
    <p id="b429-3" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[128,764,1151,916]]]'>On the following day, the police secured a warrant to search D’Angelo’s residence. The warrant was issued solely on the basis of information supplied to the magistrate in the form of an affidavit, which read as follows: “Probable cause and/or reasonable grounds is stated as follows, on 12/23/67, at 6:30 p.m., one Martin Fines [sic], owner of a grocery store located at 7000 Forrest Avenue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was accosted by a white male fitting the description of D’Angelo. This male was wearing a white turtleneck sweater, sunglasses and a black leather coat, and used a gun in the incident. D’Angelo has been identified as the person who entered Fines [sic] store on that daté and attempted to hold him up by point of gun. But would not say positively that D’Angelo was the person unless he could view the clothing that was worn by' the robber.”</p>

On January 4, 1968, this sweater was exhibited to Fine by police officers. Fine <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>then told the police for the first time that D’Angelo was the hold-up man. He also told them that he was sure of this when he saw him in the line-up, but didn’t say so at the time because he didn’t want to become involved. Based on this statement, the police caused an arrest warrant to issue and D’Angelo was again taken into custody. His indictment and trial followed.</p>

    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[191,1143,1146,535]]]'>It is clear from the record that the affidavit filed with the magistrate which caused the search warrant to issue was incorrect and misleading when it stated, “D’Angelo has been <em>identified </em>as the person who entered Fines [sic] store. . . .”, for the Commonwealth’s own evidence establishes that as of that moment this was not the case. (Emphasis ours.) This, in our view, so tainted the search that the evidentiary use of the fruits thereof violated due process of law and, in itself, requires a reversal of the conviction and judgment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
