In 1968, he brought post-conviction proceedings, maintaining that his sentence was actually five to ten years rather than the five to twenty years asserted by the Commonwealth authorities. The hearing court denied relief and the Superior Court affirmed per curiam, <a href="/pa-super/214/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="214 Pa.

      <em>“I will sentence him to five to twenty years </em>in the •Eastern Penitentiary. Have him sent to the Diagnostic Clinic and they will give Mm help and treatment ont there. They are well equipped to do that. If at the end of five years the evidence indicates that he is all right and no longer a menace, of course an application 'for parole can be made. But the extent of these crimes is so great that we have to have him at least under ■supervision for a long period of time. That is the best disposition I can think of.</p>

      <em>“Five to ten years </em>in the Eastern PeMtentiary, and to be sent to the Diagnostic Clinic.” (Emphasis added) The bill of indictment bears an endorsement prepared in a clerk’s handwriting, but signed by the judge, stating that the sentence is five to twenty years.</p>
    <p id="b315-4" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[139,1238,1149,968]]]'>The hearing court denied relief, relying upon statements in various Superior Court cases to the effect that the sentence recorded on the indictment controls. See <em>Com. ex rel. Spader v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa-super/187/0654-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="187 Pa.

As Judge Hoffman stated, these cases are all distinguishable for various reasons. <em>Scoleri </em>and <em>Spader </em>both involve “lumped sentences,” where the maximum sentence was, say, ten to twenty, and the court totalled two consecutive sentences and stated that he was sentencing to twenty to forty. When the relator asserted that his sentence was illegal, the court replied that the ten to twenty stamped on the indictment was what counted. <em>Middleton </em>involved sentences on two different indictments, where the notes of testimony, by a typographical error, showed the sentences reversed.</p>

The only sentence known to the law is the sentence or judgment entered upon the records of the court [citing cases]. If the entry is inaccurate, there is a remedy by motion to correct it to the end that it may speak the truth. People ex rel. Trainor v.

    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[199,1493,1148,263]]]'>In summary, the precedents relied on by the court below contemplate that a variance between the “sentence as written and as orally pronounced” may be questioned—but only by an appropriate “direct proceeding,” not by a writ of habeas corpus.</p>

    <p id="b317-3" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[156,566,1147,309]]]'>We thus come down to a situation where the sentencing judge has said two different things about the sentence, and has signed the stamped notation on the indictment. On the facts of the case, it is impossible to state with any certainty just what the trial judge intended.</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[156,894,1148,478]]]'>Unfortunately, we cannot aslc the trial judge to explain his intentions as he is deceased. The Commonwealth urges the trial judge’s statement in regard to appellant that “we have to have him at least under supervision for a long period of time” as evidence that a twenty year maximum was intended. We are not convinced. A ten year maximum is also a “long period of time.” The judge’s true intent is still clouded with ambiguity.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[156,1384,1148,697]]]'>Faced with such ambiguity, we will be guided, as was Judge Hoffman in his dissent in Superior Court, by Justice Frankfurter’s statement for the court in <em>Bell v.
