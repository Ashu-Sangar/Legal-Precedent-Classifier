In this connection, it is asserted: (1) that if the verdict winner accepts unqualifiedly the reduction, he consents to receive an amount he deems inadequate; (2) that if the verdict winner rejects the reduction, he is forced to undergo the expense, time and risks of a second trial; (3) that if the verdict winner appeals from the order of the court granting a new trial (resulting from the rejection of the remittitur), he is bound to defend the reasonableness of the verdict even though he may himself consider it excessive in some amount, as well as defend the verdict from attack on every other ground asserted for a new trial by the losing party.</p>

They did not attempt to present their arguments and still preserve the option of either accepting or rejecting the remittitur. They' clearly indicated that they did not want to relinquish the verdict if their choice was limited to either accepting the remittitur or appealing the grant of a new trial. They did not hide their inten<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>tions or deal deceitfully with either the trial court or with Curtis. All the Corabis wished to do was preserve “whatever rights” they might have had; they clearly said that if they had no further rights they wished to accept the remittitur.</p>
    <p id="b250-4" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[188,646,1148,960]]]'>How else could anyone obtain appellate review of whether a remittitur could be conditioned except by doing what the Corabis did? Clearly, if they had filed what the majority believes to be an unconditional remittitur they would have been foreclosed from any appeal on any issue. <em>Gough v. Halperin, </em><a href="/pa/306/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="306 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1136896" data-case-paths="/pa/306/0230-01">306 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.%20447" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="159 A. 447">159 Atl. 447</a> (1932); <em>Clarkson v.

And if they had refused to accept the remittitur the question would have been mooted and they would have had to accept the much less desirable appellate posture of resisting the grant of a new trial in place of the more comfortable position of supporting the award of a verdict. Since the Corabis could not have obtained appellate review of this interesting question in any other way without seriously prejudicing their case, I would not hold that their attempt, novel though it may have been, caused them to lose even their reduced verdict.</p>

Curtis’ rights would in no way be adversely affected if the language which sought to preserve, “whatever rights plaintiffs might have” was treated as surplusage and ignored. Further holding that the remittitur was effectively unconditional would put the case in the posture favored by the trial court. The trial court, after all, did not feel that, once the verdicts were reduced, Curtis deserved a new trial. The trial court affirmed the reduced verdict and held that it repre-. sented a fair adjudication of the controversy. Why should the majority now penalize the Corabis? For inventiveness? Because they tried something novel <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>and sought to preserve “whatever rights” they had? Because they wished this Court to hear and decide an important issue involving substantial rights? I can find no rationale sufficient to support or explain the .majority’s willingness to deprive the Corabis of an already greatly reduced jury verdict, when there is available the more reasonable and more appropriate alternative of merely regarding the conditions as surplusage and treating the remittiturs as unconditional.</p>

Rather, I believe it to be a valid issue arising from a difficult problem. There is no a priori strength in the argument that a litigant should not be allowed to ■simultaneously acquiesce in the reduction of an assertedly excessive verdict and appeal the reduction. Only the “tradition” of the remittitur procedure and the conceptual difficulties injected by the use of such terms as “offer” and “acceptance” render the notion of a conditional remittitur unacceptable. Taken as an original proposition there is much to be said for permitting the use of “conditional remittiturs.” After all, what is the judge really saying when he offers the too-successful litigant the option of accepting a remittitur? Is he not really saying that although the verdict as it stands is, in his opinion, too high, a lesser verdict would be appropriate? If this is what the trial judge is really saying, then allowing the use of “conditional remittiturs” would permit the case to be presented on appeal in an entirely accurate and very logical posture: the plaintiff would be arguing that he was entitled to at least the remitted verdict and probably more; the defendant would be arguing that the plaintiff should not have recovered anything, but •that the most he.was entitled to is the remitted verdict; ■and-the', trial court’s opinion of the proper outcome would be represented by the amount of the remitted <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>verdict. Is not this a highly accurate and eminently fair way to handle the problem of an excessive verdict?<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> I think it is; and I certainly would not dismiss it out of hand.</p>

The remittiturs are not being reviewed. Thus, the acceptance was without prejudice to the exercise of a right which is nonexistent. This should not, in my opinion, render the entire act of acceptance nugatory.
