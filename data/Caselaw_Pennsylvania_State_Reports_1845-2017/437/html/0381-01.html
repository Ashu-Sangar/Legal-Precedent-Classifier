The widow had created an inter vivos trust with the proceeds of the appointed property, of which her two nieces, who were also her executrices, were the beneficiaries.

    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.6",479,[133,1257,1149,1129]]]'>The first matter involves a determination whether certain securities, to wit, 75 shares of American’ Telephone and Telegraph Company Common Stock and 200 shares of DuPont Company $4.50 Preferred Stock, constituted a portion of the appointive property once owned by Christianna K. Gramm, and from her passed through the will of Theodore X. Gramm to become part of the life estate enjoyed by Elizabeth M. Gramm. If such assets initially belonged to Christianna K. Gramm, they represent a portion of the property accountable to Ida G. Betelle following the life tenancy of her sister-in-law. Appellants insist that Elizabeth M. Gramm owned these items outright at the time of tbe death of Theodore X. Gramm, free and clear of any trust imposed by Christianna X. Gramm. The basis of their assertion rests with the contention that Elizabeth M-. Gramm herself supplied the funds to purchase tile disputed items but that she retained them in the same bank agency account which, as requested in Theodore X. Gramm’s will, was used by Elizabeth for the custodianship of the appointive property.</p>

Appellants argue-that the Gramm couple had a “mutual understanding” that, instead of utilizing for their living expenses the appointive property given to Dr. Gramm by his mother, they would draw upon the interest of Elizabeth M. Gramm in a pension fund to which she became entitled as a retired schoolteacher and that, upon the demise of Dr. Gramm, his wife would receive reimbursement for the depletion of her pension fund monies. In this way, the argument continues, Dr. Gramm, who enjoyed the right to invade all the property provided by Christianna K.' Gramm, avoided the federal income tax liability which would have resulted from sales of appreciated securities in order to provide himself and his wife with sufficient funds for living expenses; and at the same time he held onto the securities • during a period of rising market prices.</p>

Nothing in the will of Theodore X.

The plain language of the testamentary instrument as interpreted in <em>Gramm Estate, supra, </em>provided only a life estate for Elizabeth M. Gramm with a power to consume for her needs during her lifetime and made no allowance for any reimbursement for the use of property during the lifetime of the testator.</p>

Gramm for the invasion of her own funds for her needs. The securities or the proceeds from the disposition of such securities constituting the life tenancy of Mrs. Gramm and remaining after her death pass under the will of Theodore X. Gramm to his sister without any deduction for what Elizabeth M. Gramm could have done had she decided not to use her own funds for her living expenses.</p>
