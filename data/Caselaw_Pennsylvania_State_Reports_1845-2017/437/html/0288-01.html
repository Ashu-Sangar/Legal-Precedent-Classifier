    <p id="b385-3" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[117,1055,1150,1189]]]'>Initially, we consider whether the court below had the <em>power </em>to amend the March 3 order. The Act of 1959, supra, provides: “In any civil, criminal or equitable proceeding in which the court has heretofore been vested with the power, jurisdiction and ¿uthority to alter, modify, suspend, reinstate, terminate, amend or rescind, any order, decree, judgment or sentence only during the term of court in which the order, decree, judgment or sentence, was entered of record, the court, in addition to such power, jurisdiction and authority, shall hereafter have the same power, jurisdiction and authority to alter, modify, suspend, reinstate, terminate, amend or rescind, the order, decree, judgment or sentence for a period of thirty days subsequent to the date of entering of record the order, decree, judgment or sentence, in any instance where the term of court shall terminate prior to such thirty day period: Provided, That all parties in interest, including the district attorney in criminal cases, are notified' in advance of such proposed alteration, modification, suspension, reinstatement,' termination, amendment' or rescission. 1959, June 1, P.'L. 342, No. 70, "§1:.” ' ■ '</p>

In support of this contention, Cole places great reliance upon <em>Commonwealth v. Tabb, </em><a href="/pa/417/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="417 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="1893969" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0013-01">417 Pa. 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=207%20A.2d%20884" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="207 A.2d 884">207 A. 2d 884</a> (1965). <em>Tabb </em>is clearly inapposite. In <em>Tabb, </em>after an appeal had been taken to our Court, the court below changed its order granting a motion in arrest of judgment and entered a new order granting a new trial. The holding in <em>Tabb </em>was that, since the matter had been removed from the court below by reason of the appeal to our Court, the court below lacked any jurisdiction to change its order.</p>

The grant of a new trial <em>and </em>the grant of the motion in arrest of judgment were so clearly antagonistic that even the most casual reading of the order would disclose the irreconcilable nature thereof. To grant a new trial <em>and </em>a motion in arrest of judgment simultaneously was contrary to common sense; if the motion in arrest of judgment was proper, Cole could not be tried again whereas, if the new trial was proper, the motion would have to fail. What the court did was simply to correct, by its order of June 18, a mistake which was plain on the face of the order and make the order of March 3 speak the truth. Almost seven decades ago, the United States Supreme Court, speaking in <em>Gagnon v. United States, </em><a href="/us/193/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="193 U.S. 451" data-case-ids="3629412" data-case-paths="/us/193/0451-01">193 U.S. 451</a>, 456 (1903), said: “The power to amend its records, .to correct mistakes of the clerk or other officer of the court, inadvertencies of counsel, or supply defects or omissions in the record, even after the lapse, of the term, is inherent in courts of justice . . . .” See also: <em>Commonwealth v.

The 1959 statute was never intended to eliminate the inherent power of a court to correct obvious and patent, mistakes in its orders, judgments and decrees. As entered, the March 3 order was meaningless, and to contend that such a patent mistake could not be corrected after the term time or the thirty-day statutory limit had expired is to misconstrue the legislative purpose embodied in the 1959 statute. Both before and since the passage of this statute, a court retains its inherent power to correct any- patent mistakes in its orders.</p>
