Appellant agreed to pay a minimum of $110,000 (later changed by agreement to $120,000) for the property. He further agreed to request the Township Board of Commissioners to change the R-l Residential zoning classification so that a high-rise apartment could be built on the property and to pay $140,000 if this request were granted.</p>

Approximately 75% of the Township is zoned either R-l or R-2 Residential, which permit the construction of single-family dwelling units on areas not less than 20,000 and 14,000 square feet, respectively. Multi-unit apartment buildings, although not <em>explicitly </em>prohibited, are not provided for in the ordinance.

Appellee argues that nonetheless apartments are not explicitly <em>prohibited </em>by the zoning ordinance. Appellee reasons that although only single-family residential uses are provided for, nowhere does the ordinance say that there shall be no apartments. In theory, an apartment use by variance is available, and appellee urges that this case thus is different from prior cases in which we severely questioned zoning schemes that did not allow given uses in an <em>entire </em>municipality.

It is settled law that a variance is available <em>only </em>on narrow grounds, i.e., “where the property is subjected to an unnecessary <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>hardship, unique or peculiar to itself, and where the grant thereof will not be contrary to the public interest.

In light of this standard, appellee’s land-use restriction in the case before us cannot be upheld against constitutional attack because of the <em>possibility </em>that an <em>occasional </em>property owner may carry the heavy burden of proving sufficient hardship to receive a variance. To be constitutionally sustained, appellee’s land-use restriction must be reasonable. If the failure to make allowance in the Township’s zoning plan for apartment uses is unreasonable, that restriction does not become any the more reasonable because once in a while, a developer may be able to show the hardship necessary to sustain a petition for a variance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> SÁt least for the purposes of this case, the failure to provide for apartments anywhere within the Township must be viewed as the legal equivalent of an explicit total prohibition of apartment houses in the zoning ordinance.</p>

We there stated that “The constitutionality of zoning ordinances which totally prohibit legitimate businesses . . . from an entire community should be regarded with particular circumspection; for unlike the constitutionality of most restrictions on property rights imposed by other ordinances, the constitutionality of total prohibitions <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>of legitimate businesses cannot be premised on the fundamental reasonableness of allocating to each type of activity a particular location in the community.” <a href="/pa/425/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="425 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1906748" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0043-01">425 Pa. at 59</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=228%20A.2d%20169" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="228 A.2d 169">228 A. 2d at 179</a>. In <em>Exton Quarries </em>we struck down an ordinance which did not allow quarrying anywhere in the municipality, just as in <em>Ammon R. Smith Auto Co. Appeal, </em>supra, we did not tolerate a total ban on flashing signs and in <em>Norate Corp., </em>supra, we struck down a prohibition on billboards everywhere in the municipality. Here we are faced with a similar case, but its implications are even more critical, for we are here dealing with dike crucial problem of population^ not with billboardiTor quarries. Just as we held in <em>Exton Quarries, Ammon R. Smith, </em>and <em>Norate </em>that the governing bodies must make some provision for the use in question, we today follow those cases and hold that appellee cannot have a zoning scheme that makes no reasonable provision for apartment uses.</p>

But we <em>explicitly </em>rejected both these claims in <em>National Land, </em>supra: “Zoning is a tool in the hands of governmental bodies which enables them to more effectively meet the demands of evolving and growing communities. It must not and can not be used by those officials as an instrument by which they may shirk their responsibilities.

That decision is unacceptable. Statistics indicate that people are attempting to move away from the urban core areas, relieving the grossly over-crowded conditions that exist in most of our major cities. Figures show that most jobs that are being created in-urban areas, including the one here in question, are in the suburbs. New York Times, June 29, 1969, p. 39 (City Edition). Thus the suburbs, which at one time were merely “bedrooms” for those who worked in the urban core, are now becoming active business areas in their own right. It follows then that formerly “outlying”, somewhat rural communities, are now becoming logical areas for development and population growth— in a sense, suburbs to the suburbs. With improvements in regional transportation systems, these areas also are now more accessible to the central city.</p>

While at first blush this might appear to be a distinction without a difference, there is, in reality, an important difference.

It makes no more sense to require a rural township to provide for high-rise apartments than to provide for industrial zones; likewise, it would not make sense to require an industrial municipality to provide for agricultural uses. By concluding that the township must provide for high-rise apartments, the majority also impliedly holds that every possible use, having no greater detrimental effect, must also be allowed.

There is no question that the property contains some topographical features which are less than desirable for the construction of single-family homes. The record is replete with conflicting testimony, however, as to how much expense would be required to grade the tract and divert the creek which runs through the property. There is evidence in the record to support the court’s conclusion that these preparatory expenses would not make the cost of the homes prohibitively expensive. The court pointed out that a development of single-family houses is now being constructed on a neighboring tract which is very similar topographically to the Duer Tract.

In the present instance, there was evidence that ‘the highest and best use of the area is residential.’ Within a half-mile radius of Mutual’s surface plot there are not less than forty residences of an average value of $30,000 each. Of course, if the ordinance’s exclusion of industrial use would conclusively prevent the appellants from mining and removing their coal for which they have full mining rights without liability for surface support, then a different question would be presented.” (<a href="/pa/366/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="366 Pa. 424" data-case-ids="8845641" data-case-paths="/pa/366/0424-01">366 Pa. at 430, 431</a>)</p>
