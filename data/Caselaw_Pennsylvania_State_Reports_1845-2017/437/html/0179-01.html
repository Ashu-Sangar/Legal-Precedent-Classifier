Sealed bids were received and opened by the City on February 14, 1968. The highest bidder was Nilón Brothers Enterprises (Nilón) whose bid was to pay forty-three and nine-tenths per cent (43.9%) of the gross receipts from “General Concession” to the City. On May 3, 1968, the City’s “Stadium Committee” recommended that “all bids be rejected and that new specifications be drawn up,” assigning for its recommendation, <em>inter alia, </em>four separate reasons. The Procurement Commissioner, Mr. Winter, acting on behalf of the City, rejected all the bids.</p>

The unanimous conclusion of the court below was “that the rejection of the bids involved no fraud or collusion,” and such conclusion is fully justified by the evidence of record. In fact, one of the owners of Nilón—the real party in interest in this proceeding—conceded the absence of any fraud or collusion and stated that, in his view, the City’s decision to reject all bids was arrived at in good faith; his objection to the bid rejection was that it was “uninformed” and illogical.</p>

First, it is to be presumed that municipal officers properly act for the public good <em>(Robinson v.

[Weber] contests the decision to join the two operations under the one concessionaire. Stadium Clubs have, within the last four or five years, become important adjuncts of operations of this character throughout the country. A Stadium Club is a prestige type of operation wherein, according to the estimates appearing in the record, it is proposed to offer restaurant facilities together with a cocktail bar, the restaurant to provide for possibly 300 seats and the cocktail bar 100 seats. It is possible that the Club will be operated not only when athletic contests or other events are being held, but also at all other times throughout the year. Its operation could be tied <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>iii with the season tickets sold by Ball Clubs and the members will be charged dues, all of which will go to the City under the contracts with the Ball Clubs. Among its guests will be included public officials from all levels, and prominent guests from other localities, as well as the City. On the other hand the general concessions deal with the selling of food, beverages and souvenirs, etc. to the spectators outside of the Club. [Weber] does not contest the importance of the operation of this Club.</p>

It was agreed that considerations of decor, paneling, furnishing and the other numerous requirements involved in the establishment of the Club are to be first class in every respect. Estimates of costs varied from $100,000 given by the witnesses for the plaintiff, up to <em>iy2 </em>million dollars by witnesses on behalf of the defendants. Whatever the sum involved it is clear that the City does not have the financial means to supply this facility. The City’s position is that the financing of the construction of the Club should be taken over by the concessionaire who could amortize this cost over a period of years out of profits. The operation of the Club may or may not result in a profit and, therefore, its operation should be tied in with the general concessions which yield handsome profits. A second reason is that dual operation of the two types of concessions will require the City to do business with two separate concessionaires, whereas the operation under one concessionaire will be more convenient as to financial matters (e.g., accounting) as well as other facets' of the operation including the possible interchange of <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>help and the reconciling of problems which are bound to arise in the operation.</p>

The Court sustains the finding that these are valid reasons to support single operation and that there was no abuse of discretion in rejecting the bids and seeking bids under new specifications.” We agree with this analysis and ascertain no basis for labeling this reason as arbitrary or capricious.</p>

The record discloses that the City has contracts in connection with the stadium with the Phillies and the Eagles, and, of course, <em>consultation </em>with both the Phillies and the Eagles, the principal and most likely users of the stadium, would be proper and sound. However, the ultimate responsibility for the selection of the concessionaire must rest with the City, not the Phillies or Eagles. Nevertheless, despite the inartistic language employed by the Stadium Committee in stating this reason, we cannot find that the assignment of this reason for the rejection of the bids was either arbitrary, capricious or in bad faith.</p>

The proposal is tentative like other proposals. . The City indicated in its testimony that since the City owns and operates the Gas Works that it might and probably will result in its being able to negotiate a more favorable contract involving use of gas than electricity or at least to supplement each other. The City incidentally does not contend that electrical installation and operation should be excluded. Mr. Bak, an architect who is in an executive position among all ,of the participating architects consulted and employed- by the City, testified that power of this character involves heating and air conditioning as well as the preparation of food; that the original architect’s plans did not call for the use of gas at least in any appreciable quantity. However, he stated, after much consultation, that the plans have been changed so that the installation of gas facilities will be included and provided, to the concessionaire as well as for other purposes. It is obvious that the different forms of fuel have their benefits as well as their hazards including the possibility of fire and power failure.

It is my view that when the City rejected the highest responsible bid for the sports stadium concessions, it violated this .Charter restriction. Not only does the record in this case fail to show how the City’s rejection of these bids will in any way serve or advance its interest, but, by the City’s own admission, the new bids will actually provide the City with less revenue than the rejected bids. I find it difficult to understand how it is “in the interest of the City” to diminish the revenue it will receive, from the concessions and I must therefore dissent.</p>

Bidders will not be willing to invest great amounts of time and money in preparing and submitting the best possible bid if their offers can be set aside without cause. For once the bids are open, competitive advantage may easily be lost. Of course there may very well be times when rebidding will offer the City significant benefits. In such instances the City Avould be justified in rejecting all bids, for rejection would then clearly be in the City’s best interest, and in accord with the Charter.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[192,1070,1146,530]]]'>In the instant case, however, I believe that the City has failed to demonstrate how rejection served the City’s interest. The City’s major justification<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> for rejection was that it Avould be better to have a single bid for the concessions and the stadium club,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> thus ensuring a single operator for both. While the City did give two reasons for its assertion that it would be beneficial to have a single operator for both the concessions and the stadium club, neither demonstrates that such consolidation would truly be in the City’s interest.</p>

      <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>• Robert W. Crawford, Recreation Commissioner and a member of the Stadium Committee, testified that the only way the City could.get bids for the stadium club was to have it bid with the concessions. He asserted that nobody would bid for the club alone, since the City was “unwilling” to equip it, and since the club could not, out of its own receipts, finance the cost of equipment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> If the club were combined with the lucrative concessions, however, the City could be sure of bidders. Mr. Crawford then freely admitted the obvious—that the result of including the club with the concessions would mean lower revenues for the City, since the operator would have to cover the costs of the club by taking it out of the City’s profits from the concessions. In other words, the City would still be paying for the club, but indirectly, through reduced revenues from the concessionaire.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Mr. Crawford stated: “We don’t have the money to put it [the club] up. I think if we had the money it would be better . . . but we don’t have it and we cannot go back and ask the tax<a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>payers for another bond issue, so we have to work out other solutions and that is what we were trying to do.”</p>
    <p id="Asg" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[216,531,1144,586]]]'>Surely rejection of the bids for the above reason is not truly in the interest of Philadelphia. The taxpayers have the right to know how much their stadium is costing. They have already approved bond issues limiting expenditures. If the City feels the club is so important to the stadium, the taxpayers can be asked to approve more bond issues. It is not up to City officials to indirectly finance a stadium club by accepting reduced concession receipts. Techniques designed to hide from public view costs of public projects are hardly “in the interest of the City.”</p>
    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[211,1129,1148,855]]]'>The second theory was advanced by Harry Blat-stein, executive secretary of the Stadium Committee. He stated that the cost of the club, equipment and furnishings had <em>no </em>bearing on the decision to reject the bids. The Committee, in his view, decided on joint biddings because joint control would be more efficient. But the City submitted little beyond this general assertion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> Mr. Blatstein testified that after the bids were received he talked to only one or two other stadia to see how their clubs were run. He also conceded that a separate set of books for the concessions and the stadium club would still be required.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_6" id="ref_footnote_2_6">6</a> On the other hand, plaintiff produced expert witnesses who testified that the concessions and stadium clubs in St. Louis, Minneapolis, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco are under separate management.</p>

Philadelphia did not insist on unified management and decided to have the club and concessions bid separately. This decision was originally made in 1965, some three years before the bids were rejected. There is evidence that the specifications were carefully considered before bids were invited.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_7" id="ref_footnote_2_7">7</a> Yet the City made its decision to reject all bids, some three months after they were received, based on what appears to be no more than a mere belief that a single concessionaire would be a good idea. This, in my view, is not sufficient proof that rebidding would be “in the interest of the City.” In fact, if we accept the City’s view that the stadium club will be unprofitable, a single bid will lower revenues and be <em>against </em>the City’s interest.</p>

Reason one would not be legal; reason two was admitted by the City to he merely a “formal change;” and reason three, even if valid, makes no sense until the architects have at least considered the matter and state that only gas can be used by the concessionaires. The City, in its brief, also attempts to argue that there were other “substantial reasons” for rejecting the bids. But the City never indicated what these reasons were and I find it difficult to agree that these “reasons” warranted rejection without such knowledge.</p>
