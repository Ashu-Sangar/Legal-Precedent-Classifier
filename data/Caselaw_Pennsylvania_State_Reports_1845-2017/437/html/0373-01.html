It was subsequently discovered that on that day the Papieves boy had been struck by a motor vehicle operated by a minor, <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>one Owen Norman Lawrence (defendant herein). Whether Papieves was killed or seriously injured in the collision is not of record. Without attempting to obtain medical assistance and without notifying either the police or the boy’s parents, Lawrence removed Papieves’ body from the scene of the accident, took it to his home, and hid it in his garage. Some few days later, Lawrence contacted one Joseph J. Kelly, also a minor, and requested his assistance in disposing of the body of Papieves. Defendants Lawrence and Kelly thereupon took Papieves’ body to a field near Darby Creek Koad in Marple Township, Delaware County, where they dug a grave and interred the decedent. More than two months later, the partially decomposed body of young Papieves was found, and his remains were returned to his parents.</p>

After a review of the cases in this area, one leading authority has concluded that a distinct majority of the jurisdictions hold that “where the defendant, not privileged by statute, intentionally or recklessly invades another’s interest in the body of a deceased relative by conduct which it is highly probable will cause acute and poignant emotional distress, he becomes liable therefor although no other interest of the plaintiff is invaded.” Harper and James, <em>The Law of Torts, </em>§9.4, p. 675 (1956). While the decisions in other jurisdictions have frequently spoken of the next of kin’s property or quasi-property rights in the body of the decedent, the underlying, and we believe real, issue is the right of a decedent’s nearest relatives to protection against intentional, outrageous or wanton conduct which is peculiarly calculated to cause them serious mental or emotional distress. See <em>Stephens v. Waits, supra; Gadbury v. Bleitz, </em><a href="/wash/133/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="133 Wash. 134" data-case-ids="784426" data-case-paths="/wash/133/0134-01">133 Wash. 134</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20P.%20299" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="233 P. 299">233 P. 299</a> (1925); and Prosser, “Intentional Infliction of Mental Suffering: A New Tort”, 37 <em>Michigan Law Review </em>874 (1939).</p>

Compare <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>§46 (1934) with <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>§46 (1965); see also Magruder, “Mental and Emotional Disturbance in the Law of Torts,” 49 <em>Harvard Law Review </em>1033 (1936) and Harper and James, <em>op. cit., </em>chap. 9. We recognize that any extension of legal liability to acts which cause emotional distress is not without its problems. We also recognize that the law cannot serve to guaran<a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>tee all men’s peace of mind; as the late Judge Magruder remarked, “Against a large part of the frictions and irritations and clashing of temperaments incident to participation in a community life, a certain toughening of the mental hide is a better protection than the law could ever be.” Magruder, <em>op. cit., </em>p. 1035. But this ease is not in that category. There can be little doubt that mental or emotional disorders brought on by conduct such as that set forth in the complaint at bar may be every bit as real, every bit as debilitating as ailments which have more obviously physical causes. For this reason, the obvious and inherent difficulties of the proof, or disproof, of emotional distress and the measurement of damages for such injury are not adequate cause, standing alone, to deny recovery. We conclude that recovery may be had for serious mental or emotional distress directly caused by the intentional and wanton acts of mishandling a decedent’s body which are here alleged. It goes without saying that in order to recover, a plaintiff asserting such a cause of action must be able to prove all the elements of his case by proper evidentiary standards.</p>

Initially he relies, as did the lower court, upon the impact rule set forth in <em>Bosley v. Andrews, supra. </em>That rule, at least in its most expansive form, was overturned by this Court in <em>Niederman v. Brodsky, </em><a href="/pa/436/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="436 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="1926120" data-case-paths="/pa/436/0401-01">436 Pa. 401</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=261%20A.2d%2084" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="261 A.2d 84">261 A. 2d 84</a> (1970), an opinion which was filed some few days before argument in the present case was heard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
      <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>Moreover, the impact rule, to the extent that it remains a viable rule of law in Pennsylvania, is inapplicable in the case now before us. As it was applied in this Commonwealth, the rule limited the scope of duty imposed upon an actor who by his negligence had imperiled the plaintiff; the rule precluded a plaintiff’s recovery of damages for the negligently inflicted consequences of fright, shock or emotional disturbance absent some contemporary physical impact with, or some physical injury to, the plaintiff.</p>

Going further, however, appellee correctly states that no recovery has been allowed in wrongful death actions for grief and mental suffering resulting from the loss of a decedent. <em>Ferne v.

        <em> </em>The issue has been presented to two lower courts. See <em>Block v. Har Nebo Cemetery Co., </em><a href="/pa-d-c/14/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="14 Pa.

Co. <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>3930) and <em>Reick v. Maple Hill Cemetery Assn., </em>31 Luz. L. Leg. Rep. 213 (C.P. Luzerne Co. 1936). In the latter ease, the court, at p. 215, stated as follows: “The weight of authority is to the effect that damages for mental anguish are recoverable for invasion of the different rights relating to dead bodies, although there be no actual pecuniary loss, the sense of outrage and mental suffering being proper independent elements of compensatory damages.”</p>
