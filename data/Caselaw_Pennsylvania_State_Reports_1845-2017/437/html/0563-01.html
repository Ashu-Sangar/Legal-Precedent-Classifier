An appeal was filed with this Court, but it was withdrawn by defendant after a Certificate of Discontinuance was filed by defendant on October 15, 1964.

Vickie and her Aunt, Catherine Mae Zimmerman, who was living at the Schmidt home, came downstairs and stood in the hallway and watched defendant and his wife arguing in the front yard and on the front porch. Vickie testified that “Dad was hitting Mom,” and that defendant “had hold” of her Mother’s arms as they came into the house. They continued to argue for another ten or fifteen minutes, when the defendant suddenly pulled out a gun. Vickie grabbed defendant’s arm and he pushed her back. Catherine (the Aunt) attempted to grab defendant’s arm, but he pushed her back, which caused her to fall over a couch. Defendant then shot and killed his wife and turned and pointed the gun at Vickie, who ran out the back door screaming. Vickie testified that she heard her Aunt Catherine scream and another gunshot.</p>
