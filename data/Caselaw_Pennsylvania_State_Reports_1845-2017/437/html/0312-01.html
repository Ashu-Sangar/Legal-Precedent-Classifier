The Building Inspector refused to grant the permit applied for, and appellees appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment of the Borough of Clifton Heights (Board). The proposed modifications to the premises and the use thereof are permitted when authorized as a special exception under the Borough’s Zoning Ordinance.</p>

At the conclusion of the hearing it was agreed that the time period within which the Board would have to act on the appeal would commence when the notes of testimony were transmitted to the Board. This occurred on January 7, 1969. During the latter part of January, 1969 appellees received in the mail a document executed by the Chairman of the Board which was dated January 18, 1969 and on which was -written in longhand “Appeal having been made to the Board of Adjustment by the aforesaid for Variance from the terms of The Borough of Clifton Heights Zoning Board, and the Board having held public hearing after due notice as required by law, is of the opinion that this variance be refused.”</p>

It is appellees’ theory that what was communicated to them by the Board was not a “decision” as required by the statute and that as no “decision” was made within the forty-five day period, the Board is deemed to have found in favor of them. Therefore, they conclude that they have a clear, legal right to .the building permit and that mandamus is a proper action. It is their position that'the word “decision”- cannot refer to the statement that a variance has been denied but rather encompasses findings of fact, conclusions of law and an opinion in support of the result. They state that this is the -proper interpretation of the statute because subsection (i), when referring to the right of appeal to the court of common pleas, requires the appellant to specify the grounds upon which he relies and an appellant could not fulfill that requirement if he did hot know the basis of the Board’s determination. In support of this position they cite <em>Humble Oil and Refining Company v. East Lansdowne </em>Borough; <a href="/pa/424/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="424 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1904990" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0309-01">424 Pa. 309</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="227 A.2d 664">227 A. 2d 664</a> (1967); <em>Yocum Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/393/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="393 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1279703" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0148-01">393 Pa. 148</a>, 151 n.3, <a href="/citations/?q=141%20A.2d%20601" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="141 A.2d 601">141 A. 2d 601</a> (1958), and <em>Imperial Asphalt Corporation of Pennsylvania Zoning Case, </em><a href="/pa/359/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="359 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="473105" data-case-paths="/pa/359/0402-01">359 Pa. 402</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=59%20A.2d%20121" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="59 A.2d 121">59 A. 2d 121</a> (1948) "(although they concede it involved a township not subject to The Borough Code).</p>
    <p id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[194,2133,1144,261]],["BL_411.1",411,[134,391,1160,1072]]]'>On the one hand the statute requires that the Board make a decision, and on the other it gives no definition of that word. Webster’s Third New International Dictionary' ( Unabridged edition 1961) defines decision, at 585, as “the act of- deciding, the act of settling or <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>terminating by giving judgment; a determination arrived at after consideration, an account or report of a conclusion, an announcement declaring tbe winner in a contest.” When the Board informed appellees (well within the forty-five day period) that the variance was denied, it literally had met that definition and had complied with that requirement. Appellees, however, argue that the word decision.goes beyond.the mere result and encompasses findings of fact and law and an opinion because otherwise they will not be able to specify the grounds upon which they rely when they appeal to the court of common pleas. Appellees’ own conduct is evidence of the weakness of that argument. They, did file an appeal from the determination of the Board and alleged eight reasons why the Board had abused its discretion. It is a simple matter for the court of common pleas to require the Board to file findings of fact and law and an opinion after the appeal has been filed, and then the parties can address themselves to those conclusions.</p>
    <p id="b411-4" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[139,1482,1155,911]],["BL_412.1",412,[174,400,1150,369]]]'>Also, the policy behind the statute permits such a. construction. As we stated in <em>Humble </em>Oil: “The. Legislature recognized the existence of this inertia in the orderly disposition of pending governmental matters, and, accordingly, wisely provided that when a board of adjustment indolently allows 45 days to go by without a decision following a hearing, the complaining party shall have the benefit of that slothful inattention and gain the requested permit. Without this kind of coercive determination, a board could effectively prevent the erection of needed structures through the simple process of . . . [delay].” <a href="/pa/424/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="424 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1904990" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0309-01">424 Pa. at 314</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20664" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="227 A.2d 664">227 A. 2d at 666</a>. Thus, the purpose of the statute is to prevent endless delay in the erection of needed structures, and it is not necessary to promote that purpose that anything other than a simple “granted” or “denied” be filed. This is because immediately upon receipt of that <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>order the aggrieved party can appeal to the court of common pleas, and the case can move ahead to final solution. What is important is that the Board not ignore the appeal. The statute provides the forty-five day cut-off point as a final means of moving the situation forward, but a determination such as the one in-this action serves the same purpose.</p>
    <p id="b412-4" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[168,781,1157,1074]]]'>Finally, <em>Humble Oil and Refining </em>is distinguishable' from the instant action. In that case a hearing was-held on May 24, and on May 31 the Board instructed its secretary to notify the borough solicitor to prepare an opinion and an order denying the application. A copy of the opinion and order was sent to Humble on August 11, the first notice that Humble had received even though the forty-five day period had long since expired. Humble had no knowledge of the internal affairs of the Board, and we held that under those circumstances, when nothing had been communicated to appellant during the forty-five day period, the Board is deemed to have found in favor of appellant and that an action in mandamus may be maintained. We were not there faced with the question whether what was communicated was sufficient; we were only concerned with the situation in which the Board has communicated nothing to appellants. Anything in that opinion going beyond that narrow issue was dictum and not necessary to the decision of that appeal.</p>
