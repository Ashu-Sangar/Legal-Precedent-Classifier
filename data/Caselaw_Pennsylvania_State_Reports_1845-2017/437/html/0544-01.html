The “lease” further provided mining could be by any method whatsoever, <em>i.e., </em>deep or strip mining, and granted the right of depositing all the overburden on the land itself.

Whether this agreement is a lease or a sale of the coal in place depends upon the language of the instrument viewed in the light of our case law. See: <em>Hummel v. McFadden, </em><a href="/pa/395/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="395 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1282780" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0543-01">395 Pa. 543</a>, 555, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="150 A.2d 856">150 A. 2d 856</a>, 861 (1959), and authorities therein cited. The fact that the instrument is termed a “lease” is neither controlling nor determinative of the nature of the instrument. Under the terms of the instrument, testator leased to the coal company “[a] 11 of the profitable and marketable seam or vein of coal in, under and upon” all of the fifty-five acre tract which was known to testator as his “farm.” As has been pointed out, this instrument provided that the taking of the coal could be by any method, a provision which empowered and authorized the coal company not only to deep mine but to strip mine the tract. Our examination of this instrument convinces us that testator, under the provisions of this instrument, effected a sale of all the coal in place and substituted testator’s right to the mineral estate for the royalties provided under the agreement. After execution and delivery of the agreement, testator had but two things left insofar as the mineral estate was concerned: the right to receive the stipulated royalties and a possibili<a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>ty of reverter. See: <em>Hummel v. McFadden, </em><a href="/pa/395/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="395 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1282780" data-case-paths="/pa/395/0543-01">395 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="150 A.2d 856">150 A. 2d 856</a> (1959), and authorities therein cited.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Therefore, <em>at the time of his death, </em>testator had the right to pass on, by way of inheritance, the right to receive royalties and the possibility of a reversion in the future. Under our conclusion that the agreement effected a sale of the coal in place, we must next determine what effect this sale of the mineral rights had upon the specific devise of testator’s “farm” contained in Paragraph 3 of the will.</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[211,939,1146,423]]]'>The rationale of the court below is that our case law, represented principally by <em>Smith v.

A careful examina<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>tion of the instant “lease” of the coal, viewed in the light of our ease law, demonstrates that the so-called “lease” amounted to a <em>sale </em>of the coal in place. By this “lease,” testator terminated his ownership of the mineral estate and received therefor a right to royalties from the coal when mined and removed from the premises. Indeed, the so-called “lease” went even further in that it permitted not only deep but strip mining, thus allowing the so-called “lease” to damage the surface and destroy its utility. As appellants well argue, the advent of strip mining has created an entirely novel situation. Unlike ordinary-type mining, utilization of the method of strip mining destroys for all practical purposes the surface of the land overlying the coal. The removal <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>of the overburden by strip mining in order to reach and secure the coal underneath the surface destroys and renders, particularly for agricultural purposes, the surface useless. The instant coal lease permits both deep and strip mining. Unfortunately for the farm devisees (appellants), the testator alienated by the “lease” much of that which he had previously given them..</p>

      <em>Smith, supra, </em>clearly enunciates the principle that the right to receive the coal royalties is personalty, not realty; in fact, in <em>Smith, supra, </em>the Court awarded the purchase price for the right to receive coal royalties to. deceased “lessor’s” personal representative rather than hi.s heirs.</p>

We detect no such ambiguity in this will which would permit the reception of such evidence. Even though such evidence were admissible, it could indicate no more than that which we find to have been testator’s intent when he made the will, <em>i.e., </em>that testator “preferred” the Ruehles in his will and wanted them to become the owners of his “farm.” However, by his post-testamentary action in executing the so-called “lease,” he removed from the orbit of his ownership the “mineral estate” under the farm and thus deprived appellants not only of such ownership but of the “fruits” of the farm.</p>

It is obvious that the primary object of testator’s bounty was his sister and, during her lifetime, she was to receive “all income and net profit” from the estate. Only upon the sister’s death was any further disposition of the estate to take place. The next favorite objects of testator’s bounty were to be his niece and her sou, to whom testator gave, by way of a specific devise, his “farm;” a “Christian” church to which he gave a pecuniary legacy; and <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>a Presbyterian cbureh to which he gave, in trust, a pecuniary legacy. The residuary legatees argue that the phrase “Subject to the bequests and devises hereinbefore stated,” <em>i.e., </em>the gifts to the sister, the niece and her son and the two churches, was employed by testator only to define the residuary estate or, at the most, to establish priority rather than preference. In our view, such argument is without merit. <em>“Subject to’’ </em>means “subordinate, subservient, inferior.” <em>Black’s Law Dictionary </em>1594 (1968). See also: <em>Hammond’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/197/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="197 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="918713" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0119-01">197 Pa. 119</a>, 122-123, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.%20935" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="46 A. 935">46 A. 935</a> (1900). We read the phrase “Subject to,” etc., as indicative of a clear testamentary intent that the twelve nephews and nieces were to be the recipients of the specified pecuniary bequests only after the devise to the niece and her son and the legacies to the two churches had been taken care of, and clearly indicated a <em>preference </em>among the objects of testator’s bounty. Any possible doubt that a <em>preference </em>was intended is resolved by the language of the residuary clause which is prefaced by the phrase “[w'jhatsoever shall remain of my estate, <em>after the devises and bequests hereinbefore contained </em>. . . .” (Emphasis added) The language of the will clearly spells out .a preference for the niece and her son over those objects of testator’s bounty contained in the latter part of the will. If such was the intent of the testator—and we so conclude—the result of the decree of the court below defeats such intent and places the residuary legatees, rather than the specific devisees, in a preferential position.</p>
