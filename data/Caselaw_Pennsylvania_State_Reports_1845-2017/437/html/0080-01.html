The court below, by amended order, departed from the procedure agreed upon at the pretrial conference and granted a new trial as to six of the thirty-two firemen. It did so because it felt the record indicated that contributory negligence was an issue as to these six and that a manifest injustice would be done if the defendants were not permitted to raise that issue. The pretrial order was silent as to how contributory negligence could be raised against individual plaintiffs. The lower court refused to grant a new trial as to the others because it felt the parties should be bound by their agreeemnt (contained in the pretrial order) and because the record did not indicate that there was a jury issue on contributory negligence <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>as to them.

Because our courts now face such a backlog of cases and because the test case device (by way of pretrial orders) offers some relief from that pressure, it seems appropriate to determine when, or at least when not, such a device should be used. One factor that must be present is the identity of issues, both factual and legal, in all cases that are subject to the order. Of course, the facts can only be developed later as the trial proceeds so the judge must use whatever is available to determine whether the case is of the type in which the facts are identical as to all parties or in which different facts will have no legal significance. It should have been obvious that this case does not fit into that category. The various firemen likely had different amounts of knowledge about this situation and fires in general, were in different locations and were doing different things at the time of the explosion. Therefore, it was improper for the lower court to have entered such a pretrial order, and a new trial should be granted as to all plaintiffs.</p>

It is important for this Court to establish guidelines for this type of action because in the proper circumstances it can be quite useful.</p>

Sun Oil, when informed, sent its maintenance men to check the pumps, but no evidence of water was found. Approximately three weeks before the explosion-, the manager again informed Sun of complaints <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>of water. Sun contacted Midstates, an organization which specializes in repair of gasoline station facilities, and one of Midstates’ employees was sent to check the gasoline tanks for water. One of the tanks at the station was buried under a cement floor in the basement, so Midstates’ employee broke the cement, tested the tank for water, and, finding none, left. A day before the explosion, the manager of the station again reported complaints of water to Sun. After a Sun employee went to the station and found water in the gas, Midstates was again contacted. That afternoon, two employees of Midstates went to the station to check the basement tank. After turning off the flame in a gas-fired water heater in the basement, they broke the cement and this time found water in the tank. Since it was late in the day, the Midstates’ employees decided to return the next day to complete the work, but they placed dirt, rather than cement, over the hole in the floor. There was conflicting testimony as to whether they turned the hot water heater back on before they left, but the jury could reasonably have found that they did.</p>

Several minutes later he heard a muffled sound, which he described as a “phoom,” and noticed a flame shooting across the stairway to the cellar entrance. He escaped from the cellar, told Sun’s employee to move his gasoline truck, and ran to a fire station one block away. He did not, however, tell the firemen about the history of the leaking tank. Nor did the Sun employee inform them that he had just filled the leaking tank with gasoline.</p>

I do not believe that a fireman, by merely accepting employment and doing his job, necessarily assumes, voluntarily, the risks which are inherent in fighting particular types of fires. Further, in the instant case, the jury could properly find that there was no voluntary assumption of risk, predicated on their finding that the condition on the land creating the risk was one which the firemen did not discover. This Court has long held that the risk of injury from hidden defects is not one which, as a matter of law, is voluntarily assumed. See <em>Drake v.

While some of these interrogatories could, perhaps, have been better <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>framed, I cannot find that their wording prejudiced the defendants. Further, there was no inconsistency between the answers to the interrogatories and the general verdict, thus reinforcing the view that the jury was not misled. Since interrogatories are designed as a means to check on the propriety of the general verdict, consistency between the two leaves little reason to upset the general verdict. See 3 Goodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsylvania Practice §2257-1, at 114-15 (1958).</p>

The court pointed out that there was some evidence of contributory negligence on the part of these six plaintiffs, but that the pretrial order<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_4_6" id="ref_footnote_4_6">6</a> designating the test cases was silent on the issue of contributory negligence. The court then reasoned that because “test” cases imply that issues are identical in all cases, the pretrial order could have no effect on these six cases. Hence, the six cases must be tried separately. The majority agrees with the court en banc, but I cannot.</p>

In long and complex trials, as here, this insistence on adhering to the simplification agreed to in the pretrial conference and order is most essential. Litigants who are dissatisfied with the simplification may object at trial and seek a modification if they can show manifest injustice. See 1 Goodrich-Amram, Standard Pennsyl<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>vania Practice §212-11, at 46-47 (1951). But here, there was no attempt to object at trial. The objections to the test cases came only after the verdict. Pretrial conferences and orders will not serve their function of expediting trials, if this Court allows counsel to await an unfavorable verdict and then claim that the simplification hurt his case. Defendants' here should be foreclosed because they failed to assert— at trial—that they objected to these test cases on the issue of contributory negligence. Compare <em>Payne v. S. S.

For now, under the majority’s treatment of this case, if an issue is not mentioned specifically in the pretrial order, counsel will be able to remain silent and await the verdict. Then, if the verdict is unfavorable, counsel can upset it by merely pointing out the issue that was “forgotten.” In fact, I question whether the defendants here, in agreeing to the test cases, “forgot” about contributory negligence. After all, by choosing two plaintiffs injured on the premises, they were able to have the case tried on a less exacting standard of care. See note 4 supra. I do find it difficult to believe that any defense lawyer would forget about the issue of contributory negligence—an issue so elementary and so vital to his client’s interests.</p>

That section imposes liability for unreasonable activity which injures persons off the land, regardless of whether the condition was hidden and irrespective of any warning given.

In the course of the trial, -the importance of that issue became evident. Realizing that the situation of certain firemen placed them outside the reasonable ambit of the pretrial order, the trial court realistically attempted to rectify the situation by granting new trials as to those men.
