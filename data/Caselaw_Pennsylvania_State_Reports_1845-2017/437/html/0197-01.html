The basis of the refund claim was that the registration fees paid to the Commonwealth under the Act constituted true license fees, and consequently the City was prohibited from imposing its Mercantile License Tax under the Act of August 5, 1932, P. L. 45, as amended, §1, 53 P.S. §15971 (a), popularly known as the “Sterling Act.” This section, while granting first class cities broad authority to levy, assess and collect taxes, contains the following explicit exception: “. . . except that such council shall not have authority to levy, assess and collect . . . any tax on a privilege, transaction, subject or occupation, or on personal property, which is now or may hereafter become subject to a State tax or license fee.”</p>

Instead of ordering a refund, however, the lower court remanded the case to the Tax Review Board for the purpose of determining which of the activities, if any, of Smith, Kline and French fall outside the sphere of regulation under the Act and consequently became subject to the City’s Mercantile License Tax.

In assuming that “license fee” can only refer to regulation under the Commonwealth’s police power, they ignore the possibility that “license fee” can refer to the raising of revenue under the Commonwealth’s taxing power. 33 Am. Jur. Licenses §2 (1941). Considering the legislature’s intent in 1932, the latter construction malíes the most sense. The Sterling Act is a permissive one; one that grants power to first class cities, and the reservation of power in the clause under consideration must be seen in the light of the legislative intent of providing sources of revenue for impoverished cities. Under the interpretation given in the cited decisions, the payment of $50 or $100 to the Commonwealth can deprive a city of many tens of thousands of dollars in tax revenue.

Close questions will arise as to whether a particular enactment is a revenue-producing one, but it is not necessary to decide any such questions here.

The Drug Act is clear in subjecting the industry to supervision and regulation by the licensing authority. Act of September 26, 1961, P. L. 1664, § §4, 11, 16, 17. Also, there seems no question that payment of the fee is a condition upon which the licensee is permitted to transact his business. Act, § §4, 11. The lower court found sufficient evidence that such supervision and regulation was actually conducted by the regulating agency. The Stipulation of Facts supports this finding adequately. Finally, leaving aside Dr. Maxwell’s testimony (as to whose admissibility appellant objected), the fact that the total fees collected from manufacturers and wholesalers throughout the period in question (4 years) so closely approximated the total expenses of supervision and regulation ($197,405 against $206,750.24), indicates that the legislative purpose in exacting the charge was to reimburse the licensing authority for the expenses of supervision and regulation. The same fact indicates that the Act was not designed as a revenue-producing measure and that the prohibition in the Sterling Act should not apply.</p>

We have never held, however, that merely because a business is taxed on a certain aspect of its operations by the Commonwealth, that it cannot therefore be taxed on a different aspect by the city. For example, in <em>National Biscuit Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/374/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="374 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1241450" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0604-01">374 Pa. 604</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="98 A.2d 182">98 A. 2d 182</a> (1953), we held that the payment of a state corporate income tax does not bar the city from imposing a mercantile tax which is based on the gross volume of business.

Although in both cases we used the labels “property tax” and “excise tax” to distinguish the taxes involved, the distinction does not rest on labels.

This is not, in my view, the double-taxation which the Sterling Act forbids. A corporation may be required to pay different types of taxes based on different factors and items; the Sterling Act only forbids the city from taxing the same aspect of the business <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>that the Commonwealth taxes.

Although some jurisdictions may have categorized “license fees” in the manner suggested by the majority, Pennsylvania has not. On the contrary, this Court has uniformly held that a “license fee” which is primarily a revenue-producing measure, unrelated to the police power, is not in fact a license; it is a tax. The Court thus phrased the distinction twenty years ago: “A license fee is one exacted for the purpose of regulating an occupation or privilege which is deemed to be in need of public control, and, ordinarily, it is designed for the sole purpose of reimbursing the sovereign, in whole or in part, for the necessary expense of enforcing and administering such control; if it exceeded the amount required for that purpose it would become a tax for revenue and cease to be a valid license fee.” <em>Armour and Co. v.

    <p id="b306-4" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[183,1184,1152,1242]],["BL_307.1",307,[161,378,1145,96]]]'>The majority opinion cites no new reason for ignoring the clear presumption that the Sterling Act is to be interpreted in accordance with our definition of “license fee” in <em>National Biscuit. </em>The majority merely points out that, under this interpretation, the Commonwealth’s requirement of a license fee may deprive the City of Philadelphia of a large amount of revenue. However, this Court has previously noted that payment of a State tax or license fee may exempt the taxpayer from a larger city tax, and that the Sterling Act may, therefore, in some cases result in reduced payments— in licenses, fees and taxes—to the governmental bodies of the Commonwealth taken as a whole. The Court’s conclusion until today has been that “it is for the legislature alone to remove this limitation on the City’s power if that body should determine that such action is desirable.” <em>National Biscuit Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/374/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="374 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1241450" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0604-01">374 Pa. 604</a>, 615, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="98 A.2d 182">98 A. 2d 182</a>, 187 (1953). Our legislature has presumably decided that such a change would not be desirable. This Court’s function is to construe statutes as the legislature has intended them to be construed, rather- than in accordance with what we may believe the legislature <em>should </em>have intended. We, there<a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>fore, believe that we may not now properly intervene where the legislature has chosen not to act.</p>
    <p id="b307-3" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[159,486,1149,750]]]'>Note should also be taken of the opinion written by Mr. Justice Roberts. That opinion accepts the result of the majority, but argues that the purpose of the Sterling Act is to prohibit double taxation, <em>i.e., </em>the imposition of two different taxes upon the same aspect of an enterprise, and that, because the measure of the mercantile license tax <em>(i.e., </em>a percentage of gross sales) and the measure of the registration fee <em>(i.e., </em>a flat fee per plant) differ, the “two taxes fall on entirely different aspects of appellee’s businessand, therefore, imposition of the mercantile license tax and the registration fee does not in fact constitute double taxation. Again, we find ourselves unable to agree with the line of reasoning employed.</p>
    <p id="b307-4" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[157,1249,1149,742]]]'>The Sterling Act by its terms does not proscribe only “double taxation;” on the contrary, it provides that the City may not tax a “privilege, transaction, subject or occupation” which is subject to a State tax or a State license fee. The present case poses the issue of double taxation only if one accepts the view that the license fee imposed by The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act is a revenue-producing license fee and not a true regulatory license fee (a view rejected by the majority) and that such a fee is in reality a tax. Thus, a line of reasoning based on the incidence of double taxation necessitates a definition of “license fee,” and that, of course, is a question expressly avoided by the concurrence.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[155,2011,1146,367]],["BL_308.1",308,[175,384,1146,1293]]]'>That point aside, we are still unable to agree with the position of Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Eagen that the mercantile license tax and the registration fee imposed by The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act do not fall on an identical “privilege, transaction, subject or occupation.” The Philadelphia mercantile license tax has repeatedly been held to consti<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>tute “an excise tax upon the privilege of transacting business measured by the gross volume of business annually transacted.” <em>National Biscuit Co. v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/374/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="374 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="1241450" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0604-01">374 Pa. 604</a>, 613, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="98 A.2d 182">98 A. 2d 182</a>, 186 (1953), and cases cited. A true license fee, such as the State fee here in issue, is a “charge which is imposed by the sovereign, in the exercise of its police power, upon a person within its jurisdiction for tifie privilege of performing certain acts and which has for its purpose the defraying of the expense of the regulation of such acts for the benefit of the general public.” <em>Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd. v. Publicker Commercial Alcohol Co., </em><a href="/pa/347/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="347 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1217382" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0555-01">347 Pa. 555</a>, 560, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20914" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="32 A.2d 914">32 A. 2d 914</a> (1943). Quite simply, we believe that the City mercantile license tax and the State registration fee are both charges levied on the taxpayer’s privilege of transacting business, and it is the purpose of the Sterling Act limitation to prevent the collection of two such levies. That one levy is based upon gross sales and the other is calculated on the number of plants maintained by the taxpayer is, in our view, wholly irrelevant to the issue as the legislature has framed it, and we do not read the prior decisions of this Court as suggesting a contrary conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b308-4" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[173,1688,1146,470]]]'>In conclusion, we believe that the registration fee imposed on the taxpayer by The Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act is a regulatory or “true” license fee and that under the terms of the Sterling Act payment of that fee exempts the taxpayer from the scope of the mercantile license tax of the City of Philadelphia. For the foregoing reasons, we dissent from both the opinion of Mr. Justice Cohen and the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts.</p>

        <em> </em>It should be noted that the determination of whether a particular measure is a “tax” or a “license fee” is not simply an exercise in semantics, for the validity of specific enactments will in many cases be dependent upon that determination. For example, a measure which is found to be a tax would be invalid if not supported by some revenue power granted to the political entity which imposes the tax, since a tax cannot be enacted pursuant to that body’s police powers, or be imposed under the guise of a police regulation.</p>
