K. Curtis trust. Late in 1968 the trustees of that fund decided to explore the possibilities of selling the property. After various preliminary arrangements and'negotiations with several'parties, the trustees received, late in January of 1969, an offer of |8,050,000 from appellant in this case. Having fairly well decided to accept this offer the trustees, .through their attorney, contacted the Orphans’• Court division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>to gain that court’s approval of tne proposed sale under the Act of April 18, 1949, P.

As a result of these conferences the court, under the discretion vested in it by the terms of Section 963, declared the following: that notice of the sale be given all parties interested in the trust and all known prospective buyers; that at the time set for confirmation of the sale (April 11) the court would accept sealed bids of at least $8,150,000 from any other interested buyer, but that the appellant would have the right to “top” the highest such additional hid; that the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the minor beneficiaries was unnecessary; and that it would accept both of the trustees’ proffered affidavits of value in satisfaction of the local court rules, even though one of them did not conform in some ways to the required phraseology. On March • 19 the appellant entered • into a contract with the trustees whereby he agreed to purchase the property for |8,050,000, subject to the court’s approval.</p>

Relating that he had suggested to the callers that the proper time for presenting any objections was at the hearing, he observed that neither they nor any other interested buyer was present. After further pleasantries were exchanged, the judge signed the decree approving the sale<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and said “Now, Mr. Klaus, your client [Salke] is the equitable owner.” Unhappily, the matter did not end with the decree.</p>

On May 8 the cast of characters expanded further when one A. Barton Lewis filed ■a petition seeking leave to intervene. On May 9 the court took these petitions under advisement.</p>
    <p id="b221-3" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[119,662,1147,697]]]'>The next relevant event occurred on May 28, when three contingent beneficiaries of the trust sought leave to intervene and requested that the court enjoin “final settlement” pending their study of the matter and final disposition of the litigation, Intervention was permitted and the injunction was granted. On July 2 the contingent beneficiaries filed a further petition requesting that the sale be set aside, alleging that guardians ad litem should have been appointed, that one of the two affidavits of value was defective, that the notice sent the heirs was misleading, and that the bidding-procedure adopted by the court had “chilled” truly competitive bidding.</p>
    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[118,1369,1148,741]]]'>The court reviewed the entire morass at a hearing on July 8. Two days later it filed an opinion and decree in which it set aside the April 11 confirmation decree, reasoning that the defective affidavit and the “topping” privilege granted appellant had “vitiated or tainted” the sale. A new, auction-type sale was ordered held on July 30. At that time the only bid submitted was an $8,450,000 offer from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, and the court entered a decree directing that the property be sold to the successful bidder. Appellant carefully preserved his rights below and filed this appeal. We vacate the decrees of July 11 and July 30 and reinstate that of April 11.</p>

We are of the opinion that the decree of April 11 removed the last obstacle and that the contract was, as of that moment, final. This result is mandated not only by general contract law and common sense bnt is specifically mandated by the Act of May 24, 1945, P. L. 944, 20 P.S. §§818, 819, which reads as follows:</p>

    <p id="b222-6" data-blocks='[["BL_222.7",222,[210,1595,1146,365]]]'>The decree of April 11 clearly brought the contract within the purview of this act. After that decree there were only two possible ways for the trustees to avoid the terms of their contract with appellant; by showing that the contract was induced by fraud, accident or mistake, or by showing that the April 11 decree did not have the effect of court approval of the contract.</p>

    <p id="b223-3" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[162,664,1150,1294]]]'>The only question remaining is whether the decree of April 11 was an effective court approval. It was. We note that the statute authorizing and requiring this approval grants the court broad discretion. No special prerequisites are mandated, no public sale is required. Once the court satisfies itself that the proposed action is in the best interests of the trust and grants its approval its role is complete. After all, the only reason that the court becomes involved at all in these matters is to protect the beneficiaries’ interest in seeing that the trustees discharge their duties faithfully and in the best interests of the trust. Once a court reaches the conclusion that the proposed action is appropriate and grants its approval, its job is done. Neither a lack of wisdom nor an error in business judgment nor a change of heart constitute adequate reason for altering the result once it is final. The Act of May 24, 1945, P. L. 944, 20 P.S. §§818, 819, specifically addresses itself to situations in which it appears after approval that a higher price could have been obtained, and it forbids any withdrawal of approval for such a reason. Absent a showing of a lack of integrity in the judicial process which led to the approval, the approval, once given, is final and binding.</p>

The trustees’ title insurance company, cautious corporate, entity .that it is, viewed this subtle transformation .with some skepticism, however, and suggested that the property looked very much like a piece of real estate.
