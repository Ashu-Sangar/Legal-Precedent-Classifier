    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.8",589,[113,595,1156,1294]]]'>In November, 1960, appellant, the Lancaster Area Refuse Authority (the Authority), commenced a landfill operation near the City of Lancaster. Refuse dumped by the Authority into this landfill polluted the water wells of two neighboring property owners. In suits brought by the property owners against the Authority for damages, a jury awarded verdicts in their favor, but the trial court entered judgments n.o.v. for the Authority. The Superior Court reversed these judgments, holding that sufficient evidence had been introduced at trial to support the verdicts based on the Authority’s negligence. <em>Reinhart v. Lancaster Area Refuse Authority, </em><a href="/pa-super/201/0614-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="201 Pa. Super. 614" data-case-ids="764306" data-case-paths="/pa-super/201/0614-01">201 Pa.

After the Authority had paid the judgments, it demanded reimbursement from the Transamerica Insurance Company (Transamerica) which had insured it against property damage liability. By the insurance policy the insurer agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>“[t]o pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident.” Transamerica denied coverage, whereupon the Authority brought the suit from which this appeal arises.</p>

On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>without opinion, <a href="/pa-super/214/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="214 Pa.
