Larson was the general contractor for the project, and had subcontracted the masonry work (bricklaying and building of walls) to Keystone Masonry Construction Company (Keystone), and the plumbing work to Steel City Piping Company (Steel City); Qn the date in question, a theater building was being constructed and Abbott, standing on the roof joists, was unhooking bundles of roofing as a crane lowered them onto the joists. While he was doing this, according to Abbott’s testimony, something went wrong and “I felt everything going out from under me. I turned, jumped, grabbed the top of the wall with my hands, held on as long as I could until the bricks come [sic] down. Then I landed in the debris.” In short, <em>something </em>caused the joists, upon which Abbott was standing, to fall.</p>

Larson was joined as an additional defendant. Of vital importance at the trial was the determination, if possible, of what factor or combination of factors caused the joists to fall. A jury verdict of $175,935.05 was returned in favor of Abbott against all the defendants except the architect.

Abbott and Steel City presented directly conflicting eyewitness testimony on the point, but that question was decided by the jury against Steel City and need not trouble us now. The following point for charge was read to the jury at the request of Steel City: “If you find that the Steel City Piping Company did not cut any chase in the interior wall of the theater then your verdict must be in favor of the plumbing contractor.” Since a verdict was returned against Steel City, the jury, obviously, must have found that the pipe chase was <em>cut </em>in the wall <em>by </em>the plumbers.</p>

Specifically, Steel City claims that the jury should have been charged as to the varying legal duties of a contractor, a subcontractor, an independent contractor, and an architect. Insofar as it related to Steel City, the lower court charged, in brief outline, as follows: in order for the plaintiff to recover, one or more of the defendants must have been negligent; negligence is the failure to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances; a person may be liable for the negligent acts of his servants or agents if done within the scope of their employ; if the act is negligent, it must <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>also be a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury; even if there is a negligent act which proximately caused the injury, defendant may still avoid liability if the plaintiff was contributorily negligent to any extent; two or more defendants may be jointly and severally liable; the allegedly negligent act which was supposedly done by Steel City was the cutting of a pipe chase near the accident, thus weakening the Avail; and, Steel City cam not be found liable if they did not, in fact, cut the aforesaid pipe chase in the wall.</p>
    <p id="b511-4" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[110,929,1151,804]]]'>When read as a whole, the charge to the jury appears to be quite clear factually, and to be legally adequate. <em>See Steinberg v. Sheridan, </em><a href="/pa/416/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="416 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="1893020" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0261-01">416 Pa. 261</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=205%20A.2d%20870" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="205 A.2d 870">205 A. 2d 870</a> (1965). If a case involves multiple defendants, including general and subcontractors, a charge which does not clearly establish which acts each defendant may be held responsible for may be inadequate. <em>Pascarella v. Kelley, </em><a href="/pa/378/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="378 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1250872" data-case-paths="/pa/378/0018-01">378 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%2070" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="105 A.2d 70">105 A. 2d 70</a> (1954). However, in the instant case, the charge left no room for the jury to possibly impute the acts of another to Steel City, as Avas the problem in <em>Pascarella. </em>In fact, the trial judge Avas so clear on this point that the verdict against Steel City Avas virtually a special finding that Steel City’s workers had cut the pipe chase into the wall, and that they were negligent in so doing.</p>

HoAvever, the uncontradicted testimony of the architect Avas to the effect that: the plans and specifications did not provide for <em>any </em>pipe chases to be cut; if one <em>did </em>have to be cut, then the plumbing subcontractor was <em>required </em>to first obtain the Avritten consent of the architect; and, no such consent, written or otherwise, was ever given by <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>the .architect, nor had snch consent ever been requested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In view of the aboye testimony, the trial court’s instruction' that Steel City could not be found liable unless it had cut out the pipe chase was equivalent to a direction to the jury to return a verdict for the plumbing subcontractor if it Avere found- to have followed the project’s specifications—precisely-what Steel City had requested. The-question which was left to the jury was whether a reasonable and prudent subcontractor, working under these plans and specifications, and under the conditions in which the defendants found themselves, would have cut out the pipe chases in violation of good practices and. in violation of the plans and specifications. .</p>

However, Steel City could offer no testimony about the condition of the pipe chase from July 29, 1963, to August 9, 1963.' This gap is absolutely crucial because, an accident just having occurred, repairs were naturally made and the construction work continued. One of Steel City’s witnesses testified that a wall which had had a pipe chase cut into it could easily be torn down and replaced by a wall with the pipe chase built into it during such a period. The foreman for the general contractor testified that this section of the wall had, in fact, been torn out and repaired after the accident. Accordingly,. we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding testimony as to the condition of the wall weeks, months and, in certain cases, years after the acr cident had occurred, in the absence of testimony equating such condition with the condition existing at .the time of the accident. . ~</p>

This claim is patently without merit, as is clear-from the following partial summary of his qualifications taken from the lower court’s opinion: “The. witness testified that he is engaged in the general contracting business,' operating several firms, composed of himself and members of his family: He is president of these companies, each engaged in various types of building—home building, commercial building and investment building.

He further testified that he has been in the general contracting business since the beginning of the year 1952 and had continued in it ever since. He has built dwelling houses, apartment houses, shopping centers and other like structures. He testified that he had built several buildings, three in number, in which the type of construction was masonry walls with steel bar joists and metal roof decking, similar to the Donaldson’s- Crossroads job.

We find .that the expert opinion of Bilotta, although necessarily based upon a complex hypothetical, situation, was of sufficient clarity to support the jury’s finding of proximate causation. <em>See Bialek v.

The walls were constructed of cinder block, and, in order to accommodate a vertical, four-inch drain pipe (to drain water from the roof), a channel would be cut from the blocks, leaving only the outer shell of the blocks and removing the ribbing. Customarily, the plumbers precede the masonry workers, so that the pipe is put up first and the wall then built around it. However, on occasion, this order may be reversed so that, in order to install the drain pipe, a slot must be cut out of one side of the cinder block wall, the pipe installed, and then the wall.covered over. .</p>
