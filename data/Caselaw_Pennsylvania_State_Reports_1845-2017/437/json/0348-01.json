        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn this automobile accident case Mr. and Mrs. Brown, plaintiffs at the trial and appellees here, alleged that Mrs. Brown was injured when a PTC bus struck her car from the rear. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Browns which included a $3,000.00 award to Mr. Brown for the loss of his wife\u2019s consortium. Appellant argued that on the basis of the evidence introduced at the trial it was entitled to either a judgment n.o.v. or a new trial. We disagree.\nAt the trial Mrs. Brown testified that she was driving south on Henry Avenue, a four lane dual roadway, on March 10, 1961, and that she was forced to slow down when another automobile pulled into her lane. She related that as she slowed down she noticed in her rear view mirror that the PTC bus following her seemed to be traveling faster than she was and that she was struck in the rear shortly thereafter. She further stated that the bus driver stopped and asked her if she was injured, but then refused to identify himself and promptly left the scene. Both Mr. Brown and a garage mechanic testified that there was green paint on the rear bumper of Mrs. Brown\u2019s automobile.\nThe PTC driver denied that there ever was an accident, and appellant introduced into evidence several statements made by Mrs. Brown shortly after the accident in which she apparently did not mention that a PTC bus was involved, but said only that she had been a victim of a hit-and-run accident.\nLiability\nThe issues in this area are factual, and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellee we agree with the court en banc\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record amply supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s operator was negligent in striking plaintiff\u2019s vehicle in the rear, proximately causing the injuries sustained by the wife-plaintiff. Defendant\u2019s contention that its operator never made contact with plaintiff\u2019s vehicle merely raised an issue of fact, the determination of which was for the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention that Mrs. Brown\u2019s pretrial statements render the verdict a miscarriage of justice is utterly without merit. The only thing that can be said about these statements is that they were incomplete insofar as Mrs. Brown failed to mention who the hit-and-run driver was. They were in no way inconsistent with her testimony at trial, and they certainly do not indicate that a reversal is required.\nThe judgment of the trial court as to the defendant\u2019s liability is therefore affirmed.\nConsortium\nMr. Chief Justice Bell, Mr. Justice Roberts and Mr. Justice Pomeroy favor affirmance of the award for loss of consortium, Mr. Justice Cohen, Mr.. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien do not. The Court being equally divided this portion of the judgment is also affirmed.\nMr. Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.",

        "text": "Concurring Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell:\nThe principle that a man is entitled to recover for the loss of consortium\u2014namely, his wife\u2019s services, including preparation of food and meals, aid, assistance, comfort, society and intercourse\u2014caused by another man\u2019s negligence or dereliction of duty is and always has been a basic foundation of our Anglo-Saxon Law.\nIn Kelley v. Mayberry Twp., 154 Pa. 440, 26 Atl. 595, the Court reiterated what had been a part of the very sinew of our law for countless years (page 447) : \u201cIn the case last cited [Henry & Wife v. Klopfer, 147 Pa. 178, 23 Atl. 337], it is said: 'The husband is entitled to recover the moneys he has expended or become liable to pay for the medical care and attendance upon his wife during her illness, and for the loss of her services while unable to attend to her domestic duties.\u2019 In Cooley on Torts, 226, the general doctrine on the subject is stated thus: 'For an injury to the wife, either intentionally or negligently caused, which deprives her of the ability to perform services, or lessens that ability, the husband may maintain an action for the loss of services, and also for an incidental loss or damage, such as moneys expended in care and medical treatment and the like.\u2019 Speaking of the origin, etc., of. the term 'services,\u2019 the same learned author says the word as now understood in connection with claims by husbands for damages, etc., 'implies whatever of aid, assistance, comfort and society the wife would be expected to render to, or bestow upon her husband, under the circumstances and in the condition in which they may be placed, whatever those may be. That services in the ordinary sense were not rendered at all, would be immaterial and irrelevant, except as the fact might, under some circumstances, tend to show a want of conjugal regard and affection and thereby mitigate the damages.\u2019 \u201d See Platz v. McKean Township, 178 Pa. 601, 36 Atl. 136; Bedillion v. Frazee, 408 Pa. 281, 183 A. 2d 341; Castelli v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 413 Pa. 17, 195 A. 2d 794.\nAs recently as Brown v. Glenside L. & C. Co., 429 Pa. 601, 240 A. 2d 822 (April, 1968), this Court again reaffirmed, in a short Per Curiam Opinion, the existing law of consortium in Pennsylvania. Mr. Justice Jones, in his concurring Opinion, pertinently said (page 602) : \u201cVery properly, in my opinion, the majority of this Court now reaffirms our ruling in Neuberg v. Bobowicz, 401 Pa. 146, 162 A. 2d 602 (1960).\u201d\nIn Neuberg v. Bobowicz, 401 Pa., supra, which denied a wife the right to recover for loss of consortium, Mr. Justice Eagen, in an interesting review of history, reiterated the right of a husband to recover for \u201closs of consortium.\u201d\nI would allow appellee Brown to keep the $3,000 awarded to him by the jury as consortium damages.\nThis has always been recognized, since before Biblical times and down through the recent decisions of this Court.\nThe wife\u2019s basic function is to raise the children and provide the services for her husband and children and for an affectionate home. When she is unable to perform her basic obligations to her husband and her family due to another man\u2019s negligent acts, what more basic right is there for the husband to be compensated for the loss of his beloved partner\u2019s \u201cservices\u201d? This has been true for centuries and its truth is still relevant and controlling, even in these troubled times, filled with turmoil, controversy and change.\nUntil 1950, wives were universally denied the right of consortium and only husbands were permitted to sue for harm to their conjugal interests. But in Hitaffer v: Argonne Company, 87 U.S. App. D.C. 57, 183 F. 2d 811, the Courts around the Country, have been dramatically split on whether to allow consortium to b.oth husband and wife, to the husband only, or to deny it to both husband and wife. See Anno. 23 A.L.R. 2d 1378 and Supplements \u2022 thereto.",
