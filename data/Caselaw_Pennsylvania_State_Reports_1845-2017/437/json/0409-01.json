        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis appeal involves the validity of a trespass action instituted for the recovery of damages for personal injuries. Appellants state the issue as follows: whether they are precluded from maintaining an action against the estate of a deceased defendant when the action was \u201ccommenced\u201d prior to defendant\u2019s death, defendant died prior to service of process being made, and the appellants were not aware of defendant\u2019s death until advised thereof more than one year after the statute of limitations had run.\nMorris Schor was the operator of a motor vehicle, owned by Harry Stein and wherein Mary Fuller was a passenger, which was involved in an accident with a motor vehicle owned and operated by one Clarence Becker on March 1, 1966. On February 21, 1968\u2014fif-teen days prior to the expiration of the two-year period of the statute of limitations\u2014counsel for Schor, Fuller and Stein (appellants) filed a praecipe for a writ of summons against Becker in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The writ of summons was issued but never served on Becker. Up to the time of oral argument of this appeal, appellants did not reissue the writ and Becker died, unserved with the writ of summons, on March 25, 1968. At the time of his death, Becker was not a party to any action instituted by appellants. On February 24, 1969, appellants filed a complaint in trespass to the same term, and number against Becker. That complaint was never, nor could, it have been, served upon Becker. On April 21, 1969, appellants then sought to proceed under Pa. R. Civ. P. 2077(a)(1) and 2079 (a)(1) and (2) by serving, by registered mail, the Secretary of the Commonwealth and Becker at his last known address.\nThere is nothing on this record to show the appoint ment of a personal representative for Becker\u2019s estate. However, Edward B. O\u2019Brien, a nephew of Becker, the presently-styled \u201camicus curiae,\u201d appeared in the court below and filed a pleading termed \u201cPreliminary Objections to Complaint Against and Service on Deceased Defendant,\u201d on the basis of which the court below entered its order sustaining such objections. O\u2019Brien, although not a party of record, filed the preliminary objections above referred to in the court below, Which objections led to the order from which the instant appeal was taken and, in fact, was the \u201cmoving party\u201d in the court below. O\u2019Brien appeared, through counsel, in. our Court, as amicus curiae and, at oral argument, it was made evident that his intervention into the litigation was inspired by Becker\u2019s insurance carrier.\nIt is clear, beyond any question, that O\u2019Brien lacked any standing whatsoever to challenge the validity of the instituted action. It follows that his pleading upon which the order below was entered could not and should not have been considered. Only a party having standing could file this pleading and O\u2019Brien clearly did not have such standing.\nThe order of the court below is vacated. O\u2019Brien to pay costs.\nIn the complaint filed by appellants, there are three counts, the third count being that of Hurry Stein for damages to his motor vehicle.\nThe docket entries included in the instant record reveal no basis for the statement in appellants\u2019 brief that \u201cservice was attempted upon [Becker], and the Sheriff\u2019s return of service indicated that he had moved from the address listed for him.\u201d The writ should have been served within thirty days after issuance. See: Pa. R. Civ. P. 1009(a); Peterson v. Philadelphia Sub. Transp. Co, 435 Pa. 232, 239, 255 A. 2d 577, 581 (1969).\nThis complaint was simply a \u201cpleading\u201d and not a \u201cprocess\u201d under Pa. R. Oiv. P. 1007(2). See: Yefko v. Ochs, 437 Pa. 233, 263 A. 2d 416 (1970).\nIt is obvious that such attempt at substituted service on the deceased Becker was without validity because he was neither a \u201cnon-resident [nor] a resident who becomes a non-resident or who conceals his whereabouts\u201d within the provision of Rule 2077(a) (1), and such attempt at service was patently defective.\" We treat the complaint as filed as simply surplusage under the circumstances.'\nWhile ordinarily \u201cno judgment or order for costs can be rendered against a party not a party of record in the absence of a statutory provision so authorizing.\u201d (Blue Ridge Metal Mfg. Co. v. Proctor, 335 Pa. 354, 356, 6 A. 2d 811, 812 (1939) yet, where a person not a party of record has been the \u201cmoving party,\u201d although he lacks standing, in the court below, ho renders himself liable for the costs which he has caused to be incurred. See: Haskins v. Low, 17 Pa. 64 (1851). Our imposition of costs in the case at bar in no manner serves as a precedent for the imposition of costs on amici curiae generally.",
