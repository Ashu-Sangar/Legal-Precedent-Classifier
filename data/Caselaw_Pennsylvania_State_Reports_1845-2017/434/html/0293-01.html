Even though the child was born when Leider and appellant were not married, the child, if fathered by Leider, was nevertheless legitimated by their subsequent marriage.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Therefore, since the child will not be bastardized by the testimony of the mother and her then husband, the rule does not prohibit their testifying to nonaccess. The facts established in the record surrounding the birth of the child underscore the artificial result reached in this case if the rule is rigidly applied. When the child was conceived, Leider and appellant were living together; Leider took appellant to the hospital for the birth of the child, consented to <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>a Caesarian section and paid the hospital bill; the child’s birth certificate bears Leider’s name as the father of the child; the Leiders’ 1962 joint federal tax return lists the child, “Suzanne Mary Leider,” as a dependent. These facts compel us to agree with the conclusion reached by the court below and the two dissenters on the Superior Court that Leider is the child’s father. If the trial court’s conclusion be correct, it follows that, although the child was born out of wedlock between appellant and Leider and was, therefore, illegitimate, nevertheless the subsequent marriage of the child’s father and mother rendered the child legitimate. Under these circumstances, the testimony of MacFarland and appellant as to nonaccess did not bastardize the child. By the subsequent marriage, legitimacy followed by operation of law and there was, therefore, no reason to prohibit MaeFarland and appellant from testifying.</p>

This presumption is designed to avoid the finding that a child is illegitimate, if at all possible. Since the child’s legitimacy is not at issue under the factual background herein presented, in our view the presumption is inapplicable. Assuming, arguendo, that the presumption is applicable, we cannot agree with Judge Weight’s statement, wholly unsupported by any reference to the record, that appellant’s case failed to muster the necessary proof. The court below relied on the following evidence: (a) MacFar land’s and appellant’s testimony that they had not had intercourse since 1956; (b) the testimony of the MacFar lands’ fifteen-year-old son that he had lived with his mother until 1965, that Leider came to live with appellant in 1959 and that appellant never spent any nights with MacFar land; (c) the corroborating testimony of the MacFarlands’ nineteen-year-old daughter; (d) the testimony of two neighbors who, although called by Leider, testified that they had not seen MacFar land at the house after July of 1961 — thirteen months before the child’s birth; (e) the testimony of a third friend to the same effect; (f) Leider’s testimony that he was intimate with appellant and was having sexual relations with her around the time the child was conceived. We hold that this evidence was fully sufficient to rebut the presumption that MacFarland, by reason of the marriage ties, is the child’s father — if the presumption is, in fact, presently applicable.</p>

For the law to exclude the very evidence which may go to the heart of the issue in controversy on the basis of a public policy which has ceased to exist is to blind ourselves to the realities of today. In the early 18th century the presumption of legitimacy was conclusive and <em>no </em>evidence which would tend to bastardize the child born to a married couple was permitted to refute this conclusive presumption. <em>Bew v. Luffe, </em>8 East 193, 208. But that was a rule for an era in which a child once considered illegitimate had no capacity to become legitimatized; the harshness of illegitimacy at common law required a rule which would protect a child born to a married mother, regardless of who the father was.</p>

To reflect this change in attitude a rule other than one which would exclude the most relevant and compelling evidence is needed. And we need not search far for such a rule which will still reflect a desire to uphold the legitimacy of all children born to married women but at the same time recognize <em>actual </em>parenthood when the contrary holding would offend our sense of justice.</p>

They will not be held legitimate by a sacrifice of probabilities in a futile quest for certainty. Some of the books tell us that, to overcome the presumption [of legitimacy], the evidence of nonaccess must be ‘clear and convincing’ . . . others that it must lead to a conclusion that is ‘strong and irresistible’ . . . others that it must be proof ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’ ....

The following is the evidence on which the majority principally relies: (a) that the husband came to visit his wife only occasionally when she was living with another man and during the period of conception; (b) that <em>three </em>neighbors had testified that they had not seen the husband at the house where his wife lived (three blocks away) for a period of thirteen months before the child’s birth; and (c) finally, that the husband’s 15-year-old son had testified that his mother <em>never spent any nights </em>with her husband and this was corroborated by another child. The fact that several (3) neighbors had not seen the husband at his wife’s home during the period of conception is miles away from proving that he wasn’t there during that nine-month period. Furthermore, everybody in the world (with the apparent exception of a majority of this Court) knows that a woman does not have to spend nights, <em>or any night, </em>with a man in order to have a child by that man.</p>
