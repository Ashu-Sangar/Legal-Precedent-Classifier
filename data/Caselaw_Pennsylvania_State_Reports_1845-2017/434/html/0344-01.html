Her last will, dated August 18, 1966, provided, inter alia, for a gift of $10,000 to the Reading Hospital in memory of her husband, $5,000 to be used for the maintenance of operating rooms and $5,000 to be used for maintenance and equipment in the anesthetic department. These provisions were identical to those contained in a will which testatrix had executed on August 10, 1966.</p>

Any bequest or devise for religious or charitable purposes, included in a will or codicil executed within thirty days of the death of the testator shall be invalid unless all who would benefit by its invalidity agree that it shall be valid. . . . Unless the testator directs otherwise, if such <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>a will or codicil shall revoke or supersede a prior will or codicil executed at least thirty days before the testator’s death, <em>and not theretofore revoked or superseded </em>and the original of which can be produced in legible condition, and if each instrument shall contain an identical gift for substantially the same religious or charitable purpose, the gift in the later will or codicil shall be valid; or if each instrument shall give for <em>substantially the same religious or charitable purpose </em>a <em>cash legacy or </em>a <em>share of the residuary </em>estate or a share of the same asset, payable immediately or subject to identical prior estates and conditions, the later gift shall be <em>valid to the extent to which it shall not exceed the prior gift.” </em>(Emphasis added.) The court held that since the will of November 5, 1965 had been revoked by the will of August 10, 1966, the 1965 will was not available to save the charitable gifts in the will of August 18, 1966, since the Act requires that the prior will not be “theretofore revoked or superseded.” I believe that this reading of “revoked or superseded” is excessively narrow and mechanical and does violence to the rationale of the Wills Act when applied in this case.</p>

In the case before us, however, testatrix <em>at all times </em>from the making of the 1965 will evidenced an intent to give the greater part of her estate to exactly those charities which benefited under her final will. Although testatrix’s August 10th will revoked her 1965 will, it did not change in the least her general charitable intent to benefit appellant. Had the will of August 10th been her final will, even though it too had been executed within thirty days of testatrix’s death, it would have been valid within Section 7(1) as being for “substantially the same religious or chari<a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>table purpose.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Yet because testatrix eight days later executed a new will, which changed not a whit the charitable gifts, the court below held that the gift was barred.</p>
    <p id="b453-7" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[189,609,1146,602]]]'>The Wills Act of 1947 was intended to soften the effect of the Wills Act of 1917, Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, §6, which provided no way to validate a charitable bequest made within thirty days of testator’s death. The purpose of the earlier act was to insure that “testamentary gifts to religion or charity were the result of deliberate intent of the testator, and were not coerced from him while in a weakened physical condition under the influence of the doubts and terrors of impending death.” <em>Paxson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/221/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="221 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="956128" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0098-01">221 Pa. 98</a>, 111, <a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.%20280" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="70 A. 280">70 Atl. 280</a>, 285 (1908).</p>

Under our decision in <em>Baum </em>Estate, we should interpret the statute to carry out its purpose, a purpose which aims at allowing the very type of gift that we have before us. Instead, the decision of the court below, affirmed now by the majority, ignores the long-standing intent of the testatrix because she <em>reaffirmed </em>that intent in a will that by happenstance revoked the earlier will for purposes irrelevant to this case. Thus the majority seems concerned only with the ancient requirement that a charitable gift avoid imagined or nonexistent problems of undue influence by complying with senseless technicalities, and fails to rely on the clearly expressed charitable intent of the testatrix and the public policy encouraging charitable gifts. I cannot abide such a result which so patently ignores the purpose of the Wills Act and the intent of the testatrix which existed long before the thirty day period, and I vigorously dissent.</p>

The income gift payable indefinitely Is substantially the same as an absolute gift, see <em>McGuigen Estate, </em><a href="/pa/388/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="388 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="1272548" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0475-01">388 Pa. 475</a>, 480, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.2d%20124" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="131 A.2d 124">131 A. 2d 124</a>, 127 (1957), and the restrictions on the use of the money in the later wills are not significant for present purposes.
