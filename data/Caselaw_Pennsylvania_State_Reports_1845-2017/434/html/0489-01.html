During the initial interrogation appellant was asked about a murder in a different case, committed in 1960, and appellant admitted that he had committed that crime. Appellant on July 13 and 14 gave several oral statements and a written confession admitting the murder. On July 18, appellant was taken to the Erie County Jail. On August 31, 1963, appellant gave another written confession. In the period between July 18 and August 31, appellant was questioned intermittently by police.</p>

The post-conviction court held the August 31 confession to have been involuntary and thus inadmissible and granted appellant a new trial. The July 13 and 14 statements and confessions of appellant were held voluntary and were admitted at appellant’s retrial over objection. On September 23, 1968 a jury convicted appellant of murder in the second degree, appellant’s motion for a new trial was denied, and appellant took this appeal.</p>

Appellant contends that although his first trial took place before <em>Miranda, </em>his retrial took place after <em>Miranda </em>and thus in the second trial, the <em>Miranda </em>rules apply.</p>

It is not altogether clear, even in light of this, why <em>Johnson </em>utilized a <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>date-of-trial test, rather than the date-of-occurrence test used subsequently in <em>Stovall v.

Ct. 1967</a> (1967). It does seem, however, that the Court has wisely chosen in <em>Jenkins </em>to restrict to as great an extent as possible, within the limits of <em>Johnson, </em>the anomalous situation where the police are required to have given <em>Miranda </em>warnings before <em>Miranda </em>had been decided. Since the requirements of <em>Miranda </em>do not go to the validity of the guilt-determining process, it seems fair in striking the balance between individual rights and the administration of criminal justice to limit the retroactive application of the case. See generally Mishkin, Foreward: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%2056" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="79 Harv. L. Rev. 56">79 Harv. L. Rev. 56</a> (1965). This is especially true since the voluntariness test, considering the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings as a relevant factor, still provides a mechanism to guard against the infringement of individual liberties. See Comment, The Applicability of <em>Miranda </em>to Retrials, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20316" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="116 U. Pa. L. Rev. 316">116 U. Pa.

Although a hearing was held, and the confession declared voluntary in 1964, the court below correctly ruled that it was necessary to make a new determination of voluntariness under the “evolving” voluntariness test. See <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, </em><a href="/us/384/0719-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="384 U.S. 719" data-case-ids="12047240" data-case-paths="/us/384/0719-01">supra;</a> <em>Davis v.

Appellant’s questioning began around 10:30 p.m. on July 13, and the original hearing court found that appellant made his initial incriminating statements within 20 minutes of his arrest. He was then questioned until 3:30 a.m. on July 14, when he was given an opportunity to rest. Although appellant now claims that his quarters were inadequate, there is no indication that appellant was unable to sleep, or was at any time exhausted.</p>

      <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>Although appellant was questioned over a twenty-four hour period, the interrogation sessions were separated so that there is no indication that appellant was mentally or physically exhausted nor was his will overborne by constant questioning. The fact that appellant was allowed to retire long before the police had achieved their desired aims indicates that they did <em>not </em>intend to utilize exhaustion as a mechanism to gain further admissions from appellant. Compare <em>Spano v. New York, </em><a href="/citations/?q=860%20U.S.%20315" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="860 U.S. 315">860 U.S. 315</a>, <a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="79 S.

Appellant made his initial admission almost immediately, at a time when there is no question that his statements could be anything but voluntary. This, of course, does not necessarily validate his later admissions, see <em>Gallegos v. Colorado, </em><a href="/us/370/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="370 U.S. 49" data-case-ids="6165284" data-case-paths="/us/370/0049-01">370 U.S. 49</a>, 54-55, <a href="/us/370/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="370 U.S. 49" data-case-ids="6165284" data-case-paths="/us/370/0049-01">82 S. Ct. 1209</a>, 1212-13 (1962), but after the first statement, the record indicates that the police were interested in filling in the details, and perhaps in making sure that appellant’s original admission was true and not the product of confusion. Certainly appellant could have benefited by the warnings now required by <em>Miranda, </em>and he is probably the type of prisoner who most needs an attorney’s aid, but in an atmosphere otherwise free of coercion, the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is certainly not fatal to a finding of voluntariness.</p>

Even assuming that on this record, appellant has established that the mental state of the police was as he claims, this is not enough to alone invalidate the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>confession. There is no question that it is perfectly proper for the police to question prisoners in an attempt to elicit confessions or alternatively to solve a crime or perhaps even absolve a suspect.

A friendly attitude toward the prisoner is hardly the type of police conduct which leads to a finding of involuntariness. Nowhere in the record is there any evidence that the police were in any way deceptive or dishonest in their treatment of appellant. Bather, by being friendly, the police alleviated the danger of intimidating appellant into making admissions. We certainly cannot condemn that conduct.</p>

      <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[212,1681,1159,739]]]'> There is some doubt in my mind that this evidence is properly before us. It was not presented in the suppression hearing in the instant trial. Although the petition for a suppression hearing did assert that the confession was involuntary as well as violative of <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda, </em>appellant presented no evidence at the hearing and cross-examined only as to the <em>Escobedo-Miranda </em>issue. However, appellant’s attorney must have believed, quite reasonably, that it was an exercise in futility to present evidence on voluntariness since in the post-conviction proceeding which ultimately led to the new trial, the judge below here, 'Judge McClelland, had considered all the evidence on the voluntariness of the confession at issue here, and had held it to be voluntary. Judge McClelland reasserted that view in the opinion below. In light of this unusual situation, I am inclined to agree with the majority that the fairest thing to do is to consider all of the evidence with regard to voluntariness.</p>
