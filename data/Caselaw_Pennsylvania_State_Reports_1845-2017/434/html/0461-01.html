The will named his two daughters, Helen Eeynolds and Anna Toth, executrices, and Letters Testamentary were granted to them on March 10, 1966. On May 9, 1966, Elda filed a widow’s election to take against the will. The executrices responded by filing a petition which alleged the existence of the Agreement of January 18, 1955, set forth above, and requested a citation to show cause why the election should not be vacated.</p>

Appellant Elda does not contend that there was any failure of a full and fair disclosure of the property of each, or that there was any fraud or deception practiced by either party. Her sole contention was set forth in Paragraph 8 of her answer, which reads as follows: “It is admitted that Elda DiSantis now Elda Eoseiolo entered into a pre-nuptial agreement with the decedent, Umberto Eoseiolo dated January 18, 1955. However, the decedent Umberto Eoseiolo did by various acts of desertion and nonsupport breach the agreement of January 18, 1955 making said instrument null and <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>void and without effect to prevent Elda Eosciolo from taking against the Will of Umberto Eosciolo. In the alternative it is alleged that under paragraph four of the agreement of January 18, 1955 Elda Eosciolo is entitled to support from the Estate of Umberto Eosciolo for the rest of her natural life.”</p>
    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[150,736,1147,321]]]'>After a Court hearing at which no testimony was taken, the Court, upon motion of appellant, orally dismissed the petition.

It will suffice to say that an antenuptial agreement is presumptively valid and binding and can be overcome, avoided or nullified in the ways set forth in said cases. However, the present case is unusual, in that appellant-widow does not challenge the validity of the Antenuptial Agreement but only (a) its meaning, and (b) whether she waived her right or election to take against the will as to which there was <em>no express provision, </em>and (c) whether a subsequent breach of the Agreement by the decedent nullified the Antenuptial Agreement. At the first hearing before the Orphans’ Court Judge, the widow (1) abandoned the contention set forth in her answer, namely, that the Agreement was nullified because of the decedent’s desertion and nonsupport, and (2) based her claim and her right to an election to take against his will on the fact that the Antenuptial Agreement did not contain an express waiver of this right.</p>

Included among the witnesses called by the executrices was the widow, who was called as on cross-examination. The purpose of this testimony was to show the widow’s understanding of the meaning and the scope of the Antenuptial Agreement. Counsel for the widow vigorously objected to the introduction of this testimony on the ground that it violated the parol evidence rule. Judge MacElree admitted the evidence, which is not only relevant and very important, but in our judgment is admissible.</p>
    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[234,953,1158,808]]]'>Appellant had completed only the first grade of school in Italy and did not seem to understand the English language very well.

My property, mine; his property was his, but have to take care of me on his property. Q. What did you say, exactly? A. That'is all, just that. Q. Did you say anything about what took place if you died or he died? A. As I say, if he die, his property belongs to his children, but before he got to take care of me. That was on agreement. I remember, said to my husband, you ought to take care of your wife. He get up off chair, and say, yes, and he said, he take care of me.”</p>

The Agreement provided, as above fully set forth, that each party had made a full disclosure to the other of his and her respective real and personal estate, and this was followed by a statement of the real estate which he owned and of the real estate and restaurant business which she owned. In our judgment, this An<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>tenuptial Agreement precludes any right of either party to take against the will of the other,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> even though there is no express waiver.</p>
