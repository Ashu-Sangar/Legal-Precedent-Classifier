On January 2, 1969, a petition was filed asking leave to amend the original election contest petition. On January 6th, the court dismissed the motion to strike the surety bond, but denied the motion to amend and, in addition, sustained the motion to quash and dismiss the election contest.

    <p id="b471-4" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[170,1239,1149,708]]]'>The controlling averments as stated in the petition are these: “5. That the said election and return thereof are false, fraudulent, and untrue for the following reasons: (1) The County Board of Elections illegally rejected a number of absentee ballots cast and did not count same among the other absentee votes. (2) That in the recounting or recanvassing of the Ballot Boxes upon petition of electors from sixty-four precincts the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County erred in voiding a large number of Ballots marked with an (x) wherein the lines or the line of the (x) mark, even though the lines intersected in the box where the (x) originated.”</p>

    <p id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[218,465,1159,533]]]'>The second allegation of irregularity asserted in the petition concerned the court’s ruling on the validity of certain ballots. The ruling was made during the recount proceedings ordered by the court of the ballots in the 64 election districts in Cambria County. The court ruled, over Green’s objection, that these ballots (three in number) were improperly marked<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> by the electors, and hence, should not be counted. The court, however, subsequently changed its ruling and directed that these ballots were valid and should be counted.</p>

As was noted before, the correctness of the Board’s rejection of these seven ballots was subsequently raised before the court below during the recount proceedings and its ruling in regard thereto was not appealed. Additionally, even if all of these ballots were counted in favor of Green and added to the total vote he received, it would not change the result of the election.</p>

    <p id="b472-7" data-blocks='[["BL_472.7",472,[209,1785,1153,427]]]'>As was noted before, a petition for an election contest “may be amended with leave of court, so as to include additional specifications of complaint.” (25 P.S. §3456.) The allowance of such an amendment is, however, a matter for the discretion of the lower court. <em>Ayre’s Contested Election, </em>supra.

    <p id="b473-3" data-blocks='[["BL_473.3",473,[177,398,1149,487]]]'>
      <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>The lower court gave quite specific reasons for disallowing the Petition to Amend. It noted primarily that the purported amendment was, in effect, an endeavor to file an election contest petition well beyond the twenty day, post-election period. The lower court also concluded that the original petition so failed to comply with the Act of 1937, supra, that it was incapable of amendment, and could not provide the substance for a subsequent amendment.</p>
    <p id="b473-4" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[172,898,1151,535]]]'>Moreover, the court found other substantial reasons why leave to amend should be refused. The petition seeking leave to amend was not verified nor was it signed by the twenty electors who attempted to initiate the election contest. These defects may not be brushed aside as mere “legal technicalities.” Both the Buies of Civil Procedure of the Supreme Court and the Buies of Civil Procedure of the Court of Common Pleas of Cambria County require that such petitions be verified.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The petitioners, of course, seek to have a recount of all the ballot boxes in the 35th Senatorial District which have not previously been recounted. They point to errors found in the boxes recounted during the court-supervised recount, and <em>speculate </em>that a pervasive recount of all such previously un<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>recounted boxes would yield proportionate errors, and result in the appellant’s election. The language of the act is as follows: “The petition shall concisely set forth the <em>cause </em>of complaint, showing wherein it is claimed that the primary or election is illegal.” (Emphasis supplied.) We cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the lower court abused its discretion in deciding that the petitioners showed no cause necessitating an election contest. As we noted before, “the court will not grope in the dark, or follow a contestant on a fishing expedition, in the hope of being able to find enough to enable him by the investigation to make out his case.” <em>Ayrefs Contested Election, </em>supra.</p>

With this position I cannot agree. The original petition stated, inter alia, that certain ballots had been improperly voided. The court below found, however, that even with these ballots counted, appellant would lose. The amended petition, besides setting out various errors that had been found during the recount proceedings, alleged that the improper voiding of ballots in the boxes examined required that other boxes be examined to see if equivalent improper ballot-voiding had taken place. Improper voiding in unexamined boxes if done in the same proportion as in the examined boxes would have made appellant the winner. I <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>do not believe that appellant’s failure to explicitly make this point in his original petition rendered that petition “nothing, so an amendment to nothing is also nothing” as the court below cavalierly concluded. Bather, in my view the amended petition was making essentially the same claim as that of the original petition, except that the amended petition contained an additional legal conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[171,856,1149,600]]]'>I also do not believe that the amended petition required verification. Pa. R. C. P. 206 requires verification of “allegations of fact which do not appear of record.” Any facts alleged in the amended petition that were not in the (verified) original petition were statements of errors found in the recount proceeding, which was “of record.” Appellant’s claim that he would have been the winner if unexamined boxes disclosed the same proportion of errors as the examined boxes is merely a conclusion for which verification is unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[170,1468,1148,547]]]'>Finally I cannot agree with the majority’s conclusion that because appellant is merely “speculating” that proportionate errors occurred in previously unrecounted boxes, appellant thus has not stated grounds to contest the election. Of course appellant cannot prove the alleged errors <em>unless </em>he is granted a recount of these boxes; carried to its logical conclusion, the majority’s reasoning would characterize any request for a recount as based on speculation until the recount proved the petitioner’s claim!</p>
