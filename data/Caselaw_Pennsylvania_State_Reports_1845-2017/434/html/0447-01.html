    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.4",556,[208,628,1156,653]]]'>Near the end of 1958 Dr. Ivens developed a serious heart condition which required him to reduce his work load considerably. At the same time, Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas became interested in acquiring á proprietary interest in the business; because of his. heart condition, Dr. Ivens was receptive to their plans. An agreement was finally worked out among the three doctors, the exact terms of which are in dispute in this litigation. The three doctors consulted a lawyer to draw up the agreement, who, in turn, referred them to an associate specializing in taxation. Three documents were eventually executed.</p>
    <p id="b556-5" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[206,1293,1153,431]]]'>The first document was the partnership agreement. Under this agreement, Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas as the active partners were each to receive a salary of $150.00 per week plus 45% of the net profits of the business; Dr. Ivens, the inactive partner, was to receive a salary of $500.00 per year and 10% of the net profits and he was to transfer certain equipment and accounts receivable to the partnership.</p>
    <p id="b556-6" data-blocks='[["BL_556.6",556,[205,1737,1153,377]]]'>The second document was a deed transferring the real estate at 60 Haverford Eoad from Dr. Ivens to Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas as tenants in common for a consideration of $1.00. Dr. Ivens, pursuant to advice from his accountant, filed a federal gift tax return covering this transfer, wherein the property was valued at $50,000.00 subject to an $8,000.00 mortgage.</p>

At all times during the course of these events Drs. Ivens and Schmidt resided at the kennels at Doyles<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>town, while Dr. Yuhas lived with his family at 60 Haverford Road.</p>
    <p id="b557-4" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[156,512,1149,533]]]'>The three doctors also entered into an oral agreement, the terms of which are in dispute. Dr. Ivens alleged, and the court below so found, that the agreement was to the effect that Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas would support Dr. Ivens for the remainder of his life in exchange for which Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas would take over Dr. Ivens’ veterinary practice. Allegedly, the three doctors valued Dr. Ivens’ capital contribution to the partnership at $250,000.00, including the property at 60 Haverford Road.</p>

The payments in behalf of Dr. Ivens totalled $62,986.00 during this period.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[146,1512,1154,817]]]'>As time wore on, Dr. Yuhas became dissatisfied with this arrangement. Dr. Ivens regained his health and expenses on his behalf increased yearly. Dr. Yuhas expressed an interest in revising the agreement so that the partnership’s support of Dr. Ivens would terminate at some definite time in the future, but the three doctors were unable to agree on a revision. Finally, on September 1, 1966, Dr. Yuhas served written notice on the other two doctors that he was dissolving the partnership upon receipt of the notice. Drs. Ivens and Schmidt considered this a violation of the agreement since the agreement contains no provision for unilateral dissolution of the partnership and because a partner must give sixty days’ notice of his intention to withdraw from the partnership.</p>

At this time Dr. Schmidt moved from the Doylestown kennels to 60 Haverford Road in order to protect his share of the business. From this time on the partners engaged in activity toward each other which can only be termed puerile. One such incident led to the second suit. Dr. Ivens had had the partnership truck driven from the Doylestown kennels to 60 Haverford Road to deliver some dogs and, while the truck was in the garage, Dr. Yuhas deflated the tires and drove his wife’s car into the driveway to block any exit by the truck. Dr. Ivens responded by withdrawing all of the partnership funds from the bank and depositing the same in his own name in another bank. Dr. Yuhas then instituted a suit to enjoin Dr. Ivens from withdrawing these funds.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.4",558,[229,1347,1154,599]]]'>The third suit was started after Dr. Yuhas had sent out announcements that he was withdrawing from the partnership but was continuing his veterinary practice. On the announcement he listed three telephone numbers, two of which had originally been registered in Dr. Ivens’ name and had since been used by the partnership. When Dr. Ivens attempted to have these two numbers disconnected, Dr. Yuhas filed suit against his two “partners” and the Bell Telephone Company, requesting the court to appoint a receiver to wind up the partnership affairs.</p>

Schmidt and Yuhas, asserting that the two defendants had violated the alleged oral agreement and asking that Dr. Yuhas be enjoined from interfering with the partnership business at 60 Haverford Road and from conveying that property. A fifth suit, which is not involved in the present appeal, was brought by Drs. Ivens and Schmidt against Dr. Yuhas, seeking to <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>enjoin Mm from interfering with any phase of the business conducted at 60 Haverford Road.</p>

At the time of trial, most of the issues had become moot. The Chancellor concentrated on the two remaining issues: (1) what legal and equitable interests were created by the conveyance of 60 Haverford Road to Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas? (2) how were the rights of the parties affected by the breach of the contract to support Dr. Ivens for the remainder of his life?</p>
    <p id="b559-5" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[148,1069,1149,655]]]'>The Chancellor found that Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas had, in fact, violated the contract for support and that this breaeh justified a rescission of the entire agreement. In its decree, the Chancellor ordered that the partnership agreement be rescinded; that Drs.

There is no denial that Dr. Ivens signed the return, but this does not end the matter. From reading the record, one conclusion stands out. Most of the legal work in setting up the partnership was done by a lawyer and an accountant specializing in taxation. It is not clear that they were aware of exactly what the future partners had agreed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> It is clear that they had estate planning in mind when they suggested that Dr. Ivens convey his property to Drg. Schmidt and Yuhas as an <em>inter vivos </em>gift rather than as a bequest in his will. The following facts are crucial in this regard. First, it was the accountant’s suggestion that Dr. Ivens file a gift tax return on this conveyance. Second, the return was executed by the accountant. Third, Dr. Ivens testified that he could not remember whether he had read the return or even whether he had signed it. Fourth, the partnership paid the amount due on the gift tax return. Fifth, Dr. Ivens testified that his accountant regularly filled out his federal income tax return and that he seldom, if ever, checked over the return before signing it. In short, there is sufficient evidence in the record from which the Chancellor could have found that Dr. Ivens took no interest whatsoever in tax matters and that he was not aware of the consequences of his signing the gift tax return. We conclude, therefore, that even though Dr. Ivens signed the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>gift tax return, there is ample evidence in the record to justify the conclusion that he never intended to convey the property as a gift. On the state of the record, a conclusion that he intended to make the conveyance as a gift would be almost incredible. It is highly unlikely that a veterinarian with a good practice would “give” the practice away without some assurance that his needs would be taken care of for the remainder of his life. Of course, in finding that Dr. Ivens received consideration for the conveyance of the property, we express no opinion as to whether he committed perjury in filing a gift tax return.</p>

As a general statement of law this is correct.

First, the lawyer and accountant who were responsible for drawing up the three documents testified that they were not aware of any oral agreement. Second, if they were aware, a conceivable reason for omitting any reference to the agreement for support was the fact that it would have belied the gift tax return executed on behalf of Dr. Ivens. Third, and most important, when the partnership was formed, the three doctors had complete confidence in each other and they thought they had agreed on all aspects of the partnership. They were content to let their lawyer and accountant — -who were primarily concerned with the tax aspects of the partnership — draw up the necessary legal papers, secure in the satisfaction that they had already agreed among themselves on the terms of the partnership.</p>

Schmidt and Yuhas as tenants in common created a resulting trust in favor of the partnership. He reached this conclusion by holding that the partnership and not Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas actually paid Dr. Ivens for the property. This settlement was in the form of the various support payments on behalf of Dr. Ivens.</p>

Section 404 states: “A resulting trust arises where a person makes or causes to be made a disposition of property under circumstances which raise an inference that he does not intend that the person taking or holding the property should have the beneficial interest therein, unless the inference is rebutted or the beneficial interest is otherwise effectively disposed of.” Section 440 continues: “Where a transfer of property is made to one person and the, purchase price is paid by another, a resulting trust arises in favor of the person by whom the purchase price is paid, except as stated in [three sections which are not relevant to this case].”</p>

As far as the payment for the property is concerned, there is no question that the partnership paid Dr. Ivens an amount sufficient to cover his heat, electric and telephone bills, dog show expenses, travel promotion, automobile expenses and the salaries of his housekeeper, gardener and kennelman.</p>

What Dr. Yuhas apparently contests is the finding that the partnership was the beneficial owner <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>of the property. While admitting that the partnership appeared to exercise dominion over the property, Dr. Yuhas argues that this was the result of a mistake on the part of the accountant. This is hut another example in the record of how the partnership agreement was framed solely in reference to the tax aspects, apparently ignoring what the partners had actually agreed. The accountant’s testimony indicates to us merely that he was primarily concerned with saving on taxes for the partnership and was not really concerned about whether the three doctors looked upon the property as belonging to the partnership or to Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The fact is that the partnership conducted its business at 60 Haverford Road and, to all intents, it was treated as partnership property.</p>

Although Dr. Yuhas is correct in indicating that most cases involving this exception have involved family-type contracts, there is nothing in the exception itself or in the case law to indicate that the exception should be confined to this type of contract. If the facts of this case fit the exception, and we agree with the Chancellor that they do, then the exception should apply.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[232,1405,1158,921]]]'>Dr. Yuhas draws our attention to the <em>Bruno </em>case in which we held that, if the promise to support is not the total consideration, rescission will not lie. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, at 505. Dr. Yuhas argues that the agreement to support was not the only consideration and that all the terms other than the support agreement have been satisfied. We cannot agree. Viewing the transaction as a whole, the terms of the contract were to the effect that Dr. Ivens would transfer the property at. 60 Haverford Road and his veterinary practice to Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas in exchange for the promise to support him for the remainder of his life. Admittedly, Drs. Schmidt and Yuhas provided adequate support until November 1, 1966, but at that time the support ceased altogether, so that the Chancellor was justified in considering this a failure of consideration justifying rescission.</p>

Dr. Yuhas maintains that Dr. Ivens is barred from relief because he is now claiming that he transferred the property at 60 Haverford Road for full consideration whereas when he previously filed the gift tax return he claimed that he had transferred the property as a gift. We have already noted above that the evidence in the record justifies the conclusion that the gift tax return was prepared by an accountant as part of an, estate planning scheme for Dr. Ivens’ benefit and that there is no evidence that Dr. Ivens was aware of the legal consequences of his signing the return. We are convinced that there was no deliberate inconsistency or dishonesty in Dr. Ivens’ actions. Therefore, we hold that Dr. Ivens is not barred from recovery by the “clean hands” doctrine.</p>

How could you do that when all through the years it had been included as a partnership asset, partnership property? A. I would say that perhaps I was incorrect, our firm was incorrect in treating it as a partnership asset during the five year period that it was so treated, but it didn’t mean anything tax-wise because the depreciation was taken off.”</p>
