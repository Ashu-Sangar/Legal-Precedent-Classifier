When his case came up for hearing, appellant chose to enter a plea of guilty to voluntary manslaughter. The hearing judge accepted the plea without conducting an on-the-record examination of the appellant to determine whether his plea was made intelligently and voluntarily. Appellant has now filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act in which he alleges that his guilty plea was not entered into voluntarily and intelligently because he was never informed by his counsel or the court of the meaning and consequences of a guilty plea. The court below conducted a hearing after which it held that appellant’s plea was made voluntarily and intelligently and thus denied the petition. Appellant has appealed this decision to our Court.</p>

In <em>Johnson, </em>the Court stated, “We must look to the purpose of our new standards governing police interrogation, the reliance which may have been placed upon prior decisions on the subject, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of Escobedo and Miranda.” (384 U.S. at 727) The majority stressed that “the choice between retroactivity and non-retroactivity in no way turns on the value of the constitutional guarantee involved.” (384 U.S. at 728) In holding that <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>need not be applied retroactively, the Court pointed out that a defendant who wished to challenge the validity of his confession could still argue that the confession was not voluntary, relying on the long line of Supreme Court decisions striking down coerced confessions. “We emphasize that the question whether a constitutional rule of criminal procedure does or does not enhance the reliability of the fact-finding process at trial is necessarily a, matter of degree. . . . We are thus concerned with a question of probabilities and must take account, among other factors, of the extent to which other safeguards are available to protect the integrity of the truth-determining process at trial.” (384 U.S. at 728, 729)</p>

He is free to argue in a post-conviction proceeding that his plea was not made intelligently and voluntarily and he must be given a hearing on this claim if it is not patently frivolous on the face of the record.

In my view, under our procedure, we need never overturn a guilty plea <em>simply </em>because there was no on-the-record inquiry <em>at the time </em>the plea was entered, provided that a subsequent record establishes that the plea is otherwise valid.

      <em>Boyhin, </em>as I read it, deals with the following situation: at the. outset, the trial judge accepted a guilty plea with absolutely no on-the-record inquiry of the defendant as to whether the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed, with no further record before it, in effect approving this procedure, at least as a matter of state law. The case then moved on to the Supreme Court of the United States, where that Court was faced with a guilty plea, apparently held valid under state law, that had <em>no </em>supporting record as to voluntariness. Under these facts, the Supreme Court of the United States had no choice but to reverse and invalidate the guilty plea.</p>

Thus after the ease left our state system, the Supreme Court of the United States would have before it — as we do now— a full record establishing the validity of the plea. In <em>Boykin, </em>the Supreme Court stated that “We cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights [those waived by a guilty plea] from a silent record.” 37 U.S.L. Week at 4476. Here, however, there is no silent record, and thus no need to <em>presume </em>a waiver.

Ct. 814</a> (1963), or even in a case where the plea was entered after <em>Boyldn, </em>we would remand for an evidentiary hearing and a determination of whether the plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered. Thus under Pennsylvania procedure, the Supreme Court of the United States would never receive a case in the posture of <em>Boykin </em>where there was an affirmance of a sentence after guilty plea although the plea was supported by absolutely <em>no </em>record.</p>

This Court has made it clear in the past that that is recommended, and now a necessary procedure. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Cushnie, </em><a href="/pa/433/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="433 Pa. 131" data-case-ids="1920939" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0131-01">433 Pa. 131</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20290" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="249 A.2d 290">249 A. 2d 290</a> (1969); <em>Commonwealth ex rel. West v.

Now, under our rule in <em>Cushnie, </em>if a hearing as to the validity of the plea is necessary, and there is no on-the-record inquiry by counsel for prosecution or defense, or by the judge who <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>accepted the plea, the burden of proof is on the Commonwealth to establish that the plea is valid.</p>
    <p id="b646-4" data-blocks='[["BL_646.4",646,[216,516,1154,1539]]]'>The fact that we require an on-the-record inquiry when a guilty plea is accepted does not, in my view, also require us to automatically wipe out the plea if no such inquiry is made. <em>Boykin </em>clearly says that we may not, without <em>more, </em>allow the plea to stand. That is what the Alabama Supreme Court did, and it was that action that the Supreme Court of the United States overturned. But where the state system provides a mechanism for fairly establishing a record and determining the validity of the guilty plea, I do not believe that the Supreme Court of the United States meant to — or properly could — mandate a prophylactic rule that the states would be required to follow, to overturn pleas <em>proven </em>valid on a <em>full record. </em>Clearly the Supreme Court thinks that is the best technique for insuring on-the-record inquiries, see <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em><a href="/us/394/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="394 U.S. 459" data-case-ids="6174781" data-case-paths="/us/394/0459-01">394 U.S. 459</a>, <a href="/us/394/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="394 U.S. 459" data-case-ids="6174781" data-case-paths="/us/394/0459-01">89 S. Ct. 1166</a> (1969). But while F. R. Crim. P. 11, as interpreted by <em>McCarthy </em>may be a desirable method of achieving a procedural compliance with the constitutional requirements of a guilty plea, I do not see how the exact form of <em>relief </em>can be constitutionally imposed on the states. As long as Pennsylvania guarantees and provides a full and fair procedure for determining the validity of guilty pleas, in my view the Supreme Court of the United States cannot properly and does not in <em>Boykin </em>require us to follow a rule that it would opt for as a matter of policy or preferred procedure.</p>

Week at 4476. In support of this proposition, the Court even quoted a Pennsylvania case, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. West v. </em>

      <em>Rundle, </em>supra. Yet although. I obviously agree with this statement, I do not take it to mean that state hearing procedures for determining the validity of guilty pleas are inherently unreliable. I would find this position to be wholly untenable and unsupported in fact or law and I cannot accept it as constitutionally requiring the automatic overturn of guilty pleas where an on-the-record inquiry by counsel or the judge accepting the plea is absent. This would call into question the basic reliability of the entire state constitutional fact finding process, a position inconsistent with our general theory of criminal review in the federal system. See, e.g., <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a>, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a> (1964); <em>Fay v. Noia, </em><a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">372 U.S. 391</a>, <a href="/us/372/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="372 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="1765582" data-case-paths="/us/372/0391-01">83 S. Ct. 822</a> (1963). Yet without a judgment that the state hearing procedures for determining the validity of guilty pleas in these cases are inherently unreliable, it is clear to me that the Supreme Court cannot mandate that the prophylactic rule of <em>Boykin </em>bind the states.</p>

Alabama, </em>merely because the judge accepting the plea failed then to make the requisite on-the-record inquiry.</p>
