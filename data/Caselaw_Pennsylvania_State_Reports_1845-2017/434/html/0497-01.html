Not only was their testimony on this issue not antagonistic, but neither the prior statement to the police nor the trial testimony of codefendant Lare implicated the appellant in any way beyond appellant’s own testimony. Lare’s statement to the police following their arrest did not even mention Small. At trial, Lare merely testified that Small had intercourse with the prosecutrix, and Small acknowledged this.</p>

    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[229,631,1156,987]]]'>But I believe that in a dual representation situation where codefendant implicates the appellant in both his confession and trial testimony, such a potential for conflict <em>must </em>exist. The reason is quite simple: once co-defendant in any way implicates appellant, appellant’s defense strategy necessarily becomes tied to and is limited by that of codefendant. In order for joint counsel to ably represent his “implicating” client, he cannot contemplate a strategy which would include vigorous cross-examination of this client to discredit his testimony or confession. In these cases, in effect, trial counsel is placed in the anomalous posture of being able to help one client only at the expense of the best interests of the other. So when this occurs, defense counsel is forced to seek a compromise solution which will perhaps at best result in convictions of a lesser charge for each of his clients, while not completely absolving either one.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[225,1629,1157,767]],["BL_611.1",611,[168,401,1147,604]]]'>This is perhaps what happened in this case. Faced with codefendant’s implicating statement to the police and his inability to challenge it, defense counsel likely adopted the strategy of attempting to establish a defense based on the victim’s consent to the act. But appellant was entitled to more; he was entitled to the possibility of a defense (not limited by codefendant’s statement) which would not even concede appellant’s presence at the scene of the alleged crime. If he had been represented by counsel who only had one client, counsel might have chosen any one of several courses which were not available to his dual counsel. Counsel might have challenged codefendant’s statement to the police; perhaps he would have vigorously cross-exam<a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>ined codefendant as to that part of his testimony which implicated appellant; he could have chosen not to take the stand at all. By listing these alternatives, I do not intend to criticize the manner in which trial counsel handled this case. I merely desire to stress these possibilities to demonstrate the almost impossible situation in which trial counsel found himself in trying to represent both clients. From this it should be abundantly clear why I believe appellant is entitled to a new trial, free from any conflict of interest in his representation.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.4",611,[169,1016,1147,928]]]'>Once a defendant has been afforded the right to counsel — no right is more basic to him and the guilt-determining process than the defendant’s right to have his counsel free to exercise the full privilege of cross-examination within the range of the permissible rules of evidence. In this respect, defense counsel may not be circumscribed by any other considerations than the rules of evidence, the strategic trial decisions, and the best interests of his client. Certainly not permissible is any limitation upon counsel’s conduct of the defense <em>created </em>by his <em>additional </em>representation and <em>regard </em>for the interests of his <em>other </em>client — the appellant’s codefendant — whose pretrial statement and trial testimony implicated appellant. Thus on the instant record, appellant’s counsel was indeed presented with the very evil of conflict in fact not allowed by <em>Whitting. </em>See <em>Glasser v.

Ct. 1620</a> (1968), necessitates the granting of a new trial. But this case is different from <em>Bruton </em>in one crucial respect: here appellant’s codefendant testified at trial. In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court made it clear that their concern was a deprivation of “petitioner’s right of cross-examination secured by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment.” <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">391 U.S. at 126</a>, <a href="/us/391/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="391 U.S. 123" data-case-ids="1767670" data-case-paths="/us/391/0123-01">88 S.

Although co-defendant’s presence on the stand made him subject to cross-examination, it is obvious that because counsel who would cross-examine him was <em>also his own defense counsel, </em>that cross-examination, if any, would be of little help to appellant’s case. It is clear that when the <em>Bruton </em>Court spoke of the right of cross-examination they were contemplating more than a mere gesture. In effect, they said that codefendant’s out-of-court statement could be admitted only if codefendant was subject to <em>real </em>cross-examination. Therefore, I conclude'that because of the conflict of interest inherent in the dual representation, appellant was denied his <em>Bruton </em>right to cross-examination as much as if co-defendant had refused to take the stand. For this additional reason, I conclude that appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>
