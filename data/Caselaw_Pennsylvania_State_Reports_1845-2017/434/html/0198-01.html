Darlington (now Ethel S. Garrett), for life. The instrument directs that the “entire net income” be paid to his wife and in addition provides “Stock dividends shall belong to the corpus of the trust and shall not be distributable as income.” During the course of the administration of this trust, the trustee awarded to principal certain stock dividends he received. It is these decisions by the trustee to retain such dividends in principal, upheld in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County by both the auditing judge and the court en banc, which is contested in this appeal taken by settlor’s wife.</p>

This doctrine had been established in <em>Maris’s </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/301/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="301 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1126419" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0020-01">301 Pa. 20</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20577" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="151 A. 577">151 Atl. 577</a> (1930) where the settlor had provided that “all stock dividends consisting of shares of stock of the corporations issuing them shall be considered principal.” This Court struck down that provision as a direction to accumulate income contrary to the express provisions of the Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503. The stated rationale was that “no one can be permitted to set aside the public policy of the State by the simple expedient of designating by another name <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>that which the courts have repeatedly decided to be income.” <em>Mavis’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/301/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="301 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1126419" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0020-01">301 Pa. at 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.%20577" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="151 A. 577">151 Atl. at 578</a>.</p>

To support this contention they point to the Act of May 25, 1939, P. L. 201, 20 P.S. §301.6 historical note, which permitted an accumulation of <em>extraordinary </em>stock dividends, The Principal and Income Act of 1947, Act of July 3,1947, P. L. 1283, 20 P.S. §3470.1, which vested in the settlor the power to designate the stock dividend as either income or principal, and the 1956 amendment to the Estates Act of 1947, Act of February 17, 1956, P.

The problem is that the same statutes on which the' appellees and the court below rely to establish a change in public policy (and which in fact reflect such a change), also make it clear that these changes in Commonwealth policy were not intended to apply to the receipt of this 1936 dividend. The Act of 1939 by its terms applies only to trusts created <em>after </em>1939, the Principal and Income Act of 1947 applies only to receipts <em>after </em>July 3, 1947, and the Act of 1956 applies only to trusts created <em>after </em>its enactment. Therefore, if this Court were to hold that the 1936 dividend should be treated as coming within the change of public policy established by the Legislature after <em>Maris, </em>we would be giving effect to only that part of the legislation which supports appellees’ position while ignoring the Legislature’s man<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>dates as to effective dates of the application of these policies. This we cannot do. The public policy of this Commonwealth includes not only the post-Maris substantive changes in the law, but also the Legislature’s choices as to when these policies should become operative. We must be guided by the Legislature’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[172,727,1149,1378]]]'>In addition, if we were to adopt the position urged by the appellees, another legislative policy would be defeated. It is clear that the Legislature has determined that <em>date of receipt </em>should be the crucial factor in deciding when a new principal and income rule should be effective. Thus the Principal and Income Act of 1947 provided “That the provisions of this act shall <em>not </em>apply to receipts and expenses received or paid <em>prior </em>to the effective date of this act.” (Emphasis supplied.) When this act was amended in 1963, operation of its new provisions was limited to trust receipts after the effective date of amendment (September 30, 1963). Act of August 1, 1963, P. L. 442, §3. If this Court were to decide that the policy of the 1947 Act should apply to receipts prior to July 3, 1947 (despite the clear language to the contrary), we would not only destroy the symmetry of the system the Legislature has established, but also would call into the question the need to follow the stated effective date of the 1963 amendment. If the 1947 Act can apply to receipts before 1947, why should not the 1963 Act apply to receipts before 1963, and even before 1947? Such a result would bring chaos into an area where it is especially essential and highly desirable that the rules of law be clear, definite and certain.</p>

In support of this proposition our attention is directed to the amendment to section 5 of the Principal and Income Act of 1947 which became effective on September 30, 1963. This is the amendment which changed the treatment of stock dividends of 6% or less. It provides “Corporate distributions made to a trustee in the shares of the distributing corporation, however described or designated by the distributing corporation, shall be deemed principal but if the number of shares of any class distributed to the shareholders of such class is six percent <em>(6%) </em>or less of the number of shares of that class outstanding on the record date for such distribution, the shares so distributed shall be deemed income.” Before this enactment <em>all </em>stock dividends were “deemed principal” under the act. From this amendment, appellant argues that the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>Legislature has the absolute right to change the substantive law as to what shall be considered income and what shall be considered principal; that such a change has been made by the 1963 amendment; and that all small stock dividends must be apportioned to income as a matter' of law no matter what contrary intent is expressed by the settlor.</p>

However, in light , of the intricacies of modern corporate finance and the complexities of corporate dividend policies, accounting practices and tax considerations, it is clear that the <em>Maris </em>and <em>pre-Maris </em>rules of apportionment are no longer relevant to current trust concepts. See <em>Norvell, </em>supra. No such hard and fast rules are intended to be applied today. Appellant’s argument completely ignores the fact that the rules of section 5 (either in its 1947 <em>or </em>1963 version) were intended to be applied <em>only </em>when ■ a contrary intent was <em>not </em>expressed by the settlor. Section 2 of the Principal and Income Act of 1947 has <em>always </em>provided “This act shall govern the ascertainment of income and principal . . . Provided, That the person establishing the principal may himself direct the manner of ascertainment of income and principal . . . and such provision where not otherwise contrary to law, shall control, notwithstanding this act.” 20 P.S. §3470.2. Thus the purpose of the Legislature in enacting section 5 was much less ambitious than appellant’s argument would seem to indicate. The only purpose of the rules in section 5 “is to provide convenient and workable rules of administration of estates in conformity with what would be the wishes of most settlors .... The rules stated are applicable in the absence of the expression of a contrary intention by the settlor.” Scott, Trusts §241A, <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>at 2101-02 (3d ed. 1967).

See, e.g., <em>Dunham Trust, </em><a href="/pa/433/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="433 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1921022" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0273-01">433 Pa. 273</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20531" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="249 A.2d 531">249 A. 2d 531</a> (1969); <em>Pew Trust, </em><a href="/pa/411/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="411 Pa. 96" data-case-ids="1885998" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0096-01">411 Pa. 96</a>, 109, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="191 A.2d 399">191 A. 2d 399</a>, 406 (1963).</p>

This is argued despite the fact that no change was made in section 2 of the act, the section by which the Legislature made it clear that settlor’s intent is controlling. We find this entire line of reasoning particularly unpersuasive in light of the limited role the amendment to section 5 was intended to play, when and only when the settlor failed to clearly express his own intent as to allocation. The legal effect of settlor’s section 2 expressed intention remains the same after the 1963 section 5 amendment as it was prior thereto.</p>

However, appellant has overlooked one important point. These post-1963 receipts clearly come within the terms of the Principal and Income Act of 1947, §15; this same act in section 14 provides “all other acts or parts of acts which are inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed absolutely.” Therefore, if section 9 of the Act of 1853 is in<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>consistent with section 2’s blanket permission for the settlor to express his own intent, it is the Act of 1853’s provision which must fail.</p>
