    <p id="b491-8" data-blocks='[["BL_491.13",491,[176,1540,1150,648]]]'>This is an appeal by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (Board) from an order of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas reversing an order by the Board enjoining Ficon, Inc., trading as Ye Olde Ale House (Ficon), from interfering with its employees’ right to self-organization and collective bargaining and their right to union membership, and directing the re-employment of two employees whom Ficon had discharged. The Board’s order was based on a finding that Ficon had committed an unfair labor practice in firing two waitresses, allegedly because of their union activities.</p>

The Board issued its order on May .10, 1966. Upon Ficon’s failure to comply with its order, the Board prepared a petition for enforcement of the order. Upon notification of the Board’s intention to file the petition for enforcement, Ficon indicated that it would appeal the Board’s order to the Court of Common Pleas, and both petitions were filed jointly.</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.4",492,[219,967,1155,700]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County (Spaeth, J.) reversed the Board’s order and dismissed its petition for enforcement. The court held that the evidence was substantially insufficient either to prove that Ficon, knew of the waitresses’ union activities or to prove that the waitresses were fired because of their union activities; the court noted that the Board gave no reason in its opinion for disregarding the testimony of all of Ficon’s witnesses and held that the Board’s order was based on suspicion and conjecture rather than substantive proof. The present appeal challenges the correctness of the court’s order. We reverse.</p>

Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act, Act of 1937, supra, specifies the scope of review permissible by the Common Pleas Court in cases instituted under the statute. Under §9(b), when any <em>per</em>

      <em>son </em>aggrieved by a final order of the Board petitions the court for review of the Board’s action, the court is authorized to determine the <em>substantiality </em>of the evidence to support the Board’s order. For §9(b) provides that “the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by substantial and legally credible evidence, shall in like manner be conclusive.” However, §9(a), which controls in instances where the Board petitions the Common Pleas Court for the enforcement of a Board order, provides that “the findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.” A mere reading of §§9(a) and 9(b) indicates an obvious difference with respect to the scope of review; unlike situations under §9(b), in cases where §9 (a) controls, the court must sustain the Board’s findings if there is mere evidence to support them.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b493-3" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[175,1348,1151,541]]]'>The lower court evidently felt that it was deciding an <em>individual’s </em>petition for review under §9(b). However, the Board’s petition and Ficon’s petition were joined. In view of that joinder, the question arises whether the lower court was correct in assuming that it was not bound by the narrow scheme of review contemplated by §9(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> We need not and do not decide this question, because even assuming that the lower court correctly conceived its reviewing function, still it has erred in discharging that function.</p>

      <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>Among other things, §6(1) (e) of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee in regard to tenure of employment because of the employees’ organizational involvement. Essential to the existence of a §6(1) (c) unfair labor practice is a particular motive on the employer’s part — an “anti-union animus.” The motive creates the offense.</p>

No reason was then given for the discharges and when pressed for an explanation, the manager told the employees that they would have to see the owner. The next day, the employees confronted the owner and after some evasiveness on his part, the employees were told that it was because of “your outside activities.” In the case of Palantine, the owner subsequently phoned her and promised her a job recommendation if she stayed away from her “trouble-making friend.” Later on, he gave her a written recommendation stating that she was “very efficient.” In view of such testimony, it is clear that the Board’s conclusion that the discharges resulted from the employees’ union activities was based upon substantial evidence and not upon mere guess and conjecture. The fact that the owner offered conflicting testimony does not, in itself, warrant the setting aside of the findings of the Board, The credi<a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>bility of the testimony and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom were for the Board.
