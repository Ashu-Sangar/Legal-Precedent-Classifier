A “patting down” of his person revealed that he had a penknife with a three inch blade in one of his pockets. The knife was taken from him and later introduced at trial, over objection, as a burglary tool. It is contended that the knife was secured through an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the guarantees secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and that evidence thereof should be excluded.</p>

While walking up the stairs they saw an unknown man, later identified as Hicks, standing on the level between the second and third floors. Mr. Lloyd <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>asked Hicks what he was doing there. He replied that he was looking for “R. J. Reynolds.” Mr. Lloyd told him that no such person lived in the building and asked Hicks how he had gained entrance to the building since the front door could be opened only by a key or by a buzzer from the inside. Hicks made a vague reply and left.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[231,801,1153,544]]]'>When the Lloyds ascended to their third floor apartment, they discovered that the door leading therein from the hall had been tampered with. The wood around the lock had been dug out and chips of wood and paint were lying on the floor. Mrs. Lloyd immediately phoned police, headquarters and related everything, that had occurred. She described the stranger seen on the steps as a Negro in his thirties with-a mustache and wearing, a brown coat. She also described his height and weight.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[230,1357,1154,374]]]'>The above information was relayed by headquarters to a police officer, named Closkey, who was on patrol in the area. At about 4:30 p.m., Closkey and another officer saw Hicks walking on the street, approximately four blocks from the location of the Lloyd apartment. They stopped him and “patted him down.” The knife involved was found in one of his pockets.</p>
    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[229,1745,1161,432]]]'>At the. time Hicks was stopped, he was walking down the street like any other pedestrian. He was not' carrying anything, nor. acting in an unusual manner. He. was wearing “a very light colored coat, beige or white.” He did not have a mustache, but did “need a shave.” At trial, the arresting officers did not say that his height or weight corresponded with the description given by Mrs. Lloyd.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

About forty-five minutes later, he was identified by the Lloyds <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>as the intruder. The victim of another burglary committed under similar circumstances at an address about two blocks from the Lloyd residence also identified him as the intruder at that location.</p>
    <p id="b263-4" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[193,621,1146,770]],["BL_264.1",264,[214,400,1156,711]]]'>The majority of the Superior Court were of the view that the stopping and “patting down” of Hicks, based on reasonable suspicion as distinguished from probable cause, was something less than an arrest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> That analysis is, however, quite inaccurate as is clearly manifested by the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S. Ct. 1868</a> (1968). <em>Terry </em>makes it clear that if a police officer accosts a person on the street and restrains him of his freedom to walk away, he has “seized” that person, and if he merely explores just the outer surface of such a person’s clothing, that is a “search,”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and such search and seizure are within the purview and protection of the Fourth Amendment. <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>Hence, there can be no question but that in the instant case,' Hicks was seized and searched by the police and the Fourth Amendment is applicable in the same way as it is to every other search and seizure. Therefore, the issue is basically one of “the reasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of a citizen’s personal security”: <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, 19, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S. Ct. 1868</a>, 1878-79. And this being so, the inquiry is “a dual one — whether the officer’s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place”: <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. 1</a>, 20, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.

    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[208,1456,1155,929]],["BL_265.1",265,[178,401,1144,97]]]'>First, a seizure and search, such as here involved, is reasonable and legitimate if the police officer has probable cause to arrest, i.e., if at the inception of the seizure he has knowledge of sufficient facts and circumstances, gained through trustworthy information, to warrant a prudent man in the belief that the person seized has. committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. Second, even if probable cause to arrest is absent, the police officer may still legitimately seize a person, such as Hicks was seized in this case, and conduct a limited search of the individual’s outer clothing in an attempt to discover the presence of weapons which might be used to endanger the safety of the police officer and others, <em>if </em>the police officer observes unusual and suspicious conduct on the part of the individual seized which leads him reasonably to conclude that criminal activity may be afoot and <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>that the person with whom he is dealing may be armed and dangerous.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[174,512,1149,1375]]]'>The present case has been presented in argument to the appellate courts of this Commonwealth on three separate occasions: once before the Superior Court and twice before this Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The Commonwealth does not now contend, nor has it ever contended, that the police officers had probable cause to arrest Hicks at the inception of the seizure. This is understandable. At the time of the seizure, the police were seeking, as the perpetrator of the Lloyds’ attempted burglary, a mustached Negro in his thirties, of a certain height and weight, wearing a brown coat. Hicks was not wearing a brown coat, did not have a mustache, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that he was of the approximate height and weight of the individual sought. In short, the only manner in which Hicks fit the description of the individual the police were seeking, as far as the record discloses, is that he was a Negro in his. thirties. This, in itself, was clearly not sufficient to establish probable cause. Moreover, it is fundamental that neither the evidence disclosed by the search, nor the evidence uncovered after the seizure may be considered in determining whether probable cause existed: <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">supra.</a> Hence, the Lloyds’ subsequent identification of Hicks as the felon is irrelevant to the legal issue of probable cause.</p>
    <p id="b266-3" data-blocks='[["BL_266.3",266,[225,399,1155,1312]]]'>
      <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>While the Commonwealth does not contend that probable cause to arrest Hicks existed, it does nevertheless earnestly assert that the officers were justified in seizing Hicks and conducting a limited search of his clothing to discover the presence of dangerous weapons.. This argument is premised upon the teaching of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">supra,</a> <em>Sibron v.

What the Commonwealth overlooks is that for such a precautionary seizure and search to be legitimate, there must first exist on the part of the police a reasonable belief that criminal activity is afoot and that the seized person is armed and dangerous. The police must prove that specific conduct of the seized person, observed by them, justified and made reasonable their belief that criminal activity was afoot and that the seized person was armed and dangerous. The instant record is devoid of such necessary proof. Hence, the seizure was not “justified at its inception” and was violative of the Fourth Amendment. The evidence resulting therefrom should have been excluded.</p>
