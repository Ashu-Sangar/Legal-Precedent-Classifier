In April of 1963 appellants commenced two actions in the United States District Court against other- insurance companies not here involved, and on June 21, 1963, they instituted a third féderal action against the nine companies before this Court today. All three federal actions were consolidated for trial. On June 7, 1965, the federal district court handed down an opinion allowing recovery for appellants on their two April 1963 claims, but dismissing the suit against appellees for failure to meet the federal jurisdictional amount. <em>Fratto v. northern Ins.

Appellees asserted in new matter that this state court suit was untimely, citing a provision common to all the policies here involved: “Suit. No suit or action on this policy for <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity . . . unless commenced within twelve months next after inception of the loss.” Since the loss occurred in 1962 and the present suit was not commenced until 1965, appellees moved for summary judgment under Pa.

Therefore, by the time the federal court dismissed the suit, it was too late for appellants to commence a timely state action. The Frattos thus seek to place this controversy within the line of cases holding that “an insurer will , not be permitted to take advantage of the failure of the insured to perform a condition precedent contained in the policy, where the insurer itself is the cause of the failure to perform the condition.” <em>Arlotte v.

In <em>Hocking, </em>the plaintiff sued within the time limits of the policy, but, at trial, the company asserted that the action was premature (it having been commenced less than 60 days after plaintiff had filed with the company a statement, of loss in contravention of the policy provision giving the insurer a 60 day grace period). The trial court agreed and dismissed, plaintiff’s action. His second suit was held untimely. On appeal, plaintiff argued that the insurer’s failure to raise the prematurity defense in its answer in time to allow plaintiff to. commence a timely action after the 60 day period worked an estoppel of the company’s right to invoke the one year statute of limitations in the second suit. This Court rejected that argument and said: “It is undoubtedly true that any act which tends to mislead the plaintiff, while parties are dealing on friendly terms, to avoid litigation, will be held to be evidence of a waiver of such a limitation as the present; <em>but after </em>

      <em>suit has been brought, and the parties are dealing at arms’ length, the rule does not apply with the same strictness, and much more positive evidence of actual misleading, if not intent to mislead, is necessary to prove a waiver by </em>estoppel.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

If “positive evidence of actual misleading” did not exist in <em>Hocking, </em>it hardly exists here. For the appellants have not demonstrated in a manner to preclude summary judgment against them, that the appellees knew of the jurisdictional defect in the appellants’ suit, or knew that that court would ultimately dismiss the suit. In view of that barrenness in the appellants’ case, we cannot conclude that the appellees smugly sat back, unconscionably looking at the calendar, and anxiously awaiting the day when the appellants’ rights would have no remedy.</p>

If we were to allow the appellants to commence a new action, in contravention of the policy time-limit, and despite the lack of any convincing demonstration that the appellees purposely mislead the appellants, we would, in effect, be charging the appellees with the responsibility of discovering the mistakes made by the appellants.

On appeal, plaintiff argued that the insurer’s failure to raise <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>the prematurity defense in its answer in time to allow plaintiff to commence a <em>timely </em>action after the 60 day period worked an estoppel of the company’s right to invoke the one year statute of limitations in the second suit. This Court rejected that argument, holding that the estoppel notion has no effect after the parties commence legal action, since then both sides are deemed to be at arms’ length.</p>
    <p id="b251-4" data-blocks='[["BL_251.4",251,[163,851,1148,1256]]]'>On reflection, however, I believe that this “arms’ length” solution is too simplistic, for the notion of the arms’ length transaction still requires that the “arm” holding a boxing glove, rather than a mace. Dilatory tactics such as those apparently used by the insurance company in <em>Hocking </em>have never been favored in the law. And in this regard it should not matter whether the parties have commenced suit, or not. Both in <em>Hocking </em>and in the present case, the insurance company <em>had </em>a complete defense to the first lawsuit. In both cases this defense was raised <em>so late </em>in the proceedings that the insured found himself <em>unable </em>to begin anew in the proper court or (as in Hocking) after the proper 60 day period. Moreover, the case now before us in large measure presents an even more appealing fact pattern than <em>Hocking. </em>Appellees <em>expressly admitted federal jurisdiction here. </em>They were more than willing to try this case in the federal courts on the <em>merits. </em>However, by the federal court’s own act appellees found themselves out of that forum unscathed. They now attempt to reap <em>a complete windfall </em>from this turn of events by invoking the one year statute of limitations.</p>

Yet the court refused to allow the company to invoke the statute, holding that by delaying the first suit beyond the contractual period and then raising the prematurity defense for the first time, the insurer could not then take advantage of the statute of limitations provision. The California court said simply: “Under the circumstances it would be a perversion of the policy of the statute of limitation to deny a trial on the merits.” <a href="/citations/?q=154%20P.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="154 P.2d 399">Id. at 406</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20P.2d%20399" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="154 P.2d 399">154 P. 2d at 403</a>.</p>

For example, in <em>Arlotte v. National Liberty Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/312/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="312 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="1150714" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0442-01">312 Pa. 442</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.%20295" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="167 A. 295">167 Atl. 295</a> (1933), the insured’s dwelling was destroyed when it was hit by a truck. Since all the parties assumed that the insured’s copy of the policy had been destroyed in the ensuing fire, the company agent erroneously told the insured that the policy did not cover this sort of damage. After the one year period had expired, the insured found the policy among his belongings, discovered that truck damage was covered, and commenced his suit. We held the company estopped from raising the statute of limitations. I see no reason not to extend this fair and equitable rule to cases such as the present one, where appellants’ continuation of a suit in an improper court was <em>encouraged </em>by appellees’ <em>express agreement </em>that that Court was the proper forum. Just as in the truck case, appellee <em>could </em>have discovered their error by themselves; but this did not move us in <em>Arlotte, </em>and in my view should not move us here. When the company, by its action, sets in motion the events leading to an insured’s eventual noncompliance <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>with a policy provision, the company must not be permitted to defeat a claim by invoking that provision.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[163,523,1150,1155]]]'>There remains, however, one more fly in the ointment of this case’s resolution. Appellants’ theory must* of course, rest on the fact that a timely state court action <em>could </em>have been brought had the company promptly raised the issue of jurisdiction in the federal forum. In this regard, therefore, I am troubled by the fact that this record conclusively shows that appellants’ federal action was itself brought in June, 1963, a full year and a half after the fire. In an affidavit opposing the motion for summary judgment, appellants’ counsel recites that this initial delay in the federal court was the result of negotiations with the company tending towards settlement. A finding that delay was caused by negotiations prompted the federal court to excuse appellants’ lateness in their other two federal actions. However, the federal court never ruled on this delay, in spite of the fact that appellees raised it in their federal court answer, since that tribunal dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. Moreover, the court below also failed to rule on the federal court delay since it no doubt believed this issue irrelevant.</p>
    <p id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[160,1690,1150,706]],["BL_254.1",254,[220,406,1154,590]]]'>I do not regard the issue as irrelevant, for if the federal suit itself was <em>not </em>timely, then appellees are entitled to a judgment in their favor. If, on the other hand, the court below were to find that the initial delay in filing the federal action was excused by the company’s willingness to attempt a negotiated settlement, then I believe appellants may proceed to trial. Appellants’ affidavit opposing the motion for summary judgment states that settlement negotiations account for their failure to file the federal court action within one year, a statement not denied by appellees. This affidavit places in issue the factual question of what caused the apparent lateness of the federal action thus <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>creating a material issue of fact sufficient to withstand the motion for summary judgment. That appellees have not denied the statements contained in appellants’ affidavit, however, should not, in our opinion, operate to appellees’ prejudice, given the fact that until today the parties may well have regarded the timeliness of the federal suit as irrelevant. Thus, I believe that this case should be remanded in order for the court below to decide whether appellants’ tardy commencement of their federal court suit was excusable.</p>
