      <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>At the Referee’s hearing, appellant introduced evidence tending to prove that he is now suffering from silicosis, that he was employed by Metalweld cleaning and grinding metal products and that he used a substance called “Black Diamond” in his blaster and carborundum as a grinding medium. At a subsequent hearing, appellant testified that he had secured a sample of “Black Diamond” from Metalweld’s supplier and had had it chemically analyzed. The research chemist who analyzed the “Black Diamond” testified that the particles were slightly larger than grains of sand and that they contained 41.26% free silica by weight. By way of rebuttal, Metalweld presented testimony that appellant is not now totally disabled and argued that appellant failed to prove that he was exposed to silicon dioxide dust in the course of his employment. As far as the sample of “Black Diamond” was concerned, Metalweld urged that appellant had failed to prove that it was identical to the substance used in his blaster, that particles larger than grains of sand will not cause silicosis, and that appellant had failed to prove that “Black Diamond” would disintegrate and release silicon dioxide dust into the air during the sandblasting process.</p>

The Workmen’s Compensation Board reversed, holding that appellant had failed to prove that he was employed in an occupation with a silica hazard or that there was free silica in the air at Metalweld’s plant. The Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, per Judge McDermott, remanded the case to the Board for a clarification of its opinion. Metal-weld appealed this order to the Superior Court which held in a per curiam opinion that the record was sufficient for an adjudication on the merits. <a href="/pa-super/209/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="209 Pa.

This Board concludes that he totally failed to sustain that burden.” After studying the record, we would agree that appellant failed to prove that he was exposed to silicon dioxide dust in Metalweld’s plant. However, we feel that the question whether appellant has presented sufficient evidence to raise the statutory presumption is much more difficult. We agree with the rationale behind Judge McDermott’s original remand order that the Board had not adequately explained the reasons for its decision.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[168,1190,1149,489]]]'>Our problem with the Board’s opinion is that, if there ever was an occupation which would appear to pose a silica hazard, it would be that of a sandblaster. If appellant were a coal miner, we could take judicial notice of the fact that there is a silica hazard in the anthracite mining industry. See: Crews, supra, at 464. We would like to know whether we can also take judicial notice of the fact that there is a silica hazard in the sandblasting industry.</p>

Appellant was also employed to polish and grind metal parts in what apparently was a similar process. The Court in <em>Metis </em>said: “At the hearing Dr. Hetherington, an expert in pulmonary diseases, including silicosis . . . testified that in his professional opinion a polisher of cast iron stove parts is employed in an occupation in which silicosis is a hazard. ... We think that Dr. <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>Hetherington’s testimony was sufficient, to bring the case within the provision of clause (f) of section 301. . . .” (<a href="/pa-super/156/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="156 Pa.

Superior Ct. at 75, 76</a>) Absent any explanation on the part of the Board as to its rationale, the holding in <em>Metz </em>may well be controlling in our case. .</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[212,743,1155,985]]]'>Since it would appear to us that sandblasting might be an occupation posing a silicosis threat and since it appeared that appellant was using a substance which contained at least some free silica, we are remanding this case to the Board for an elaboration of its original opinion or, if need be, for remand to the Beferee for additional testimony. Specifically, we are at a loss to understand on what evidence the Board relied in holding that appellant had not established that there is a silica hazard in the sandblasting industry, or- what facts the appellant failed to establish in order to raise the statutory presumption. Perhaps there is a valid reason why sandblasting as an occupation does not pose a silicosis hazard: the instant record fails to establish any such reason. Moreover, why should sandblasting as an occupation not be equated with coal mining insofar as the silica hazard is concerned? The record is silent in this respect also.</p>
