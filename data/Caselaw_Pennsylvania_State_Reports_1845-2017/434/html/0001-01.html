David A. Magaziner, Jr. and Edith Braunstein Magaziner were married on April 19, 1950 and are the parents of three minor children. In 1967, the parties separated and in August <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>of that year Mrs. Magaziner commenced a divorce action. In September of 1967, Mrs. Magaziner filed two petitions in the County Court of Philadelphia. One petition was for a writ of habeas corpus, asking the court to award her custody of the children. The other sought support for the three children. The docket entries indicate that custody was awarded to Mrs. Magaziner on September 21, 1967. Support for the children was originally set, on December 14, 1967, at $150.00 per week. Then on January 18, 1968, the County Court, through Judge Donnelly, issued the following order: “And Now, To Wit, this 18th day of January, 1968, in consideration of the attached agreement which has been filed by both parties, dated December 21,1967, both parties being represented by counsel and an addendum dated January 17, 1968, it is Ordered that in accordance with said agreement and addendum, the husband is to pay the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per week for the three children, said payments to be made through the Clerk of the Court, 1801 Vine Street. Said Order is to commence as of today. Any other Order heretofore entered is hereby vacated. The parties have agreed that the custody of the children be with the Mother, And It Is So Ordered.</p>

Although the exact factual matrix of the case is unclear and subject to dispute, certain facts appear of record. On May 2, 1968, Judge Bonnelly informed Mr. Magaziner’s counsel, I. Raymond Kremer, by letter and perhaps also by telephone, that Mr. Magaziner had breached the agreement to permit Mrs. Magaziner to take the children’s and her belongings from the house. The letter further stated: “I shall consider it a Contempt of Court if he fails to comply with the agreement. Mrs. Magaziner will call at the house on Monday morning, May 6th, 10 A.M., for this purpose. If he refuses to comply with the direction of the Court, he will be considered in contempt.”</p>

Mrs. Magaziner and her counsel, Richard Sprague, then appeared, on Monday, May 6th, before Judge Bonnelly who scheduled a hearing for the next day. At that hearing on May 7th Mr. Magaziner did not appear, his attorney stating that Mr. Magaziner could not be reached. Judge Bonnelly, over objection that Mr. Magaziner was not present, then heard the testimony of Mrs. Magaziner and stated, “I will consider him in contempt of court. I will give you an opportunity to present him tomorrow morning at 10 o’clock. If he does not appear, I will hold him in contempt of court.”</p>

Judge Bonnelly then signed an order “Let Attachment Issue, Returnable Forthwith” for the arrest of Mr. Magaziner. He was arrested, booked, fingerprinted, and placed in a cell until bail was secured.</p>

Although at times referred to as a petition asking this Court to take original jurisdiction, in essence it sought a writ of special certiorari so that this Court could exercise ifcs King’s Bench powers to correct an allegedly flagrant violation of the petitioner’s rights. Such writ was granted on August 5, 1968.</p>

Assuming arguendo that petitioner could be shown to be in contempt of a valid order of the County Co art, surely that court did not follow the proper procedure for putting the question in issue. The court issued an order “Let Attachment Issue, Returnable Forthwith.” As far back as <em>Commonwealth v. Snowden, </em>1 Brewster 218, 219 (1868), this Court set forth the practice on attachment for civil contempt: “A rule is generally granted in the first instance on affidavits, upon the return of which the defendant answers on oath, the evidence is heard, and if the court <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>should be of opinion that the fact on which the rule was taken is not sufficiently answered or excused, and that in point of law a contempt has been incurred, an attachment is awarded when the defendant is brought in on this writ to answer interrogatories propounded to him on behalf of the Commonwealth, in whose name the writ always issues, and if he gives such answers as purge him from the criminality, he must be discharged.” In other words, it is a several step process that must take place to hold one in civil contempt— rule to show cause why an attachment should not issue, answer and hearing, rule absolute (arrest), hearing on the contempt citation, adjudication of contempt. The court here improperly elided the first step. In <em>Douglass-Whisler B. Co. v. Simpson, </em><a href="/pa/233/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="233 Pa. 517" data-case-ids="981065" data-case-paths="/pa/233/0517-01">233 Pa. 517</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.%20760" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="82 A. 760">82 Atl. 760</a> (1912), a writ of attachment was issued by the court below to compel the appellee to comply with a court decree; the court then reconsidered and quashed the writ. This Court observed at page 519: <em>“It </em>was issued upon the petition of the appellant, without previous notice to the appellee of the decree against him and without a rule to show cause why it should not issue. The general rule is well settled that a writ of attachment for the summary arrest and imprisonment of a party in a civil proceeding for contempt in violating an order or decree cannot issue without such previous notice as will afford him an opportunity of being heard.” See also <em>Cooke v. United States, </em><a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">267 U.S. 517</a>, <a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">45 S.

For it should be beyond question that one can be held in civil contempt only for failure to obey some process or order of court. The petition to cite for contempt recites that at the hearing of May 7, 1968, Judge Bqnnelly <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>told Mr. Magaziner’s counsel that Mr. Magaziner was to permit Mrs. Magaziner access to his house, and that Mr. Magaziner, in refusing, should be held in contempt. Not only does such a statement nowhere appear in the transcript of that hearing, but if it did, it would be irrelevant. We quote at length from the opinion of Chief Justice Sterrett in <em>In re Garis, </em><a href="/pa/185/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="185 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="898027" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0497-01">185 Pa. 497</a>, 501, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%201110" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="39 A. 1110">39 Atl. 1110</a> (1898) : “As was said by Mr. Justice Sharswood at nisi prius (Pierce v. Post, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Phila.%20494" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Phila. 494">6 Phila. 494</a>) : *'An attachment is never issued against a party or a witness unless he is shown to be in contempt of court. <em>Se can only be in contempt by disobeying some process or order of court previously served upon him.’ </em>This is undoubtedly the correct practice, as indicated by the cases above cited, whether under the common law or statutes. No case to the contrary has been cited, and it is confidently believed that no well-considered case to that effect can be found. The record before us fails to disclose any rule or order on the appellant, prior to the attachment, which he disobeyed or could have disobeyed, because no such rule or order was ever issued or served upon him prior to the rule for attachment. The only thing that is suggested as a possible basis for the attachment proceeding against him is the written request by the appellee, committee of his lunatic wife. <em>It is too elear for argument that such requests or demands, not preceded by a rule to show cause duly issued, served, and returned, and an order duly entered by the court, after hearing, are neither rules nor orders of court, and cannot in any proper sense be regarded as the legal equivalents of either. The verbal statement of the Court, </em>made at the hearing of the rule for attachment, and recited in the answer to appellant’s rule to set aside the attachment proceedings, <em>is of no consequence whatever. </em>Decrees and orders of courts of record cannot <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>be carried in the breast of tbe judge who makes them. If any regard is to be had to the regular and orderly conduct of judicial proceedings in such courts, all their orders, rules and decrees must be recorded. The verbal order referred to never was recorded, and its first and only appearance in the case is the reference made to it in the appellee’s answer to appellant’s rule to show cause. Further elaboration is unnecessary. There, is nothing whatever in the record to justify the attachment proceedings against the appellant.” (Emphasis added). In the instant case also, there is no order of court upon which the contempt order is predicated. The only valid order is that of January 18, 1968, set forth at length above, and that order contains nothing requiring Mr. Magaziner to permit Mrs. Magaziner to enter his house, or even to receive the various personal items in dispute for that matter. Although that order refers-to an agreement of the parties of December 17, 1967, amended January 17,1968, the terms of the agreement are not incorporated into the order except for the section on visitation rights. Assuming arguendo that Mr. Magaziner violated the terms of that agreement, the contempt process of the County Court is surely not the proper vehicle to redress the violation of the contract. The appropriate legal remedy would be an action of assumpsit or replevin or perhaps even a bill in equity for specific performance. Even then, if Mrs. Magaziner won, grave doubt would exist as to whether any judgment, order, or decree could be enforced by an attachment of the person of the defendant. See <em>Colburn v. Colburn, </em><a href="/pa/279/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="279 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="1083377" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0249-01">279 Pa. 249</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20775" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="123 A. 775">123 Atl. 775</a> (1924) and <em>Silvestri v.

However, we need not enter any order ourselves because the case appears to be moot. The case below was transferred from Judge Bonnelly to Judge Meade, who on August 6, 1968, dismissed the petition to cite for contempt. Although this Court entered its order allowing the review on August 5, 1968, when the court below acted, it had not yet been served with the writ of special certiorari issued by this court. In <em>Corace v. Balint, </em><a href="/pa/418/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="418 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1896060" data-case-paths="/pa/418/0262-01">418 Pa. 262</a>, 276, <a href="/citations/?q=210%20A.2d%20882" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="210 A.2d 882">210 A. 2d 882</a> (1965), this Court stated: “A court of first instance cannot further proceed with a cause <em>after it has been served with a writ of certiorari </em>issued by an appellate court. . . .
