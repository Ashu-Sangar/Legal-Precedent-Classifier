First, the doctrine is based on the erroneous assumption that the accidental character of an injury must be found in the cause rather than in the result. This emphasis on the cause rather than on the result is especially anomalous in Pennsylvania where the unusual pathological result test which places the emphasis on the result entirely developed. See: <em>Parks v. Miller Printing Machine Co., </em><a href="/pa/336/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1195608" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0455-01">336 Pa. 455</a>, 459, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 A.2d 742">9 A. 2d 742</a> (1939). Second, the unusual strain doctrine is based on the erroneous assumption that that which is unusual is necessarily accidental. <em>Royko v. Logan Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/146/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="146 Pa. Super. 449" data-case-ids="1037012" data-case-paths="/pa-super/146/0449-01">146 Pa. Superior Ct. 449</a>, 462, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20A.2d%20434" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="22 A.2d 434">22 A. 2d 434</a> <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>(1941). If a man who never lifted heavy weights decides to lift a 100-lb. bag, this would be considered unusual, but it would hardly be considered accidental since he consciously decided to lift the bag. Third, the rule has proved to be unworkable because of the difficulty of concluding what is an unusual strain in a given situation. As a result, the appellate cases in Pennsylvania cannot easily be categorized info any meaningful and consistent pattern.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.4",203,[162,908,1150,1042]]]'>Although the facts seem to indicate that the unusual strain doctrine is no longer responsive to the problems in this area, we choose not to abrogate the doctrine in this opinion for the following reasons. First, such a major change should preferably be made by the legislature. The adoption of a totally new concept such as the “New Jersey rule” should be preceded by legislative investigations in an effort to determine the latest medical knowledge concerning the connection between heart attacks and employment strain. Furthermore, we as a court are not in a position to study the possible consequences from an insurance standpoint of the adoption of a more liberalized rule for recovery in heart attack cases. We cannot and should not, as a judicial body, convert workmen’s compensation coverage into general group life and health insurance coverage. Therefore, we would urge the legislature to undertake a study of the desirability of revising Pennsylvania’s unusual strain doctrine.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[162,1962,1147,432]],["BL_204.1",204,[207,409,1160,1263]],["BL_205.1",205,[177,401,1146,320]]]'>Our second reason for choosing not to overrule the line of cases upholding the unusual strain doctrine is that it is not necessary in this case. We conclude that the Workmen’s Compensation Board and the courts below applied an erroneous limitation on recovery under the facts of this case. The Court of Common Pleas held, “[T]here can be no doubt, under the authorities which control our decision, that the unusu<a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>alness must reside in the nature and character of the duties in the particular employment rather than in the experience of the individual.” The court cited no authorities for this proposition, and Procon has also failed to bring to our attention any cases which convince us that the unusualness must be determined in relation to the profession in general.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Our research convinces us that the weight of authority<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and of reason support the appellant’s position. If workmen’s compensation is intended to deal with the problems of the individual worker, then the standards which determine whether he shall recover compensation should also be geared to the individual. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine what amounts to an unusual strain for the members of a given profession. Certainly, in a given profession or occupation different members would be subjected to far different working conditions. Most assuredly, there are many carpenters who have never worked under conditions such as those which led to the decedent’s death. What is more, the industry-wide test is difficult to apply because a given member of a profession may be able to tolerate a greater or lesser amount of strain depending on his age. The de<a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>cedent was sixty-four when he suffered his fatal attack. What is an unusual strain for a carpenter sixty-four years of age who had apparently worked many years in more tranquil surroundings may be far different from what would be an unusual strain for a twenty-year old apprentice carpenter.</p>

We recognize that overexertion which aggravates an existing disease may constitute an accident and that proof of aggravation of a pre-existing condition is not, standing alone, sufficient to prove an accident or to raise an inference that its cause was accidental. However, viewing the record in its entirety, we must come to the conclusion that the overexertion, unusual to the deceased, aggravated deceased’s preexisting heart disease to the extent that it did cause an “accident” within the statutory meaning.
