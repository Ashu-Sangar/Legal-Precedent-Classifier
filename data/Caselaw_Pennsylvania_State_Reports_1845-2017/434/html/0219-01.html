Pelesky obtained a search warrant for a .22 revolver from Ralph George, who served as mayor and as justice of the peace of Portage. Armed with the warrant, Pelesky and two other officers arrived at appellant’s home around 11:00 p.m. on March 1. When asked about the gun, appellant told Pelesky that he had given it to one Robert Kline. Pelesky then called the juvenile probation officer of Cambria County. Since appellant, seventeen years old at the time, was on probation as a juvenile offender, the officer told Pelesky to take him to the juvenile detention center for violating his parole by carrying a gun. Pelesky took appellant to the office of Mayor George in Portage; he did not take appellant to the detention center in Ebensburg because he first wanted to search Robert Kline’s home in an effort to recover the gun that night.</p>

All three persons testified. substantially to the same effect as to what took place, and appellant’s version does not seriously dispute it. The mayor and the two police officers were carrying on a conversation between themselves, and Mayor George looked over toward appellant, who was “sitting there with his head down and looked out of this world.” Mayor George said: “What’s the matter, Mike, you look kind of down in the <em>dumps; </em>do you want to talk? He [appellant] said, I want to, but I can’t. I said, well, if you want to talk, talk.” At that point appellant orally confessed to having killed Serenko. Mayor George then notified police officers who were in an adjoining room, and thereafter a written statement which was not introduced into evidence was taken from appellant after he had been warned of his <em>Miranda </em>rights for the first time.</p>

United States, </em><a href="/us/391/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="391 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1767426" data-case-paths="/us/391/0001-01">391 U.S. 1</a>, <a href="/us/391/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="391 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1767426" data-case-paths="/us/391/0001-01">88 S. Ct. 1503</a> (1968). Mathis was questioned by an Internal Revenue Service agent while in jail serving a sentence for an unrelated offense about certain tax refunds Mathis had claimed the IRS agent did not give Mathis his <em>Miranda </em>warnings before questioning him. Information elicited from Mathis eventually led to a criminal prosecution and conviction for knowingly filing false claims. Mathis attacked the admissibility of statements he had given the agent. The government argued that there was no custodial interrogation since Mathis was in custody for an offense unrelated to tax evasion. The Supreme Court summarily rejected this argument: “We find nothing in the Miranda opinion which calls for a curtailment of the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the person is in custody. In speaking of ‘custody’ the language of the Miranda opinion is clear and unequivocal : ‘To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized.’ <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 478</a>.” <a href="/us/391/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="391 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1767426" data-case-paths="/us/391/0001-01">391 </a><a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a><a href="/us/391/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="391 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1767426" data-case-paths="/us/391/0001-01">U.S. at 4-5</a>, <a href="/us/391/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="391 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="1767426" data-case-paths="/us/391/0001-01">88 S. Ct. at 1505</a>. In short, as soon as a defendant is placed in custody for any reason, he must be given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings before he is interrogated. We have no doubt that, while appellant was in Mayor George’s office, he was “in custody” within the meaning of such phrase in <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>and that he was entitled to be given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before being questioned by the police.</p>

Ct. 1758</a>, 1764-65 (1964) : “We hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but <em>has begun to focus on a particular suspect, </em>the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied ‘the Assistance of Counsel’ in violation of the Sixth Amendment. . . .” (Emphasis added.) See <em>Commonwealth v. Jefferson, </em><a href="/pa/423/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="423 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1903093" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0541-01">423 Pa. 541</a>, 545-46, <a href="/citations/?q=226%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="226 A.2d 765">226 A. 2d 765</a>, 768 (1967). The Supreme Court clarified this particular holding in <em>Miranda: </em>“By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.” Footnote 4 states, “This is what we meant in Escobedo when we spoke of an investigation which had focused on an accused.” <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. at 444</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

We interpret this to mean, in conjunction with Mathis, that when an individual is placed in custody for any reason, he cannot be interrogated with<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>out first being advised of Ms rights regardless of whether the investigation has focused on him as a suspect in a particular crime.

Although appellant may have been tMnking of confessing, something was making him think that he should not, and the first move was made not by him but by the mayor who <em>urged </em>appellant to “talk.” This should be sufficient to necessitate <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Once the mayor said “you look kind of down in the dumps <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>... if you want to talk, talk,” he should have also been obligated to inform appellant of the consequences of any statement and of his constitutional right to remain silent and to be assisted by counsel. “[I]t is not simply custody plus ‘questioning/ as such, which calls for the Miranda safeguards but custody plus police <em>conduct </em>[here the mayor’s conduct] calculated to, expected to, or likely to, evoke admissions.” Institute of Continuing Legal Education, “Criminal Law and the Constitution — Sources and Commentaries” 356 (1968) (Emphasis in original).</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[212,1009,1155,808]]]'>It simply is not enough to mechanically attempt to ascertain what “interrogation” means without considering the rationales behind <em>Miranda </em>and the fifth and sixth amendments. Our basic theory of criminal law is that an accused should be assisted by counsel and should not be convicted by evidence from his own mouth. <em>Miranda </em>simply requires that an accused be told of his rights. It in no way precludes the use of voluntary confessions, but merely requires the giving of certain warnings so that an accused can make a knowledgeable decision whether to confess. The requirement of “interrogation” is designed to permit the use by the prosecution of a confession that is given by an accused <em>without any prompting, </em>before warnings can be given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The mayor knew exactly for what appellant was being held, having issued the search warrant for the gun sought as the murder weapon, a gun which the police were informed had been in appellant’s possession. Appellant never <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>suggested that he might want to confess until the major said “you look kind of down in the dumps; do you want to talk ... if you want to talk, talk.” This certainly was not an innocent attempt on the part of the mayor to strike up a friendly conversation to help appellant pass the time until the police returned from their search. There is no difference for constitutional purposes between questioning an accused outright and more subtly suggesting that he incriminate himself without being asked specific questions. Had appellant been asked “did you do it?” <em>Miranda </em>warnings would be necessary. There is no reason why they should not also be required where the question is “will you talk?” Talk about what? The implication clearly was that appellant had committed the crime and would feel better if he confessed. In our view, any question likely to or expected to elicit a confession constitutes “interrogation” under <em>Miranda. </em>The question here was clearly of this type, and thus we believe that appellant is entitled to a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b334-7" data-blocks='[["BL_334.9",334,[221,1078,1155,748]]]'>I agree with the views expressed in the majority opinion in the following respects: (1) that, at the time of appellant’s oral statement, he was then “in custody” and that he was entitled to be given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before <em>being </em>questioned; and (2) that the question whether appellant was at the time of the incident in the office of Mayor George the focus of an investigation does not require our consideration because appellant was then clearly occupying an “in custody” status. I dis'agree, however, with the view expressed in the majority opinion that appellant’s oral statement was not a <em>volunteered </em>statement and the conclusion reached in the majority opinion that appellant’s oral statement was admitted in violation of <em>Miranda.</em>

If appellant’s statement was a purely voluntary statement, then it is not within the proscription of <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>

Viewed in the totality of the circumstances present, appellant’s oral statement was a purely voluntary statement and did not arise from an interrogation or questioning by police authorities.</p>
