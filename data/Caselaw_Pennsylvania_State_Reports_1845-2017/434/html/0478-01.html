Mayberry’s appointed counsel in his brief raises the following issues: (1) that the court erred in failing to provide Mayberry with substantive constitutional safeguards by not apprising him of the nature and elements of the crime of criminal contempt, by not giving timely notice of the commission of criminal contempt, by not informing him of his right to counsel and in failing to provide him with counsel at the time of sentence; (2) that the statute providing for criminal contempt is unconstitutional as applied to the instant factual situation.</p>

An examination of the record reveals a course of conduct on Mayberry’s part almost beyond belief and of an obviously and patently planned and determined attempt on Mayberry’s part to interfere with the administration of justice and to make a farce and mockery of his trial. Mayberry accused the trial judge of denying him a fair trial, called him a “hatchet man for the State” and a “dirty S. O. B.,” stated he would not “be railroaded into any life sentence by any dirty tyrannical old dog like [the judge],” told the trial court “to keep [his] mouth shut,” referred to the court as a “bum” and a “stumbling dog,” accused the court of working for the prison authorities and of conducting a Spanish Inquisition. He further told the judge that he was in need of psychiatric treatment and was “some kind of nut.” These few examples are indicative of Mayberry’s outrageous conduct during the course of the trial. Moreover, in open court, Mayberry stated his intention of disrupting the court’s charge to the jury and carried out his intention to such an extent that the court was finally forced to have him gagged, placed in a strait jacket and removed to an <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>adjoining courtroom to which the charge to the jury was broadcast through a public address system. The record further demonstrates beyond any question that Mayberry’s behavior was calculated and planned with the aim of disrupting the orderly procedure of the trial and the administration of justice.</p>

Ed. 2d 522</a> (1968), the Court was called upon to decide whether the Constitution guaranteed the right to a jury trial for a criminal contempt punished by a two-year prison sentence. Holding that “petty crimes need not be tried to a jury” and recognizing that the court had deemed it unnecessary under <em>Dunoon </em>to fix “the exact location of. the line between petty offenses and serious crimes,” the court held that a criminal contempt punishable by a two-year prison sentence constitutes a serious crime which entitles a defendant to the right to trial by jury and that it is constitutional error to deny the defendant such right. If <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Bloom </em>are presently applicable, Mayberry would be entitled to a jury trial on the contempt charges.</p>

Although appellate courts are naturally reluctant to interfere with the sentencing procedure, a matter within the discretion of the trial court, this Court has a duty to consider whether that discretion has been abused. <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em><a href="/pa/380/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="380 Pa. 52" data-case-ids="1256083" data-case-paths="/pa/380/0052-01">380 Pa. 52</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=110%20A.2d%20216" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="110 A.2d 216">110 A. 2d 216</a> (1955). The duty is particularly crucial in direct criminal contempt cases where no statutory limit is placed upon the trial judge’s discretion. <em>Brown v.

Saeher and his fellows, <em>inter alia: </em>“Insinuated that there was connivance between the Court and the United States Attorney . . . Repeatedly made charges against the Court of bias, prejudice, corruption, and partiality . . . Made a succession of disrespectful, insolent, and sarcastic comments and remarks to the Court . . .

I note that in Title Three of The Penal Code of 1939, entitled “Offenses against Public Justice and Administration”, of the thirty-one crimes enumerated, only two — perjury (seven years) and prison breach (ten years) carry a maximum sentence of more than five years. No crime in the category carries with it a penalty approaching the twenty-two years given appellant, and I must dissent from the imposition of that sentence.</p>
