In that case, the City of Pittsburgh owned land which it set apart for the erection of a technological school. The school was to be constructed by a private board of trustees, which was to hold title to the building, but not to the land upon which it was built. Title to the land was to remain with the City of Pittsburgh pursuant to the authorizing statute. The Board entered into an agreement with a contractor for the construction of the building. Upon the contractor’s default in its obligations to a subcontractor, the subcontractor filed a lien claim against the board of trustees and the City of Pittsburgh. The lower court rejected the Board’s argument that the subcontractor’s work was done for <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>a purely public purpose” and was therefore exempt from a mechanics’ lien claim under the second section of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431. We accepted the lower court’s judgment on that matter, and said in dictum at page 489: “While the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Technical School is, to some extent, a public institution, in that students are educated upon payment of a nominal tuition fee, yet, in our opinion, its purposes cannot be said to be ‘purely public’. The funds for its erection and maintenance were contributed by a private citizen, neither the Commonwealth, the City, nor any public agency thereunder furnishing any of the funds necessary therefor, and instead of the school being managed or directed by the public through public officials, it is under the charge of a board of trustees, specially created, with exclusive authority to prescribe the qualifications for admission of pupils, the course and terms of study, and make and enforce such rules and regulations for the management of the school as they may deem proper. Under these circumstances, it seems to us, the public enjoys the benefits of the school, not by right, as it should if the purpose was public, but by permission only.”</p>

But even though the Act permits the lien, still we must inquire and decide whether, apart from the Act, the case law of Pennsylvania precludes mechanics’ lien claims against municipalities. For as the lower court indicated, “the Act contains no provision allowing or disallowing mechanics’ liens against land or buildings owned by municipalities, counties or cities.” The lower court dismissed American’s lien because it found that it was the law of Pennsylvania that there can be no liens against municipal property. For that proposition, the lower court relied principally upon <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>

    <p id="b481-4" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[174,526,1151,992]]]'>Although our research has disclosed no case explicitly holding that in every instance liens against municipal properties are void, still the statement seems correct as a general proposition of Pennsylvania law. However, it seems to us that a meaningful ground for distinction rests in the use to which the municipality puts the property. Where, as here, the municipality acts as an absent landlord, entrusting the management and control of its premises to its tenant; and where the building was constructed and paid for by the tenant; and further, where the municipality in owning the building, discharges a function not governmental in nature, but rather proprietary and quasi-private;— then an exception to the general rule that municipal property is exempt from mechanics’ liens seems proper. Since an execution upon the lien would not disrupt an essential public service or function, no reason appears for striking the lien down.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In all cases, the municipality can immunize itself from mechanics’ lien liability by simply providing in its contract with the other party that all mechanics’ liens are waived. That such a provision would bind all subsequent parties who contributed material and labor to the premises is indicated by the Mechanics’ Lien Law of 1963, supra, Article IV, §402, 49 P.S. §1402, which provides: “A written contract between the owner and contractor or a separate written instrument signed by the contractor, which provides that no claim shall be <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>filed by anyone, shall be binding; bnt the only admissible evidence thereof, as against a subcontractor, shall be proof of actual notice thereof to him before any labor or materials were furnished by him; or proof that such contract or separate written instrument was filed in the office of the prothonotary prior to the commencement of the work upon the ground or within ten (10) days after the execution of the principal contract or not less than ten (10) days prior to the contract with the claimant subcontractor, indexed in the name of the contractor as defendant and the owner as plaintiff, and also in the name of the contractor as plaintiff and the owner as defendant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

In sustaining a lien against a school district, the Kansas court held that the lien-claimant’s inability to execute against the municipality did not invalidate his lien. The Court stated at pages 110-111 of its opinion: “Liens may be foreclosed and placed in judgment, and then like other judgments are met by this statute which provides a tax instead of an execution as a means of enforcement. But it may be said that there is an incongruity in calling that right a specific lien, which is incapable of direct enforcement; and further, that the necessities of public business require that public buildings shall be held exempt from mechanics’ liens, or any risk, incident thereto, of their being lost to the public use. But many specific liens exist which cannot at all times be directly or otherwise enforced. A mortgage prior to its maturity, and a decree of foreclosure prior to the time when by its terms process may issue, are examples. So there are liens whose en<a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>forcement is suspended during the existence of the title by which defendants hold their property ....

        <em>Wilson </em>prevented a lien upon a county courthouse; our disposition likewise precludes liens against such municipal properties as are used for essential governmental functions; the result in <em>Wilson </em>is, therefore, quite compatible with our result here.</p>

    <p id="b486-8" data-blocks='[["BL_486.9",486,[228,1231,1153,211]]]'>I cannot understand why the majority has stepped beyond precedent, the statute governing mechanics’ liens, and common sense to reach the decision rendered here today.</p>
    <p id="b486-9" data-blocks='[["BL_486.10",486,[225,1452,1155,649]]]'>Section 303 of the “Mechanics’ Lien Law” of 1963, P. L. 1175, 49 P.S. §1101, provides: “Section 303. Lien Not Allowed in Certain Cases.— ... (b) Public Purpose. No Lien shall be allowed for labor or materials furnished for a purely public purpose. ... (d) Leasehold Premises. No lien shall be allowed against the estate of an owner in fee by reason of any consent given by such owner to a tenant to improve the leased premises unless it shall appear in writing signed by such owner that the erection, construction, alteration or repair was in fact for the immediate use and benefit of the <em>owner. . . </em>.”</p>
    <p id="b486-10" data-blocks='[["BL_486.11",486,[224,2120,1154,269]]]'>The majority now holds that the erection of the Spectrum was not a public purpose and that §303 (d) of the Mechanics’ Lien Law does not apply. The most shocking result of the majority’s opinion is its complete disregard of §303 (d).</p>
    <p id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.3",487,[175,399,1147,767]]]'>
      <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>It was the express purpose of the framers of the Mechanics’ Lien Law to protect the owner against the filing of mechanic’s lien claims against his property, where the circumstances clearly show that the contractor looked to the tenant for payment at the time the contract was made. Section 303(d) of the Act makes it mandatory for the contractor, who seeks to lien an owner’s property, when the contractor has contracted with the tenant alone, to produce a writing whereby the owner specifically admits that the work is being done for the owner’s immediate use and benefit, as opposed to work that is done for the benefit of the tenant who contracts for the work and to whom the contractor looks for payment.</p>
    <p id="b487-4" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[175,1179,1148,590]]]'>The right to a mechanic’s lien is provided by statute. Thus, strict compliance is necessary and the statute should not be construed so that the lien is expanded beyond the legislative grant. <em>Murray v. Zemon, </em><a href="/pa/402/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="402 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="1296692" data-case-paths="/pa/402/0354-01">402 Pa. 354</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=167%20A.2d%20253" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="167 A.2d 253">167 A. 2d 253</a> (1960). This Court should not therefore constrxie a lease, which permits the tenant to undertake construction on the demised premises, to satisfy a statutory requirement that before a property may be subjected to a mechanic’s lien the owner must acknowledge an immediate use and benefit to himself, or consent to be bound for construction costs.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[175,1789,1148,596]]]'>Mr. Justice Eagen, speaking for a unanimous court, in <em>Murray v. Zemon, </em>supra, at 359, clearly stated the requirements: “. . . In order for the claim to be valid against the estate of the owner, where he is not a party to the contract, his consent mxist appear in the form of a written statement, signed by him, and which shall also state that the improvement is made for his immediate use and benefit. This is a condition precedent. The claim filed must on its face show the existence of such consent to satisfy this requirement. Every mechanic’s lien must be self sustaining: . . .”</p>

      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>Even though an owner gires his written permission to the tenant to make alterations, repairs, and additions to the owner’s premises, such written permission is not sufficient to authorize the contractor, who deals with the tenant as such, to lien the premises. It is proper for a tenant to obtain the permission of the owner to make repairs, alterations and additions, to the owner’s property, but there is no duty upon an owner where the tenant is having the work done by the contractor, to repudiate liability by notifying the contractor.</p>
    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[212,1019,1154,256]]]'>The majority relies on the preamble of the lease between the City and Wolman to show an “immediate use and benefit” as well as the necessary consent required by subsection (d). This reliance is misplaced for several reasons.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[209,1296,1155,431]]]'>These clauses are nothing more than a justification to the citizens of Philadelphia that the lease will benefit the City. It was an attempt to avoid a repeat of the challenge of misuse of public property that occurred in <em>Clarey v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/311/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="311 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1146273" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0011-01">311 Pa. 11</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20237" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="166 A. 237">166 Atl. 237</a> (1933). Nowhere does the City assume the responsibility for the costs of the Spectrum. This is not the consent contemplated under the Act.</p>
    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[203,1740,1174,652]],["BL_489.1",489,[172,396,1147,212]]]'>Even if we accept the statements in the preamble as fact and determine that there is a “benefit”, where is the “immediate use”? There is always some benefit to the owner when his tenant makes improvements upon his land. “Immediate use” requires more than a long-range direct or a present indirect benefit. The owner must have the immediate use of the benefit; for example, when the construction is performed at the. end of the leased term or when the owner retains part of the premises and shares the use of the common hallways, walkways, and roof. Unless this use is present, a consent which does not assume financial responsi<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>bility will not subject the owner to a mechanic’s lien. A recitation that there will be benefits to the public accruing from the construction of an arena is not a consent by the City to be financially bound.</p>
    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[169,621,1150,757]]]'>Furthermore, a concession by the majority that there are benefits accruing to the City as stated in the preamble completely undercuts its position that the construction was not for a public purpose under §303 (b). The clause which recites the increase in tourist and convention business makes this eminently clear. Any contention that the presence of profits to private enterprise eliminates the public purpose has been disposed of in <em>Martin v. Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/420/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="420 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1898587" data-case-paths="/pa/420/0014-01">420 Pa. 14</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=215%20A.2d%20894" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="215 A.2d 894">215 A. 2d 894</a> (1966). In that case, Chief Justice Bell ruled that the stadium across the street from the Spectrum was being built for a public purpose. There is no valid distinction for treating the two differently and the <em>Martin </em>case should bind this Court.</p>
    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[166,1400,1149,263]]]'>The holding of the majority clearly violates the law as pronounced in <em>Martin v.
