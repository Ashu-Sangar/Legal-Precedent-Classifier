The plaintiff, Helen Marie Chesko, was a passenger in a boat owned and operated by Fred Fusco. At the time the accident occurred, Fusco was driving his boat upstream in a westerly direction. The defendant, operating his own boat, was coming down the Creek in the opposite direction. At the point where the collision took place, Connequenessing Creek is approximately 100 yards wide, and flows from west to east. Neither party challenges or disputes the aforesaid facts. However, the precise place or spot on the <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Creek, and the exact manner in which the accident occurred when the two boats collided were issues which were hotly contested by the parties.</p>
