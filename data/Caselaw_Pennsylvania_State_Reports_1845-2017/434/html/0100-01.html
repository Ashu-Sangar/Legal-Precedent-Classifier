A number of reputable witnesses described in some detail, how, even as far as a mile away from the property, their activities were curtailed. It is true that the defendant produced witnesses and that there was a conflict of testimony as to the intensity of the noise caused by the drag strip operation, the traffic congestion, the effect on farming activities and other factors, but it is worthy of note that all of those who were called by the defendant were demonstrated to have either a business relationship in the past or the present with the defendant or have at least some other connection.
