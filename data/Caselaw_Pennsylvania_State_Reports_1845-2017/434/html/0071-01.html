First, in my view <em>Escobedo </em>requires that a confession be suppressed if a <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>prisoner is not warned of Ms right to remain silent. That right of course can be waived, but footnote 14 of the <em>Escobedo </em>opinion indicates by its citation of <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em><a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">304 U.S. 458</a>, <a href="/us/304/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="304 U.S. 458" data-case-ids="10805" data-case-paths="/us/304/0458-01">58 S. Ct. 1019</a> (1938) that that waiver must still be, in short, a knowing and intelligent one. The court below found that appellee did not understand what she was being told, and this finding precludes the possibility that her waiver was knowing and intelligent. It causes no particular harm, I suppose, for the majority to perform verbal theatrics in determining whether given statements of the court below were “findings” or “conclusions,” although it should be pointed out that this case is in no way different than the many cases in which we affirm findings of the hearing judge that, for example, a guilty plea has been voluntarily entered, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v. Wakeley, </em><a href="/pa/433/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="433 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="1921060" data-case-paths="/pa/433/0159-01">433 Pa. 159</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=249%20A.2d%20303" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="249 A.2d 303">249 A. 2d 303</a> (1969).</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[221,1348,1157,646]]]'>What is important is that there is support in the record for the court’s ultimate finding. The court below pointed out that the record showed that appellee was sleepy and seemed to have been nodding her head aimlessly during the period in which she was told of her rights. The court also found that the statement which appellee gave, including that part in which she supposedly admits to knowing her rights, was not in her own words. On this record, I do not believe that we could hold that as a matter of law appellee knowingly and intelligently waived her right to remain silent.</p>

In my view, the fact that a request for counsel is not couched in language of the utmost clarity and has not specifically been made and refused does not mean that a <em>Schmidt </em>“request” has not been made. Given the fact that the accused was a 17 year old girl, and apparently was, in general, far from entirely lucid, I believe her statement that she would obtain an attorney if necessary constitutes a sufficient request.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

Cupp, </em>37 L.W. 4362, 4364 (April 22, 1960), an opinion announced on the day before our decision in the case before us was filed, the Supreme Court of the United States held insufficient as an <em>Escobedo </em>request a prisoner’s in-custody statement that: “I think I had better get a lawyer before I talk any more. I am going to get into trouble more than I am in now”, to which the officer replied, “You can’t be in any more trouble than you are in now.” I believe that the <em>Frazier </em>decision is unwise on its facts and would reject it as a matter of state law, an option that is open to us when we believe that the Supreme Court of the United States has too narrowly drawn the bounds of constitutional protections.

It seems to me that Frazier’s request was a rather explicit one, and I think it is totally unrealistic to view it as anything less than that. Certainly Frazier said what he did because he wanted a lawyer. I do not believe that prisoners make “passing comments” of this type merely to pass time with interrogating police officers. I also would reject the Court’s argument that “petitioner did not pursue the matter.” Under the circumstances, I do not think there was anything Frazier could <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>have done but continue to answer questions.

Considering the fact that under <em>Escobedo, </em>less complete warnings are necessary <em>than </em>under <em>Miranda, </em>I <em>would </em>think that a prisoner <em>having </em>been told less, if anything would be required to be less articulate in his demands.</p>

I cannot believe that the Court in <em>Frazier </em>meant to exclude from consideration the age, intelligence, experience, and condition of a prisoner in determining whether an <em>Escobedo </em>request has been made. Certainly Geraldine Taper, a tired, seventeen year old girl of limited intelligence, could not be expected to be as articulate as at least some prisoners who have had considerable experience in the criminal process. I believe that her requests here, under the circumstances, were sufficient.</p>
