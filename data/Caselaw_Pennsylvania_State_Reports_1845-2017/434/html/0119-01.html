    <p id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.8",226,[224,709,1152,211]]]'>Plaintiffs-appellees instituted an action in trespass against the defendants in Philadelphia County. The cause of action arose as a result of a motor vehicle accident in Monroe County.</p>
    <p id="b226-7" data-blocks='[["BL_226.9",226,[221,932,1154,596]]]'>Plaintiffs are residents of Philadelphia County. Defendant Saturen is a resident of Philadelphia County and defendant Schouppe (appellant) is a resident of Monroe County. Deputized service was made upon defendant Schouppe in Monroe County. Schouppe filed preliminary objections contending that the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County is without jurisdiction over him since Pa. R. O. P. 1043<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> deputized service is permitted only from the county in which the accident occurred. Defendants’ preliminary objections were dismissed and this appeal followed.</p>

Under the prior practice, separate actions had to be brought in each of the counties so that each individual defendant could be properly served. This requirement of multiple actions was cumbersome. Under the amendments to the Rules, where defendants residing in separate counties jointly or jointly and severally incur an obligation or commit a tort, a single action can be brought against all defendants either in the county of the cause, or in a county in which one of the defendants may be served. Rule 1006(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Rule 1009(e) makes further provision for any necessary deputized service. Thus, by a single action litigants are enabled to adjudicate the liability of all defendants who reside anywhere within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
