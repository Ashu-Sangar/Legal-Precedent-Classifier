The statements of counsel in the record indicate the contrary. The burden of proving an illegal inducement of a guilty plea falls on appellant when the record of a colloquy clearly shows a valid plea. Commonwealth v. Grays, 428 Pa. 109, 237 A. 2d 198 (1968). The existence of the record here makes the application of Commonwealth v. Finney, 433 Pa. 152, 249 A. 2d 286 (1969), inappropriate.\nAppellant further contends that the hearing judge erred in not calling appellant\u2019s trial counsel to testify. Appellant, however, requested neither their testimony nor their attendance. A hearing judge is not required to call witnesses of his own initiative. Considering the state of the record and the applicable burdens, there is no error.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr, Justice Jones concurs in the result.",
