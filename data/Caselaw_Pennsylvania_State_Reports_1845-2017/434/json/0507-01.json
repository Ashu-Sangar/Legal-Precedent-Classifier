        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones,\nOn May 15, 1963, Kenneth C. Brown (appellant) was injured in the course of his employment with the Reynolds Metals Company. Reynolds\u2019 workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, The Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), accepted appellant\u2019s claim for compensation under the provisions of The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a71 et seq.) and made payments to appellant pursuant to the schedule established by the Act.\nAppellant then brought an action in trespass against Travelers, alleging that Travelers\u2019 negligence in inspecting or failing to inspect Reynolds\u2019 work places and equipment caused his injuries. After appellant had filed an amended complaint, Travelers filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the amended complaint. The Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia County (per Spaeth, J.) sustained Travelers\u2019 preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.\nAppellant raises two issues: first, whether, as a matter of law, Travelers had a duty to see that the area where appellant worked and the manner in which the work was done were safe; second, if the answer to the first question is affirmative, whether an employer\u2019s insurance carrier is subject to suit under The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. We need not consider the first issue, for we hold that an employer\u2019s insurance carrier enjoys the same immunity from liability under the Act as does the employer.\nTravelers\u2019 position is that, under \u00a7303 of the Act (77 P.S. \u00a7481), the insurance carrier is entitled to the same freedom from common law liability as is the employer. Section 303 provides: \u201cSnch agreement shall constitute an acceptance of all the provisions of article three of this act, and shall operate as a surrender by the parties thereto of their rights to any form or amount of compensation or damages. . . . Such agreement shall bind the employer and his personal representatives, and the employe . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added) Travelers claims that the insurance carrier is included within the term \u201cemployer,\u201d relying on the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d found in \u00a7401 of the Act (77 P.S. \u00a7701) : \u201cThe term \u2018Employer,\u2019 when used in this article, shall mean the employer as defined in article one of this act ... or his insurer if such insurer has assumed the employer\u2019s liability . . . .\u201d\nAppellant counters by arguing that this definition applies only to Article IV of the Act, that the employer\u2019s immunity from liability is established in Article III and that, therefore, the general definition of \u201cemployer\u201d set forth in Article I is controlling. Section 103 defines \u201cemployer\u201d as \u201csynonymous with master, and to include natural persons, partnerships, joint-stock companies, corporations for profit, corporations not for profit, municipal corporations, the Commonwealth, and all governmental agencies created by it.\u201d (77 P.S. \u00a721). No reference is made to the employer\u2019s insurance carrier.\nThe courts in this Commonwealth which have considered this question have disagreed as to which definition should apply. The leading case in support of the appellant\u2019s position is Mays v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 323 F. 2d 174 (3d Cir. 1963), in which the court (per Staley, J.) held that the Article I definition was to be applied to the immunity section in Article III. We are not persuaded by this opinion. The Mays opinion was carefully analyzed and criticized in an exhaustive and able opinion written by Judges Barbieri and Ullman \u2014 both of whom had extensive experience in workmen\u2019s compensation prior to their elevation to the bench. Brown v. Travelers Ins. Cos., 37 Pa. D. & C. 2d 111 (Phila. C. P. 1965). Since we feel that Judges Barbieri and Ullman more than adequately set forth the reasons why the more restricted definition of \u201cemployer\u201d should not apply to the immunity section, we quote at length from their opinion: \u201cAs is observed, Judge Staley\u2019s conclusion is arrived at by his view that the language of section 103 is to be given superior force to that of section 401, for he refers to the former as the \u2018principal definition\u2019. One may ask, why so? We have noted previously herein that article I (including section 103) and article IV (including section 401), are neither of them substantive. We have termed them \u2018external\u2019 articles, as compared with the legislatively designated substantive articles II and III. In short, the first and fourth articles are ancillary, descriptive, unsubstantive and are both basically procedural in significance. It would have been inappropriate for the legislature to have included the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier as synonymous with employer in section 103 of article I of the act, because that section was delineating the status of employer and employe for the limited purposes of their status as parties to the statutory agreement to accept the compensation system which was set up in article III .... Chronologically speaking, it would be pointless and fruitless to discuss the insurance carrier in article I of the act, because the need for insuring could not arise until article III had become operative. It is the \u2018master\u2019 alone (who, before he accepts the act, has no need for a compensation insurance carrier), who is concerned with the substantive provisions of articles II and III. The employer not only has the right to reject the act, but frequently has done so. See Rich Hill Coal Company v. Bashore, 334 Pa. 449 (1939). Article IV sets up all of the provisions for every form of process and remedy available to a claimant and the manner in which liability of the employer to him is to be met, satisfied, settled, concluded and released; so that even under Judge Staley's conception of article IV, and section 401, the insurance carrier shares every one of the obligations, prerequisites, benefits and release rights of the employer. Thus, we find the legislature stating in section 401 that the employer, who had to be defined in section 103 solely as the \u2018master\u2019 for articles II and III purposes, would, for all remedial or procedural purposes, be taken to be a complex entity, including within its scope the compensation insurer (be it a private company or the State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund), and the agent of such \u2018master\u2019.\u201d (37 Pa. D. & C. 2d at 119, 120)\nIf we were to accept the appellant\u2019s argument that the Article I definition applies to Article III, then we would have difficulty interpreting \u00a7319, which states, \u201cWhere the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added) (77 P.S. \u00a7671). The appellant could hardly argue that if the employer has an insurance carrier, that carrier has no subrogation rights because the word \u201cemployer\u201d as used in the subrogation section does not include the insurance carrier. Travelers argues quite convincingly that the legislature clearly intended the word \u201cemployer\u201d as used in \u00a7319 to include the insurance carrier. Therefore, since \u00a7319 is part of Article III, this destroys the appellant\u2019s argument that the Article I definition of \u201cemployer\u201d applies throughout Article III. Instead, we are convinced that the legislature intended that the broader definition which clearly applies in \u00a7319 should also apply in \u00a7303 establishing the employer\u2019s immunity.\nWhile we conclude that Judges Barbieri and Ullman correctly interpreted the Act, we must admit in all candor that the question is not free from doubt on the face of the statute. However, the relevant policy considerations reinforce our conclusion that the legislature intended that the insurance carrier would share in the employer\u2019s immunity.\nFirst, if the appellant\u2019s position were adopted, then a regrettable discrimination would result between employers who are insured by the State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund or are self-insuring employers and those employers who carry private insurance. The statute setting up the State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund specifically gives the Fund the same defenses which are available to the employer, and, therefore, it is impossible to bring a suit such as the instant action against the Fund or a self-insuring employer. Such discrimination would be inequitable and unjust both to the employers who utilize private insurance and to their employees: first, these employers would be placed at a competitive disadvantage since private insurance carriers would necessarily have to raise their rates to offset the increased liability placed upon them by the result urged by the appellant; second, the employees-would be disadvantaged because, in the wake of such a result, private insurance carriers would probably abandon all safety programs since these programs, instead of cutting costs by reducing accidents, would merely increase the orbit of the carrier\u2019s liability. We cannot and do not believe that the legislature ever intended the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to produce such discrimination.\nSecond, we do not think that the legislature intended to place insurance carriers in such a position that they would be forced to abandon these safety programs. Today many insurance carriers undertake such safety programs in the factories and business places of employers whom they insure. Admittedly, these programs are not motivated by an altruistic feeling toward workers, since it is to the financial advantage of the insurance carrier to reduce accidents and safety programs reduce accidents. Nevertheless, although the insurance carriers are attempting to save money, the safety programs they institute directly benefit the workers. Under the appellant\u2019s position, if an insurance carrier is negligent in instituting a safety program, it is liable to an employee who is injured as a result. Since the insurance carrier is not required by law to carry on these safety programs, the end result of the appellant\u2019s argument seems assured \u2014 insurance carriers will specifically absolve themselves from undertaking such safety programs. Again, we cannot conclude that the legislature intended this result.\nThird, the weight of authority from other jurisdictions supports Travelers\u2019 position. This question has been much litigated across the country. In 1960 the Supreme Court of New Hampshire held that a negligent insurance carrier was subject to suit by the injured employee. Three years later the Supreme Court of Iowa followed suit. However, the legislatures in both these states quickly amended their workmen\u2019s compensation statutes to reverse the results reached in these cases. Courts in at least fifteen other states have considered this question and twelve of these courts rejected the position advocated by the appellant. Furthermore, at least seven states \u2014 including Pennsylvania \u2014 have amended their workmen\u2019s compensation acts specifically to bar recovery by the employee against the insurance carrier. These statistics indicate that the position advanced by the appellant has generally met with disfavor and represents a minority view. The legislatures of at least nine states have come to the conclusion that permitting an employee to bring an action against the insurance carrier produces serious consequences for the entire structure of workmen\u2019s compensation.\nIn conclusion, we hold that the insurance carrier is included within the term \u201cemployer\u201d as that word is used in \u00a7303 and, therefore, shares the employer\u2019s immunity from common law liability.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen concurs in the result.\nAct of June 2, 1915, P.

        "text": "Dissenting Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien :\nI cannot agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The majority holds that the carrier is entitled to the same freedom from common law liability as the employer, as provided in \u00a7303 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7481. Section 303 provides: \u201cSuch agreement shall constitute an acceptance of all the provisions of article three of this act, and shall operate as a surrender by the parties thereto of their rights to any form or amount of compensation or damages for any injury or death occurring in the course of the employment, or to any method of determination thereof, other than as provided, in article three of this act. Such agreement shall bind the employer and his personal representatives, and the employe, his or her wife or husband, widow or widower, next of kin, and other dependents.\u201d (Emphasis added). The majority relies on \u00a7401 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7701, which provides: \u201cThe term \u2018Employer,\u2019 when used in this article, shall mean the employer as defined in article one of this act [\u00a7103 of the Act], or his duly authorized agent, or his insurer if such insurer has assumed the employer\u2019s liability, or the fund if the employer be insured therein.\u201d The majority, recognizing the split of authority in Pennsylvania, relies on the decision of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas in Brown v. Travelers, 37 Pa. D. & C. 2d 111 (Phila C.P. 1965), which held that \u00a7401 did indeed exempt the carrier from common law liability. I am not persuaded by that case, but rather am impressed by the reasoning of Judge (later Chief Judge) Staley in Mays v. Liberty Mutual, 323 F. 2d 174 (3d Cir. 1963), which reasoning was also adopted by Judge Gold in Adcox v. Pa. Mfrs\u2019. Assn. Cas. Ins. Co., 37 Pa. D. & C. 2d 179 (Phila. C.P. 1964). I am also impressed by the reasoning of the decisions in several other jurisdictions which have permitted recovery. However, I recognize that those cases, as well as those which have denied recovery, are based on the particular workmen\u2019s compensation statutes applicable in the several jurisdictions and are thus of somewhat limited value to this Court. I am thus unimpressed by the \u201ccounting of jurisdictions\u201d argument made by the majority. That argument is never a particularly powerful one and is even less so in this case where a particular state\u2019s statute must be construed.\nOur task is to interpret the Pennsylvania statute, and I, for one, agree with Judge Staley that the clear words of the statute are susceptible of only one interpretation. I take the liberty to quote extensively from his opinion in Mays, supra, at page 176: \u201cThe appellate courts of Pennsylvania have not passed upon the question. The problem, though novel, is wholly one of statutory construction. More particularly, as we have previously stated, it is refined to the question of whether the insurance carrier is an \u2018employer\u2019 as that term is defined in the statute. Accordingly, we start with that definition: \u2018\u00a721. \u201cEmployer\u201d defined. The term \u201cemployer\u201d as used in this act, is declared to be synonymous with master, and to include natural persons, partnerships, joint-stock companies, corporations for profit, corporations not for profit, municipal corporations, the Commonwealth, and all governmental agencies created by it.\u2019 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a721. It is not contended that Liberty is in any sense the master of Mays, and, thus, as the district court observed, \u2018The specific language of this section would apparently exclude from the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d anything not therein included.\u2019 However, the court was impressed with the expanded definition of the term found in Article IV, \u00a7401 of the Act, and with the subrogation rights of insurance carriers. The relevant portion of \u00a7401 provides: \u2018The term \u201cEmployer,\u201d when used in this article, shall mean the employer as defined in article one of this act, or his duly authorized agent, or his insurer if such insurer has assumed the employer\u2019s liability, or the fund if the employer be insured therein.\u2019 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7701. The district court reasoned that, \u2018[ujnder the Act, the carrier cannot assume any portion of the employer\u2019s recognized duty without assuming the corresponding liability. Having assumed a portion of the employer\u2019s liability, the carrier stands in the shoes of the employer under the Pennsylvania Act.\u2019 211 F. Supp. at 544.\n\u201cBut the legislature has defined the term \u2018employer\u2019 in words which are clear and free from all ambiguity. The mandate of the Pennsylvania Statutory Construction Act requires adherence to that definition. Nor is this legislative command made inapplicable by the definition contained in Article IV, \u00a7401 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Article IV relates solely to procedure, and \u00a7401 specifically states that the definition therein contained applies only \u2018when used in this article.\u2019 Since the Act contemplates a system of compensation insurance, it is perfectly reasonable that the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, which pays the injured employee, be given the same procedural rights as the insured employer. Of course, the reference in \u00a7401 to an insurer who \u2018has assumed the employer\u2019s liability\u2019 means the liability to pay compensation to the injured employee, for under the Act that is the extent of the employer\u2019s liability. From this it is clear that, rather than expanding the principal definition of \u2018employer\u2019, \u00a7401 serves only this limited purpose. In this respect the definition in that section supports the position of Mays, for when the legislature intended to equate the insurer with the employer, it did so specifically in unequivocal terms. Its failure to do so in the clear, unambiguous definition found in \u00a7103, 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a721, is an indication that it did not intend to blend their jural personalities.\n\u201cIt is beyond dispute that the Act affects only the legal relations between employer and employee and does not purport to alter the employee\u2019s rights against third parties. On the contrary, the statute acknowledges the viability of those rights. 77 Purdon\u2019s Pa. Stat. Ann. \u00a7671. Thus, insofar as the employment relationship is concerned, the statute must be liberally construed in order to effectuate its remedial purpose, but its scope cannot be extended in a manner which would destroy either the employee\u2019s common-law rights against third persons, or the common-law conception of third persons. Zimmer v. Casey, 296 Pa. 529, 146 A. 130 (1929). The essence, indeed the very legislative definition, of the employer-employee status is the master-servant relationship. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held in Zimmer, 146 A. at 131, \u2018The act does not affect the existing common-law right to sue the wrongdoer, unless that wrongdoer is the master.\u2019 The master-servant relationship is totally lacking in the matter sub judice. Hence, to hold that Liberty is the employer of Mays within the meaning of the Act would not only be to abrogate by judicial legislation the employee\u2019s common-law rights, but would directly contravene the intent of the legislature as manifested in the statute.\n\u201cWe conclude therefore that this suit is not barred by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d [footnotes omitted]. (Emphasis in original).\nThe majority recites several reasons why we should not follow Mays. First, it states that the definition of employer in Article I, \u00a7103 should not control, because Article I, like Article IV, is ancillary to Articles II and III. This was the reasoning adopted by the court in Brown v. Travelers, 37 Pa. D. & C. 2d, supra. That argument is simply not tenable. Article I is the definitional article, setting forth definitions to govern the entire Act. The expanded definition of employer in Article IV is specifically limited to that Article. Thus the definition in Article I is still valid for the rest of the Act.\nThe majority next argues that certain unreasonable results would follow from a decision in favor of appellant here. One of these would allegedly be to deprive the carrier of subrogation rights under \u00a7319 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7671. That section provides, in relevant part: \u201cWhere the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employee . . . against such third party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article [footnote omitted] by the employer . . .\u201d Travelers contends that since several cases have indicated that where the carrier pays, the carrier is subrogated to the employee\u2019s claim, \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7319 is necessarily interpreted to include the carrier. Since, says Travelers, it would be unreasonable to hold that \u201cemployer\u201d includes the carrier in \u00a7319 but not in \u00a7303, \u00a7303 should be interpreted to give immunity from common law liability to the carrier as well as the employer. The majority has accepted this argument. Travelers\u2019 argument founders, however, on the assumption that the subrogation right of the carrier is based on \u00a7319. The only appellate state court case cited, Neal v. B. R. & P. Rwy. Co., 103 Pa. Superior Ct. 218, 158 Atl. 305 (1931), expressly predicates subrogation on the carrier-employer contract. It would appear that even without any specific provision for subrogation, the general equitable principle that one who pays the debt of another is entitled to the creditor\u2019s claim against the debtor would apply to allow the carrier the right of subrogation. There is thus nothing inconsistent in allowing the carrier a right of subrogation based on general equitable principles, completely outside \u00a7319, and at the same time holding that the clear meaning of the word \u201cemployer\u201d in \u00a7303 excludes the carrier.\nNor am I convinced by the argument that the allowance of a common law action against a private carrier results in certain invidious discriminations. The majority asserts that such discriminations would exist because the private carrier could be sued, whereas the State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund could not. Furthermore, employees of employers utilizing private insurance would be disadvantaged because private insurance carriers would abandon all safety programs. This argument breaks down in several respects. Assuming that the State Fund is immune from common law liability, numerous reasons for distinguishing the State Fund from private carriers present themselves. For refutation of the contention that the employees would be disadvantaged I again quote from Judge Staley\u2019s opinion in Mays, supra: \u201cThe insurer\u2019s final argument is based on what it terms \u2018pressing considerations of public policy.\u2019 It is urged that our determination will cause insurance companies to refrain from making safety inspections, and that the \u2018ultimate losers will be workmen and their families\u2019 because of an increase in the incidence and severity of industrial accidents. There can be no doubt of the value of a safety program. This, however, is not to say that insurance carriers are motivated solely by altruism or derive no financial benefit from a safety inspection policy. It is obvious that the cost of workmen\u2019s compensation becomes less and less expensive as more and better safety methods are devised and put into operation. We point this out not to suggest that the insurer has a duty to inspect, but simply to show that a policy of inspection has practical advantages for the insurer, as well as for the employer and his workmen. . . .\u201d Clearly, none of the alleged unreasonable results that would follow from appellant\u2019s construction is sufficient to overcome the clear meaning of the words of the statute.\nFinally, the majority alludes to the enactment of the 1968 amendment to \u00a7305 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. That amendment, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1552, \u00a71, 77 P.S. \u00a7501, provides that the insurer \u201cshall be entitled to all of the employer\u2019s immunities and protection hereunder except, [exceptions not relevant].\u201d The majority does not hold, as indeed it could not, Doane v. Travelers Ins. Co., 266 P. Supp. 504 (E.D. Pa. 1966), that the 1966 amendment applies retroactively to deprive the injured plaintiff of his common law action. Rather, it intimates that the 1966 amendment clarified the prior law that had existed since the enactment of the Act itself. It should be clear by this time that in all cases such as this, one side urges that the amendment changed the law, and the other that it merely clarified the law. I am inclined to agree with the Supreme Court of Iowa, which, when faced with the identical problem of deciding what bearing an amendment had on the previous meaning of the statute, stated that little if any weight should be given to the passage of the amendment since the amendment would not necessarily indicate either an intent to change the meaning of the existing law or legislative recognition that the statute prior to the amendment already permitted the operations that were in doubt. State v. All-Iowa Agricultural Assn., 242 Iowa 860, 48 N.W. 2d 281 (1951).\nHowever, inasmuch as the language of \u00a7303 before the amendment to \u00a7305 was clear and free from ambiguity, this Court should not even have to consider the effect to be given the 1966 amendment to \u00a7305 as an aid to the construction of \u00a7303 as it originally stood. Statutory Construction Act, supra, \u00a751, 46 P.S. \u00a7551. I would thus hold that appellant\u2019s cause of action is not barred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nNor do I believe that appellant has for any other reason failed to state a cause of action. The question of the duty owed by the employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier to an employee has been considered on several occasions by the Pennsylvania courts. The starting point must necessarily be the decision of this Court in Dejesus v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 423 Pa. 198, 223 A. 2d 849 (1966). In that case, the plaintiff sued his employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation carrier for injuries he sustained from a strip of baling wire which he had cut in the process of opening a bale of compressed wool. Plaintiff alleged a duty on the part of the insurer, arising out of its advertising material representing that it provided loss prevention services and safety counsel to its policyholders. We held that the allegations were insufficient to create a duty in the carrier toward the employee because there was no averment that the advertisements were part of any contract or other legal obligation undertaken by the carrier, or that the advertisements adversely affected appellant. We went on to indicate that even if Dejesus had alleged an undertaking to render services in developing safety techniques, he still would not have stated a cause of action. The Court cited with approval \u00a7323 of the Restatement 2d, Torts, which states: \u201c\u00a7323. Negligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services. One who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of the other\u2019s person or things, is subject to liability to the other for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to perform his undertaking, if (a) his failure to exercise such care increases the risk of such harm, or (b) the harm is suffered because of the other\u2019s reliance upon the undertaking.\u201d Since DeJesus failed to allege an increased risk of harm or reliance upon the carrier\u2019s undertaking, he was precluded from recovering on that basis also.\nAppellant\u2019s attorney in the instant case evidently did his homework, for the pleading deficiencies which precluded recovery in Dejesus have been avoided here. Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the amended complaint clearly set forth appellant\u2019s theory that appellee had assumed a duty by undertaking to render services in making the employer\u2019s premises safe, and that its negligent inspections or failure to inspect had increased the risk of harm to appellant who had relied on appellee\u2019s program. The amended complaint, in addition to getting forth a theory of appellee\u2019s undertaking a duty, can also be read to support a theory that appellee was required to fulfill such a duty by virtue of its contract with the employer. Whether appellant can adduce evidence at trial to support either of these theories is conjectural, but I cannot say as a matter of law that he should not be given an opportunity to prove a duty based on either theory, both of which the law of Pennsylvania has long recognized.\nAppellee urges that the cases of Raines v. Pa. Thresh. & F. Mut. Cas. Ins. Co., 385 Pa. 464, 123 A. 2d 420 (1956), and 391 Pa. 175, 137 A. 2d 257 (1958), preclude any finding of a duty in the instant case. The plaintiff in Raines had received a leg injury at work. Plaintiff sued his employer\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier on the ground that the loss of the leg and the aggravation of other injuries were caused by the failure of the insurance carrier to furnish him with competent and adequate medical care allegedly promised to him by the carrier\u2019s representative. This Court, twice affirming the court below, first on the trespass claim and then on the assumpsit action, held that there could be no recovery. However, the Raines cases are distinguishable from the instant case, and rather than preclude appellant\u2019s recovery, actually support it. Those cases are based not on the impossibility of a duty arising from an undertaking to perform it, but from the failure of the plaintiff to \u201cplead a single fact from which could be derived a finding of negligence on the part of the insurance company that was the proximate cause of the aggravation of the appellant\u2019s injury.\u201d 385 Pa. at 467. Raines is based merely on a failure sufficiently to allege the undertaking.\nIn addition to the Dejesus case, supra, other Pennsylvania authority clearly supports the principle stated by the Restatement and by Justice Cardozo in Glanzer v. Shepard, 233 N.Y. 236, 135 N.E. 275, 276 (1922) : \u201cIt is ancient learning that one who assumes to act, even though gratuitously, may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully, if he acts at all.\u201d In Mays v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 211 F. Supp. 541 (E.D. Pa. 1962), reversed, on other grounds, 323 F. 2d 174, the District Court denied recovery to the employee on the ground that the carrier was not liable outside the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the first issue involved in the instant case. However, the Court did not reach the issue of the action being barred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act until after it considered whether the carrier owed any duty to the plaintiff upon which liability could be predicated even if the action were not barred by the effect of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint was somewhat inartfully drawn, choosing to rely on an alleged duty to inspect imposed by the contract between the employer and the carrier. The District Court found from the contract only a license to inspect, not a duty. However, from some of the carrier\u2019s answers to interrogatories that were before the court on the motion for summary judgment, it appeared that the carrier had undertaken to make some inspections even though it was not required to do so. The court stated at page 542: \u201c[T]he voluntary undertaking of such a program by Liberty possibly may have created a duty. However, as the facts are not yet sufficiently developed, an ultimate finding on the existence of a duty cannot be made prior to a hearing on the merits. At this point it cannot be said that as a matter of law Liberty had no duty to Mays.\u201d On appeal, the Court of Appeals likewise refused to accept the carrier\u2019s argument that, as a matter of law, it owed no enforceable duty to the employee. Similarly, in Adcox v. Pa. Mfrs.' Assn. Cas. Ins. Co., supra, Judge Gold, in a well written opinion, held that the complaint set forth a cause of action \u201cby alleging an enforceable duty to plaintiff arising out of defendant\u2019s voluntary assumption of responsibility to make safety inspections in the employer\u2019s establishment.\u201d The instant case is virtually the same as Mays and Adcox; it is impossible to determine on these preliminary objections that Travelers owed no enforceable duty to Brown. On preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, all well pleaded facts in the complaint and every inference fairly deducible therefrom must be taken as true. Kutsenkow v. Kutsenkow, 414 Pa. 610, 202 A. 2d 68 (1964). Appellant has pleaded sufficient facts which, if true, would indicate that Travelers assumed a duty to him; he has stated a cause of action.\nIn addition, appellant has alleged that, by virtue of its contract with the employer, Reynolds, Travelers owed the employee, Brown, a duty. The leading case in this area is Evans v. Otis Elevator Co., 403 Pa. 13, 168 A. 2d 573 (1961). In that case, the plaintiff, Evans, a stock clerk, was injured through the malfunction of his employer\u2019s freight elevator. Plaintiff sued the defendant, Otis Elevator Company, relying on the employer\u2019s \u201cOtis Service\u201d contract with the defendant, under which Otis agreed to make a semi-monthly examination of the elevator and to lubricate it and make necessary adjustments. This Court in affirming a judgment on a verdict for the plaintiff, stated at page 18: \u201cOtis argues that this agreement imposed upon it no duty or obligation to Evans and that Evans, not a party to this agreement, has no standing to complain of an injury allegedly sustained by reason of the manner in which Otis performed this agreement. Generally a party to a contract does not become liable for a breach thereof to one who is not a party thereto. However, a party to a contract by the very nature of his contractual undertaking may place himself in such a position that the law will impose upon him a duty to perform his contractual undertaking in such manner that third persons \u2014 strangers to the contract \u2014 will not be injured thereby; Prosser, Torts (2d ed. 1955), \u00a785, pp. 514-519. It is not the contract per se which creates the duty; it is the law which imposes the duty because of the nature of the undertaking in the contract. If a person undertakes by contract to make periodic examinations and inspections of equipment, such as elevators, he should reasonably foresee that a normal and natural result of his failure to properly perform such undertaking might result in injury not only to the owner of the equipment but also third persons, including the owner\u2019s employees: Bollin v. Elevator Construction &, Repair Co., 361 Pa. 7, 17, 18, 63 A. 2d 19 and cases therein cited. The orbit of Otis\u2019 duty to third persons is measured by the nature and scope of his contractual undertaking with Sperling and, if, as presently appears, Otis undertook to inspect the elevator at regular intervals, and, if the elevator was in a defective or dangerous condition discoverable by reasonable inspection, Otis would be liable to third persons, regardless of any privity of contract, who might be injured by Otis\u2019 failure to properly perform its contractual undertaking of inspection. Such principle finds support in reason, justice and precedent: [citing cases].\u201d\nThis theory of recovery was rejected by the courts in Mays, supra, and Adcooo, supra, on the ground that the contracts involved there merely gave the carrier the license to inspect, and did not impose a duty upon the carrier. Appellant here alleged that the instant contract does impose a duty. At this stage, it cannot be determined that the instant case does not fall within the Evans v. Otis Elevator Oo. line of cases, and for that additional reason, a cause of action has been stated.\nI would thus reverse the order sustaining the preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, and would permit the plaintiff to go to trial.\nMr. Justice Roberts joins in this dissent.\nAct of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-1025.\nThe cases are set forth in the majority opinion, at footnotes 2, 3, and 5,\nGlobe Indemnity Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 138 F. 2d 180 (3d Cir. 1943); Rehrer v. Service Trucking Co., 112 F. Supp. 24 (D.C. Del. 1953), construing Pennsylvania Law; Neal v. B. R. & P. Rwy. Co., 103 Pa. Superior Ct. 218, 158 Atl. 305 (1931).\nI might point out that the carrier argued that employees of employers who did not utilize private insurers (i.e., who self-insured or insured with the State Fund) would be discriminated against. While I cannot accept this contention either, it is apparent that the carrier is arguing out of both sides of its mouth.\nParagraphs 6, 7 and 8 of the amended complaint allege:\n\u201c6. At or about the said time and place and on different dates prior thereto, the defendant, The Travelers Insurance Company, saw fit, as part of its Workmen\u2019s Compensation contract with the Reynolds Metal Company, to have its inspectors, investigators and other safety engineers inspect the various machines and other implements of production at the Reynolds Metal Company in order to evaluate the safety factor of same and also to give advice concerning the safety devices which might be used to decrease the amount of risk involved under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation policy.\n\u201cDefendant issued a policy of Workmen\u2019s Compensation insurance to plaintiff\u2019s employer and undertook by affirmative actions on. the part of its agents, servants, employees and representatives to inspect the work places, machinery and equipment used by the plaintiff and his employer and to apprise counsel and recommend to the said employer and its employees as to the existence of all unsafe, hazardous, dangerous and negligent conditions of said work places, machinery and equipment used by the said employer and its employees.\n\u201cThe defendant, in advertising brochures, pamphlets and statements both oral and otherwise, had advised, informed and otherwise indicated to the employer, the Reynolds Metals Company and its employees, that it had undertaken, agreed and otherwise set forth that it would promulgate, institute and establish a proper safety program with proper safety procedures and methods, including warnings on the premises of the plaintiff\u2019s employer in and about the work places used by various employees of the Reynolds Metals Company, and that it would make any and all necessary inspections of the premises, or places, machinery and equipment used by the said employer, the Reynolds Metals Company, and its employees in order to properly institute, establish and install a workable safety program and recommend and install proper protective devices and periodic inspection programs in order to make safe the work places, machines and equipment on the premises of the Reynolds Metals Company in order to minimize, reduce and eliminate accidents upon the premises.\n\u201cTo implement and supplement the program initiated by the defendant on the premises of the Reynolds Metals Company, defendant used technically trained safety experts and conducted a safety engineering department for this purpose and for compliance with the duty it had undertaken with respect to the Reynolds Metals Company, its Workmen\u2019s Compensation policy holder, and to its employees concerning safety. Surveys and inspections were made prior to the date of the accident in the instant case at or about the machinery on which plaintiff was injured and, although the duty and obligation of the defendant to plaintiff was clearly defined by its program, safety devices on and about the machine on which plaintiff was injured, were not, through the negligence of the defendant, recommended, although it was patently clear and obvious that the exposed moving gears, parts and, more particularly, those on which plaintiff was injured, constituted a danger to the employee operating the machine in question. It was also clear that the safety buttons on the existing machine in question were inadequate, ill-placed and ineffective. Defendant again breached its duty to the employee in negligently failing to recommend changes regarding the same.\n\u201cDefendants thereby failed negligently to adhere to and to comply with the standards and the obligation and duty which it had undertaken with respect to the plaintiff employee.\n\u201c7. That, because of this program instituted by defendant, the said defendant foresaw the various dangers to the plaintiff and in endeavoring to eliminate said dangers and other dangers, defendant thereby assumed a legal duty to the plaintiff in the development of the safety techniques, devices, etc. as used in its program. Having undertaken this program, defendant recognized it as necessary to the protection of plaintiff\u2019s person and things.\n\u201c8. Recognizing the aforementioned, defendant failed to exercise reasonable care and judgment in addition to tbe allegations of negligence listed below in correcting the obvious dangerous conditions or in ordering and directing them to be corrected, and in not warning the plaintiff who, because of the safety program, advertisements, etc., relied upon the defendant and its program for his safety.\n\u201cHaving undertaken the said program, and having not warned plaintiff or otherwise corrected the conditions which were obviously dangerous for the protection of the plaintiff, the defendant thereby increased the risk of harm to the plaintiff who, knowing of the program, had relied on defendant\u2019s expertise, inspections and recommendations, etc. for his safety.\" (Emphasis ours)",
