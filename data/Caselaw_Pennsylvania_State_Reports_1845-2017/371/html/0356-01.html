Plaintiff brought a Bill in equity (1) to restrain the Secretary of Highways and the Commissioner of State Police from interfering with the passage of their combined truck tractors and semi-trailers and (2) to compel the Secretary of Highways to issue to plaintiff a special hauling permit for overweight cargo. The Secretary of Highways refuses to issue a special permit if, as in this case, the load is built-up or is capable of dismemberment. Defendants filed preliminary objections which were sustained by the trial Court in an able opinion written by President Judge Bhaham; the plaintiff’s bill was dismissed.</p>

The Code also limits the axle weight and the wheel weight of a combined truck tractor and semi-trailer, as well as the separate gross weight of a truck tractor and of a semitrailer in order to distribute the weight or load so as to safeguard the highways and bridges of this Commonwealth.</p>

This would enable plaintiff with a “W” truck tractor and a <em>2 </em>axle semi-trailer to have a combined gross weight of 49,000 pounds; a “Y” truck tractor with a <em>2 </em>axle semi-trailer to have a combined gross weight of 53,000 pounds; and a “Z” truck tractor with a 2 axle semi-trailer to have a combined gross weight of 56,000 pounds; plus In each case a 5% toleration allowance.</p>

To avoid this conclusion, plaintiff contends that §903(g) must be construed in conjunction (a) with other pro<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>visions of The Vehicle Code which, as we have seen fix <em>separate </em>gross weights for truck tractors and for semitrailers and (b) with The Tractor Code which was likewise passed by the Legislature on May 1, 1929 (P.L. 1005, 75 P.S. 861). We find no merit in these contentions. The provisions of §903 (g) are directly and expressly applicable to a combined truck tractor and semi-trailer vehicle and are not in conflict with any other part of The Vehicle Code or with any provision of The Tractor Code.</p>
    <p id="b388-4" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[268,908,1160,1050]]]'>The Tractor Code does not contain a clear definition of a “tractor”. However, its nature and character and use are well known to farmers, manufacturers and the public generally — its large wheels, often with cleats, metal tires or caterpillar treads, the caterpillar or crawler type of vehicle, its customary use and its very low speed, clearly differentiate a tractor from a truck or truck tractor. There is no semi-trailer provided for under The Tractor Code but there is a trailer with two wheels and one axle which is very nearly, if not exactly, the same thing as the so-called semi-trailer under The Vehicle Code. Not only is a truck tractor by nature, type, characteristics, customary use, speed and definition, very different from a tractor, but <em>the combination </em>of a truck tractor and semi-trailer provided for under The Vehicle Code is, by its combined characteristics, use, speed and effect on the highways, very different from a combination of a tractor and a trailer which are <em>separately </em>provided for under The Tractor Code.</p>

The trial Court correctly concluded that the effect of such an interpretation would be to apply the combined load of 45,000 pounds only to out of state unregistered truck <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>tractors and semi-trailers, and if so, this would amount to discrimination against interstate commerce and would violate the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution: <em>Morris v.

To overcome this difficulty, plaintiff contends that §903 (g) applies to (hut only to) all unregistered vehicles, whether engaged in intrastate or interstate commerce or both, and whether owned by residents or non-residents of Pennsylvania. We find nothing in the character of the vehicles or in any surrounding circumstances or in the language of the Act to support this contention.</p>
