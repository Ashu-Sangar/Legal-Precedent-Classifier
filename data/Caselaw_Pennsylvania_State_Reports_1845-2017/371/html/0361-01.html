The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $20,000.00, which was reduced by the trial Court to $14,000.00.

He testified that thereafter there were days when he would be unable to work. He had no medical expenses. The parties have stipulated that the earnings lost by the plaintiff as a result of Ms injuries amounted to fl,-000.00. Two of the three doctors testified that there was still tenderness and some slight muscle spasm in the lower back, and that plaintiff had objective evidence of a sprain of this area.

He told me to put hot applications on it and rub it.” Plaintiff testified that his back still gives him pain at times, especially when bending or lifting, and quite often the thigh gets sort of numb. Plaintiff also testified that he was not able to perform his work as readily as before the accident, and that he can’t throw a switch like he used to, or help his wife around the home as he did before his injury. A witness for the defendant testified that plaintiff was always a slow worker and that he couldn’t notice any difference in the way he worked after than the way he worked before the accident.

While the amount of $14,000 is a substantial one, it must be regarded in the light of conditions of today and not of yesteryear. One must consider today the purchasing power of any given sum rather than its figural magnitude.

The majority opinion states that the plaintiff “had no medical expenses.” This is due not to slightness of the injuries sustained but to the fact that the plaintiff, as a railroad employe, was entitled to medical care from the railroad company’s physicians without expense to him. Plaintiff and defendant counsel stipulated that the plaintiff’s lost wages amounted to $1,000. On the day of the accident the plaintiff was removed to the hospital for emergency treatment and then returned to his home. For the following fifty days he was taken back and forth between his home and the dressing station for treatment and observation. During this period he had X-rays taken at the South Side Hospital, and he was also treated by bis family physician, Dr. Schrack. Dr. C. C. Yount related the plaintiff’s account of his injuries as follows: “Patient complained of discomfort in the lumbar area, the low lumbar area, that’s down near the fifth lumbar, between the fifth lumbar and the sacrum. He had difficulty in turning over in bed or in any torsion movements. Complained of some numbness in the right lower extremity, posterior surface, that is the back surface, to just below the knee hut did not go to the foot or ankle. The discomfort was most marked on stooping and getting up and down off the car, railroad car, which he said was necessary for him to do in his daily work.

Dr. Francis J.

Q. Tell us about swinging on and off the trains when they are moving. Is that the normal way you brakemen do? A.

A man’s services around the house have been so much a subject for light humor and cartoon that the seriousness and efficacy of his domestic toil does not always receive the acknowledgment it deserves. The difference between a bare abode and a comfortable home depends to a great extent on the householder’s skill with hammer, saw, hoe, mower, rake and paint brush. And if a man is so injured that he cannot perform his physical domiciliary duties he has been deprived of something which is as definitely a loss as a paring down of earnings. Mrs. Duffy, the plaintiff’s wife, testified that prior to the accident her husband did the heavy work around the house, such as painting, washing walls, repairing, mowing and washing windows, but that Ms disability now impedes him in this endeavor and she cannot do the work because of an operation she has undergone.
