The one time that the question was squarely presented, it was intentionally not passed upon and the appeal was disposed of on the merits which, of course, it could not rightly have been had the appealed order not been legally appealable : see <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Company v.

A- review of the bases will so- Confirm. In <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Driscoll, </em>supra, which the appellee cites, the appeal in a preliminary injunction proceeding was taken after ah order con<a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>tinuing the injunction had been entered. As the report shows, — “The right to appeal was challenged by appellee in a motion to quash . . . [for the] reasons . . . that as the appeal was from the order continuing the injunction ... it was from an interlocutory decree and the questions that might be raised on appeal from the granting of the preliminary injunction were thus waived . . . .” In reply, the appellants contended that “the appeal is from the refusal of the court below to dissolve the preliminary injunction . . . [which] is equivalent to the granting of a preliminary injunction. . . . They also argue [d] that in any event the appeal [was] good from the order continuing the preliminary injunction.” With the appellate jurisdiction thus directly challenged, this court declined to decide the question, saying (p. 100), — “However, we will not at this time decide the motion to quash.” Not only did the <em>Driscoll </em>case not decide that an appeal from a preliminary injunction does not lie after an order continuing the injunction has been entered, but the necessary and logical implication from the disposition made of the appeal in that case is to exactly opposite effect, for, as already stated, such was the type of appeal entertained in the <em>Driscoll </em>case and it was disposed of on the merits.</p>
    <p id="b329-4" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[179,1751,1150,653]],["BL_330.1",330,[263,351,1156,99]]]'>The further statement in the <em>Driscoll </em>case that “The Act of February 14, 1866, P. L. 28, permitting appeals from the granting of preliminary injunctions did not provide for appeal from an order continuing a preliminary injunction” is true, hut it does not justify an inference that an appeal from the granting of a preliminary injunction does not lie after an order continuing the injunction has been entered. What the Act of 1866 conferred was a right of appeal from the <em>granting </em>of a preliminary injunction and nowhere does that statute provide or even intimate that such right of appeal vanishes upon the entry of an order eontinu<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>ing the injunction. The appeal is at all times from the granting of the preliminary injunction.</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[259,461,1160,1650]]]'>Nor do the cases cited in <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Driscoll, </em>supra, hold that an appeal under the Act of 1866 from a preliminary injunction does not lie after an order continuing the injunction has been entered. Por example, in <em>Transue v. Gregorashczuk, </em><a href="/pa/295/0529-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="295 Pa. 529" data-case-ids="1115105" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0529-01">295 Pa. 529</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%20532" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="145 A. 532">145 A. 532</a>, while it was said that the appeal was from the order continuing a preliminary injunction, which was not appealable, the appeal was actually treated as being “from the granting of a preliminary injunction” and was disposed of on the merits. In short, the appeal was not quashed as it should have been had it been taken from an unappealable order. In <em>Chiswell v. Campbell, </em><a href="/pa/296/0228-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="296 Pa. 228" data-case-ids="1116644" data-case-paths="/pa/296/0228-01">296 Pa. 228</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=145%20A.%20817" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="145 A. 817">145 A. 817</a>, where a preliminary injunction had been granted and continued, the appeal was quashed as being too late, having been taken more- than eighteen months- after the decree -granting the injunction. What was there said respecting an appeal from an order continuing a preliminary injunction was obviously a dictum. <em>Drum v. </em>Dinkelacker, <a href="/pa/262/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="262 Pa. 392" data-case-ids="1044418" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0392-01">262 Pa. 392</a>, 394, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.%20509" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="105 A. 509">105 A. 509</a>, was another case where the appeal from a preliminary injunction was taken <em>too late </em>to be effective. As the opinion in that case states, the appeal was taken more than two years after the granting of the injunction although “six months [was then] the limit of time for appealing: Section 4 of the Act of May 19, 1897, P. L. 67.” It was also correctly said in the <em>Drum </em>case, supra, that “no Act of Assembly allows-an appeal from a refusal to dissolve” an injunction previously granted. But, no such appeal is involved here.</p>

This court properly reversed. What was there said about a dismissal of a motion to dissolve a preliminary injunction being unappealable was correct but has no bearing whatsoever on the question with which we are now concerned. <em>Holden v. Llewellyn, </em><a href="/pa/262/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="262 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1044564" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0400-01">262 Pa. 400</a>, 403, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.%20639" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="105 A. 639">105 A. 639</a>, merely repeated what had been contemporaneously said in <em>Drum v. Dinkelaeker, </em>supra, about an order continuing a preliminary injunction not being appealable which, of course, it is not. Our present question is whether the granting of a preliminary injunction remains appealable by virtue of the Act of 1866 after an order continuing the injunction has been entered. The case of <em>Caflisch v. Logue, </em><a href="/pa/216/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="216 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="950365" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0146-01">216 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.%2031" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="65 A. 31">65 A. 31</a>, is <em>sui generis. </em>The quashing of the appeal in that case was apparently because the lower court had done no more than continue the initial hearing on the preliminary injunction in order “to give counsel for plaintiffs an opportunity to file their answer.” There is nothing in the case to suggest that an appeal from the granting of a preliminary injunction cannot be taken after an order continuing the injunction has been entered. Nor is any rational basis apparent for so holding.</p>
    <p id="b331-3" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[193,1651,1151,709]],["BL_332.1",332,[248,314,1156,539]]]'>Indeed, if the right of appeal be held not to exist in such contingency, there would seem to be no time when the granting of a preliminary injunction can be appealed. In <em>United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America v. Sherman, </em><a href="/pa/352/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="352 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="464081" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0133-01">352 Pa. 133</a>, 134, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20860" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="41 A.2d 860">41 A. 2d 860</a>, where an appeal from a preliminary injunction was taken within the five-day period preceding the day fixed by the court for a hearing on a motion to continue the injunction, we dismissed the appeal as being premature because it “. . . rendered impossible the hearing fixed by the court pursuant to Equity Rule No. 38 . . . The merit of this ruling seems obvious. A hearing on a motion to continue a preliminary in<a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>junction within five days of its issuance is an integral part of the procedure for granting such an injunction without notice. When the hearing is had, it may be that the injunction will not be continued, in which event the defendant would have no reason to appeal. Consequently, awaiting the hearing at the end of the five-day period, before appealing, not only aids in the avoidance of unnecessary appeals and expenses but may actually expedite a prompter dissolution of the injunction which is what an aggrieved defendant desires.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[246,864,1157,486]]]'>Our conclusion is that, while an appeal taken from the granting of a preliminary injunction prior to the initial hearing on a motion to continue the injunction is premature <em>(United Electrical </em>case, supra), the right of such appeal, as conferred by the Act of 1866, is unaffected by the entry of an order continuing the injunction and endures for the period of time allowed by law for an appeal in an equity proceeding. Accordingly the appellee’s motion to quash is denied.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[244,1360,1156,983]],["BL_333.1",333,[201,319,1152,1036]]]'>Before treating with the appeal on the merits, there is a further technical matter to be considered. The defendants contended in the court below and contend here that the bill of complaint was so deficient in its averments as to be incapable of supporting the grant of a preliminary injunction. After this appeal was taken, the matter was proceeded with in the court below as is permitted by the Act of 1866, supra. At the hearing on April 17th the lower court allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint; and, at the argument of this appeal on May 29th last, the plaintiff asked permission to file, and has since filed, a petition for leave to conform the copy of the bill of complaint in the appeal record with the amended complaint now on file in the court below. The defendants filed a responsive answer and denied a right to amend the lower court record in this court. While an appeal under the Act of 1866 does not operate as a supersedeas or sus<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>pend the proceedings in the original suit, we do not think enlargement of the record in this court in order to include therein amendments made below subsequent to the taking of the appeal would be justified. In <em>Surco Products, Inc., v. Kieszek, </em><a href="/pa/367/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="367 Pa. 516" data-case-ids="1228463" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0516-01">367 Pa. 516</a>, 522, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20842" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="80 A.2d 842">80 A. 2d 842</a>, it was held that the absence of a jurisdictional requisite to the grant of a preliminary injunction (see <em>Baur v. Wilkes-Barre Light Co., </em><a href="/pa/259/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="259 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1038303" data-case-paths="/pa/259/0117-01">259 Pa. 117</a>, 122, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.%20430" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="102 A. 430">102 A. 430</a>) could not be supplied by action subsequent to the taking of an appeal from the injunctive order. And, while averments insufficient to support the cause of action pleaded are not jurisdictional deficiencies, orderly procedure requires that the action appealed from stand or fall on the record whereon the court below acted in entering the appealed order or decree. So far as the bill of complaint is material to our review of the action taken by the court beloAV, we shall accordingly confine ourselves to the bill as originally filed.</p>
