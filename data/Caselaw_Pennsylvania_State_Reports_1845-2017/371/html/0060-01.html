There, the floor had been made slippery because of snow, water and slush tracked in by patrons. The defendant’s employes mopped up the floor from time to time but did not do so for an hour and a half prior to the accident. The Supreme Court, affirming the verdict for the plaintiff said: “The floor of the store was covered with smooth linoleum which had, as one witness described it, ‘a slippery disposition.’ It is a matter open to common observation that many stores have floor coverings of rubber or other materials which are proof against slipping. It was shown that it was defendant’s practice in bad weather to strew either an anti-slip compound or sawdust on the floor, to prevent slipping. This indicates that defendant was aware of a floor condition which might cause injury to its customers. That this condition could have been obviated by comparatively inexpensive attention is too clear to require argument. If a combination of a ‘smooth linoleum’ with Avater or snow produced a slippery condition at a place where invitees had occasion to walk, sometimes, as in the instant case, with packages in their arms or hands, it Avas defendant’s duty to correct that condition.”</p>

These are situations that jurors are familiar with, and I do not understand a refusal to submit to a jury any situation resulting from the common denominator of everyday experience. If the Horn and Hardart Baking Company exercised every reasonable precaution, or if it should develop that the steps in question were not wet at all, the jury", under proper instructions from the <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>court, reinforced by argument from defendant’s counsel, would so find, and the plaintiff would have failed to establish her case. But it does not comport with my idea of modern justice to say that the accident <em>could not have happened </em>in the manner described by the plaintiff’s witnesses when there is no evidence that it could have happened in any other way, except the “evidence” of sheer hypothesis and guessing.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[246,777,1155,648]]]'>In entering the nonsuit against the plaintiff, the lower court said that before there can be a recovery in a case of this kind there “must be an obviously dangerous condition.” But this observation slips on the wet steps of a faulty logic. For if the condition were obviously dangerous, the plaintiff could not possibly recover because she would then be charged with contributory negligence. It was the very latent and lurking quality of the slipperiness which lured the plaintiff to her injury and produced the responsibility of the defendant, since the instrumentality was under its exclusive control and within its immediate supervision.</p>
