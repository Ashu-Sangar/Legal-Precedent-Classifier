Typical excerpts from legal text-books follow: “. . . beginnings [of a tort action for abuse of legal procedure in criminal prosecutions] are somewhat obscure, but it was coming into use in Elizabeth’s reign and eventually became known as the action for malicious prosecution. Its progress was gradual, for it had to make its way between two competing principles, — the freedom of action that every man should have in bringing criminals to justice and the necessity for checking lying accusations of innocent people. For some time the Judges oscillated between apprehension of scaring off a just accuser and fear of encouraging a false one; but Savile v. Roberts (1698) put the action on a firm basis and indeed it is so much hedged about with restrictions and the burden of proof upon the plaintiff is so heavy that no honest prosecutor is ever likely to be deterred by it from doing his duty. It is notable how rarely an action is brought at all, much less a successful one, for this tort.” Winfield, Law of Tort (1948) p. 610.</p>
    <p id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[247,1662,1157,599]]]'>“There is no other cause of action which is more carefully guarded. Unfortunate defendants who are wrongfully subjected to the judicial process must bear that risk except in the most extreme cases. When such a defendant in turn becomes plaintiff he has an uphill fight to maintain his suit. . . . Strict, uniform, and expert rulings are at a premium in these cases. Judges play a dominating part in handling them. ‘Questions of law’ and ‘questions of fact’ take on different hues here from that found in most other cases.” Green, Judge and Jury (1930) p. 338.</p>

Most of the thefts occurred during the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. On June 29, 1947, at about 10:35 p.m., Sergeant Frantz of the Railroad Police, saw a man dressed in khaki cross the freight yard, go to some high grass, pick up a package and place it in a pick-up truck. Because Frantz was on foot and about 500 feet away, he was unable to follow the truck. On the same night, at about 4:30 a.m., Frantz discovered that the seal on a freight car had been broken and that three blowtorches were missing from inside the car. The Railroad Police made no progress in solving the crimes until July 13, 1947, when Sergeant Frantz and another railroad policeman discovered that another railroad car had been entered and a quantity of T-shirts removed. A check was then made of the employes’ automobiles and the T-shirts were found in a car owned by Harry Kurtz, one of defendant’s employes. When Kurtz returned to his car, he was questioned and then taken to the office of the captain of the Railroad Police (Captain Monaghan). Kurtz admitted the theft of the T-shirts and also of the blowtorches. Kurtz stated that one McCall and another man whose name he did not remember but whom he described as about “five, feet eleven and 177 pounds” and who wore khaki clothes, were his accomplices. At the request of Captain Monaghan, a state policeman (Sergeant Funk) was assigned to the case. <em>McCall </em>was then questioned and placed under arrest. One of <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>the missing blowtorches was discovered at McCall’s home. When questioned by Funk, McCall stated that he, Miller (plaintiff) and Kurtz (all were employes of defendant working together as a team of brakemen on the same evening shift) had taken the blowtorches from the railroad car. When McCall was taken to the Pennsylvania State Police barracks, he repeated his allegations that Miller and Kurtz also “took a torch from this car.” His statement, taken in the presence of Sergeants Funk (State Police) and Frantz (Bail-road Police), was reduced to writing and signed by McCall and later sworn to by him before a notary public.</p>

A search of the house failed to reveal a blowtorch of the type taken from the railroad car. Plaintiff was then taken to the police department of defendant and questioned by the two officers and Captain Monaghan. He was then told that Kurtz and McCall had accused him of stealing a blowtorch. What occurred thereafter is summarized by the court below: “After the questioning the plaintiff was lodged in the city jail by Sergeant Frantz until lunchtime, at which time he was taken to lunch by Frantz and Captain Monaghan. These railroad officers advised the plaintiff that they had made inquiries and knew the plaintiff had the torch. They took plaintiff to his home and told him to ‘go in and get the torch.’ He again denied the accusation and invited them to make another search, which they declined to do. Captain Monaghan then said ‘If you are innocent, fight it the whole way.’ When the plaintiff was being questioned by the- railroad police at the railroad offices. Captain' Monaghan told him -they were not interested in' him, but that ‘they would like to find out who else was taldng property off the railroad.’ They promised <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>to ‘make it right with [plaintiff] if [he] could tell them.’ He denied any knowledge of the matter.”</p>

Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, <a href="/pa/354/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="354 Pa. 87" data-case-ids="467446" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0087-01">354 Pa. 87</a> (and many cases cited therein), <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20674" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="46 A.2d 674">46 A. 2d 674</a>. And such want is in no sense dependent upon the guilt or innocence of the accused. Probable cause does- not depend on the state of the case in point of fact but upon the honest and reasonable belief of the party prosecuting [citing cases]. While the return of a true bill of indictment by the grand jury may. constitute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of <em>probable cause, </em>Graham v. Noble, 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 232, 234, the <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>corollary of that legal principle is that an acquittal is not sufficient in itself to establish <em>want of probable cause </em>[citing cases].</p>

Probable cause has been defined as a reasonable ground of suspicion supported by circumstances sufficient to warrant an ordinary prudent man in the same situation in believing that the party is guilty of the offense: <em>Altman v. Standard Refrigerator Company, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/315/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="315 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="1156726" data-case-paths="/pa/315/0465-01">315 Pa. 465</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20411" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="173 A. 411">173 A. 411</a>. Plaintiff failed to sustain this burden. Plaintiff’s sole witness was the plaintiff himself. In substance Miller testified that he: (1) was previously of good repute; (2) was acquitted of the crime charged; (3) protested his innocence throughout; and (4) was not caught with the stolen goods. None of this testimony was disputed, and there was no issue of fact raised concerning the same. Plaintiff has produced no affirmative evidence that defendant lacked probable cause. Plaintiff does not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case simply by proving his arrest on a criminal charge and his acquittal: <em>Simpson v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Company, </em>supra; <em>Byers v. Ward, </em>supra. The fact that Captain Monaghan stated that if plaintiff were innocent he should fight the charge the whole way does not aid the plaintiff. Such a statement does not indicate that Monaghan believed plaintiff innocent of the charges about to be made against him. He was merely éncouraging plaintiff not to be discouraged by the evidence against him if in fact he were' 'innocent. The circumstances known to Monaghan made Miller <em>a </em>logical suspéet. -</p>

      <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>Plaintiff was the only person known to be at the scene of the crime other than the two who admitted guilt. While this is not conclusive proof of plaintiff’s guilt, it forms a reasonable basis for suspicion. Bad motive may not be inferred simply because a policeman asks two criminals whether the third man present (plaintiff) was also involved in the crime and believes them when they answer “yes”. The uncontroverted testimony is that the railroad police suspected the three brakemen who were on duty when the larceny occurred. Their suspicions concerning two of the three brakemen were confirmed. Even if the policemen were mistaken about the third brakeman (plaintiff), there was not a scintilla of testimony to show that this was <em>not </em>an honest error but was motivated by <em>malice. </em>The information given by Kurtz and McCall was substantiated by the known facts in many ways. Kurtz’s statement implicated McCall; this was corroborated by McCall’s confession. Kurtz’s description of the third thief fit plaintiff exactly. McCall’s statement, given independently, implicated Kurtz, and the railroad police already knew that this was true. To draw any adverse conclusion from the refusal of Kurtz to name Miller when he named McCall, on the theory that Kurtz had been friendly with Miller for a longer period and should have remembered Ms name more readily, overlooks the obvious possibility that Kurtz would be more anxious to shield his friend of longer standing.</p>

One night Sergeant Frantz of the defendant Railroad Company’s police discovered that the seal on a freight car had been broken and that 3 out of 12 gasoline blowtorches that had been contained in a box in the car were missing. A couple of weeks later it was found that some men’s shirts had been taken from another car, some of which were thereupon discovered in an automobile belonging to a brakeman named Kurtz. The latter was taken to the office of Captain Monaghan of the Railroad police, and, upon being questioned there, he admitted that he had participated in the theft of those shirts. He also stated that he and two other brakemen had stolen some blowtorches; he identified one of these brakemen as Fred J. McCall who was a fellow workman on his shift; the “other fellow” he described as a man of approximately 5 feet 11, weighing 177 pounds, and wearing khaki clothes. It is to be noted at this point that Kurtz had known the plaintiff, Clarence W.

McCall was arrested, Ms house was searched and a blowtorch found there, whereupon he gave a written, sworn statement to Sergeant Funk of the Pennsylvania State Police in which he said that he, Miller, and Kurtz had come upon a car the seal of which had been broken and that each of them had taken from it a blowtorch.

Nevertheless they took plaintiff to the headquarters of the Railroad police, questioned him for an hour or more, and then lodged him in the city jail; later in the day they took him home where plaintiff invited them to search his house again but they refused to do so. Captain Monaghan said to plaintiff: “If you are innocent fight it the whole way”, also that “they weren’t so interested in me; that they would like to find out who else was taking property off the railroad,” and they would “make it right” with him if he would tell them “who was stealing the stuff”. Plaintiff told him he knew nothing of the matter whatever; then and at all times since he stoutly asserted his innocence, but Sergeant Frantz swore out a warrant against him on the charge of larceny, Ms affidavit alleging that plaintiff and McCall had stolen a blowtorch “valued at $100.00 more or less”. (It was testified that a blowtorch .was actually worth about $7 or $8). Sergeant Frántz and Captain Monaghan appeared, before, the Justice of the Peace; of course, they knew nothing of their own knowledge inculpating plaintiff, and they, merely presented the written statement of McCall. .The Justice held .plaintiff in $1500 bail; he was thereupon confined in jail until the following morning when his wife deposited in cash the amount <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>of bail thus fixed.

      <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>Since defendant relied upon the statements made by Kurtz and McCall, an analysis of the testimony in regard to those statements is in order. Kurtz immediately identified McCall as one of those guilty of the theft, but he did not identify plaintiff; if he had been <em>able </em>to do so, why, haying known plaintiff for over four years, did he not name him as he named McCall (with whom he had worked for only two years) instead of describing the “other fellow” as being of an approximate weight and height? Such a method of description, so far from justifying a belief that he was accusing <em>plaintiff, </em>would, on the contrary, lead to exactly the opposite conclusion; it would indicate that he did not actually know who the “other fellow” was. All, therefore, that defendant had to act upon was the statement of McCall, and the learned trial judge in the court below properly characterized that statement as having been made “under dubious circumstances” since McCall testified that he could not remember whether <em>he </em>had named plaintiff or whether he had merely assumed plaintiff’s guilt because his name was <em>suggested </em>to him by the police. Moreover it is hornbook law that the word of a confessed criminal accusing another of participation in the crime must be closely scrutinized, and, <em>unless corroborated, </em>must be accepted with caution before it may be relied upon, since such information comes from a corrupt source: <em>Commonwealth v.

And Mr. Keene directed us to proceed with the prosecution of the three mentioned men.” The first observation to be made with reference to that testimony is that it constitutes merely an <em>oral </em>statement, and as such cannot, of course, be assumed by the court, as a matter of <em>law, to be factually </em>true.

It is only if the advice of an attorney or the direction of a district attorney is sought <em>in good faith </em>and after a full disclosure of <em>all </em>the facts within the accuser’s knowledge and information that such advice or direction is effective to disprove the existence of malice in the institution of the prosecution, and it is <em>for the jury to determine </em>whether such good faith existed or whether the advice was merely to protect the accuser from liability for initiating proceedings upon which he may already have decided; this is especially important in the present case where defendant’s police had already placed plaintiff in jail before they claim to have conferred with the district attorney. It is <em>also for the jury to find </em>to what extent there was a full disclosure of all the facts or whether material non-supporting facts were withheld: Restatement, Torts, §666, and comment (g).

McCall was called by defendant to identify his signature to the statement given by him to the police, whereupon counsel for plaintiff cross-examined him at length as to the circumstances under which he made, signed and swore to the statement and the conversations that had taken place between him and the police in reference thereto. The extent of permissible cross-examination is largely a matter for the discretion of the trial court, and here I see no abuse of that discretion. Since the identification by McCall of his signature carried with it an inference that the contents of the statement were voluntarily made and assented to by him, it was proper to attempt to elicit from him that the fact stated therein in regard to plaintiff’s complicity in the theft was made upon the suggestion of the police rather than of his own initiative: see <em>Smith v.
