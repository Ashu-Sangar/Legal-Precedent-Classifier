    <p id="b465-9" data-blocks='[["BL_465.11",465,[180,1561,1151,376]]]'>The plaintiff then obtained a rule on Kosir to show cause why the complaint should not be amended, to substitute as defendant, instead of the designation originally employed, the name of Anthony John Kosir trading and doing business as the Steelton Taxicab Company.

    <p id="b465-10" data-blocks='[["BL_465.12",465,[180,1959,1151,378]]]'>Legal principle and precedent, as well as elemental logic and justice coincide to authorize the filing of the amendment.

In the case of <em>Wright v. Eureka Tempered Copper Company, </em><a href="/pa/206/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="206 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="931790" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0274-01">206 Pa. 274</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20A.%20978" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 A. 978">55 A. 978</a>, the defendant actually served and actually responsible was the Eureka Copper Works, although the defendant was erroneously described as “Eureka Tempered Copper Company.” The lower court there also refused to allow an amendment to correct the name. Upon appeal, this Court said: “In this case there is no dispute as to what was intended and what was actually done in bringing the suit. . . . He [counsel for plaintiff] served the right party, the manager of the copper works, and thus brought that company into court, but under a wrong name. The mistake in bringing the suit was in the name of the party actually summoned, and not in suing the wrong party, and the amendment should have been allowed. The judgment is reversed with a procedendo.”</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[265,1466,1160,883]],["BL_467.1",467,[180,338,1151,554]]]'>The same principle is involved where the entity sued is decribed as a corporation but it develops later that the defendant intended and actually served with process is a partnership. In <em>McGinnis v. Valvoline Oil Works, Ltd., </em><a href="/pa/251/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="251 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="1019715" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0407-01">251 Pa. 407</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=96%20A.%201038" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="96 A. 1038">96 A. 1038</a>, the Court authorized an amendment which changed “The Yalvoline Oil Works, Limited, a corporation,” to “The Yalvoline Oil Works, Limited,” a partnership association. In <em>Gozdonovic v. Pleasant Hills Realty Co., et al., </em><a href="/pa/357/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="357 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="472067" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0023-01">357 Pa. 23</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%2073" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 A.2d 73">53 A. 2d 73</a>, the defendant was named as “Pleasant Hills Realty Company, a corporation.” Subsequently discovering that the company was not a corporation, but a partnership, the plaintiff moved to amend and was permitted to do so although the statute of limitations had then run. On appeal here, this Court said: “The question for determination is whether the right party was <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>sued but under a wrong designation, or whether a wrong party was sued and the amendment was designed to substitute another and distinct party. . . . The defendant newly named under the amendment was merely the partnership entity. . . The amendment as allowed, therefore, did not substitute any new parties upon whom liability could be imposed; the action was still directed against the entity which was Xartub’s employer, and the designation of that entity could properly be changed from that of corporation to partnership.”</p>
    <p id="b467-3" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[180,905,1151,938]]]'>The mistake of the plaintiff in this case was a natural one. The word “company”, when used as part of a name of a business enterprise reasonably suggests a corporation, and the public logically assumes, having no notice to the contrary, that it is a corporation. Where a private individual uses “company” as a fictitious name, he may deceive the public whether he intends to do so or not. In the present state of the law, there is nothing to prevent any individual, no matter how meager his resources, from magnifying his prestige by tacking “company” after his name. Whether artificial ballooning of one’s importance should be permitted in this manner is a question for the legislature and not for the courts. Our only province is to permit any innocent person who has been deprived of his day in court as a result of such deception to file the necessary amendment which will bring him back into court.</p>

That is the whole purpose of the procedure, namely that the defendant be required to answer for an offense charged against him.</p>

Although Kosir was wearing the cloak of the Steelton Taxicab Company he was the precise person involved in the accident and he was precisely the person served, through his agent employed in his very business office.</p>

Nor is an amendment permissible where the suit is first brought against a person as an administrator, executor or trustee and the proposed amendment attempts to bring him on the record in his own individual capacity.
