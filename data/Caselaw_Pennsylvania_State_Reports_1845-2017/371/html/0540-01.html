    <p id="b569-10" data-blocks='[["BL_569.19",569,[156,1513,1150,376]]]'>Defendant has appealed from the refusal of the learned court below to grant its motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial after a jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the amount of $18,000. The action was in trespass for damages sustained by plaintiff when her automobile was struck by a street car driven by defendant’s employe.</p>

In considering this point, it is fundamental that we must take the version of the testimony most favorable to plaintiff and ignore contrary inferences which the jury <em>might </em>have drawn from defendant’s evidence: <em>Davis v. Feinstein, </em><a href="/pa/370/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="370 Pa. 449" data-case-ids="1234510" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0449-01">370 Pa. 449</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.2d%20695" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 A.2d 695">88 A. 2d 695</a>. From the testimony of plaintiff and her wit<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>nesses, the jury would have been justified in believing that the collision occurred in the following manner: about 6:30 p.m. on April 28, 1949, plaintiff was traveling east on Fifth Avenue in the city of Pittsburgh, intending to turn north on Dithridge Street and stop at Webster Hall Hotel. It was still daylight. Plaintiff stopped at the intersection, signaled for a left turn, and looked for traffic in all directions. She observed defendant’s westbound street car situated beyond the entrance to the Cathedral of St. Paul at the corner of Craig and Fifth Avenue, which is two hundred sixty-two feet from the intersection at which plaintiff was turning. Plaintiff turned her car from its position astride the inside rail of the eastbound track and immediately noticed that pedestrians walking across Dithridge Street from the Cathedral toward Webster Hall were blocking her path. She proceeded across the westbound track at a very slow rate of speed in order to give the pedestrians time to pass. Plaintiff looked once again in the direction of the oncoming trolley ear, saw it about sixty or seventy-five feet away, and almost immediately thereafter was struck by it. At the time of impact, the front wheels of her automobile had already passed the last car rail although the body of her automobile was still across the track.</p>

It may well have appeared to a reasonable person that she had ample time to complete the turn before the street ear traversed the distance of approximately three hundred feet that it had to travel before reaching the point where she was beginning her turn. This is far different from the cases relied on by defendant. For instance, where the testimony of the <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>plaintiff’s own witnesses disclosed that her deceased husband had attempted to cross on a bicycle in front of a rapidly approaching street car which was only fifty to seventy-five feet distant, we held that defendant was entitled to binding instructions: <em>McCracken v.

    <p id="b571-4" data-blocks='[["BL_571.5",571,[164,1175,1151,1039]]]'>The instant case is more nearly akin to <em>Shannon v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/115/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="115 Pa. Super. 494" data-case-ids="977421" data-case-paths="/pa-super/115/0494-01">115 Pa.

Ordinarily, under such conditions, there was no question about there being ample time for him to get across before the trolley car would be at the intersection. The mere sight of a trolley car in the distance does not prevent the driver from attempting to cross if such distance would appear to afford the opportunity to the ordinary prudent person. ... It was for the jury to decide as to whether he exercised the reasonable care required under the circumstances. There is no doubt, taking as we must, that his narration is true, the jury could find that there was ample time for the motorman to stop his car when he saw the plaintiff on the track/...”</p>

This contention is based on a computation from the physical layout of the intersection that there was room for plaintiff’s automobile between the last street car track and the cross walk. It may be true that the action suggested would have been the wisest thing for plaintiff to do, but we do not believe that this Court should say that it was the <em>only </em>reasonable course for her to pursue. Such action would undoubtedly have increased the danger of striking a pedestrian, since it would have required plaintiff to increase speed until she was very close to the crosswalk. The exact position of the pedestrians relative to the trolley tracks on Fifth Avenue is not fixed by the testimony. It was for the jury to say whether it was unreasonable for her to expect the motorman of defendant’s street car to observe her predicament and stop in time to avoid collision with the automobile in plain view across his line of travel.</p>

We certainly do not condone such remarks, but neither did the trial judge. The only question to be decided now is whether the effect of the remarks was so prejudicial as to require a mistrial. The following comment on this situation appears in the opinion of the learned court below: “The speeches of counsel, of course, are not a part of the record, but it is our recollection that in the course of his talk to the jury counsel for plaintiff referred to the rising prices of commodities and mentioned that the defendant had recently raised its fares. Counsel for defendant immediately objected. The trial judge ordered plaintiff’s counsel to cease this line of argument, and also instructed the jury to disregard the remark. It will be noted that no motion for the withdrawal of a juror was made at that time. It was not until the next day that the motion was presented and refused. We do not think the trial judge abused his discretion in this regard.” It is well-settled that the discretion of the trial judge to decide whether a juror should be withdrawn is broad: <em>Bausewine v. Norristown Herald, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/351/0634-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="351 Pa. 634" data-case-ids="462729" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0634-01">351 Pa. 634</a>, 648., <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="41 A.2d 736">41 A. 2d 736</a>.

It is. significant that defense eounsel did not consider the re<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>mark sufficiently inflammatory to move for a continuance at the time the argument was made, but presented the motion as an afterthought the following day. Whatever harm resulted was cured by the trial judge’s instruction to the jury to ignore the remark.</p>
