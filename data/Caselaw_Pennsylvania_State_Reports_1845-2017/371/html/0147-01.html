Kerwin, or Sadie Kerwin, the decedent, died unmarried, intestate, and without issue on December 9, 3948. She was the daughter of John Kerwin, who died in 1872, and Isabella Kerwin, who died on March 3, 1911. The decedent, Sarah P. Kerwin, had two brothers — John C. Kerwin, Jr., who died on December 16, 1897, and William, who died, unmarried and without issue, on April 23, 1925. John C. Kerwin, Jr., who died in 1897, left surviving him an alleged widow, Mary Eisenberg Kerwin, who died in 1945, and two children — Catherine E. Snyder, nee Kerwin, and William E. Kerwin, who are both living and are claimants in this proceeding. Por many years John C. Kerwin, Jr., with Ms parents and brother and sister, resided on Sampson or Sampsonia Street in what was formerly called Allegheny, now part of Pittsburgh. Old city directories show that ‘John Kerwin’ lived at 35 Sampson Street, Allegheny, from 1893 through 1897. John C. Kerwin, Jr., hereafter referred to as John Kerwin, courted Mary Eisenberg prior to 1895. Mary Eisenberg resided with her parents at that time on Jefferson Street in Allegheny, now Pittsburgh. Jefferson Street, where the Eisenbergs lived, and Sampson or Sampsonia Street, where the Kerwins lived, are in the same neighborhood. Racial and religious differences between the Kerwin and Eisenberg families caused objections to the proposed marriage of John and Mary. In the latter part of 1895 these two young people came to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Millard R. McQuaid on <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>Spring Garden Avenue, on the North Side, Pittsburgh, and John Kerwin told Mrs. McQuaid that ‘. . . they was going to <em>go </em>over and do it up right, and asked me (Mrs. McQuaid) if they could stay at our place until they got settled . . . said they was . . . going to get married . . John Kerwin and Mary Eisenberg then went away for about a week, after which time they returned to the McQuaid home. When they came back to the McQuaid residence they told the McQuaids they were married and they lived with the McQuaids for five or six months. After John Kerwin and Mary Eisenberg went away to get married, and returned, they went to the Eisenberg home where they told her brother, John W. Eisenberg, and her mother that they had gotten married. After living with the McQuaids for five or six months, John and Mary went to live in the district known as Woods Run, or Manchester, on the North Side Pittsburgh. A child, John Charles Kerwin, was born to John and Mary Kerwin on July 17, 1898. The birth certificate issued by the City of Pittsburgh, in evidence as Exhibit ‘A’, shows the name of the father of the child as John Chas. Kerwin and the mother’s name as Mary Kerwin. It also shows that the child was born at ‘6 Woods Run Street, 11 Ward.’ Mr. and Mrs. McQuaid testified that, at the request of John and Mary Kerwin, they went to their home in Woods Run, or Manchester, and took the baby to church, had him baptized, and brought him back to his home. John Kerwin, the child’s father, attended the baptism. This testimony is corroborated by a Certificate of Baptism, in evidence as Exhibit ‘B’, issued by St. Francis Xavier Church, North Side, Pittsburgh, Pa., showing the baptism on December 20, 1896, of John Kerwin, who was born July 17, 1896. This certificate shows the name of the child’s father as ‘John Kerwin’ and the ‘Name of the Mother (Before Marriage)’ as ‘Mary Eisenberger’. This child, whose name is shown on the death <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>certificate as ‘John Kir wins’, died on July 2, 1899, and the death certificate issued by the City of Pittsburgh, in evidence as Exhibit ‘O’, lists the name of his father as ‘John’ and his mother as ‘Mary’. The testimony establishes that Catherine E. Kerwin was born August 13, 1893. John Kerwin recognized her as his child and she was known in the community where John and Mary Kerwin lived as their child. The testimony is that John Kerwin and Mary Eisenberg went away to get married in the latter part of 1895. John Kerwin, the father of the claimants, was killed in a railroad accident on December 16, 1897, about two years after he and Mary Eisenberg told the McQuaids that they had been married. Thus the period in which they could have established a reputation of being husband and wife lasted only for two years and expired about fifty-two years prior to the hearings in this case. William E. Kerwin, one of the claimants in this case, was born three months after the death of his father, John Kerwin. Several disinterested, credible witnesses who lived in the same neighborhood as John Kerwin and Mary Eisenberg testified that, prior to the death of John in 1897, he and Mary had the reputation in the community and among their neighbors of being husband and wife; that Mary Eisenberg was known as Mrs. John Kerwin and that Mary’s children were known by the name of Kerwin. On July 23, 1919, the Eisenberg homestead at 206 East Jefferson Street, Pittsburgh, Pa., was sold. One of the heirs signing the deed of conveyance is Mary Kerwin, identified in the testimony as the widow of John Kerwin. ' Mary Eisenberg was known as Mary Kerwin, widow of John, from the date of death of John Kerwin (1897) until her own death in 1945. The certified copy of the 1900 United States census, in evidence as Exhibit ‘X’, listed her as Mary Kerwin and showed that she was a widow who had been married for three years and was the mother of three <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>children, two of whom were living. The two children were listed on the said census records as ‘Kate’ and ‘William’ Kerwin. They always used the surname Kerwin. At the time of the 1900 census Mary Kerwin and her living children, Catherine and William, were living at the home of her father, Christ Eisenberg at 206 East Jefferson Street, Pittsburgh, Pa. There is no testimony that the claimants were ever known by the name Eisenberg. There is some evidence that John Kerwin and Mary Eisenberg did not live together in a continuing marital relationship. The directories for the City of Pittsburgh indicate that he lived at 35 Sampson St., Allegheny, from 1893 through 1897. Miss Ella Mangan, a neighbor of John Kerwin, stated that she never missed him from Sampsonia Street, and that he was not reputed to be married to Mary Eisenberg, and that he was buried from his mother’s home on Sampson Street.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The records of the Coroner of Allegheny County, in connection with the accidental death of John Kerwin, contain an affidavit made on December 17, 1897, by William Kerwin, a brother of John Kerwin, which states that the said John Kerwin was single at the time of his death. The application for letters of administration on the estate of John Kerwin, executed by his sister, Sarah F. Kerwin, on December 21, 1897, shows that ‘the said decedent left the following named widow or husband, heirs and next of kin, to wit: Isabella Kerwin, mother, William Kerwin, brother, and Sarah F. Kerwin, sister.’ This applica<a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>tion is a record of the Register’s Office of Allegheny County, Pa., at No. 711 of 1897. There is no record of administration or distribution in the said estate of John Kerwin. The 1900 census record, Exhibit ‘K’, hereinbefore referred to, lists ‘Kate Kerwin’ and ‘William Kenvin’ as ‘niece’ and ‘nephew’ of Christ Eisenberg (Mary Kerwin’s father) rather than as his grandchildren, as they should have been listed if they were held out as Mary Kerwin’s children by her family. The record of the Register of Wilis of Allegheny County, in connection with the probate of the will of Christ Eisenberg on July 24, 1905, contains an affidavit by Katharina Eisenberg, Mary Kerwin’s mother, naming the children of the decedent; she names her daughter as Mary Eisenberg, although she names other married daughters by their married names.”</p>

Under the facts as found by the auditing judge, appellees presented sufficient proof that they were the daughter and son of John Kerwin. The testimony by numerous witnesses that John Kerwin recognized Catherine as his daughter, the census which shows that Mary Kerwin was a widow and the mother of three children two of whom were living and known as Kate and William, and the baptismal certificate for John and other evidence support the conclusion of kinship reached by the auditing judge.</p>

In that case President Judge Rhodes discussed at great length the effect of the presumption <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>of legitimacy and rejected the contention of the appellants here. The court there said, at p. 484: “Appellee’s kinship to decedent having thus been shown, it was not incumbent upon him to go further to prove his legitimacy; it was for the appellants to disprove it, and that by proof that was clear, direct, satisfactory, and irrefragable. (Pickens’ Estate, supra; McAnany’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=91%20Pa.%20Super.%20817" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="91 Pa. Super. 817">91 Pa. Superior Ct. 817</a>).” The court continues, p. 486: “It thereby appears that the presumption of legitimacy is in reality the presumption of the fact and of the validity of the marriage of the child’s parents, once parentage is established.” In meeting the very point raised by the appellants here the Superior Court said, p. 487: “The effect of the presumption of the present appellee’s legitimacy was, therefore, <em>to place upon appellants the burden of disproof of the marriage of his mother and the </em>decedent.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b182-4" data-blocks='[["BL_182.4",182,[260,1275,1155,759]]]'>Appellants’ able counsel attempts to distinguish <em>Mays’ Estate, </em>supra, on the grounds that the claimants in that case produced a baptismal record and that here appellees did not (even though they did produce a baptismal record for their alleged deceased brother). A baptismal record or certificate certainly is valid and important proof of kinship but, in our opinion, not of itself determinative whether or not the presumption of legitimacy arises. The presumption of legitimacy becomes operative upon the proof of kinship whether such kinship is proved by a baptismal certificate, by the testimony of one who was present at the birth or, as in this case, by circumstantial evidence which satisfies the auditing judge.</p>

That case contains these peculiar facts. The claimant and her mother previously made a claim against the estate, alleging that they were child and widow of the deceased. This claim was compromised: 'The master to whom the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>claim in <em>Craig’s Estate </em>was referred found that the claimant was not a legitimate child of the deceased and that there was a legal compromise of the claim of the alleged widow and child. The mother, since she was not making a claim in this action, was permitted to testify. The Court reviewed her testimony and decided that it, together with other evidence, affirmatively disproved a common law marriage. In discussing the presumption of legitimacy this Court did say, “The question is not as to the paternity of appellant. That is conceded. Counsel for appellant argues the question here is one of legitimacy and that the burden is on respondent to overcome the presumption of legitimacy by clear and satisfactory facts. In this case, however, the question of legitimacy depends solely upon whether a valid marriage existed between the parents of the child and the proof of this fact must measure up to the standard applied in such eases.” It must be remembered that in <em>Craig’s Estate </em>the person claiming to be the common law wife of the decedent testified in support of her daughter. The master thus had available a witness whose testimony had a direct bearing on whether or not a common law marriage had been consummated, which evidence, in turn, affected the question of legitimacy. In the instant case both parties to the alleged marriage are dead. The only evidence available is circumstantial. Kinship has been adequately established. Under such circumstances the holding in <em>Mays’ Estate, </em>supra, is the correct rule to be applied rather than the above language in <em>Craig’s Estate.</em>

This burden they <em>might </em>have met in such a <em>conclusive </em>manner as to re<a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>quire appellee to rebut proof of Ms illegitimacy by any means at his command. This will, upon examination, be found to be the situation in which falls every case cited by appellees having to do with legitimacy of children rather than marriage merely.” (Emphasis supplied).

In so deciding, the Court in <em>Wharton’s Estate, </em>supra, quoted with approval the statement by the auditing judge “£. . . that the facts upon which to base a doubt <em>which appearing, must and would he construed in favor, of claimant </em>are not present in this case . . .’ ”.

The majority opinion has failed to realize that this presumption of legitimacy has been confined to and has been applied by this Court only in those cases where the child was born in the period of wedlock — for example where its legitimacy was contested because of the non-access of the father, or because the mother was living in adultery, or because there was a prior marriage and a prior questionable divorce. Where a marriage has not been established, the presumption of legitimacy has never yet been applied by this Court, for to do so whenever and simply because the parents have a child, would often obliterate the necessity of marriage. It must not be forgotten that civilized society has believed for over 1,000 years that marriage is a holy estate instituted of God; it has been the foundation of the home and the family, and the bedrock upon which the legitimacy of children is founded. The wisdom and necessity of preserving this very important pillar of society is probably the reason why our Courts have always required an alleged common law marriage to “be established by clear and convincing evidence.” <em>Pierce v.

John had been living in his family’s home and Mary in her family’s home. Why they selected the McQuaids to be their confidants is not disclosed. At any rate, they asked Mrs. McQuaid if they could stay at the Mc-Quaid home until they got settled and said they were going to get married. They then went away for a week, after which they came back to the McQuaid home, told them they were married, and lived with the McQuaids for 5 or 6 months.

There was no evidence who gave the information for the birth certificate and it is certainly not uncommon for a mother of an illegitimate child to name him after his father. In any event, it merely proves parentage, not marriage.</p>

Not even Mary’s brother, who was claimants’ star witness, ever visited their supposed home, although one day he met them on the street and they asked him to come down and see them.

The Court, in its opinion said, inter alia, (pages 533-534) <em>“Marriage is a civil contract </em>and does not require a particular form of solemnization by church or state officials to make it valid; but as a contract <em>it must be evidenced by words in the present tense </em>uttered with <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>a view to establish the relation of husband and wife and should be proved by the signatures of the parties, if in writing, or by witnesses who were present when the contract was made: Com. v.

In considering the effect of evidence offered to prove marriage by cohabitation and reputation, it is necessary to bear in mind the following language [of Justice Shakswood] in Picking’s App., 2 Brewst. 222 [1867] : ‘If a man and woman live together as husband and wife, are reputed to be such by their acquaintances, are visited and recognized by the friends of both parties, attend together places of worship or of public amusement, call each other and áre called by the same name, and educate and recognize their children as legitimate, — a marriage proved to have been solemnized in facie ecclesiae would not be more satisfactorily shown. On the other hand, a man may live with his kept mistress in such a way as to create a kind of repute of marriage among some persons; he may even, to gratify her, allow himself to be held out, and hold himself out to her friends and acquaintances, as her husband, may be a constant visitor, sleep, and often eat at her house, may recognize the fruit of the connection as his children, and manifest affection and tenderness towards them; yet the evidence may fall short of that which ought to satisfy the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>mind that there was an actual agreement to form the lawful relation of husband and wife. <em>The conduct of the parties must be such that almost anyone acquainted with them would naturally infer that they bore that relation to each other </em>.... he took over the house and continued to maintain her there .... [page 535] He lived with his parents and was known as a bachelor and apparently took precautions to prevent his friends from suspecting the contrary, even addressing letters to his alleged wife in the name of Mrs. L. Scott. The proof of the marriage consisted of the following testimony of the alleged wife: ‘Q. Now, what was said by your husband and you at that time? A. He said, “I don’t want you to ever use your name again; this is your name; <em>you are my wife', </em>and I want you to thoroughly understand that”; and I agreed with him thoroughly. . . . Q. What brought up the subject of marriage, if you can recall? A. Well, the subject had been talked over before and <em>he said that he would marry me and he </em>did . . .’ <em>She testified further that they entered upon their marriage relations from that time, </em>[page 536] Her testimony is supported by certain important facts which are undisputed and which are as follows: A child, the present appellant, was born in 1886 and entered in the official record of births and deaths <em>at his request </em>as Edith Craig, child of Hugh and Lizzie Craig, the return having been made by the attending physician. There is other evidence of acts on the part of Craig in recognition of the child as his own and in later years there was correspondence between them which recognized the existence of the relationship of parent and child. <em>In a neighborhood in which they limed, appellant’s mother was known as Mrs. Craig </em>and while Mr. Craig was absent frequently there was nothing to indicate the parties were , other than a respectable married couple. All this occurred while they resided at 1837 Mervine Street, Philadelphia, between <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>1882 and 1889. . . . During the later period from 1889 to 1913 when Craig died, the alleged wife lived in Washington with their daughter, the appellant. [Of course if they had been legally married for 7 years, the fact that they subsequently lived apart would not annul or vitiate the marriage.] During this period of twenty-four years . . . [page 537] the testimony relied upon is that of appellant and her mother and some thousands of letters [over 4,000] which passed between the latter and Craig. During this time he continued to reside in Philadelphia and visited them at Washington two or three times a month. . . . <em>While the letters beUoeen Craig and appellant indicate the relationship of father and child, this adds little weight to the theory of the legitimacy of the child. The question is not as to the paternity of appellant. </em>That is conceded. <em>Counsel for appellant argues the question here is one of legitimacy and that the burden is on respondent to overcome the presumption of legitimacy by clear and satisfactory facts. </em>In this case, however, the question of legitimacy depends solely upon whether a valid marriage existed between the parents of the child and the proof of this fact must measure up to the standard applied in such cases. The real question for determination is whether appellant is the legitimate child of Hugh Craig, Jr., and this in turn must depend upon whether the parents were lawfully married.” How is it possible to sustain the present claim in the light of that decision?</p>

The pertinent facts appear from the following excerpts from the Court’s opinion (page 293) : “Frequent jaunts from Youngstown were taken by them, some quite lengthy, and, as it was inconvenient under such circumstances to travel on- a boat or live at hotels as <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>unmarried persons, they registered as man and wife; during these times, when necessity demanded, because a curious situation would be otherwise presented, Stevenson introduced claimant as Mrs. Stevenson. Business and no doubt pleasure required her repeated journeys to Pittsburgh, on such occasions very often staying over night with Stevenson at various hotels, of course as his wife. In 1911 Miss Bradley engaged in millinery business at Youngstown. This was arranged by Stevenson paying a large part if not all of the cost, and keeping the claimant supplied with money at all times while conducting this business. . . . Whether the Ohio arrangement was for claimant’s benefit or to screen his acts, he knew where Miss Bradley was located at all times, visiting there nearly every Sunday. He presented her with jewelry, money in large sums and valuable shares of stock. ... [p. 294] Claimant had inserted an item in the society column of a Youngstown newspaper to the effect that she was to be married to Stevenson March 20th, and, after a trip to Florida and other- southern points, they would reside in Pittsburgh. . . . There appellant insisted on marriage. . . . <em>‘. </em>. . Arch came across the room, took me in his arms, saying, “Nancie, as long as you live I would not give you up, I will not give you up as long as I live; . . . from to-night on I am going to give you my name and protect you; . . . <em>you are my wife, </em>I always considered you for years as such; . . . <em>from to-night on we are married, </em>...

[p. 295] Now, ... we are as near and dear to each other as it is possible for us to be, <em>from now on you are Mrs. </em>Stevenson,” and I was satisfied. Q. Did you agree to that? A. I did.’ They continued the journey, living at hotels as man and wife, later returning to Pittsburgh. Claimant, in April, moved her furniture from Youngstown into an apartment house at Beechview, Pittsburgh; here Stevenson <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>paid the house bills, including rent. The parties were not introduced as husband and wife, except by relatives of claimant. She was known to tradespeople in that vicinity as his wife, but not to the people generally or any part of them, save as indicated. She had few guests except relatives; to these few she was known as Mrs. Stevenson. Later, when visiting Youngstown or her uncle, she was addressed by letter as Mrs. A. M. Stevenson. The reason for this is obvious, — it enabled them to continue the deception. . . . [p. 296] When it is attempted to establish marriage without the usual formalities, we should examine the professed contract with great scrutiny, and be entirely satisfied this solemn undertaking has been entered into by the voluntary assent of both parties. The mere fact decedent joined, ostensibly as husband of appellant, in the conveyance of a few lots in Youngstown, Ohio, where she had lived for some years prior to moving to Pittsburgh, is not conclusive on the question of marriage, nor would the additional facts in evidence work such results. . . .

The relationship between the parties was meretricious at its inception, but on November 9, 1925, <em>the parties entered into a formal marriage contract </em>before the Clerk of the Orphans’ Court of Fayette County.

After plaintiff learned in 1931 that defendant’s first husband had obtained a divorce and so informed the defendant, he thereupon said, according to her testimony: “I will take you for my wife,” to which she replied, “If that is the case I will take you for my husband.” He denied this.
