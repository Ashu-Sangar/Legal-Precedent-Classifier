These premises were a private residence of which the insured was co-owner with her sister Charlotte Henderson and which they both occupied. While the policy was in force another sister of defendant, Mrs. Elizabeth Quentin, a resident of Port Washington, New York, on the occasion of a visit to defendant’s home accidentally fell in one of the bedrooms and thereby sustained injuries. The cause of the fall does not appear, but there is an intimation that Mrs. Quentin may have slipped on the hardwood floor or on one of the rugs. She brought no suit in Pennsylvania against defendant during the period of the Statute of Limitations, but did institute an action in Nassau County, New York, in which State apparently the Statute of Limitations had not barred the suit.</p>

The petition set forth express conditions of the policy to the effect that the insured would cooperate with the Company in the event of an accident and a claim therefor, that she would, upon the Company’s request, assist in securing and giving evidence, and that the title and ownership of the premises were as stated in the policy. It was averred that she had violated and failed to comply with these conditions in that she had repeatedly refused to give a written statement concerning the circumstances of the accident and the conditions existing at the premises, that she had repeatedly advised her sister Charlotte not to give any such written statement, that she had frequently asserted that she would see that her sister Elizabeth was paid for her injuries notwithstanding the terms of the policy and she would help her to recover against plaintiff, and that she had often demanded that plaintiff make a settlement with Mrs. Quentin notwithstanding the fact that there was no liability imposed by law upon the defendant because there was no negligence on her part. It was further stated that the title and ownership of the premises were not in defendant alone but that Charlotte Henderson was a co-owner, that defendant had entered into a collusive agreement with Mrs. Quentin to be present at the latter’s place of business in New York so as to permit of service of a summons being <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>made upon her there and to have the action in New York instituted against defendant alone, whereas, the liability, if any, would be upon her and her sister Charlotte; finally, that she had failed to give immediate notice to plaintiff of the fact that a summons had been served upon her. By reason of these alleged facts plaintiff averred that defendant had forfeited all rights to protection under the policy, and the court was requested to enter judgment to that effect and that plaintiff was under no obligation to defend the action in New York or to pay any judgment that might be obtained therein.</p>

She averred that she had never been requested to give a written statement and if such a request were made she was ready and willing to furnish one; she denied that she had repeatedly advised her sister Charlotte not to give any written statement concerning the condition of the premises or the circumstances of the accident, or that she had frequently asserted that she would see that her sister Elizabeth was paid for the injury notwithstanding the terms of the policy; she stated that she had been under the impression that the policy covered any accident on the premises.

The court dismissed the petition for declaratory judgment, and plaintiff now appeals from the court’s order so decreeing.</p>
    <p id="b619-5" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[172,1008,1146,1320]]]'>We start with the fundamental proposition that whether or not a court will take jurisdiction of a petition for a declaratory judgment or decree is purely a matter of judicial discretion. The Act of May 26, 1943, P. L. 645, employing in that regard the same phraseology as the preceding Act of April 25, 1935, P. L. 72, provided that “Relief by declaratory judgment or decree <em>may </em>be granted in all civil cases where” . . . etc., and it merely set forth certain circumstances which would not necessarily debar the granting of such relief if otherwise deemed desirable; it provided that conditions there specified “shall not debar a party from the privilege of obtaining a declaratory judgment or decree in any case where the other essentials to such relief are present.” This discretionary character of the judicial process in such actions has been consistently proclaimed by this court ever since declaratory judgments first came into being: <em>Kariher’s Petition (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/284/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="284 Pa. 455" data-case-ids="1092095" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0455-01">284 Pa. 455</a>, 471, <a href="/citations/?q=131%20A.%20265" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="131 A. 265">131 A. 265</a>, 271; <em>Carwithen’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/327/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="327 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1176720" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0490-01">327 Pa. 490</a>, 494, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20743" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="194 A. 743">194 A. 743</a>, 745; <em>Capital Bank and Trust Company’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/336/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1195567" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0108-01">336 Pa. 108</a>, 111, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 A.2d 790">6 A. 2d 790</a>, 792; <em>Kahn v.

      <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>The question arises, therefore, whether, under the facts here presented, judicial discretion would be wisely exercised if plaintiffs petition were granted. One of the chief objectives which declaratory judgment procedure was aimed to accomplish was the furnishing of an expeditious remedy for the settlement of claims, which, in the words of the statute, “indicate imminent and inevitable litigation”, — to settle controversies which, for some reason or other, could be determined more advantageously if settled promptly rather than at some future time when they would require adjudication. In the present case there cannot be said to be a probability, much less a certainty, that the incipient controversy which now exists between these parties will ever ripen into litigation since it cannot be assumed that the suit in New York will result in a verdict for Mrs. Quentin; on the contrary, if, as plaintiff now confidently asserts, its investigation disclosed that Mrs. Quentin’s fall was not due to any negligence on the part of defendant, and that the sisters made admissions to that effect, the verdict may well be for defendant, in which case no claim against plaintiff would arise. No question is raised here as to the interpretation of any of the terms of the policy, but merely one of fact as to whether defendant failed to comply with the duty imposed upon her of cooperation with the Company; a trial or hearing now held to weigh the conflicting testimony bearing on that issue and to determine it accordingly might prove to be a wholly useless proceeding. It was said in <em>Capital Bank and Trust Company’s Petition, </em><a href="/pa/336/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="336 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1195567" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0108-01">336 Pa. 108</a>, 111, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 A.2d 790">6 A. 2d 790</a>, 792; “. . . the vital factor in the assumption of jurisdiction is the presence of antagonistic claims indicating imminent and inevitable litigation, coupled with a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be a practical help in ending the controversy: . . . . Tested <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>in light of the foregoing principles, the present petition fails to support the relief there sought. Rather it is an attempt to get the court to decide future rights <em>in anticipation of an event which may not happen.” </em>(Italics supplied.) In <em>Kahn v.
