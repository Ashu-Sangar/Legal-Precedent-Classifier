He pleaded not guilty, but after five days of trial changed his plea to guilty. He was 23 years old and Avas regularly employed in a cement factory where he earned $84 and upwards a week. The robbery was planned and executed by defendant and his cousin, John S. Frank. Frank, who shortly after his arrest confessed to the robbery, was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the plea of guilty, counsel for the defendant requested that the Court appoint a psychiatrist to examine Elliott and the Court appointed Dr. William Drayton, Jr., to act for the Commonwealth as well as for the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[173,508,1150,323]]]'>“Since the solemn choice of the penalty must be left to the conscience and unfettered judgment of the court in the light of the facts of the particular ease before it, precedents are not of great value, and decisional law cannot and has not shackled the exercise of such judgment into the bonds of stare decisis.</p>
    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[173,845,1151,323]]]'>“We are confronted with a problem of. penology: Commonwealth v. Ritter, [13 D. &amp; C., 285, 288]. ‘A court is not called upon to state, and we think generally would do well to refrain from recording, in detail its reasons for the sentence it imposes in each case.’ Commonwealth v. Levin, 66 D. &amp; C. 55, 62.</p>
    <p id="b101-5" data-blocks='[["BL_101.6",101,[171,1181,1152,881]]]'>“Penologists have recognized four theories upon which the imposition of punishment is based; namely, reformation, retribution, restraint and deterrence. The first has no application in this case; the second is incongruous in an era of enlightenment; the third is relatively unimportant where the choice is life imprisonment or death; the fourth must be regarded as an important objective of punishment regardless of the enormous amount of conflicting literature on the subject. “The real question is not as to whether the death penalty is in general a deterrent, but as to the particular kinds of murder cases in which execution would or would not be most likely to effect deterrence. It becomes a problem of determining the basis upon which to make such classification.’ Commonwealth v. Ritter, supra, at pages 291, 292.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[172,2075,1150,271]],["BL_102.1",102,[262,346,1158,540]]]'>“In applying theories such as these, we must consider all of the features and circumstances of the specific crime and the history of the defendant who committed it. A distinction has been made between crimes of mental as opposed to emotional impulse. A <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>diabolically planned murder by poison or lying in wait for some mercenary or similar motives requires the death penalty; whereas, a killing engendered for reason of passion, though with the necessary elements of a specific intent to kill, may be considered differently. Certainly a murder committed in the course of an armed robbery, ruthlessly shooting down the first obstacle of human resistance, as was the case here, demands the former penalty. The unwarranted murder of Officer Mitchell was such a crime.</p>
    <p id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[260,905,1156,427]]]'>“In turning to the individual who committed this crime, we are concerned with his depravity. The facts of this murder convince us that he is an individual who is dangerous to society and undoubtedly of savage nature. There was no reason to mow this victim down in cold blood, no occasion to fire so precipitously except as a manifestation of a savage and depraved nature.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[258,1352,1158,491]]]'>“His personal history is replete with crime from an early age; larcenies, burglaries, hold-ups, possession of firearms, and confinement on at least three occasions to correctional institutions. Although his mental level is allegedly low as measured by psychological testing, he exhibited throughout the trial an innate shrewdness and sharp perception. He was characterized by the detectives as the leader of a long series of crimes and his aggressive tendencies corroborate such a conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b102-6" data-blocks='[["BL_102.6",102,[257,1854,1156,313]]]'>“There were no economic pressures which excited this lust for crime. His work record was steady; his earnings adequate.

Mental deficiency is a fact which always should be and in this case was taken into consideration in determining and fixing the penalty or sentence. However, no case in Pennsylvania has ever decided that a trial Judge or a Supreme Court <em>must, as a matter of law, </em>reduce a sentence from death to life imprisonment because the defendant is an unstable, weak moron or a mental defective.</p>
    <p id="b103-4" data-blocks='[["BL_103.4",103,[185,937,1151,549]]]'>Dr. Drayton had examined Elliott in 1939 as well as in 1950. In his report relative to his examination of Elliott in 1950, Dr. Drayton reported that he not only examined him, but he read all the notes of testimony, some of them twice, as well as examined the court records. Dr. Drayton stated that defendant was a middle grade moron, and that he was mentally defective and a fabricator of the first water. He likewise found that he had a certain amount of native shrewdness and showed no evidence of being mentally ill.</p>
    <p id="b103-5" data-blocks='[["BL_103.5",103,[186,1499,1148,90]]]'>There is no contention by defendant or by his counsel that he was insane.</p>

The sentencing Court granted the petition and heard and studied all the evidence which defendant’s attorney so thoroughly and painstakingly presented. The sentencing Court, composed of three judges, was unanimously of the opinion that nothing had been presented to it which would warrant disturbing the sentence imposed.</p>

This contention carries the theory or doctrine of “diminished responsibility” to an extreme and would vest in a psychiatrist and not in the Courts the right and power to determine and fix punishment for crimes. Such a theory or philosophy would soon transfer the punishment of criminals from Courts to psychiatrists and would inevitably result in a further breakdown of law enforcement and eventual confusion and chaos Fortunately our cases are opposed to such an undesirable result.</p>

In <em>Commonwealth v.

I challenge that statement categorically. It can be stated as a universal truth stretching from nadir to zenith that regardless of circumstances, no one wants to die. Some person may, in an instant of spiritual or physical agony express a desire for death as an anodyne from intolerable pain, but that desire is never full-hearted because there is always the reserve of realization that the silken cord of life is not broken <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>by a mere wishing. There is no person in the actual extremity of dropping from the precipice of life who does not desperately reach for a crag of time to which to cling even for a moment against the awful eternity of silence below. With all its “slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” life is yet sweet and death is always cruel.</p>

To the extent, therefore, that one of the three judges who passed on the awesome question of life or death, actually believed that the mold of the grave was no grimmer than the cold of a cell, to that extent his participation in the consideration of the appropriate penalty for the defendant at bar was of no worth whatsoever.
