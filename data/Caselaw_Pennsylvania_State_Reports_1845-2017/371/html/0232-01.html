The court below decided that it had such right and dismissed the bill in equity seeking to restrain appellee from strip mining the coal underlying appellants’ railroad. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[247,719,1158,1159]]]'>The right of appellee to strip mine the coal depends upon the interpretation of a written document dated September 29, 1891, executed by the Mineral Railroad and Mining Company (a predecessor in title to appellee, the lessee of lands in Mount Carmel Township in Northumberland County) and the Mount Carmel and Natalie Railroad Company (a predecessor in title to appellants). Under this document (variously termed a deed, grant, agreement and release) the lessee granted the railroad company a right of way over the surface of its land to “make, construct, maintain and use its said railroad” which extended approximately 5.90 miles from Natalie Junction to Natalie Colliery. The area over which the right of way was granted is shown by two maps attached to the document. The strip of land was not to exceed thirty acres of surface, and to be of a width not over thirty feet on either side of the center line shown on the maps. The lessee’s term was for nine hundred and ninety-nine years, and the rights of the railroad company were for five hundred years from September 29, 1891.</p>
    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.6",262,[246,1901,1156,434]],["BL_263.1",263,[185,340,1152,1781]]]'>The findings of fact of the chancellor concerning title were approved by the court in banc and are sufficiently-supported by the evidence. The M. A. Hanna Company, appellee, became the successor to all the rights of the Mineral Railroad and Mining Company, the lessee-grantor. The fee title to the surface over which the appellants’ right of way extends is vested in appellee, subject to the grant in the document dated <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>September 29, 1891, supra. All the rights granted to the Mount Carmel and Natalie Railroad Company became vested in the appellants. As we approve the findings of the court below establishing title, we will not recite <em>in detail </em>the chains of title. The only question of law encountered in tracing the title concerns the sufficiency of the assignment of the rights of Mineral Railroad and Mining Company to appellee. On December 24,1913, the stockholders of Mineral, a corporation, approved the transfer of all property of the company to appellee’s predecessor, but no formal assignment was executed prior to dissolution of Mineral Corporation in 1932. To cure this possible defect in title, on March 2, 1951, all parties who had owned shares in Mineral Corporation at the time of its dissolution, viz.: Pennsylvania Railroad Company and Northern Central Railway Company, joined in an assignment to appellee. Appellants argue that the Act of May 21, 1881, P. L. 30, 15 PS 3062, provides the exclusive method by which the officers of a dissolved corporation may convey assets. Appellee contends that this is an enabling act only and not a mandatory procedure. Since no creditors’ rights are involved, we agree with the conclusion of the learned court below that the assignment by all those who held stock at the time of dissolution was effective to pass whatever title was still held by Mineral Corporation. “On dissolution, the legal title to land passes to the stockholders, and title to the corporate property vests in the stockholders as tenants in common and is subject to their contract if all debts have been paid and no receiver has been appointed”: 16 Fletcher on Corporations (1942 ed.) sec. 8134, p. 878.</p>

      <em>Miles v. Pennsylvania Coal Company, </em><a href="/pa/214/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="214 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="946018" data-case-paths="/pa/214/0544-01">214 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=63%20A.%201032" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 A. 1032">63 A. 1032</a>, but have no controlling application in this case. When this document was executed in 1891, there had been no severance, and there was none until almost fifty years after the execution of the document upon which appellants base their rights. We then have the situation where a lessee of the fee grants to a railroad company the right and privilege of constructing and maintaining a railroad over a designated strip of the lessee’s land. Concerning this there is no dispute. The litigation revolves about the <em>reservations </em>and <em>restrictions </em>connected with the grant. In summary: the lessee (grantor) reserved all the coal underlying the grantee’s railroad, with right to remove same without liability. But the grantee railroad company was authorized, after due notice, to retain such underlying coal upon payment to the lessee of the value of the coal. It is the interpretation of the <em>words </em>of the document which determines whether the <em>method </em>of removal of the coal may be by <em>strip mining </em>or is required to be by <em>deep mining.</em>

The coal is nineteen feet thick at its upper extremity (referred to as the surface outcrop) and thirty feet thick at the vertex of the V, which lies approximately two hundred and fifty feet below the rails of appellants’ road. The overburden from the outcrop to the natural surface of the ground is approximately thirty feet deep, and on top of this is an artificial fill about twenty-two to twenty-four feet in depth. Thus it is- apparent that strip mining will, require removing the earth beneath appellants’ track for a distance of about three hundred feet, to depths ■ varying from fifty to two hundred and fifty <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>feet. This will make operation of the railroad impossible until the ground is back filled within a year after the mining is completed in compliance with the Anthracite Strip Mining Act of June 27, 1947, P. L. 1095, 52 PS 681.1 et seq. Testimony was adduced by appellants that because of the shape of the vein a considerable portion of the coal could be removed by deep mining without disturbing the surface at all, and relatively minor disturbances would result from deep mining the surface outcrop.</p>

With this contention we cannot agree. The risk was assumed by [appellants’] predecessor in the mining, removal or taking away of the coal as aforesaid, which we interpret to mean <em>by any method of mining. </em>A thorough study of the terms and conditions of the grant of 1891 leaves no doubt that the parties contemplated not only surface subsidence but also surface destruction. It provides if at any time previous to the mining of the coal lying under the right of way, by anyone authorized to do so, if reasonable notice is given that a part or portion of said veins or coal lying under said right of way or surface right granted therein will be necessary for support of the surface of ground on which the railroad is constructed, or located, the coal so lying under the right of way shall be permitted to remain unmined and unremoved for the support of the said surface of the ground on which the said railroad shall be constructed. Then follows a provision for payment of the coal thus unmined and a method for determining the price to be paid. We find a further provision that upon failure to pay for the value of the unmined coal within a certain time the party then mining the coal shall be at liberty to mine and remove it from said veins lying under the right of way as if the request had not been made. The plaintiff admits (paragraph 13 of the bill) the receipt of notice from the defendant under date of May 27, 1950, of its intention to continue strip mining operations, which would occasion the destruction of the railroad. It took no advantage of any right reserved to it for the enforcement of surface support.</p>
