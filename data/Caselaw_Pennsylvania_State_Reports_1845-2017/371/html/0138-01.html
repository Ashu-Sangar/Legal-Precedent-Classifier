    <p id="b168-6" data-blocks='[["BL_168.9",168,[252,773,1154,321]]]'>The defendant was found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The case turned on whether he murdered Ezekiel Evans or killed him in self defense. The lower Court refused defendant’s motion for a new trial and from the refusal of his motion defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.10",168,[252,1106,1154,373]]]'>The important facts are as follows: Defendant had been living with Marie Evans for several years. She was a married woman with four children and had been separated from her husband, Ezekiel Evans, for 9 years. In spite of this so-called separation, her husband apparently visited her three room apartment several times each week and frequently spent the night there.</p>
    <p id="b168-8" data-blocks='[["BL_168.11",168,[250,1492,1155,868]],["BL_169.1",169,[173,355,1145,98]]]'>Early in the evening of Saturday, February 3, 1951, defendant, as was his usual practice, came to Marie Evans’ apartment. No one was there except her husband. Defendant thereupon left the apartment, but returned, according to his testimony, several times later on in the evening, leaving each time because of the continued presence of Ezekiel. Early the next morning, viz., Sunday, February 4th, at an undisclosed time, defendant came back, as he stated to obtain his overcoat. He was admitted by Ezekiel. Marie Evans was in a drunken sleep in the kitchen. One of the children, Ella Jean Evans, was asleep in a chair in- the living room; Ella May Evans, aged 14, and Albert Evans, aged Í2-, were asleep in the bed in the bedroom. Ezekiel Evans was-later found dead, lying along the foot of the bed with his head overhanging the side of <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>the bed, face down. A pool of blood was on the floor directly under his head.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[172,467,1147,422]]]'>Ella Jean testified she went to bed about 10:30 or 11 o’clock and at that time her father was on the bed with her sister and brother. “He was laying on the left hand side of the bed, at the foot of the bed”. The testimony did not disclose when Ella May and Albert went to bed, but when they did so their father ivas lying on a couch in the bedroom near the door across from the foot of the bed.</p>
    <p id="b169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[172,909,1148,489]]]'>All of the occupants of the apartment denied having witnessed the killing or any struggle. When Albert woke up he saw his father lying at the foot of the bed with a hole in his head, ran into the living room, awakened his sister, looked out the open front window and saw the defendant rounding the street corner. When Ella Jean awoke and saw her father she first called her mother, then a neighbor who lived upstairs, and then went to get the police.</p>
    <p id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.6",169,[172,1410,1149,483]]]'>The theory of the Commonwealth was that this was a cold-blooded planned murder; that defendant killed Ezekiel while he was asleep on the bed where he was subsequently found by his children and the police. The theory of the defense was that the killing was in self defense and therefore excusable; that it resulted from an unprovoked assault by deceased with a butcher knife and that the defendant could only avoid the assault by retaliating.</p>
    <p id="b169-7" data-blocks='[["BL_169.7",169,[171,1906,1150,485]],["BL_170.1",170,[270,348,1154,321]]]'>Defendant testified that when he came back for his overcoat, Ezekiel, who was a larger man and had previously threatened him and cut him, accused him of stealing his suit and came at him with a butcher knife; that he grabbed the upraised arm of Ezekiel (in spite of the fact that defendant’s árm had been fractured shortly before and it was in a sling when he first came to the apartment that Saturday afternoon); that he picked up a hammer by the cot, hit Ezekiel on. the head <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>■with it twice and as Ezekiel fell on the bed, hit him a third time, because he was afraid and frightened. Defendant also testified that at the first blow Ezekiel dropped the knife and he kicked it toward the kitchen. The testimony as to the knife, which was never found by the police, was confused and contradictory.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[268,681,1155,640]]]'>Three of the contentions raised by defendant are worth discussing. The first contention is that the Court committed basic and fundamental error in its charge to the jury concerning the burden of proof of self defense. Obviously the question of self defense was the most important question in the case; on it hung defendant’s sole chance of acquittal. The Court’s charge on this point was as follows: “Since self defense is an affirmative defense, the elements required to support it must be proved by the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, unless they appear from the facts and circumstances in evidence.”</p>
