The complaint further alleged that at the time the storage order was issued, one of the individual defendants, Edward A.

However, she admitted in cross examination that in July, 1944, she went to the warehouse of the corporate defendant at Wilkinsburg to remove some of the goods and to arrange for some furniture to be shipped to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where she and her husband were then residing, and that she realized that the Wilkinsburg warehouse in which plaintiff’s goods were actually stored was a wooden and not a fireproof building.</p>

Regardless of the language employed by the bailee, he may not avoid indemnifying the bailor for losses occasioned by his own negligence, because it would be contrary to public policy for anyone to enter into an agreement for immunization against culpable conduct.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.5",248,[201,1055,1163,1104]]]'>In the case of <em>Schell v. Miller N. Broad Storage Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/157/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="157 Pa. Super. 101" data-case-ids="1061435" data-case-paths="/pa-super/157/0101-01">157 Pa.

The lower court nonsuited the plaintiff, but the Superior Court reversed on the ground that the bailee, although not an insurer, “was obliged to exercise ordinary diligence and care not only to prevent a fire from starting but also to arrest its progress.” The Superior Court in its decision made an examination of the evidence introduced in behalf of the plaintiff and concluded that it was adequate to establish a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the defendant, which required submission of the issue involved to a jury.</p>

Accepting every fact and inference therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, as we are <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>required to do in considering a nonsuit, the evidence clearly indicates that the defendants failed to measure up to the care required by them by law. The building in which the goods were stored, having been used as a hay and feed store for 34 years, was a dried-out structure, with wooden floors and ceiling and therefore vulnerable to the tiniest flame. The elevator in the building was blocked off from the rest of the building only by wooden partitions. Open electric wires were attached to wooden joists by porcelain conductors. A coal furnace, in which the defendants and tenants threw waste paper and rubbish, dominated the basement. The whole building was equipped with 10 fire extinguishers, 2 to a floor, but no one was charged with the responsibility or duty of operating these extinguishers. After 5 o’clock at night, the building was without watchman. The fire began at 6:30 p.m. Evidence established that on the day of the fire, a truck owned by the defendants, with gasoline in its tank, parked on the first floor in the rear of the building, and it was here that the fire began. The building was not equipped with automatic fire extinguishers, sprinklers or fire doors of any kind. Edward A. Murdoch, one of the defendants, testified as follows: “Q. There was nothing to</p>

I don’t get the drift of your question. Q. There was nothing automatic to block off the fire after it started? A. No.” That the defendants were aware of the proper manner in which to maintain a warehouse was evidenced by the fact that another warehouse owned by them (on Neville Street, Pittsburgh) was equipped with modern safeguards against fire hazards such as automatic doors and fireproof means to shut off the elevator shaft.</p>

A verdict should not be directed if on all the facts and circumstances there is room for fair and sensible men to differ in their conclusions, or, as it is sometimes stated (if) the evidence is not such that honest minds could reach but one conclusion’: 26 R.C.L., pages 1067, 1069, Section 75.’. .”</p>
