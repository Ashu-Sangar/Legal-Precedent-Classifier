Sterling walked on the left hand side of the dump to find the funny books when the surface suddenly gave way underneath him and he sank through the refuse almost up to his neck. There were hot coals on the bottom and he was burned about his legs and hands. The surface appeared to him and to other witnesses to be solid and no fire or smoke or hot coals were visible at the point of the accident until after the surface gave way. A watchman was maintained at this dump. There was no testimony that the township had started the fire, or had actual knowledge that any fire was smouldering underneath the surface; and the dangerous condition was undoubtedly a latent one.

While Sterling was picking his way over the left section of the dump, looking for comic books and traversing what seemed to be solid ground, the ground gave way beneath his feet and he sank up to his neck into a smouldering fire below the surface, sustaining severe burns to both legs and arms, burns which required hospitalization for 83 days and an extensive job of skin grafting.</p>

A playground is what.the very word spells out: a ground used for play. Palmer Burridge, who over a period of two years visited the dump once or. twice a week, testified as follows: “Q.

Playing. Q. How often did you see other boys there? A.

In <em>Thompson v. Reading </em>Co., <a href="/pa/343/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="343 Pa. 585" data-case-ids="1208371" data-case-paths="/pa/343/0585-01">343 Pa. 585</a>, 599, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.2d%20729" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="23 A.2d 729">23 A. 2d 729</a>, this Court said: “Young children have no foresight and scarcely any apprehensiveness of danger. This is a circumstances which those owning instrumentalities potential for harm must bear in mind, for it is every individual’s duty to use toward others what due care <em>then </em>and <em>there </em>requires. The question whether or not injury to a child legally incapable of negligence will import negligence - to- the - owner or- possessor of the injuring instrumentality depends -on -the circumstances. . . .” Justice Maxijy, later Chief Justice, said also in that case: “The attractiveness and comparative <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>accessibility to children of a potentially dangerous instrumentality are circumstances by which the owner’s want of care is tested. If it is <em>in fact </em>inaccessible, no want of care can be imputed to its owner. But if it is only <em>apparently inaccessible </em>but <em>in fact </em>accessible to children, and the owner knows this or ought to know it, he exhibits negligence if he fails to do those simple things which would make it harmless.”</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[257,774,1155,265]]]'>The dump here was certainly accessible to Sterling Bush and the Township <em>knew </em>that it was accessible. And the Township failed to do those simple things which would have made the dump harmless to seven-year old Sterling Bush and other children.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[255,1051,1158,1087]]]'>In the case of <em>Hogan et al. v. Etna Concrete Block Co., </em><a href="/pa/325/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="325 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="1172241" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0049-01">325 Pa. 49</a>, 51, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20763" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="188 A. 763">188 A. 763</a>, the defendant manufactured concrete blocks which were transported by a small car from the place of manufacture to the place of storage. For years the children played among the blocks and rode the car. No fence or watchmen excluded them from the defendant’s premises. In affirming judgment returned in favor of a minor plaintiff injured on one of the defendant’s cars, this Court said: “Toleration of trespass for sufficient time gives rise to privilege which adds to the duties of the occupier in the maintenance and use of his premises. . . The ‘playground rule’ in Pennsylvania is a specialized application of this principle. . . Here there was ample testimony that for years children were wont to play daily on defendant’s grounds without its objective disapproval. Therefore defendant may not disregard the likelihood of their presence in the conduct of its operations ... or in the maintenance of hazardous machines or artificial conditions.”</p>
