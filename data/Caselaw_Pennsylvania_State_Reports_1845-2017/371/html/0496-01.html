      <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>By Ms will Harry Publicker, decedent, made testamentary provisions for Ms daughter Helen, his daughter Elva and his son Robert, and for their respective issue. Bequests to his daughter Elva P. Mangold and her issue, <em>plaintiffs? </em>were revoked by codicil. The will and the codicils were probated and no appeal has been taken from the register’s decree of probate. The plaintiffs, being thus disinherited, instituted an action in trespass against testator’s other daughter, Helen P. Neuman, and her husband, Simon S. Neuman, <em>defendants. </em>Plaintiffs allege in their complaint that defendants conspired to cause decedent to disinherit plaintiffs; that the husband-defendant occupied a confidential relation toward decedent; that through actions amounting to fraud and undue influence defendants were able to secure decedent’s execution of the codicils at a time when decedent, because of illness, was in a weakened physical and mental condition, indicating that decedent did not possess testamentary capacity. Plaintiffs aver that they were damaged “to the extent of the value of [their interest in decedent’s estate]”. It is stated that such value “cannot be computed exactly at this time” but alleged that such loss is in excess of $7,500,000. Preliminary objections were filed by defendants to the complaint, which were sustained.</p>

The damage claimed is the value of the inheritance under the concededly valid will. There is little which we can profitably add to the well considered opinion of President Judge MacNeille in the court below. He encompassed the problem when he said: “Under long established principles, it is well settled that the only procedure for attacldng the validity of a will or codicil is <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>by an appeal from probate. If an action is in effect a contest of a will, the proper tribunal for such contest is the orphans’ court of the county in which the will was probated. A court of common pleas has no jurisdiction to entertain an action the effect of which is to collaterally attack a will or codicil.”</p>

They argue, however, that there is a fundamental difference between an attack on the <em>will </em>which must, under the Register of Wills and Orphans’ Court Acts, be in exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court and an attack on the <em>conduct of the tortfeasor. </em>But what the learned counsel overlook is that plaintiffs charge that the alleged wrongful act was the fraudulent procurement and probate of an <em>invalid codicil </em>which had the effect of depriving them of testator’s bounty under the admittedly valid will. This is in direct impeachment of an unreversed or unannulled judicial decree of the register of wills to the contrary. In the probate proceedings plaintiffs, as heirs at law of testator, were interested parties to the probate and had actual or constructive notice thereof. It therefore follows that the present suit constitutes an obvious collateral impeachment of the decree of probate. It is a rule of law of general application that a judgment properly entered is not subject to collateral attack. In 49 C. J. S. sec. 401, p. 792, the principle is stated, with numerous citations from various jurisdictions, as follows: “A judgment rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, unless reversed or annulled in some proper proceeding, is not open to contradiction or impeachment, in respect of its validity, verity, or binding effect, by parties or privies, in any collateral action or proceeding, . . .” This Court has so decided in numerous cases.</p>

DeHaven, </em><a href="/pa/209/0187-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="209 Pa. 187" data-case-ids="936055" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0187-01">209 Pa. 187</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=58%20A.%20141" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="58 A. 141">58 A. 141</a>. In that action of trespass plaintiff, an heir at law, alleged that testator, by will, had bequeathed his estate to defendant, who had fraudulently influenced testator not to change the will in favor of plaintiff, as testator had expressed his desire to do. Such an injured party obviously would <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>be without a remedy iu a probate court. An action at law for damages against such a tortfeasor would not constitute an impeachment of the decree of probate. (In that case the allegations were held to be insufficiently specific in order to state a valid cause of action). These situations are so legally and logically disparate from the case now before ns that they merit no further consideration.</p>
