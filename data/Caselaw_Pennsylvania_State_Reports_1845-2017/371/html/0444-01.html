The Company had indicated to Sedwick where the holes were to be dug and the poles and anchor rods erected. This particular hole, 6% feet deep and 17 inches wide, was dug on De<a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>cexnher 19, 1947. Two days later, on the 21st, plaintiff was informed by a neighbor about it and went out to investigate, it having been dug without his permission or knowledge. It was in the latter half of the afternoon of a cloudy day and starting to get dark. While walking around to find the hole plaintiff’s left leg slipped into it with the result that he allegedly sustained certain injuries. He testified, although there was strong evidence to the contrary, that there was no mound or ring of dirt thrown up around the hole and that the ground seemed level at that point. The hay field through which he passed he described as being “rough and rolling, grass growed up, kind of spongy and spots of snow around in the fields.” Around where the hole was “it was all weeds and briars and whatever it was.” Other testimony on behalf of the plaintiff was to the effect that that corner of the field “was left in weeds, briar and morning-glory vines.”</p>

The complaint alleged that defendant had, without plaintiff’s permission, trespassed upon his farm and dug a hole there, and that property damage as well as personal injuries to plaintiff resulted from the negligence of defendant in thus trespassing and causing others to trespass on his farm, digging the hole there and leaving it unprotected and without barriers, thereby creating a dangerous trap. Defendant filed an answer denying the acts complained of were done by its agents or employes, but that, on the contrary, the installation of the poles and anchor rods was made by Jud Sedwick, an independent contractor. Defendant brought Sedwick on the record as additional defendant, alleging that any damage done to plaintiff’s property or injuries suffered by him were the result of additional defendant’s negligence and not that of defendant. Defendant also filed a preliminary objection to the juris<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>diction on the ground that an action for trespass to land in Indiana County could not be brought in Allegheny County. The court, without objection from plaintiff, thereupon struck from the complaint “the .cause of action for damages to the land.” It will be noted that this did not deprive plaintiff of the right to pursue his action for trespass on the land and for any damages recoverable in such an action other than those to the land itself, — in this case an entirely negligible item. Moreover we have held in <em>Bookwalter v. Stewart, </em><a href="/pa/369/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="369 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1232360" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0108-01">369 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=85%20A.2d%20100" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="85 A.2d 100">85 A. 2d 100</a>, that an action of trespass on the land may be brought in any county where the defendant can be served; in other words, that it is a transitory action.</p>

If, as plaintiff claims, Sedwick acted as defendant’s agent, there would be a hopeless inconsistency between the verdict in his favor and the verdict against his employer, since, in that event, , the latter could be liable only on the principle of respondeat superior; (cf. <em>Ferne, Admrx., v. Chadderton, </em><a href="/pa/363/0191-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="363 Pa. 191" data-case-ids="1221604" data-case-paths="/pa/363/0191-01">363 Pa. 191</a>, 195, 196, <a href="/citations/?q=69%20A.2d%20104" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="69 A.2d 104">69 A. 2d 104</a>, 107). On. the other hand, if Sedwick was an.-independent contractor, it is Of Course axiomatic that his negligence, or that of his' employes, in failing properly to perform the work entrusted to him, could not impose liability upon defendant. Only insofar, therefore, as the action, is one fox?, the' unauthorized in<a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>vasion of plaintiff’s land — that is, insofar as it is the common law action of <em>quare clausum fregil </em>— can plaintiff’s recovery therein be justified. Defendant maintains that plaintiff, Laving chosen to proceed on the theory tliat defendant was negligent<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> cannot uphold the verdict in Ms favor on the ground that it was nevertheless justified on a different theory of liability; in support of that argument defendant cites the case of <em>Kramer, Admr., v.

There, however, the verdict was for <em>defendant, </em>and plaintiff then claimed that the case should Lave been submitted to the jury on a theory different from, or in addition to, that on wMch it was presented to them. Here, however, the verdict was for <em>plaintiff, </em>and, if the complaint stated a cause of action and the evidence supported the allegations, plaintiff was entitled to recover, whatever the legal theory on wMch the liability might be based: <em>Federoff v.

The first is that the fact that a trespass results from an innocent mistake and, in that sense, is not deliberate or wilful, does not relieve the trespasser of liability therefor or for any of the results thereof: <em>Watson v. Rynd, </em><a href="/pa/76/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="76 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1038894" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0059-01">76 Pa. 59</a>; <em>Chase v.

Thus, in Eestatement, Torts, §163, comment b, it is said: “If the actor intends to be upon the particular piece of land in question, it' is not necessary that he intend to invade the actor’s interest in the exclusive possession of his land. The intention which is required to make the actor liable ... is an intention to enter upon the particular piece of land in question irrespective of whether the actor knows or should know that he is not entitled to enter thereon. It is, therefore, immaterial whether or not he honestly and reasonably believes that the land is his own, or that he has the consent of the possessor or of a third person having power to give consent on his behalf, or that he has a mistaken belief that he has some other privilege to enter.” So, in §164 it is said: “One who intentionally enters land in the possession of another without a privilege to do so is liable ... to the possessor of the land as a trespasser thereon, although he acts under a mistaken belief of law or fact, however reasonable, . . . that he . . . (b) has the consent of the possessor or of a third person who has the power to give consent on the possessor’s behalf,...” (See also comments a and d).</p>

The foot injury was occasioned by a briar penetrating his shoe and causing a puncture in the sole of the foot; after treatment this injury cleared up entirely in a couple of months leaving but a small scar. The only professional testimony as to the back injury was that of a doctor who examined him five days before the trial, more than two years after the accident, for the purpose, not of treatment, but of testifying. This doctor stated that in his opinion plaintiff had a chronic inflammation of muscles and tissue in the lower part of the back...and an early osteoarthritis. The testimony as to the causal relation between the accident and the arthritic condition was extremely tenuous.
