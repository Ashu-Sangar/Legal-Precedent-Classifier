Heizmann O’Reilly, whose trust estate is now being adjudicated, died March 1,1904, a resident of Berks County, Pennsylvania. In her will she gave her daughter, Mrs. Forster, the income from a trust estate of approximately $57,000. for life, with a power to appoint the principal in and by her will. Mrs. Forster, the donee of the power, died domiciled in California, on June 4, 1950, leaving a will in which she made the following (relevant) provisions: Testatrix directed the payment of her debts and funeral expenses; then bequeathed to the Bishop of the Diocese of Los Angeles, $3,000. for masses for the repose of the souls of herself and her immediate family; made certain gifts to a friend, Emma E. Reiner; and then devised to her two cousins (who are also residuary legatees) all her undivided interest in certain real estate in Pennsylvania. She then provided as follows:</p>

They contend that their interpretation is fortified (a) by the circumstances surrounding testatrix at the time she made her will, and (b) by the principle that an absolute gift cannot be cut down except by clear and unambiguous language: <em>Burpee Estate, </em><a href="/pa/367/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="367 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1228396" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0329-01">367 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20721" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 A.2d 721">80 </a><a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a><a href="/citations/?q=80%20A.2d%20721" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="80 A.2d 721">A. 2d 721</a>.

The law of California applies generally to the interpretation of Mrs. Forster’s will and to the disposition and succession of her property; but the exercise and interpretation of a power of appointment created by a donor who was domiciled in Pennsylvania is governed by the law of Pennsylvania: <em>Barton Trust, </em><a href="/pa/348/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="348 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1220255" data-case-paths="/pa/348/0279-01">348 Pa. 279</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20A.2d%20266" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="35 A.2d 266">35 A. 2d 266</a>; Restatement, Conflict of Law, §285.</p>

In that case the donor of a power of appointment was domiciled in Pennsylvania. The donee of the power died domiciled in New Jersey. This Court held that the law of Pennsylvania governed the exercise of the power of appointment and said (page 281) : “In order to determine whether the residuary clause constituted an exercise of the power it is first necessary to decide by the law of what state that question is governed. In executing a power of appointment the donee disposes of the estate as that of the donor, the appointment being referred back to the instrument which created the power as if it had been actually embodied therein, and it is no doubt because of this principle that it has been uniformly held that the proper and effective exercise of a power of appointment is, in the case of personalty, controlled by the law of the donor’s domicile at the time of the creation of the trust.”</p>

    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[190,1358,1154,879]]]'>Considering the will in its entirety, it is clear that the testatrix, in the Eighth paragraph, intended under certain enumerated conditions to modify and limit the absolute gift which she had made to the five charities in the Seventh paragraph. Reading the two paragraphs together we are of the opinion that testatrix gave all her residuary estate, including the trust estate in Pennsylvania over which she had a power of appointment, to the five named charities, provided that if that gift should exceed one-third of the total amount of her net estate including the appointive estate, she bequeathed to her cousins, Theodora Heizmann and Mary Heizmann, all the balance of her above mentioned residuary estate, over and above the said one-third, excluding however from the cousins’ share all property, which she had theretofore otherwise bequeathed or devised.</p>
    <p id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[190,2257,1154,99]],["BL_382.1",382,[267,348,1162,825]]]'>The charities contend that the attendant circumstances as well as the language of the will show that-the <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>gift to the cousins in the Eighth paragraph embraces only the property which testatrix owned individually and does not include the appointive trust fund. We do not agree with this interpretation. It will be noted that testatrix commenced the Seventh paragraph of her will: “All the rest, residue and remainder <em>of my estate”. </em>She does not then say <em>“and also”, </em>but says <em>“including </em>that portion of my mother’s said estate over which I have a power of appointment”. It is clear from her language that she knew the distinction between her own individual estate and the estate over which she had a power of appointment, and that she blended these two estates and regarded them as “my estate” not for the payments of debts or for any general purpose, but for the purpose of bequeathing and distributing her residuary gifts.</p>
    <p id="b382-5" data-blocks='[["BL_382.4",382,[269,1193,1161,812]]]'>The charities also contend that the circumstances surrounding the testatrix when she made her will clearly indicate that she had a strong reason tó limit the gift which she made to them to one-third of her own individual property, but had no such reason to reduce or limit their share of the appointed estate. Section 41 of the California Probate Code of 1931, as amended, limits a testatrix’s right to will more than one-third of her estate to charities if she leaves a surviving spouse or other close relatives (not, however, including cousins). The Code further provides that any property devised contrary to such section shall go to the surviving spouse (or other surviving close relative), unless there is a substitutionary residuary bequest or devise in the will.</p>

Section 41 of the California Probate Code and the circumstances surrounding Mrs. Forster when she made her will may be persuasive reasons for limiting a gift to charities to one-third of her individual estate, hut they do not exclude a desire or intent to similarly limit her gift of the appointive estate. She may not have known whether the charitable prohibition in the California Code would include an appointive trust fund in Pennsylvania or she may have had other satisfactory reasons for limiting’ her gift of the appointive trust estate. What is clear, in our opinion, is that she did limit, by the language of paragraphs Seventh and Eighth of her will, her residuary gifts to charities to one-third of her combined individual and appointive estates under the conditions set forth in the Eighth paragraph thereof.</p>

If this situation exists, Theodora and Mary Heizmann would be entitled inter alia to all the balance or remainder of the trust fund over and above one-third thereof; proper adjustments, if any are necessary, can be made in their distributive shares of Mrs. Forster’s individual estate either by the proper Court in California or by the parties themselves.</p>
