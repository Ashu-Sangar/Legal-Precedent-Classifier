The deed was immediately recorded. The defendants by deed dated <em>July </em>29,1941, reconveyed the premises to the plaintiff. The deed was prepared, signed, acknowledged and actually delivered to the plaintiff on that date at the office of Theos E. Manos, who was a member of the Allegheny County Bar and attorney for all the parties. The plaintiff failed to record this deed until July 10, 1946. Defendants on <em>January 9, 19J¡.6, </em>six months prior to the date on which their father recorded their deed to him dated July 29, 1941, conveyed the premises to a straw man, who, the same day, reconveyed the premises to the three sons and the plaintiff as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Both of these deeds of January 9, 1946, were immediately recorded. All of the foregoing facts are undisputed.</p>
    <p id="b401-4" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[190,1514,1155,760]]]'>Plaintiff came to Pittsburgh from Greece about 1922 and thereafter rented the premises in controversy for a hotel and restaurant business. In 1931 he brought over his eldest son and in 1939 the rest of his family. Except during the time when the defendants were in the military service of the United States they worked with their father in the conduct and operation of the hotel and restaurant business between 12 and 14 hours a day, generally 7 days a week, without any salary or pay. Plaintiff and the oldest son were partners on June 26, 1941 and on July 29, 1941. The family was exceptionally closely knit, although the father by virtue of old world customs was the patriarch and dominant influence in the household.</p>

      <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>Mr. Manos testified that the reason for the original deed of <em>June 26, 19J¡1, </em>from the father and mother to the sons was to put the property beyond the reach of a presently existing pressing creditor of the father; in other words, to cheat and defraud creditors. No one, so far as the evidence discloses, informed the plaintiff’s wife of her rights in the property or explained to her that she was relinquishing those rights by the execution of this deed. Mr. Manos testified that the three defendants orally agreed to reeonvey the property to the plaintiff upon his demand. The defendants denied this agreement and alleged a different oral agreement, viz., that they purchased the property for $2,100 and gave their check in payment and further agreed that each of them and the plaintiff would acquire equal shares in the real estate with the right of survivorship, although at plaintiff’s suggestion the deed was made to the defendants alone. It should be noted that the defendants had three different versions of this oral agreement. The trial Judge believed Mr. Manos, although his testimony with respect to the check being paid out of and the proceeds thereof being repaid into the business do not appear to us to be very clear or convincing.</p>

This deed was not recorded by the plaintiff, as we have seen, until July 10, 1946. It is likely that the reason it was not immediately recorded was because plaintiff did not settle with or pay his creditor in full until April 30, 1945. Why it was not thereafter recorded has never been disclosed.</p>

      <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>The defendants gave an entirely different reason for the execution and delivery by them of the deed of <em>July 29, </em>1941 to the plaintiff. There was a §6,000 mortgage on the real estate and the unpaid debts of the business totaled approximately §4,000. Their father was afraid they would leave the business and work for their uncle who had started a restaurant business in the same block. The father therefore promised them, so they testified, that if they would execute the above-mentioned deed to him, he would not record it hut would keep it until all the mortgage indebtedness and the debts of the business were paid, at which time he would return the deed to them and cause a new deed to be made in the name of all four of them. They also alleged that a confidential relationship existed between them at that time. Although the mortgage indebtedness and the business debts were paid off mainly out of the earnings of the business <em>prior to February, 19J¡3, </em>the defendants did nothing to assert their rights or to compel the performance of this alleged oral agreement <em>until January 9,19J¡6, </em>when they made a conveyance of the property to a straw man who in turn executed and delivered to them a deed to themselves and the plaintiff dated January 9, 1946, which they immediately recorded. In spite of this litigation, they still continue to work in their father’s restaurant business.</p>

The conspiracy, intentional or unintentional, entered into by these parties and the weaknesses in each of their claims made it very difficult to determine which side was telling the truth. For example, the deeds and conveyances of <em>June 26 </em>and <em>July 29, </em>1941, were undoubtedly part of plaintiff’s scheme to defraud his creditors; the plaintiff perpetrated a legal fraud on his wife in that he failed to tell her the rights she was giving up in executing with him the .deed to their children; plaintiff failed to record the deed of July 29, <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>1941 until July 10, 1946, a year after Ms creditors had been paid; plaintiff did not take the witness stand to deny or refute defendants’ testimony of the oral agreements made between him and them with respect to the deeds of June 26 and July 29, 1941; and finally plaintiff’s unconscionable treatment of his sons in employing them for years without salary or wages.</p>
    <p id="b405-5" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[196,735,1156,1491]]]'>A fair summary, we believe, of the reasons for the Court en banc’s overruling of the findings of fact of the trial Judge are (1) “Manos was an interested and biased witness entitled to little credence”; and (2) a confidential relationship existed between the father and his sons. If Manos was an interested witness it is indisputable that the defendants were far more interested; and the question of confidential relationship is, in this case, a question not of fact but of law; and, as we shall see, immaterial. Moreover, defendants’ claims and contentions were likewise full of weaknesses. For example, they swore to three different versions of the oral agreement with respect to the original deed of <em>June 28, 1941, </em>and the interest or title they were to receive. The payment which they allege they made to purchase the property on June 26, 1941, differed from the check actually given and the discrepancy was not explained; they failed to explain why, if they were entitled to receive back the property which by their deed of <em>July 29, </em>1941, they conveyed absolutely to their father, they never requested or demanded the reconveyance of this property or made their present claim until January, 1946, three years after they claim they were entitled thereto; and finally and perhaps the greatest weakness of their case is that the trial Judge who saw and heard them disbelieved their story and believed the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff.</p>

On tlie other hand, Mr. Manos, whose testimony was flatly in contradiction of the defendants as to the oral agreements they claim to have made with their father in Manos’ presence, had little, if anything, to gain and a great deal to lose by his testimony because it blackened his character and reputation. In the light of all these facts and circumstances we must accept the findings of fact made by the trial Judge which were based upon the testimony and credibility of Mr. Manos, and the lack of credibility of the defendants.

    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[239,677,1156,871]]]'>In <em>McCloskey v. McCloskey, </em>supra, a brother alleged that his sisters were given their father’s entire estate on their express promise to hold two-fifths of it, including the real estate, in trust for their brothers. The trust was denied by the sisters. The Court held that since no valid trust was expressly declared in writing, the alleged oral agreement or trust came within Section 4 of the Statute of Frauds and could not be enforced and that the refusal to recognize the agreement of trust or to convey the property was not sufficient to create an implied trust or take the case out of the statute. The Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Brown, said (page 495) : “ ‘The plain meaning of this enactment is, that a trust in land can now be proved in no other way than by writing:’ Barnet v. Dougherty, <a href="/pa/32/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="32 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="986778" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0371-01">32 Pa. 371</a>.</p>

But the only misconduct charged is that the appellees now refuse to recognize the trust, and that, notwithstanding their promise to be bound by it, they now declare they will not regard it. This is not enough to take the case out of the plain words of the statute. . . . The statute of frauds would soon become a dead letter if the mere <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>broken promise of a trustee under a trust created by parol, who had agreed to carry it out, should, without more, be held sufficient to create a trust by implication within the exception of the act. It is only when a trustee refuses to perform or recognize a trust that courts are asked to declare its existence as against him, and if a trust, which has no legal existence under the statute, can be brought into being as within the exception simply because a trustee breaks his promise to perform, no case will be without the exception. ‘The statute of frauds would be worse than waste paper, if a breach of the promise created a trust in the promisor, which the contract itself was insufficient to raise:’ Kellum et al. v.
