While Mrs. Matson was a student at the University of Pittsburgh Law School, she had the reputation among her fellow-students of having Communistic tendencies.

I am informed that Mrs. Matson is on the Executive Board of American-Soviet Friendship and was one of the organizers of the Progressive Citizens Party, which is now the Progressive Party, and which as you may recall was the organization which undertook to force the Board of Public Education of the City of Pittsburgh to permit it to use a high school auditorium for its meeting. This matter was litigated in the United States District Court in Pittsburgh, and in its opinion the Court stated that the Progressive Party was a <em>Communist Organisation.</em>

Plaintiff secured several thousand powers of attorney from United States Postmasters and alleged that he caused to be introduced a bill in Congress for payment of certain claims; that the Postmaster General, after the passage of the bill, endeavored to obtain legislation by Congress to destroy plaintiff’s contracts of employment; that the Postmaster General, in order to further harass plaintiff and with malicious intent, sent, with the payment checks to plaintiff’s clients, a letter stating that no attorney’s services were necessary and that any power of attorney to collect pay<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>ments for them was null and void.

The Supreme Court held that this declaration did not state a valid cause of action because the United States Postmaster General was entitled to absolute privilege, and even if his statements were falsely and maliciously made, he was nevertheless exempt from suit and his demurrer must be sustained. The Court in its opinion said, page 498: “We are of opinion that the same general considerations of public policy and convenience which demand for judges of courts of superior jurisdiction immunity from civil suits for damages arising from acts done by them in the course of the performance of their judicial functions, apply to a large extent to official communications made by heads of Executive Departments when engaged in the discharge of duties imposed upon them by law. The interests of the people require that due protection be accorded to them in respect of their official acts. As in the case of a judicial officer, we recognize a distinction between action taken by the head of a Department in reference to matters which are manifestly or palpably beyond his authority, and actions having [a legitimate or proper] connection with the general matters committed by law to his control or supervision. ... In exercising the functions of his office, the head of an Executive Department, keeping within the limits of Ms authority, should not be under an apprehension that the motives that control his official conduct may, at any time, become the subject of inquiry in a civil suit for damages. It would seriously cripple the proper and effective administration of public affairs as entrusted to the executive branch of the government, if he were subjected to any such restraint.”</p>

With reference to exactly the same situation as here exists, the Supreme Court said, page 499: “But if he acts, having authority, his conduct cannot be made the foundation of a suit against him personally for damages, . . . The motive that impelled him to do that of which the plaintiff complains is, therefore, wholly immaterial. If we were to hold that the demurrer admitted, for the purposes of the trial, that the defendant acted maliciously, that could not change the law.” This well illustrates the danger of extending the principle of absolute privilege. On the other hand, if, as plaintiff contends, the privilege was merely conditional, she would be entitled to prove actual malice which would defeat any claim of conditional privilege; and hence defendant’s demurrer could not be sustained. For this reason it becomes pertinent and important to review some of the powers and duties of an Attorney General together with some of the limitations thereon which have been analyzed and discussed in several recent cases.</p>

However, as Mr. Justice Stern pointed out in <em>Matson v.

The Attorney General in that case attempted to conduct a public hearing into the “alleged <em>communistic leanings, sympathies and </em>utterances” of an assistant district attorney, in which hearing the Attorney General would be the prosecutor, judge and jury. Pointing out that no crime was charged, this Court held that the Attorney General had no such power either under the Administrative Code or under any other authority. However, neither the case itself nor the quoted excerpt therefrom supports plaintiff’s position in this case. The objection in this case goes not to her general qualifications, views or competence, but <em>whether she was a member of a communist organization or engaged in communistic activities in behalf of an organization, </em>one of whose major <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>purposes is <em>to undermine, sabotage and destroy the government </em>whose laws she was sworn to uphold and protect. As the chief law enforcement officer of this Commonwealth, it was the right, privilege and we believe the duty of the Attorney General to call to the attention of the District Attorney of any county facts or charges which disclose that one of the assistant district attorneys was, for example, a dangerous criminal or as in this case, was allegedly engaged in communistic activities and request or demand his or her dismissal.</p>

We specifically hold that this official letter, being written by a public official in the course and within the scope of his powers, was “absolutely privileged”; and that even if the allegations were erroneous and false, and were maliciously made, this privilege was absolute and constituted a complete defense to Mrs. Matson’s action of libel.</p>

Yet the authorities almost universally hold, as herein-above stated, that statements or acts of high public officials which are made in the course of and within the scope of their official powers or duties give them complete immunity from legal redress. Even though the innocent may sometimes suffer irreparable damage, it has been found to be in the public interest and therefore sounder and wiser public policy to “immunize” public officials, for to permit slander, or libel, or malicious prosecution suits, where the official’s charges turn out to be false, would be to deter all but the most courageous or the most judgment-proof public officials from performing their official duties and would thus often hinder or obstruct justice and allow many criminals to go unpunished.</p>

Justice Vinson, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, said in a footnote on page 278: “The practice of cabinet officers to issue public statements in • respect to the activity of their departments is ■ too- well known to <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>require comment.

Kahauser, District Attorney of Allegheny County, concerning the plaintiff, was libelous per se. We are also unanimous as to the law of privilege which the defendant pleads. As the majority opinion states it, “. . . the Attorney General, when acting officially, and within the scope of his authority, has absolute privilege, protection and immunity from civil liability with respect to his official communications and official acts. . . . this [privilege] . . . becomes unavailable if and when the Attorney General . . . acts in matters outside his jurisdiction or beyond the scope of his powers or duties.” The cases, which the majority cite and analyze in support of the above-quoted legal proposition, are not open to question. My difference with the majority lies alone in their conclusion that, under the facts of this case, the defendant is entitled to <em>absolute </em>privilege as a defense to his libel.

Had the Attorney General been proceeding within the scope of his official duties, only the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County would have had jurisdiction of the suit against his deputies: Act of May 26, 1931, P.L. 191. Second, in a well-considered opinion by Mr. Justice Stern, we held on the merits that conducting such a hearing was not within the powers or duties of the Attorney General under “any of the provisions of the-Administrative Code”- or under the common- law.- This -latter conclusion is implicit in our answer (p. 289 ) to the argument- then being made <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>for the Attorney General that the power to hold such a hearing was but a preliminary to a possible exercise of his power to supersede the District Attorney, which power this court had theretofore held <em>(Margiotti Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/365/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="365 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1225552" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0330-01">365 Pa. 330</a>, 332, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20A.2d%20465" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="75 A.2d 465">75 A. 2d 465</a>) to be derived from <em>the common law. </em>With reference to the power of super-session Mr. Justice Steen pertinently said, — “Certainly it was never, by the broadest stretch of imagination, regarded as including the right of the Attorney General to examine into the general qualifications, views and competence of a duly elected District Attorney, or one of his assistants, as a basis for supplanting him and thenceforth conducting the office by his own deputies.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

We directly held, however, that “The proposed hearing in this case was wholly without legal power or authority on the part of the Attorney General.” Since the Attorney General “was wholly without legal power or authority” to clarify the charges of his letter of January 5th or to develop “further evidence” in regard thereto, <em>a fortiori, </em>he was not acting within his jurisdiction and duties when he made the charges. He, of course, had a right, like any other citizen, to inform the district attorney of anything he knew concerning the former’s assistants or office that he deemed harmful to the public service. But, in so doing, he was not acting because of any <em>official </em>duty devolving upon him.</p>

The majority opinion frankly concedes that “We are all unanimously of the opinion that the Attorney General has no right or power to discharge or to compel a district attorney to discharge an assistant district attorney from her official position or from duties, matters or cases outside of the case or matter in which the Attorney General has superseded the district attorney,” citing <em>Matson v. Jackson </em>and other authority. Admittedly, the exception noted is not present in this case. Since the purpose of the letter of January 5th was to bring about Mrs. Matson’s dismissal as an assistant district attorney and since <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>the Attorney General had no legal power to effect such a result, it was likewise no part of his <em>official </em>powers or duties to make the charges in substantiation of the “demand” which he did not have legal authority to make.</p>
    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.4",237,[189,614,1154,988]]]'>Nor can the letter be otherwise justified as an official act. It was no more in aid of an execution of the laws of the Commonwealth than was the proposed hearing. The plain purpose of the letter of January 5th being, as already stated, to compel Mrs. Matson’s dismissal as an assistant district attorney, the reason for the Attorney General’s effort to that end becomes relevant. He did not charge that she had violated any law; nor did he purport to be investigating violations of the law. He gave as his reason for demanding Mrs. Matson’s dismissal that “it appears obvious that her Communistic associations render her unfit to hold this position.” This reason is referable alone to the “'qualifications, views and competence” of the assistant district attorney, — -a field not open to the Attorney General even in a case where he has superseded the district attorney: see <em>Matson v. Jackson, </em>supra, at p. 289.</p>

If that be not so, then the doctrine of absolute privilege will be extended far beyond any conscionable limits and become an aid to persecution in the hands of the unscrupulous. I well recognize that, where a public officer, acting within the scope of his lawful authority, libels another, the fact that he acts maliciously does not deprive him of absolute privilege: see, e.g., <em>Spalding v. Vilas, </em><a href="/us/161/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="161 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="5701729" data-case-paths="/us/161/0483-01">161 U.S. </a><a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a><a href="/us/161/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="161 U.S. 483" data-case-ids="5701729" data-case-paths="/us/161/0483-01">483</a>, 499; and <em>Glass v.

In other words, when an officer acts within the scope of his powers and duties, his motive does not become a material consideration. But, that does not mean that a public official can deliberately publish a libel and then obtain absolute privilege by subsequently subjoining an official act in the same connection. The difference between cases such as the <em>Spalding </em>and <em>Glass </em>cases, supra, and the present is that in the former the officer <em>acted first </em>in performance of his official duty and the alleged libel was an incidental concomitant. In the latter, he <em>libels first </em>and then acts in respect of what he asserts is official.</p>
    <p id="b238-4" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[250,1071,1157,827]]]'>Notwithstanding that the letter of January 5th cannot, on the basis of any of our prior cases (especially <em>Matson v.

But, merely describing them by expansive adjectives should not be availed of to make an official act out of conduct which, under our decisions, should be found not to be within the powers or duties of the Attorney General.</p>

It is tantamount to saying that they are limitless. That being so, with the current decision of this court extant, the Attorney General (a mere appointive officer) will henceforth enjoy absolute privilege for any and all of his writings so long as he uses his official stationery and signs himself with descriptive designation of his <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>office. He can even libel Ms appointor, the Governor, with impunity. What Mr. Justice Steen further said in <em>Matson v. Jackson </em>(at p. 288) is apposite here,— “. . . we have already pointed out that the proposed hearing cannot be justified as an aid to the execution or enforcement of the laws. Indeed a contrary view would be equivalent to holding that the Attorney General is vested with the power to conduct hearings as to the political, economic and social views of every public officer in the Commonwealth entrusted with the execution of the laws, from the Governor himself down to the least important officials, including even those duly elected, in order to ascertain whether, in his opinion, they are fit and competent to perform their respective duties in enforcing the laws, — a proposition the very statement of which illustrates its inherent absurdity.” The vice of overextending by court decision the powers of the Attorney General would be bad enough if the possible harm were confined to acts of that officer, but what the majority opinion now construes to be within his powers will, to a relative degree, be among the powers of every prosecuting officer in the Commonwealth within the territorial confines of his jurisdiction. It is disturbing, to say the least, to contemplate the potential evils.</p>

That case and the present are not distinguishable in principle so far as the scope of the Attorney General’s <em>official </em>duties is concerned. Nor does the majority opinion attempt any serious differentiation of the two cases.

But, in so acting, such persons (including the Attorney General) enjoy only conditional privilege as a defense to their incidental libels. Once the libel is established prima facie, it becomes the duty of the person charged therewith to allege and prove that the “publication [was made] upon a proper occasion, from a proper motive, in a proper manner and [was] based upon reasonable or probable cause”: see <em>Bausewine v.
