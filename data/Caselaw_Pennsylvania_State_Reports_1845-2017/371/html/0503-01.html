Capozi, brought an action in trespass against Hearst Publishing Company, Inc., and Jacob Wilder to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from the latter’s negligent driving of a truck. The Hearst Publishing Company filed an answer denying any agency relationship between itself and the individual defendant. A jury rendered a verdict of $80,-000 against both defendants. The defendants together filed motion for new trial and defendant, Hearst Publishing Company, separately filed motion for judgment in its favor <em>non obstante </em>veredicto..</p>

The plaintiff filed an answer to this petition and rule, and depositions were taken. The lower court in its opinion dismissing the motions for new trial and judgment <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>with reference to the rule issued said that “. . . the case was apparently settled as far as counsel was concerned, but there is no evidence that the plaintiff agreed to anything his counsel said, and the plaintiff had a contract with his attorney whereby the case could not be settled without the permission of the plaintiff. Therefore, we believe this case was properly submitted to the jury, . . .”. As it appeared that the court intended to and in effect did discharge the rule, the parties stipulated that the appeal to this Court should be argued and decided as if an order had been entered expressly discharging the rule. The dismissal of the defendants’ motion for' new trial was conditioned upon remittitur being filed for all of the verdict in excess of $40,000.' ' This remittitur was filed and judgment was entered against both defendants in the amount of $40,000. On this appeal' therefrom defendants make various contentions.</p>

Under the rule issued, depositions were taken of the plaintiff, counsel for plain-biff, counsel for the defendants and the representative of defendants’ insurance carrier, and the contract between plaintiff and his attorneys was introduced which contained - a provision “Said attorneys shall have full power to settle or .compromise said suit or suits as may- appear to them to my best interest-, • but, in • no event, for a- sum-less-than that expressly approved- by <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>me; . . .”. Negotiations for settlement of the case had been carried on for several weeks, prior to and during the course of the trial. They appeared to have culminated in what occurred in the trial judge’s chambers when counsel for both parties met there with the trial judge. As indicated in the finding contained in the lower court’s opinion, above quoted, there appeared to have been an agreement between counsel for settlement of the case at $22,500, and the real question at issue was whether plaintiff’s counsel were authorized to agree to a settlement in such amount. Appellants make no claim of ratification by plaintiff of his attorneys’ act as in <em>Yarnall v. Yorkshire Worsted </em>Mills, <a href="/pa/370/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="370 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1234591" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0093-01">370 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="87 A.2d 192">87 A. 2d 192</a>.</p>

In support of this contention the publishing company first claims that there was no evidence introduced to connect it with any of the events or personalities involved in the accident. The truck which ran into plaintiff was driven by the defendant Wilder and was being used for distribution of a newspaper daily, the “Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph”. Although the named defendant was Hearst Publishing Company, Inc., the case was tried on the theory or assumption that the “Sun-Telegraph”, or “Sun-Tele” as it is popularly known, was the co-defendant with Wilder. Throughout the testimony bearing upon Wilder’s status either as an independent contractor or employe of his codefendant, the latter was invariably referred to as “Sun-Telegraph”. The court in its charge referred to the “Sun-Telegraph” as the defendant, at one time stating to the jury: “Now, then, the defendant says — they have two different defenses. The Sun-Telegraph, which is owned by the Hearst papers, says this man. was not their employee and, therefore, ‘We are not responsible for his negligence. He was an independent contractor.’ ”, and instructed the jury: “You can bring them [verdicts] in against Mr. Wilder and the Sun-Tele or you can bring it in against either of them, and I think it would be foolish to bring it in against the Sun-Tele if you do not bring it in against Wilder.” The trial judge at the conclusion of his charge said: “Is there anything else that either side would like me to charge on?”. Various requests were then made in which the corporate defendant was referred to by counsel on both sides as “Sun-Tele” or “the newspaper”. At no time did counsel for the defendant Hearst Publishing Company seek any correction by the court in its charge in this respect, and although he moved for a compulsory non-<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>suit as to the corporate defendant and filed a point for binding instructions in its favor, in neither case was it placed upon the ground that no testimony had been adduced involving the Hearst Publishing Company.</p>
    <p id="b537-3" data-blocks='[["BL_537.4",537,[177,610,1147,534]]]'>Defendants’ counsel proceeded throughout the trial as if “Sun-Telegraph” or “Sun-Tele” and the named defendant, Hearst Publishing Company, were synonymous or identical, acquiesced in the lower court’s similar treatment of the corporate defendant, and it would be unfair and unjust under the circumstances to now permit reliance upon this misnomer to which defendant throughout the trial subscribed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Cf. <em>Skocich et al. v.

In order to connect and impose liability upon the corporate defendant, plaintiff relied in the presentation of his case upon the presumption of ownership and agency arising out of the display of a defendant’s name upon a business truck: <em>Hartig v. American Ice Co., </em><a href="/pa/290/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="290 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="1104469" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0021-01">290 Pa. 21</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.%20867" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="137 A. 867">137 A. 867</a>. The plaintiff’s case established that the truck which ran into plaintiff and driven by Wilder, had the words “Sun-Telegraph” in large letters on both of its sides. The words were not permanently painted thereon but appeared on posters that were pasted on the sides of the truck, and there <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>was testimony that in addition to the words “Sun-Telegraph” the posters served to advertise articles that would appear in current or future editions of the paper. Appellants argue that the presumption as to ownership and agency applies where the name of the defendant is permanently painted on the truck, but that there is no reasonable basis for inferring that a vehicle is owned or used in the business of one whose product is advertised on the vehicle; that it is common knowledge that certain companies utilize their vehicles to advertise the products of other companies. We can see no substantial difference in the applicability of the presumption in question, between a name painted on a truck or printed on a poster attached to the truck if it so predominates in the sight of the passing public to reasonably permit the inference of agency and ownership. A poster may well be used to not only denote proprietorship but to permit change in the advertisement of the proprietor’s own product.</p>
    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[253,1390,1154,763]]]'>The defendant Wilder testified that the posters, which were 6 feet by 3 feet in size, were put on every week by an employe of the “Sun-Telegraph”. The testimony clearly indicated that the words “Sun-Telegraph” predominated in the printed matter so as to catch the eye. One witness testified that he saw the trucks every day and that they had the words “Sun-Telegraph” on them. He further testified that the posters covered the whole side of the truck. Another witness said the truck had big letters “Sun-Tele” on the side. A reading of their testimony shows that although the trucks had other words advertising specific articles and features in the “Sun-Telegraph”, the focus of attention to all were the words “Sun-Telegraph”.</p>

The Company shall be named in the insurance policy as one of the parties insured and said policy or a certificate thereof shall be delivered to the Company upon a receipt being given to the Owner for the same. . . .”. The contract was unquestionably of evidential importance in establishing the legal relationship between the individual defendant and the corporate defendant. A cursory inspection of the instrument clearly indicates that under its terms Wilder acted as an independent contractor and not as an employe of the corporate defendant in the use of the truck.

However, we are convinced that an application of the principles above enunciated makes it clear that the court below committed reversible error. In the present case the document was offered in support of the contention that the individual defendant was an independent contractor. The provision as to insurance was completely consonant with the contention of the defendant Hearst and in no manner could aid plaintiff’s contention that the driver was the employe of defendant Hearst. Thus the only 'possible purpose its receipt in evidence could serve, from plaintiff’s viewpoint, would be to reveal to the jury the existence of insurance. The general rule that a document must be. offered in its entirety does not, in our.-.-opinion,-apply, to <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>a document otherwise admissible which contains matter that is highly prejudicial, and therefore of itself inadmissible, unless the exclusion of the latter adversely affects the party insisting upon the introduction of the document in its entirety.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[188,619,1149,924]]]'>Counsel for plaintiff relies upon cases where it has been held discretionary with the court as to what documentary evidence should go out with the jury and endeavors to similarize the present situation because of the language employed by counsel for the appellants at the time of the offer. It is sufficient answer to say that the offer in substance was the introduction of the contract into evidence without the provision with respect to public liability insurance. The objection by counsel for plaintiff was in substance to the introduction of less than the entire contract and the court’s ruling was with respect to the contract’s introduction into evidence. No discretion was involved in this situation. The exclusion of the prejudicial portion of the contract was a matter of right. The refusal of the admission of the document into evidence with the exclusion was harmful error.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[187,1565,1146,201]]]'>Since a new trial must be granted and the verdict therefore set aside, it is unnecessary to consider appellants’ remaining contention that the verdict as reduced was still excessive.</p>
