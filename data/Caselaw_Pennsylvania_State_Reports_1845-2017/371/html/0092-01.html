    <p id="b121-8" data-blocks='[["BL_121.10",121,[169,998,1148,377]]]'>Plaintiff, Golden Slipper Square Club, obtained an injunction against defendant, Golden Slipper Restaurant &amp; Catering, Inc., enjoining the defendant from using the name “Golden Slipper” in conjunction with the operation of its night club, restaurant and catering business. From the decree granting an injunction the defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b121-9" data-blocks='[["BL_121.11",121,[169,1389,1149,589]]]'>The chancellor found the following facts: Plaintiff is a non-profit corporation with its principal offices at 213 S. Broad Street, Philadelphia. It has been in existence since 1924 and has now a membership of 1600 persons, predominantly from the Philadelphia area. It owns, maintains and operates the Golden Slipper Square Camp, a charitable summer camp for underprivileged children; a Milk Fund and a Coal Fund; it provides scholarships and outings for orphans; it gives aid to service men and to the needy poor; and it fosters achievement and service awards.</p>

In connection with these entertainments, plaintiff solicits advertisements for its program book from which it receives approximately |85,000 a year. Plaintiff also holds approxi<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>mately eight meetings a year and at these meetings leading celebrities speak or perform and large contributions are solicited and received. In the last three years plaintiff has raised and distributed for charitable purposes over |350,000. It bears a splendid reputation, locally as well as nationally, and in metropolitan Philadelphia it has become known and identified as the “Golden Slipper” or “Golden Slipper Club”.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[261,783,1154,931]]]'>The defendant is a business corporation engaged since March 1948, in the restaurant, catering and night club business, with its principal place of business at 715 W. Girard Avenue,'Philadelphia. It was originally known as Congress Restaurant, Inc., but changed its name on or about October 15, 1948. The chancellor specifically found that <em>defendant changed its name “with the intent to trade upon the long-established good will and reputation of the </em>plaintiffDefendant has spent substantial sums of money in advertising its business. The words “Golden Slipper” or “Golden Slipper Club” which defendant sometimes used in its advertising are identified by the citizens of Philadelphia and its environs solely with the plaintiff. Defendant has likewise used the same symbol in its advertising and on its neon sign as the plaintiff has used in much of its printed matter, namely, the symbol of a golden slipper.</p>

Letters and bills intended for the defendant (which for a number of months was in a precarious financial condition) are frequently delivered to the plaintiff; sev<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>eral times a week the plaintiff receives telephone calls intended for the defendant. “Use of the words ‘Golden Slipper’ by the defendant as part of its corporate name has bred confusion in the minds of the public as to whether or not the defendant is identified with the plaintiff”.</p>

The song “Oh Dem Golden Slippers” has been frequently used by string bands of the Philadelphia Mummers since 1901. The name “Golden Slipper” had been registered by one Anna Taffler on September 14, 1927 for use in her hosiery business. The name “Golden Slipper” is also used by the manufacturer of “Golden Slipper” premium ginger ale. The defendant upon plaintiff’s protest, promised to change its name but thereafter changed its mind, hence this suit.</p>
    <p id="b123-6" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[166,1507,1149,808]]]'>It is important to note that the defendant adopted its name with intent to trade upon plaintiff’s good will and reputation and that the name, symbol, advertising and activities of the defendant have bred confusion and deception and have threatened the standing, reputation and fund raising abilities of the plaintiff. If plaintiff and defendant were business corporations engaged in a similar business these facts would be sufficient to warrant injunctive relief: <em>KoolVent v.
