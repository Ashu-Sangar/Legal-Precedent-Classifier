The Authority is the owner of a water system in Chester and vicinity. It desired to construct an underground water pipe-line.

Friel, engineer, together with rights of entry thereto, along, about and upon said line, for construction, maintenance or renewal thereof.” Apparently, the Authority started work on appellant’s land on June 8, 1950 and completed the work about July 31, 1950.</p>

That all rights of way or easements heretofore appropriated by the Authority for the construction, operation, maintenance and ultimate renewal of its underground water transmission pipe-line are expressly defined and limited as follows: (a) To the permanent occupation and use of such area underground as shall be required for the installation, construction, joinder, anchorage and support of a single line of prestressed steel and concrete water-main pipe, of diameters varying from 48 inches to 30 inches, as well as for the accommodation of access manholes, valves, boxes, conduits and other accessories — all as shown for each individual property upon the blue-print plan attached to the bond tendered to the owner of such property in the condemnation proceedings instituted following the adoption of the aforementioned Right of Way Resolutions; and (b) To the <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>permanent occupation and use of such surface area as shall be required for the said manholes, valves, boxes and other accessories, including markers; and (c) To the temporary occupation and use of such surface area as shall be reasonably required in and about the original construction of the said pipe-line — said area, however, not to exceed 20 feet in width to either side of the center of said pipe-line, to be entered upon and reached only along the line of the said pipe-line right of way and not across other lands of the owners; and (d) To the temporary occupation and use of such surface area as shall at any time or times in the future be reasonably required for the operation, maintenance or renewal of said pipe-line and/or accessories — said area, however, not to exceed 10 feet in width to either side of the center of said pipe-line, to be entered upon and reached only along the line of the said pipe-line right of way — the Authority to be and remain responsible for any and all damage to buildings, fences, crops, trees, or other property occasioned by reason of any such future occupation and use, if and when such damage be sustained. 2. That this resolution constitutes a supplement to the aforementioned Right of Way Resolutions of April 6, 1950, and May 4, 1950, respectively; and the terms and provisions hereof are intended to limit the rights of the Authority acquired thereunder and to define the responsibility of the Authority in connection with the exercise of such rights. 3. That all resolutions, motions, or parts thereof, that may be inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed. 4. That the effective date hereof shall, as to each property involved, be the date of its original appropriation by Resolution of this Board.”</p>

In the latter case the question was whether certain expenses of the township in building a sewer in front of a property were properly items to be charged against the property owner in making an assessment for benefits, and this Court said such questions must be raised upon exceptions. However, it is not all questions of law which will be decided upon exceptions. The rule was well stated in <em>Allentown’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/121/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="121 Pa.

The original resolution took the “. . . rights of way or easements on and under the lands hereinafter described <em>as are necessary </em>to construct, operate and maintain said water pipe-line. . .”. (Emphasis supplied). The resolution of January 4, 1951 merely defined the <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>amount necessary. In <em>Pittsburgh Forge &amp; Iron Co. v.

After entry on the land, the county commissioners adopted another resolution “. . . more particularly defining the property taken, or intended by the original resolution to be taken, . . .”. This supplemental resolution was offered in evidence at the trial of the appeal to the common pleas and its admissibility approved by this Court. See also <em>Philadelphia Felt Co.’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/293/0551-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="293 Pa. 551" data-case-ids="1111148" data-case-paths="/pa/293/0551-01">293 Pa. 551</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.%20208" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="143 A. 208">143 A. 208</a>; <em>M.

Since the supplemental resolution may be introduced on appeal to the common pleas and since the viewers’ report is not before the jury, it is unnecessary to refer the case back to the viewers.
