    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[234,497,1157,1108]]]'>This proceeding was by a petition of Ioanna Yassilakis, of Greece (sister of testator), for a citation directed against Diamantis Yassilakis (brother of petitioner and testator, and executor under the will of the decedent) and Stephen Yassilakis (nephew of testator, a son of the brother Diamantis) <em>“defendants”, </em>to show cause why Diamantis should not pay petitioner $2,000 and Stephen pay petitioner $500 (or in the alternative why Diamantis should not pay the entire $2,500), such sums being one-half of the proceeds of two life insurance policies wherein defendants were respectively named as beneficiaries, the proceeds thereof having been paid by the insurance companies to the named beneficiaries in accordance with the terms of the policies. The basis for such demand is that testator <em>by his will </em>directed, <em>inter alia, </em>that his “life insurance money” be equally divided between Diamantis and petitioner, but that each “defendant”, as. designated insurance beneficiary, collected the insurance proceeds and refused to pay petitioner a one-half share.</p>

That record also discloses that Diamantis, as executor, filed an account of his administration of- the: estate-.on-.July 16,- 1.946.

The objections, however, must be sustained upon a different ground. No order to pay a legacy may be made unless there has been a preceding accounting and an award of the legacy: Yol. 1 Eemick Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Practice sec. 161, p. 477, et seq.; Hunter Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Commonplace Book Vol. 1, p. 327, et seq. and Vol 2, p. 973, et seq.; <em>Yeisley Estate, </em><a href="/pa/358/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="358 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="8845318" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0200-01">358 Pa. 200</a>, 203, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="56 A.2d 205">56 A. 2d 205</a>.

    <p id="b300-5" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[241,1626,1156,542]]]'>As the legatee claims that the proceeds of the insurance formed part of the testator’s estate, the application would be to surcharge the fiduciary for having received such assets and having applied them to Ms own use. Furthermore, if the petition for review is allowed, there are many of the items of credit which are being attacked by the petitioner as improper credits. All such matters must be determined by the auditing judge. The rights of the parties must be appropriately adjudicated followed by a definitive decree.</p>

It is “. . . a choice which a party is compelled to make between the acceptance of a benefit under a written instrument, and the retention of some property already his own, which is attempted to be disposed of, in favor of a third party, by virtue of the same paper”.

As the qualified executor of the decedent’s will, Diamantis was answerable to the Orphans’ Court for the estate committed to his care and its proper distribution. He was both a beneficiary under a policy of insurance on the decedent’s life and a legatee under the decedent’s will, which sought to control the distribution of the proceeds of the insurance. While the <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>account already filed and audited showed no balance for distribution, there would be a fund available for distribution if the real estate be sold to pay the legacy. As Diamantis is now dead, the duty of responding for him as a former fiduciary in respect, of the equitable election arising under the testator’s will continues to attach to his personal representative.</p>

Does a testator’s physical possession of insurance policies, on his life, with designated beneficiaries, constitute such policies assets of decedent’s estate? These questions, including the effect of the will upon designated insurance beneficiaries, are. not now properly before us and concerning which we expressly refrain from deciding. Such matters must first be determined at the audit of an appropriate account followed by a definitive decree.</p>
