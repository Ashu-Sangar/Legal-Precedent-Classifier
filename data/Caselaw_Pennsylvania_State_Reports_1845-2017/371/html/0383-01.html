M.D. Tenn.). The <em>Schroeder </em>case well exemplifies the differentiation. There, as we have already seen, the employees who quarried and prepared the rock for local use on a highway and on a railroad, both interstate instrumentalities, were not engaged “in commerce”. Yet, another group of similar employees who quarried some of the same kind of rock for use directly in the construction of a dike to prevent a nearby oil Seld from being inundated and ruined by the encroachment of water from a dam, then under construction, were held to be within the Act. The reason for the latter conclusion was that such employees’ work contributed immediately to the continued flow of oil which, of itself, was an article of commerce. The court thus reasoned: “Quarrying the rock, processing it, and hauling some of it to the dyke constituted part of the <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>integrated effort haying for its purpose the protection of the oil field from being flooded in order that production of oil and its movement in interstate commerce might continue. While bearing that close and immediate tie to the integrated effort designed to effectuate the continued production of oil and its movement in interstate commerce, the employees were <em>engaged in the production of goods for commerce </em>. . .” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b418-4" data-blocks='[["BL_418.5",418,[242,858,1161,827]]]'>In the present instance, the stone was quarried locally for local use. True enough, as a part of a concrete aggregate the stone became imbedded in interstate transportational facilities, but it never moved in interstate commerce nor became a part of commerce. The fact that the workmen who applied the concrete to the maintenance of the interstate instrumentalities may have consequently been “in commerce” (see <em>Overstreet v. North Shore Corporation, </em><a href="/us/318/0125-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="318 U.S. 125" data-case-ids="364396" data-case-paths="/us/318/0125-01">supra)</a> did not constitute the “off-the-road” employees, who prepared and delivered the concrete, producers of goods for commerce.

Some of the component materials came from outside the State, but all of the product was compounded, delivered and used within the State, about 85% of it being used in the maintenance and repair of interstate highways. The defendant employer conceded that those of- its employees who applied the amesite to the highways were covered by the-Act, being “engaged-in commerce” on-analogy to the service performed in <em>Overstreet v.

The action in the <em>Alstate </em>case was by the Secretary of Labor for relief against alleged violations of the Act by the defendant with respect to the employees just indicated.

Alstate’s off-the-road employees, in producing material which is used to repair and maintain the surfaces of instrumentalities of commerce, are engaged ‘in the production of goods for commerce.’ ” This decision not only conflicted directly with the ruling in the <em>Schroeder </em>case, with respect to “off-the-road” employees who locally produce and prepare materials for local use in the repair and maintenance of interstate instrumentalities, but it, at once, introduced an entirely new theory for bringing such employees within the coverage of the Act, namely, that they are engaged “in the production of goods for commerce.” The way in which the learned court reached this conclusion was by reasoning that, inasmuch as <em>goods in commerce </em>would be hauled over the highways which were repaired and maintained with materials furnished by the “off-the-road” employees, the latter were in an “occupation directly essential to the production” of <em>such </em>goods within the intent of Sec. 3 (j) of the Act. The vast number of purely local <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>employments that would be made subject to the Act on the basis of the theory of the <em>Alstate </em>case is not difficult to imagine. It is readily conceivable that many, if not most, local activities are “necessary”, at least in some remote degree, to the production of goods for commerce. Particularly pertinent becomes the caution voiced by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, when construing the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in <em>Chapman v.

Actually, the work in the <em>Sehroeder </em>case was not “new construction” within the contemplation of that term as employed in the Act. It was but a relocation of existing arteries of interstate traffic (viz., a highway and a railroad) made necessary by the Federal Government’s construction of the Denison Dam and Reservoir. Thus, it was noted in the <em>Schroeder </em>case (p. 387) that <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>“The relocated track has been connected with the existing track of the railroad company and has become a permanent part of it. The relocated portion of the highway when completed was or is to become a part of the existing highway but it had not been completed at the time of the trial of this case.” Certainly, the Court of Appeals, which decided the <em>Schroeder </em>case, did not regard “new construction” as being present nor was it assigned as a reason for excluding the particular employees from the coverage of the Act as it should have been, and no doubt would have been, had the work been “new” construction within the meaning of the Act: cf. <em>Kelly v.

The “ice cases” were discriminatingly distinguished in the <em>Schroeder </em>case where Judge Bkatton, speaking for the court, said (p. 389), — “Our attention is directed to the so-called ice cases [citing them]. In all of them, the ice company produced ice and sold it to a railroad company, an express company, or other like agency, for icing refrigerator ears, icing dining cars, icing shipments of less than car <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>lots, or other similar purpose; and the major contention of the ice company was that since it sold the ice at the point of production to the transportation company, the production was local and therefore its employees were not within the coverage of the Act. That contention was rejected. But in wide difference from the facts here, it affirmatively appears in three of those cases and is fairly inferable in the fourth, that some of the ice actually moved across state lines before being consumed by use or otherwise, and that it was produced and sold Avith knowledge and intent that it would move in that manner. It is true that in Atlantic Co. v. Walling, supra, the court said in effect that the production of goods for commerce, within the meaning of the Act, includes the production of goods for use by an instrumentality of interstate commerce as an essential part of such commerce, even though the particular goods produced do not move in commerce. But the Act does not speak of the production of goods for an instrumentality of commerce as distinguished from commerce itself.” The foregoing distinction of the ice cases was quoted with approval and followed by the District Court for the District of New Jersey in the <em>Trimmer </em>case, supra.</p>

It was no doubt because of the expected physical relation or reaction between goods in commerce and the ice which refrigerates them that Sec. 1 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, as amended, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A71" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="49 U.S.C. §1">49 U.S.C.A. §1</a> (3), expressly declared, inter alia, that “transportation” (interstate) includes “. . . all services in connection with the . . . refrigeration or icing ... of property transported.” <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>The very first of the “ice cases” (sub nom. <em>Fleming v.

Supp. 654</a>, 661, D.C.M.D. Ga.) specifically relied on this statutory declaration of the interstate character of the icing service of goods in commerce. The rationale of the “ice cases” is obviously not applicable to “off-the-road” employees who furnish materials locally for local use.</p>

Consequently, ander the definition of “produced” in Sec. 3 (j) of the Act, such employees were held to be in an occapation necessary to the prodaction of goods for commerce. The relation was direct and immediate. In <em>Lewis v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em><a href="/f2d/154/0751-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="154 F.2d 751" data-case-ids="1143013" data-case-paths="/f2d/154/0751-01">154 F. 2d 751</a> (C.A. 5), upon which the <em>Alstate </em>opinion also relies, the employees of an electrical company whose power was utilized in commerce and for prodaction of goods in commerce were likewise held, under the broad definition of “produced” in Sec. 3 (j), to be in an occapation necessary to the prodaction of goods for commerce. There is no similarity between the facts of these cases and the “off-the-road” employees of the instant case.</p>
