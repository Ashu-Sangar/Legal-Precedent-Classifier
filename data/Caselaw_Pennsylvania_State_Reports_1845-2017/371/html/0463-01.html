In March, 1951 Aimetti executed and delivered to Andres, as security for the repayment of money borrowed from him, a chattel mortgage in the sum of $25,300 encumbering the same machinery, equipment and chattels as were covered by the chattel mortgage to Berwick National Bank.

Whether fast or loose ... all the machinery of a manufactory which is necessary to constitute it, and without which it would not be a manufactory at all, must pass for a part of the freehold.” The principle thus enunciated has been followed, in various applications, by a multitude of subsequent cases, among which may be noted <em>Christian v.

This principle became more important as our industrial life expanded, so that the necessary credits to sustain and finance manufactories and other like industries could be obtained with some degree of certainty that the security offered would be continued. Therefore, it was held that where premises were used in manufacturing or a similar industry, the real estate and personal property necessary to the plant as a going concern were subject to the lien of an industrial mortgage.

In our opinion the fact that merely the land is here described and the word “building” is omitted is not sufficient to preclude the application of the doctrine. Of course a mortgage of land carries with it any structure erected thereon and all fixtures attached thereto even though not expressly mentioned (16 Am. Jur. 606, §296), and since, if such structure be in fact a manufactory the <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>machinery, equipment and various chattels used in connection therewith are deemed in law to be fixtures, they also pass under the mortgage conveyance; in other words, since the building is covered by the mortgage with the same legal effect as if specifically described therein, all that the law deems affixed thereto is likewise included as part of the realty thereby conveyed.</p>

Whether the real estate mortgage itself, of which he had both record and actual notice, was sufficient to put him upon investigation as to the nature of the structure erected on the land and the consequent coverage of the mortgage need not here be considered, because admittedly he was fully cognizant of all the pertinent facts and circumstances. He not only had visited the brewery and was fully familiar with its makeup and its operations, but he knew when he accepted the chattel mortgages that they covered the machinery, equipment and chattels which were used in and about the brewery. Having such actual notice, his chattel mortgages thereby became, from every possible point of view, subordinate as liens to that of the real estate mortgage so far as there was any overlapping. The Act of June 1, 1945, P.

' This was emphasized by this Court: “The mortgage, itself by its very, terms'.shows that it bound more than, "buildings and. land. - After 'describing the <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>lot of ground by metes and bounds, it proceeds with the usual clause, ‘Together with all and singular the buildings, improvements . . . hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging.’ <em>Building and appurtenances </em>under the situation before us would include all machinery and fixtures going to make up the establishment as a completed plant:” Blaine v.

Together with all and singular the buildings, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances to the same belonging, or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions, remainders, rents, issues and proñts thereof’.” In that case the Supreme Court said: “The words of the descriptive clause in the mortgage before us convey ‘all that two-story <em>factory </em>building and lot.’ This of itself gives notice of an ‘industrial mortgage.’ ”</p>

The lower court goes so far as to say: “While there is no mention in the mortgage itself that the said mortgage is placed upon an industrial plant and while there is no mention of the machinery and equipment as such, nevertheless we conclude that the mortgage in this case is an industrial mortgage, the ordinary appurtenance clause of the said mortgage being sufficient to cover the machinery and equipment and supplies necessary to carry on the brewery in this case, as a going concern.” That this overreaches itself is demonstrated by the fact that within the word “appurtenances” the court below, as <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>the majority here concede, erroneously included desks, chairs and typewriters, in addition to bottles, kegs, soakers and crowners. It even stretched the mortgage tent to cover five trucks on the assumption that since a brewery must have some means of transportation, the trucks therefore must have been included in the bank’s mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[251,720,1155,1152]]]'>The Majority Opinion excludes the office furniture and the trucks from the operation of the mortgage, but does not exclude the bottles, kegs, soakers and crowners. The majority say that the trucks should be excluded because they travel outside the mortgaged premises, but so also do the bottles and the kegs. Once the principle of industrial mortgage is established in the sense intended by the majority, everything on the premises must be included. Who is to draw the line between the personalty that is mortgaged and the personalty that is not? If bottles are needed to contain the beer, and thus form an integral part of the manufacture of the beer, the trucks are equally needed to distribute the beer because without distribution the beer factory is of no consequence whatsoever. This arbitrary division between beer kegs and beer trucks is bound to cause much perplexity in future disputes of this kind. All of it unnecessary. The requirement that a mortgage, (in order for it to be regarded an industrial mortgage) must make some mention of the industry upon it, is not an unreasonable requirement.</p>

Anyone contemplating purchase of land has the right to be guided and assured by the record. The decision of the majority, if allowed unchecked and normal expansion, may well jeopardize the reliability of our recording system which safeguards titles to real estate. Diluvial chaos will result if deeds and mortgages recorded in the courthouses of the land are to have attached to them oral conditions and modifications enforcible after the rights of third parties without notice have intervened. It was to stave off that kind of disorder that the Statute of Frauds and other similar legislation erected barriers to preserve inviolate the provisions of contracts solemnly entered into and affirmed by sealed instruments.</p>
    <p id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[183,1226,1150,809]]]'>Here there was no question of culpable deception or undue influence. The mortgage in question was prepared by counsel for the mortgagee. If the parties intended to include machinery, equipment and other personal property within the scope of the mortgagee’s security, it would have been a simple matter to so indicate. If it was the intention to make of this mortgage an industrial mortgage the most fundamental prudence would have dictated the inclusion, after description of the real estate, of some such phrase as “having erected thereon a brewery”. In that event it would not be necessary to place “appurtenances” on a Procrustean bed in order to stretch it to cover the meaning advanced by the appellee, and adopted by this Court.</p>

The differences and contradictions as to what was really said were as marked as the different views expressed <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>by witnesses to a traffic accident. The witnesses upholding the view of the Bank testified that it was understood the mortgage was to cover the brewery, the machinery and equipment. The chattel mortgage witnesses testified that it was understood the personal property on the land was free from any previous mortgage lien. The court weighed this evidence and concluded that “all of the articles included in the sheriff’s sale were included under the lien of the mortgage of the First National Bank of Mount Carmel and were all contained in the manufacturing establishment.” But the parol testimony, as between the parties to this suit, was irrelevant and inadmissible, and the conclusions, therefore, supererogatory. In the absence of evidence of fraud or mutual mistake the appellees were estopped, at least as against third parties, from denying the quite obvious and transparent meaning of the mortgage which they drew up and accepted.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[250,1340,1154,820]]]'>If the principle enunciated in the majority opinion becomes law, and it will be law unless modified by statute or other decisions of this Court, this will mean that no title searcher can be certain of the nature of a mortgage unless he physically inspects the land involved. And, even after the inspection, he will still not be certain, because the mortgagor and mortgagee may have had an unrecorded oral agreement, which agreement in itself will be subject to all the interpretations, conclusions and nuances of meaning attendant upon rival appraisals of contested questions of fact. And all this is an invitation to uncertainty, costly litigation and disorganization in the world of real estate supposedly mapped out precisely with the latitude of reason and the longitude of pragmatic thought.</p>
