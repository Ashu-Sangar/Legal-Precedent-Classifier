    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.8",158,[265,902,1153,209]]]'>It would be well to keep in mind from the very beginning what the parties frequently forgot through their written briefs and oral arguments, viz., that this appeal involves only the question of a counsel fee.</p>
    <p id="b158-7" data-blocks='[["BL_158.9",158,[265,1131,1151,98]]]'>In order to determine this question it will be necessary to review the following pertinent facts:</p>
    <p id="b158-8" data-blocks='[["BL_158.10",158,[256,1249,1161,1091]]]'>On October 13, 1939, James McRoberts, a brother •of the plaintiff who is likewise the appellant, died intestate, unmarried and without issue. Mr. Q-. D. Shrum was engaged as attorney to represent the decedent’s estate. Plaintiff was estranged from his family and had not seen them for forty years. Mr. Packard, a friend and tenant of the decedent knew of the family discord and asked the defendant, Mr. Bradley McK. Burns, an attorney in Pittsburgh, to try to locate the plaintiff. Through a search of court records, Burns ascertained that the plaintiff was an heir and shortly thereafter located him in the Garfield District of the City of Pittsburgh. Fifteen. days after the decedent’s death, plaintiff went with Packard to Burns’ law office where he signed a lengthy power of attorney dated October 28, 1939, appointing Burns his attorney to “demand, sue for, recover and .receive all... . . personal property . . . and/or interest in real'estate which aré or shall be due, owing and payable to me from, [the administrator] ...

    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.5",159,[188,890,1147,365]]]'>Plaintiff inherited no personal estate of the decedent since that was exhausted in the payment of debts, but merely an undivided interest in certain real estate, most of which was vacant unimproved property. The other heirs at first denied, but within a few months finally recognized plaintiff’s relationship to the decedent.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.6",159,[189,1275,1147,929]]]'>Mr. Burns, on behalf of plaintiff, filed a petition for partition of decedent’s real estate, and at that time made an agreement with plaintiff that there should be credited against and in reduction of Burns’ above-mentioned contingent fee any fee plaintiff might become obligated to pay Burns in the partition proceedings. This agreement appears twice in the written record and counsel for Mr. Burns reiterated this agreement at the bar of this Court. In the partition proceeding it was admitted and if was later stipulated by order of the Court that plaintiff was an heir. As a result of presenting a petition for partition and initiating that proceeding on behalf of plaintiff, Mr. Burns received for his services therein, a total fee of $6500. Plaintiff’s share of this fee was $812.50, which was actually received by defendant, Burns, who properly gave plaintiff credit for payment of the samé.</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.7",159,[189,2216,1147,153]],["BL_160.1",160,[248,330,1152,156]]]'>The basic issue of “fee” was confused and complicated by frequent disputes between' the parties as to some of their financial dealings.- Burn's collected cer<a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>tain rents and received various moneys for plaintiff; he made several advances and he and his wife and Packard made several loans to plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b160-5" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[246,496,1154,539]]]'>Plaintiff filed a bill in equity to cancel the power of attorney which he had given to Burns on the allegation that it was obtained by fraud and further prayed for an accounting.

    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[240,1049,1158,1090]]]'>Plaintiff then petitioned the lower Court on January 3, 1945, (filed January 5, 1945) to open its final decree (as the Court in its original decree had permitted) for the sole purpose of an accounting. Included in and made a part of the petition was a stipulation by the parties agreeing that the decree of June 23, 1943, be opened up only for the purpose of an accounting; and further that neither the fee of $6,500 payable in the partition proceedings to Burns nor the interpretation of the power of attorney executed by plaintiff to defendant Burns, were to be considered in this proceeding. On the same day, to wit, January 3, 1945, the Court by McDonald, J., after consideration of the petition and of the aforesaid stipulation, entered an. order; decreeing that the final decree entered by the Court, on June 23, 1943,-be opened for the following accounting purposes.': (.a) . , .,..(b). . .

Burns by James Altenbaugh Mc-Eoberts on account of such Power of Attorney, or for any other reason, to the end that there may be a final accounting between all the parties concerning all matters involved in this litigation.”</p>
    <p id="b161-4" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[179,830,1150,1139]]]'>Apparently all parties in interest agreed or made no objection to Judge McDonald's order or decree of January 3, 1945. Pursuant to this order of the court a hearing was held on June 25, 1946, before Judge Thompson. At that hearing the parties entered into the following stipulation: “The Court: It is stipulated by counsel representing both parties in interest here that a balance of <em>Tioo Thousand Dollars shall he paid to Bradley McK. Burns, Esq., in full settlement of counsel fees claimed hy him in connection with this proceeding; </em>and in as much as an accounting has been made by Judge McDonald of various matters at issue between the parties; if this accounting shows a balance due Mr. Burns that balance shall be added to the Two Thousand Dollars attorney’s fees now agreed upon.

    <p id="b162-4" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[248,720,1153,211]]]'>Judge McDonald then ordered the said power of attorney revoked and cancelled; and directed the payment of certain sums of money to various parties in interest in accordance with the accounting.</p>
    <p id="b162-5" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[246,940,1156,323]]]'>Notwithstanding the fact that the parties had stipulated before Judge Thompson, <em>“doth parties agree to accept without exception or appeal the findings of Judge </em>McDonald,” defendant Burns filed exceptions to Judge McDonald's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and. decree nisi of November 2, 1946.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[246,1274,1153,263]]]'>It appears to us clear thát Mr. Burns did not object or except to the $2,000 attorney fee which he had already agreed to and which, as we shall' hereinafter show, he could not abrogate, but was excepting' to the items of credit and debit found by Judge McDonald.</p>

The court en banc gave a summary of the history of the case including the stipulation (a) that $2,000 had been agreed upon by the parties to be paid to defendant Bradley McK. Burns in full settlement of counsel fees claimed by him in connection with this proceeding, and (b) that both parties had agreed to accept, without exception or appeal, the findings of Judge McDonald. The Court en banc then said: “Did counsel rely on the original adjudication before Judge' McDonald in. agreeing to.the stipulation;, as'counsel for the. defendant .contends;'.or ..did counsel' expect the Chancellor to make new. findingSr — o-uisicZe thé' $2,0.00 <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>

It is further ordered and directed that this proceeding be placed upon the equity trial list, to be referred to a chancellor for final disposition.”</p>
    <p id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[173,842,1149,597]]]'>It seems to us that the only issue raised by the opinion and order of the Court en banc was the question of the debits and the credits which were contained in Judge McDonald’s original adjudication or the debits and the credits which Judge McDonald would subsequently find in a new adjudication; but in no event was the $2,000 counsel fee to be considered or disturbed. However, defendant interpreted the order to mean that the parties were to have a new accounting as to all debits and credits, and likewise a new determination of defendant’s counsel fee of $2,000.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[170,1452,1151,642]]]'>If that is the correct interpretation of the order of the Court en banc, such order was improper, erroneous and illegal. Plaintiff and Mr. Burns, with the approval of the Court and their respective counsel, and after long and careful consideration, had agreed and stipulated that Mr. Burns’ fee was to be $2,000. This was likewise specifically so found by Judge McDonald in his opinion and decree of November 2, 1946; and in the parties’ stipulation approved by the Court below June 25, 1946, both parties had agreed to accept without exception or appeal, the findings of Judge McDonald. The reason for such a settlement is clear.</p>
    <p id="b163-7" data-blocks='[["BL_163.6",163,[168,2113,1150,266]],["BL_164.1",164,[257,343,1155,1261]]]'>Plaintiff had contended (1) that defendant obtained from him a power of attorney without disclosing the fact that (as defendant knew) plaintiff became entitled to an undivided vested interest in decedent’s real estate immediately upon decedent’s death which real es<a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>tate would never pass to, an administrator unless it was necessary for the payment of debts; and (2) that the power of attorney never contemplated the recovery of this real estate which had already vested in plaintiff, and (3) that a fee of $8,000 for the few services rendered by defendant to plaintiff in this case ivas excessive and unconscionable. The defendant himself and his attorney knew these contentions of the plaintiff at the time they made a settlement and stipulated for a fee of $2,000 in full settlement of Burns’ claim to a one-third fee under the abovementioned power of attorney. Such a compromise agreement entered into with full knowledge of all the facts and the applicable principles of law, is binding upon the defendant and could not be set aside by a Court. As Justice Stearns aptly said in <em>Mowry v. McWherter, </em><a href="/pa/365/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="365 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="1225545" data-case-paths="/pa/365/0232-01">365 Pa. 232</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.2d%20154" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="74 A.2d 154">74 A. 2d 154</a>, (p. 238), “Where parties, sui juris, enter into an unambiguous agreement, with knowledge of the facts, the courts will not relieve them of their contractual obligations because of the questionable wisdom of the bargain: Owens v.

Judge Musmanno approved and incorporated in his decree of January 5, 1952, a memorandum submitted by counsel for defendant Burns, and found that, exclusive of the counsel fee, defendant Burns and Mrs. Burns and Packard owed plaintiff the sum of $818.72. Defendants’ objections to Judge McDonald’s accounting which resulted in all this litigation seem strange in view of the fact that their last memorandum was in exact accord with the accounting filed by Judge McDonald, the only differences being (1) that the account was not set up in the same detailed itemized manner as was Judge McDonald’s, and (2) the interest was brought up to date.</p>
