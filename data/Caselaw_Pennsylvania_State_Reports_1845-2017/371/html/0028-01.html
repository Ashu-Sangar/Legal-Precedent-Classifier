The complaint alleged that the accident was caused by the negligence of the drivers of the two vehicles. Only the defendant company appeared and defended. The wife claimed damages for her physical injuries and for pain and suffering, while the husband claimed for the loss of his wife’s services and companionship and for the expenses occasioned by her injuries. The two cases were joined for suit in the one action as required by Rule 2228 (a) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure: 337 Pa. 6a.</p>

It undoubtedly was. But, before we come to that, we shall point out for the future guidance of the members of Uie court below what they should do to avoid an even division of opinion to the end that direct and positive action by <em>the court </em>may be attained. In the first place, it is unnecessary for all four judges to sit at the same time as a court en banc. According to a prearranged schedule, the judges could rotate in panels of three for the purpose of constituting a court en banc, the panel of course containing, if possible, the trial judge whose work is the immediate subject of review. If, however, all four judges should insist upon participating in the court, en banc at any given time,, upon, the eventuation <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>of an equal division of opinion among them, an outside judge should be called in as an additional member of the court for the time being, reargument should be had and disposition of the matter made by majority action of the court. A litigant is entitled to positive and definitive action in a court of first instance and that can be had only by the unanimous or majority vote of the judges composing the court. Judicial practices to achieve that goal should be pursued. In appellate review it sometimes happens that the appealed decision must be affirmed because of an evenly divided court. But, that is because there is no provision for augmenting such a court by the addition of a temporary member. Such practice has no bearing on the manner in which a court of first instance can properly attain finality of a matter before it. In fact, it would have been more in keeping with the practice governing the entry of summary judgments in general had the learned court below granted a new trial (i.e., an interlocutory order) rather than enter a definitive judgment when the members of the court were evenly divided in opinion on the merit of the motion.</p>

So independent of each other are the substantive rights of a husband and wife in the indicated circumstances that, at common law, the two causes could be sued for only in separate actions: see <em>Fries v.

In fact, its language presupposes the existence of the substantive rights. The changes made by the Act were purely procedural and the legislature so recognized.

Rule 2228 (a) took the place of Section 1 of the Act of 1895 providing for the enforcement in one action of the separate rights of a husband and wife for injury to the wife. Buie 2231 (d) continued the practice of returning separate verdicts on the respective causes of action of the husband and wife and of entering separate judgments thereon. The Buies Committee so understood the import of Buie 2231 (d) as evidenced by their Note thereto wherein they say that “In providing for separate verdicts and judgments, the rule [No. 2231 (d)] follows the Pennsylvania statutes relating to actions for injuries to a wife . . .

The defendant, too, has a right to have separate verdicts returned against him and separate judgments entered thereon as the law con templates. The Rules Committee’s Note to Rule 2231 (d), cit. supra, states that “This subdivision guarantees a party who asserts or <em>against whom is asserted </em>an independent claim the same procedural rights that he would enjoy, and imposes the same burdens to which he would be subject, if he had sued or <em>been sued </em>in a separate action”: 337 Pa. 13a (Emphasis supplied). Only by the allocation of the damages to the respective claimants by separate verdicts can the defendant be informed if the verdicts are consistent or one or the other is excessive.

The <em>Siidelmm </em>case was an action by a husband as administrator under the Wrongful Death and Survival statutes for the death of his wife. Separate verdicts were returned in that case. The obvious disparity between the amounts of the verdicts in relation to the items- for which recovery could respectively be claimed became, as we said, “a matter of no practical moment” after the. trial-court had reduced one of the verdicts.: In the- circumstances there obtain<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>ing, the husband personally was ultimately entitled to both verdicts.

The appellant embodied this same “either or” misconception in its fourth request for charge which the learned trial judge appropriately qualified before affirming it.</p>

The judge in his charge said: “The husband is responsible for the doctor and hospital bills, and that is why he joined in here as a party plaintiff.” There was no instruction that the husband was entitled to anything <em>more </em>than reimbursement for those expenses. Since the doctor and hospital bills amounted to precisely $573.70, and the amount of the verdict was $6,-<em>513.10, </em>it requires no clairvoyance to conclude that the jury intended the husband to be compensated $573.70, and that the wife was to receive $6,000 for pain, suffering and inconvenience.

      <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>I do not believe that in order to correct the error made by the court below in permitting one verdict instead of two it is necessary to send the cause back for another tedious, protracted, expensive trial. The error on the slate of the first trial can be wiped off with an appellate eraser and the demands of the law and justice will have been completely met. There is precedent for this slate-cleaning procedure. In the case of <em>Wesley et use. v. Rhodes, </em><a href="/pa-super/113/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="113 Pa. Super. 409" data-case-ids="974413" data-case-paths="/pa-super/113/0409-01">113 Pa. Superior Ct. 409</a>, 413, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20443" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="173 A. 443">173 A. 443</a>, which construed this very Act of 1895, Judge Stabtfelb said: “Appellant also assigns for error the fact that one verdict was taken for husband and wife, plaintiffs, while under the Act of May 8, 1895, P. L. 54, separate verdicts should have been taken for each. We can not see that defendant was in any manner injured thereby, so that it was at best harmless error for which we will not reverse.”</p>
    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[190,1277,1147,418]]]'>In <em>Helsel v. Traction Company, </em><a href="/pa-super/14/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="14 Pa. Super. 420" data-case-ids="827805" data-case-paths="/pa-super/14/0420-01">14 Pa. Superior Ct. 420</a>, 422, the Superior Court declared: “In such case the party injured is the other plaintiff, not the defendant, and if the party injured does not complain of the manner in which the jury has apportioned the damages for which the defendant is liable, it is difficult to see what meritorious cause of complaint the latter can have.”</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[188,1718,1148,308]]]'>Judge Rhodes in the case of <em>Fulcomer v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em><a href="/pa-super/141/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="141 Pa. Super. 264" data-case-ids="1027622" data-case-paths="/pa-super/141/0264-01">141 Pa.

    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.6",67,[188,2050,1147,262]]]'>While disagreeing with the majority of the Court on the subject of the new trial, I subscribe wholeheartedly to the procedure announced for the avoidance of any situation which brings about an impasse in the disposition of pending business in the lower Courts.</p>
