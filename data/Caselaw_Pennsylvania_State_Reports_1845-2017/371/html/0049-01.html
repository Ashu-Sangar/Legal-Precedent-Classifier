In dismissing the appeal the court below sustained an exception by the Company and overruled the Board as to that portion of its order which directed the Company, upon request, to reinstate certain named employes without back pay.

The facts as taken from the Board’s findings are as follows: During the day of June 9, 1949, a dispute arose between the Company management and the day cab drivers. The next day, after attempts by the business agent of the Union (the bargaining agent of the employes) to contact the president and secretary of the Company and its attorney, the day cab drivers, in violation of a collective bargaining agreement which was then in effect, parked their cabs and refused to work. When the night cab drivers arrived for work on June 10, 1949, their trip cards were not available and they were told by the manager in the presence of the president that there was no work. On June 11th and June 13th a supervisor for <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>the Company solicited the employment of other men who had been used during a previous strike. The Company then by its attorney informed the Union that it refused to discuss the grievance of the cab drivers (both day and night shift) which it was required to do under the collective bargaining agreement. Further letters between the Union and the Company resulted in no change in position by either party and on July 5, 1949, the Company informed one of the day drivers that he was dismissed and one of the night shift drivers that he was no longer considered an employe.</p>

After a hearing the Board entered a <em>nisi </em>decision on March 29, 1950, which, in substance, ordered the employer to cease and desist from discriminating against employes in regard to hire and tenure of their employment because of their membership in the Union, to bargain collectively and to reinstate the night shift drivers without back pay. Exceptions were dismissed and a final order entered October 26,1950. A petition for review was filed by the Company and a petition for enforcement of the order was filed by the Board. The lower court after argument modified the order in the manner above stated.</p>

The particularly pertinent clauses are (a), (e) and (e), which read as follows: “(a) To interfere with, restrain or coerce employes in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in this act. . . . (c) By discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment, or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization: Provided, That nothing in this act, or in any agreement approved or prescribed thereunder, or in any other statute of this Commonwealth, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization (not established, maintained or assisted by any action defined in this act as an unfair labor practice) to require, as a condition of employment, membership therein, if such labor organization is the representative of the employes, as provided in section seven (a) of this act, in the appropriate collective bargaining unit covered by such agreement when made and if such labor organization does not deny membership in its organization to a person or persons who are employes of the employer at the time of the making of such agreement, provided such employe was not employed in violation of any previously existing agreement with said labor organization. ...

(The italicized words indicate the amendment made by the 1939 act). The amendment thus makes it clear that it is only when employes have been “discharged in violation of clause (c) of subsection (1) of section six” of the act that the Board is given the power to order reinstatement. In fact, it is difficult to imagine any other reason for the Legislature’s amendment of the act.</p>

On June 9, 1949, a controversy arose over one of the cab drivers, one Harold Laukhuff, who, when reporting for work the following day was told to “go home until sent for.” The day drivers then stopped work but upon orders from their union representative returned to their cabs to work until the grievance over their fellow-employe should be adjusted.
