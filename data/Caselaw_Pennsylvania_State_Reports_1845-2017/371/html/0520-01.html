A <em>presumption of ownership </em>does not arise <em>solely </em>because property is in the <em>possession </em>of decedent at death. Many circumstances may exist under which property is in the possession of a decedent without the presumption or inference of decedent’s ownership. The burden of proof is on anyone who claims property in the possession of another to establish facts essential to the validity of his claim of ownership: <em>Henes v.

In decedent’s safe deposit box was found a sum of money in a sealed envelope whereon decedent had written, but not signed, “This belongs to [claimant].” Claimant contended that the money was his and he had given same to decedent for safekeeping; he did not claim the money as a <em>gift </em>from decedent. Incompetency of claimant as a witness was waived. He attempted to prove the claim by his own oral testimony. The auditing judge rejected the claim because he disbelieved claimant’s testimony.

Justice Maxey said (p. 310): “There is considerable confusion of thought arising from the fact that the phrase ‘burden of proof is used indiscriminately as meaning either <em>burden of proof </em>or <em>burden of producing evidence. </em>It was aptly said in Central Bridge Co. v. Butler, <a href="/mass/68/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Gray 130" data-case-ids="1998265" data-case-paths="/mass/68/0130-01">2 Gray 130</a>: ‘The burden of proof and the weight of evidence are two very different things. The former remains on the party affirming a fact in support of his case, and does not change in any aspect of the cause; the latter shifts from side to side in the progress of a trial, according to the nature and strength of the proofs offered in support or denial of the main fact to be established.’ See also Caldwell v.

R. 50</a>, 53, Lord Justice Bowen said: ‘In order to make my opinion clear, I should like to say shortly how I understand the term “burden of proof.” In every lawsuit somebody must go on with it; the plaintiff is the first to begin, and if he does nothing he fails. If he makes a prima facie case and nothing is done by the other side to answer it, the defendant fails. The test, therefore, as to burden of proof is simply to consider which party would .be successful if no evidence at all was given, or if. no more evidence was given than is given <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>at this partcular point of the case; because it is obvious that during the controversy in the litigation there are points at which the onus of proof shifts, and at which the tribunal must say, if the case stopped there, that it must be decided in a particular way. Such being the test, it is not a burden which rests forever on the person on whom it is first cast, but as soon as he, in his turn, finds evidence which, prima facie, rebuts the evidence against which he is contending, the burden shifts until again there is evidence which satisfies the demand. Now, that being so, the question as to onus of proof is only a rule for deciding on whom the obligation rests of going further, if he wishes to win.’ ” We have since frequently cited this case with approval, <em>inter alia: Katz v.

It is equally consistent with the conjecture of appellee that claimant in fact may have purchased the same acting through her attorney, the decedent. In any event, <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>proof was required to overcome the <em>prima facie </em>proof adduced by claimant.</p>
    <p id="b557-5" data-blocks='[["BL_557.4",557,[196,427,1150,824]]]'>Three cases are cited by the learned auditing judge as authority for the principle that “securities ... in the possession of the decedent at the date of his death raises a presumption that they are his property: Criswell’s Estate, <a href="/pa/334/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="334 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1190771" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0266-01">334 Pa. 266</a>; Keyser’s Estate, <a href="/pa/329/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="329 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="1181416" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0514-01">329 Pa. 514</a>; Paxon’s Estate, <a href="/pa/225/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="225 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="965348" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0204-01">225 Pa. 204</a>. . . .” An examination of those cases discloses that they relate to the <em>jurisdiction </em>of the orphans’ court in matters of dispute of title to personal property. They all hold that where at decedent’s death property is shown to have been in his possession, or is presumptively his, the orphans’ court has jurisdiction to investigate so far as to inform itself whether a substantial dispute exists. If such dispute does exist an issue must be awarded for trial by jury.</p>
    <p id="b557-6" data-blocks='[["BL_557.5",557,[196,1263,1147,321]]]'>The appellant made out a <em>prima facie </em>case and because nothing was done by appellee to answer it, the case of the appellee falls. Since the claimant established her title to the securities, the executor is directed to surrender them to claimant: <em>Paxson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/225/0204-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="225 Pa. 204" data-case-ids="965348" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0204-01">225 Pa. 204</a>, 206, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20A.%201114" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="73 A. 1114">73 A. 1114</a>.</p>
    <p id="b557-7" data-blocks='[["BL_557.6",557,[195,1597,1147,155]]]'>The decree of the court below is reversed, at appellee’s cost, the securities in controversy to be delivered to appellant, with necessary transfers.</p>
