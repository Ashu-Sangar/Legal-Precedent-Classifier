Local 30 asserts that there is no case from this Court where the discussion of <em>per se </em>unconstitutionality was necessary to the decision. Local 30 also claims that federal law does not recognize a <em>per se </em>approach to equal protection analysis. Local 30 further argues that the Commission’s “class of one” argument fails because “classification does not depend on numbers.” In any event, Local 30 claims that the Act does not create a closed class of one because another Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission theoretically could be created at a later time.</p>

By defining “public employer” exclusively as “The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission,” the Commission notes that the Act singles out the Commission from all other public employers of first-level supervisors.

The Commission maintains that the clearest proof that the Act is a special law is to compare the original version of the Act, which would have applied to all first-level supervisors of virtually all public employers, to the final version, which reduced the definition of “public employer” to a single entity, the Commission.</p>

The Commission claims that its first-level supervisors are not responsible for the actual work on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and thus, the special treatment mandated here is not necessary to ensure the free flow of travel and commerce throughout the Commonwealth. Indeed, if the General Assembly was genuinely concerned with labor disputes that could disrupt the turnpike’s operation, the Commission argues, it would have addressed labor relations with rank-and-file Commission employees, not the tiny class of first-level supervisors. The Commission argues that, because there is no rational reason to treat it differently from every other public employer in the Commonwealth, it met its heavy burden and established that the Act is unconstitutional, and the Commonwealth Court properly so held.</p>

      <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>Additionally, the Commission contests Local 30’s claim that special legislation of this sort may be deemed acceptable if it is part of an incremental, step-by-step approach or a pilot program ultimately designed to provide collective bargaining rights to all first-level public supervisors. The Commission notes that the legislation that extended collective bargaining rights to first-level supervisors with the Allegheny County Port Authority<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> and to City of Philadelphia school administrators <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> is distinguishable from the Act <em>sub judice. </em>This is so because the classes governed by those prior Acts are open as the legislation is specific to second-class and first-class counties, respectively, and not to the Allegheny County Port Authority or to the City of Philadelphia School District specifically. Those county class-based legislative classifications potentially could expand; whereas here, in contrast, the existing legislative classification can never have more than one member-the Commission. Additionally, the Commission notes that any attempt to excuse this special legislation under an “incremental approach” theory is absurd because the Port Authority Act was enacted in 1986, the School Administrators Act was enacted in 1996 and this Act was passed in 2002. At this rate, the Commission notes, this supposed incremental program could take hundreds of years to implement.</p>

The Commission notes that there was/is no pilot program language in the initial or the final version of the Act, a fact which distinguishes this case from the legislation which was deemed constitutional in <em>Zogby. </em>Furthermore, the Commission notes that in <em>Zogby, </em>this Court flatly stated that, “Article III, Section 32 does not have a ‘pilot program exception.’ The relevant inquiry, however, is not whether such an exception exists, but whether the particular pilot program here at issue constitutes special legislation.” <em>Zogby, </em><a href="/pa/574/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="828 A.2d 1079" data-case-ids="588041,9108060" data-case-paths="/pa/574/0121-01,/a2d/828/1079-01">828 A.2d at </a>1091 n. 16 (Pa.2003).

The logical corollary of that holding, the Commission argues, is that legislation is <em>per se </em>unconstitutionally special legislation where one member is categorized and no others can come into the class. The Commission cites this Court’s decisions in <em>Hickok I </em>and <em>Zogby </em>as further examples of cases which explicitly recognized that a statute which creates an immutable class of one is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. Applying this line of authority, the Commission notes that the Act in the case <em>sub judice </em>is expressly applicable to but one public employer — the Commission — and thus it is unconstitutional <em>per se. </em>The Commission characterizes as “absurd” Local 30’s argument that a second and redundant Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission could be created and also notes, in any event, that this legislation employs a definite <em>article </em>— i.e., the Act applies to “the” Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, thus defining a single entity. Any subsequent Commission, by definition, would not be “the” single existing Commission referred to in this legislation.</p>

In answering the suggestion that the legislation was a special law in violation of Article III, Section 32 because Philadelphia was the only city at that time to qualify as a first class city, the Court found the argument unsound because other cities’ populations could rise above 300,000 and become members of the first class. <em>Id. at </em>10. This Court later explained the <em>Wheeler </em>holding in <em>Haverford Township </em>as follows: “the fact that Philadelphia was the only member of a class did not make the act local, since it provided for a class as such, into which other members might come.” <em>Haverford Township, </em><a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.2d%20786" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="28 A.2d 786">28 A.2d at 789</a>.

In <em>Hickok I, </em>this Court expressly recognized the prospect of such a finding of <em>per se </em>unconstitutionality. After finding that the legislation at issue was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose, the <em>Hickok I </em>Court announced an alternative holding that a “classification is <em>per se </em>unconstitutional when the class consists of one member and it is impossible or highly unlikely that another can join the class.” <em>Hickok I, </em><a href="/a2d/761/1132-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="761 A.2d 1132" data-case-ids="11162777,1366928" data-case-paths="/a2d/761/1132-01,/pa/563/0391-01">761 A.2d at 1136</a>.

The <em>per se </em>unconstitutionality standard is solidly rooted in our case law and was clearly set forth as a specific, albeit alternate, holding in <em>Hickok I. </em>“Where a decision rests on two or more grounds equally valid, none may be relegated to the inferior status of obiter dictumf.]” <em>Commonwealth ex rel., Fox v.

Thus, it is clear a statute may be deemed <em>per se </em>unconstitutional if, under the classification, the class consists of one member and is closed or substantially closed to future membership. In this case, our analysis above makes it clear that the General Assembly created a class with one member and did so in a fashion that makes it impossible for another member to join the class. The class -will never open to more than one member because the General Assembly defined “public employer” as “The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission.” Local 30’s argument that the class is open because another Commission could be created in the future is illogical because if another Commission was created, the cur<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>rent Commission would no longer exist.

Local 30's citation to the Port Authority Act and the School Administrators Act as proof that the General Assembly has previously extended the same collective bargaining rights to first-level supervisors of other public employers in the Commonwealth, and that this Court has sanctioned the General Assembly's power to do so, is unpersuasive. First, as the Commission notes, the Port Authority Act applied to Port Authorities in second-class counties and the School Administrator Act applied to school administrators in first-class counties, which are settled, legitimate classifications. The Act at issue here, in contrast, applies solely to the Commission. Furthermore, in point of fact, neither the Port Authority Act nor the School Administrators Act was challenged as violative of Article III, Section 32, and neither was determined by this Court to be constitutional under Article III, Section 32. Thus, this Court has neither approved nor disapproved of those Acts as special legislation.</p>
