In 2001, this Court denied Perrone’s first petition for reinstatement on the grounds that he did not perform adequate community service, and because eight years of disbarment was insufficient to dissipate the detrimental effect Perrone’s misconduct had upon the integrity and standing of the bar and on the administration of justice. <em>In the Matter of William James Perrone, </em><a href="/pa/565/0563-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="565 Pa. 563" data-case-ids="124722" data-case-paths="/pa/565/0563-01">565 Pa. 563</a>, <a href="/a2d/777/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="777 A.2d 413" data-case-ids="11079543,124722" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0413-01,/pa/565/0563-01">777 A.2d 413</a>, 416-17 (2001) (hereinafter <em>“P&amp;rrone I </em>”).

Relying on Rule 217(i),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> the Committee found that Perrone did not meet his burden under Rule 218(c)(3)(ii) of establishing that he possessed the moral qualifications, competency and <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>learning in the law required for reinstatement.

The Board went on to find that Perrone satisfied his burden of demonstrating that he possesses the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law necessary to practice law in this Commonwealth. Relying on the fact that Perrone had been disbarred for more than ten years, it further concluded that his resumption of the practice of law would neither be detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or administration of justice nor subversive of the public interest.</p>

Because Perrone was paid for his time and set his own hours, the Board noted that he reasonably believed that he was an independent contractor rather than a person “employed” by a firm.

    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[171,694,1157,1261]]]'>Looking first to the applicability of subsection (j)(4), we conclude that Perrone is clearly bound by such rule. Subsection (j) begins by stating that a “formerly admitted attorney may not engage in <em>any form of law-related, activities ... </em>except in accordance with the following requirements.” Pa. R.D.E. 217(j) (emphasis added). It is therefore clear that subsection (j) sets forth a global prohibition on the performance of <em>all </em>law-related activities unless they comply with the requirements of the rule, regardless of whether they are performed as an independent contractor or otherwise. Similarly, subsection (j)(4)(ii), states, “[w]ithout limiting the other restrictions in this subdivision (j)(4), a formerly admitted attorney is specifically prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities: ... (ii) performing <em>any latv-related services </em>from an office that is not staffed, on a full time basis, by a supervising attorney.” Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(ii) (emphasis added). Thus, the plain language of the rule establishes that subsection (j)(4) applies to <em>all </em>law-related services performed by formerly admitted attorneys, regardless of the manner by which they are performed. To the extent that Perrone relies on the use of the terms “employed” or “employment” in subsections (j)(l) and (j)(5) as negating the applicability of (j)(4), we reject this contention as each subsection refers to separate obligations of a formerly admitted attorney.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

The rule was intended to balance the benefits of allowing a formerly admitted attorney to remain current in the law to enhance competency, while recognizing the significant policy considerations of preventing the unauthorized practice of law and avoiding public confusion regarding the status of a disbarred or suspended attorney.</p>

ODC argues that the rule requires a formerly admitted attorney to be physically present in the office of the attorneys who are supervising him.

He argues that Rule 217(j)(4)(ii) does not suggest that the disbarred attorney has to be physically present in the law office at all times, but rather is intended to ensure responsible supervision of the work performed by the formerly admitted <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>attorney. Perrone asserts that, taken to its logical conclusion, ODC’s interpretation of the rule would prohibit a disbarred attorney from performing paralegal services in a law library or researching a legal matter from a computer at his desk at home. Perrone argues that it would be absurd to require the disbarred attorney’s physical presence in the supervising attorney’s office when the supervising attorney is ensuring that the disbarred attorney is not engaging in the practicing of law by having contact with clients or representing that he is a licensed attorney, which is the underlying purpose of the rule.</p>

Simply put, subsection (j)(4)(ii) requires that there be a supervising attorney at a law office on a full-time basis to monitor the law-related services performed by a disbarred or suspended attorney.

    <p id="b547-7" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[171,489,1163,1543]]]'>As noted by the Majority, ODC argues that this provision requires a formerly admitted attorney to be physically present in the office of a supervising attorney and that such physical presence is necessary to ensure that the disbarred attorney is not representing himself as a lawyer, is not having physical contact with clients, and is not rendering legal advice. The Majority rejects such an interpretation as too restrictive and concludes that the language of the Rule was not intended to limit formerly admitted attorneys regarding the physical location of where their work must be performed. The Court notes, “we agree with Perrone that ODC’s interpretation of subsection (j)(4)(ii) is too restrictive and not in accordance with the mandate of the rule. The rule was intended to ensure accountability, not observation of each step of the process by which a disbarred or suspended attorney performs legal research and/or drafts memoranda.” Maj., 587 Pa. at 399, 899 A.2d at 1115. While such an interpretation of the rule is reasonable, I am not so sure it is better than the view articulated by ODC. Certainly, there is some legitimacy to ODC’s view that direct physical oversight of a formerly admitted attorney’s work is preferable to the remote supervision of such work by a full-time attorney in a staffed office. Indeed, if the majority’s interpretation of the applicable clause is correct, it would make no sense to require the supervising attorney to work full-time in a staffed office. Accordingly, I believe it would be best to refer the matter to the Disciplinary Board for further consideration of the rule and to make a determination whether direct or remote supervision of formerly admitted attorneys is preferable.</p>

Thus, as noted, I <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>join the Majority’s conclusion that Perrone should be reinstated to the practice of law.</p>

Specifically, in discussing whether Perrone is subject to Rule 217(j) because, as he claims, he is an independent contractor, the Majority, in footnote 8, notes that “assuming, as we have, that Perrone is an independent contractor, he would not be subject to the second sentence of subsection (j)(l), although he is clearly subject to the first.” Maj. Op. at 398 n. 8, 899 A.2d at 1114 n. 8. Because the fine point of whether Perrone is subject to this specific clause of subsection (j)(l) is not before us, I would not definitively speak to its applicability.</p>
