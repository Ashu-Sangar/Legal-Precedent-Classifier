Consequently, the child would remain in foster care while the case twice progressed through the appellate court system. In an effort to achieve permanency for the child, the court and the local agency considered the requirements of the Juvenile Act and the Adoption Act and the practices of the child services agencies in the other counties, and determined that a termination petition could be filed without a court-ordered goal change.

The Act directs that “[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(1). In this regard, the Act sets forth two instructions. First, in 1 Pa.C.S.1921(b), the Act directs that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Second, in 1 Pa.C.S.1921(c), the Act directs that “[w]hen the words of the statute are not explicit,” the General Assembly’s intent may be ascertained by considering specified matters, which include the occasion and necessity for statute; circumstances of its enactment; mischief it remedies; object it seeks to attain; former law; <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>consequences of particular interpretation; contemporaneous legislative history; and legislative and administrative interpretations of statute.</p>

Therefore, I believe that this Court’s interpretation of 42 Pa.C.S. 6351 should focus on the statute’s language according to the rule set out in 1 Pa.C.S.1921(b) for the construction of statutes that are clear and unambiguous. In my view, the majority opinion should not include a consideration of the statutory factors in 1 Pa.C.S.1921(c) for the construction of statutes whose words are not explicit. <em>See Commonwealth v. </em>Packer; <a href="/pa/568/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="568 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="163625" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0481-01">568 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="798 A.2d 192" data-case-ids="163625,9428700" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0481-01,/a2d/798/0192-01">798 A.2d 192</a>, 196 (2002) (observing that only when the language of the statute is ambiguous does statutory construction under 1 Pa.C.S.1921(c) become necessary).</p>
