    <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.7",526,[289,606,1156,692]]]'>This Appeal presents the question of whether an order disqualifying trial counsel in a civil case is an interlocutory order, which is not immediately appealable. Appellants Joseph and Rose Vaccone contend that the trial court erred in disqualifying their counsel, Frank D. Branella, from represénting them in their action against Appellee Marc J. Syken. The Superior Court quashed their appeal of this order, ruling that the order disqualifying counsel is interlocutory, and is not an appealable collateral order under Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure (“Pa.R.A.P.”) 313. We agree, and, as discussed below, we hold that a trial court order disqualifying counsel in a civil case is interlocutory and is not immediately appealable.</p>
    <p id="b526-8" data-blocks='[["BL_526.8",526,[288,1323,1157,906]]]'>Appellant Joseph Vaccone (“Vaccone”) was a construction contractor, working in a house in South Philadelphia on July 24, 2000, when the house collapsed. Two people were killed in the accident, and Vaccone and another person were injured. Vaccone and his wife Rose brought suit against Mark Leuzzi &amp; Sons Contractors (“Leuzzi”) for Vaccone’s injuries, claiming that workers for Leuzzi undermined the foundation of the house while working in the basement. The other victims of the collapse filed actions against Vaccone and his company, Vaccone General Contractors. The Vaccones, as plaintiffs against Leuzzi, were represented by Attorney Frank Branella (“Branella”), who employed Attorney Marc Syken (“Syken”) as an associate. Branella assigned Syken to work on the case, and Syken became involved in settlement negotiations with Zurich Insurance Company (“Zurich”), which insured both Leuzzi and Vaccone’s company. Zurich was represented by the law firm of Bodell, Bove, Grace &amp; Van Horn.</p>

The Vaccones then filed this suit against Syken, alleging that he had defrauded them in persuading them to settle with Zurich by undervaluing their personal injury claim. The reason for the fraud, claim the Vaccones, was that Syken settled their case at a low value in order to obtain employment with the Bodell firm, which represented the insurer Zurich.</p>

Branella then filed a counterclaim against Syken, alleging that Branella relied upon Syken in negotiating and accepting the settlement amount for the Vaccone’s damages.</p>

The trial court (New, J.) agreed, and granted the Motion to Disqualify on the grounds that Attorney Branella would be a witness in the case of <em>Vaccone v. Syken. </em>The Superior Court, <em>per curiam, </em>quashed the appeal as interlocutory.

In Richardson<em>Meirell, </em>the Court reversed a Court of Appeals ruling that it had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of an order disqualifying counsel. In an extensive analysis, Justice O’Connor, writing for the majority, determined it appropriate to extend the <em>Flanagan </em>holding to civil cases: “We hold that orders disqualifying counsel in civil cases, like orders disqualifying counsel in criminal cases and orders denying a motion to disqualify in civil cases, are not collateral orders subject to appeal as ‘final judgments.’ ” <em>Richardson-Merrell, </em><a href="/us/472/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="472 U.S. 424" data-case-ids="1512498" data-case-paths="/us/472/0424-01">472 U.S. at 440</a>, <a href="/us/472/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="472 U.S. 424" data-case-ids="1512498" data-case-paths="/us/472/0424-01">105 S.Ct. at 2766</a>.</p>

We adopt this rule because we believe that it has become necessary to remember the purpose of the finality rule, which is to avoid piecemeal litigation, and not to become swallowed up in its exceptions. Orders disqualifying counsel do not meet all three prongs of the collateral order doctrine. First, in many cases, orders disqualifying counsel will not be separable from the merits of the litigation, and that is particularly the case here where the order is based on the likelihood that the attorney, Branella, would be called to testify at trial. In such a case, the disqualification order is indeed inextricable from the merits of the case because it would be impossible to determine the impact that the attorney’s testimony would have on the outcome of the case. Second, while appellants claim that disqualification of Branella would cause them hardship; this is not an important reason to deny review within the meaning of the collateral order doctrine. Appellants do not contend that they will be unable to find substitute counsel,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> but simply that they will be inconven<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>ienced because Branella has been involved with this case from the beginning. As the Superior Court has noted in <em>Keefer v. Keefer, </em><a href="/a2d/741/0808-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="741 A.2d 808" data-case-ids="11656406" data-case-paths="/a2d/741/0808-01">741 A.2d 808</a>, 813 (Pa.Super.Ct.1999), “Orders that make a trial inconvenient for one party or introduce potential inefficiencies, including post-trial appeals of orders and subsequent retrials, are not considered as irreparably lost.” Finally, under the third prong of the collateral order doctrine, appellants will not irreparably lose their right of review of the disqualification order if appeal is delayed until after the litigation is completed. If on appeal the Superior Court determines that the motion to disqualify Branella was improperly granted, that Court will simply order a new trial and appellants can proceed with Branella as their attorney.</p>
