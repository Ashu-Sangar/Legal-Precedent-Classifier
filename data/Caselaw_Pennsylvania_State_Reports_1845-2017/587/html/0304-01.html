Notwithstanding appellant’s assertion regarding the merit of his claim, appellant admits he is unable to prove prejudice without the results of the DNA test. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief, at 10, 21. Thus, a conundrum exists: appellant cannot prove prejudice without the test, and without showing prejudice he cannot get the test.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> By first requiring appellant to establish counsel lacked a reasonable basis for not pursuing DNA testing, the prejudice prong is capable of being resolved. If appellant demonstrates counsel lacked a reasonable strategy, DNA testing can then be conducted; the results would allow the PCRA court to address the prejudice prong comprehensively.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The Defender Association of Philadelphia, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>asseits appellant is entitled to post-conviction DNA testing to establish prejudice because only if the test is performed, with exculpatory results, can prejudice be established. <em>Amicus </em>argues appellant is entitled to a “freestanding” request for post-conviction DNA testing. <em>See </em>Amicus' Brief, at 42. Appellant is not entitled to a “free-standing” post-conviction DNA test because he was not convicted of a crime prior to the existence of, or general availability of, DNA testing. In addition, this Court need not reach the issue of "free-standing” DNA requests because appellant's post-conviction DNA request was not “free-standing”; appellant's request was based on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Furthermore, the statute limits post-trial testing for very salient reasons: If post-trial testing were routinely available, few would seek pretrial testing; it would behoove counsel to go to trial without testing, then seek DNA testing if convicted, there being nothing but an up-side to a convicted client. DNA testing that is available cannot become after-discovered evidence, and cannot be treated as a second chance lottery ticket. Creating a rule that encourages such gamesmanship is not áppropriate.</p>
