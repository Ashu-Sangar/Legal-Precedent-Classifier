The Commonwealth further claims that the PCRA court erred in granting appellee a new penalty hearing, arguing that the mental health evaluation, upon which the PCRA court relied in awarding relief, was formulated twenty years after the murder took place and failed to consider appellee’s conduct at the time of the crime itself. Also, with regard to this second claim, the Commonwealth contends that neither appellee nor his family members provided trial counsel with any indication that appellee suffered a disadvantaged childhood.

No evidence, however, was presented that identified the race of: (1) the remaining jurors; (2) the alternate jurors; (3) the other veniremembers struck by the prosecutor; (4) the veniremembers struck for cause by the court; and (5) the veniremembers struck by defense counsel. In response, the Commonwealth presented testimony from one of the seated jurors who testified that she specifically remembered that at least one of the seated jurors was black. N.T. 11/6/2001 at 3.

Specifically, the PCRA court posited that <em>Tilley </em>was distinguishable because “[appellee] is black, his allegation of error is that the Commonwealth excluded black jurors and his direct appeal was open at the time that <em>Batson </em>was decided.” PCRA Court Op. at 3. The Commonwealth contends, however, that appellee is in the very same material position as Tilley since appellee, like Tilley, did not raise a claim that the prosecutor struck jurors because of their race until collateral review.

      <em>Batson </em>claim, posed as such, is waived.

The Commonwealth notes that appellee failed to establish the racial composition of all of the prospective jurors, and that one juror’s testimony established that at least one member of the jury was black. Additionally, the Commonwealth highlights prosecutor Long’s testimony that he had never tried a case in front of an all-white jury. On such a record, the Commonwealth submits, the determination of the PCRA court, who was not the trial judge, cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>

Appellee further argues that because the Commonwealth offered race-neutral reasons via prosecutor Long’s testimony, its challenge to the sufficiency of his <em>prima facie </em>case is rendered moot. Appellee additionally notes that the Commonwealth has failed to challenge on appeal both the PCRA court’s finding that the prosecutor did not have race-neutral, non-discriminatory reasons for striking the four black veniremembers, and the PCRA court’s retroactive finding of purposeful racial discrimination in jury selection.</p>

Counsel undertook little or no affirmative effort in preparing for the penalty phase as well, engaging in a paucity of investigation of mitigation. Counsel in fact admitted that he conducted virtually no preparation for the penalty phase. During the penalty hearing, counsel introduced no testimonial evidence, but did argue two record-based mitigating circumstances. This Court noted that, if counsel had conducted a reasonable investigation, he would have discovered that Malloy was abused during his childhood by his mother and her boyfriend, that he was placed with his grandmother after his mother abandoned him, and that he was institutionalized at the age of twelve because of his criminal behavior. On this record, this Court found that counsel was ineffective for not investigating and presenting a reasonable case in mitigation, noting that the foregone evidence was easily discoverable had counsel undertaken even a minimal investigation. <em>See Malloy, </em>

As we noted in <em>Malloy, </em>although the type of mitigation evidence presented by appellee on collateral review, <em>i.e., </em>dysfunctional childhood and resulting mental health effects, may not be as strong as the “smoking gun” mitigation evidence at issue in some other cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> appellee did prove that if counsel had conducted even a minimal investigation, he would have uncovered significant mitigation evidence in appellee’s background that was easily discoverable. <em>See <a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">id.</a> </em>Indeed, some of the available mitigation evidence was easily discoverable in appellee’s prior incarceration records and the presentence investigation report for the other murder charge where counsel also represented appellee. In addition, counsel’s performance at the penalty hearing was lacking as he produced no testimonial evidence, choosing rather to argue record-based mitigating circumstances found unpersuasive by the jury. Moreover, as recognized in <em>Malloy, </em>“[t]he onus is not upon a criminal defendant to identify what types of evidence may be relevant and require development and pursuit. Counsel’s duty is to discover such evidence through his own efforts, including pointed questioning of his client.” <em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">at 788</a>. Therefore, although it is true that appellee never volunteered to counsel all of the alarming details of his childhood, it was not necessarily his responsibility to do so. Counsel is charged with the duty of asking probing questions of his client, and with the duty of discovering and developing mitigation evidence in light of what options are afforded by the Sentencing Code. Here, counsel failed to undertake a reasonable investigation, including sufficiently questioning appellee <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>concerning any possible mitigation evidence, and he failed to adequately question the one potential mitigation witness he did meet with, appellee’s sister. Accordingly, appellee’s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness has arguable merit.</p>
    <p id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.5",489,[170,558,1157,1611]]]'>Second, it is clear that counsel’s failure to investigate and develop mitigation evidence of appellee’s background was not an objectively reasonable strategy. It is well-settled that the reasonableness of counsel’s investigation into possible mitigation evidence can depend upon the information provided by the defendant, and counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for not introducing information uniquely within the knowledge of the defendant and his family which is not supplied to counsel. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/577/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="577 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="91719" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0473-01">577 Pa. 473</a>, <a href="/pa/577/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="846 A.2d 105" data-case-ids="91641,91719,9252174,9252208" data-case-paths="/pa/577/0472-01,/pa/577/0473-01,/a2d/846/0105-01,/a2d/846/0105-02">846 A.2d 105</a>, 113 (2004) (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

In this case, however, the testimony presented at the PCRA hearing established that counsel failed to conduct even a cursory investigation into appellee’s background. This case, similar to <em>Malloy, </em>is not one where trial counsel attempted to question his client and family members with the goal of eliciting relevant mitigation information, only to have childhood abuse, severe family poverty, squalid childhood living conditions, parental alcoholism, mental health issues, or other potential mitigation evidence within their knowledge not revealed to counsel. <em>See Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d at 788</a>; <em>contrast Bond, </em><a href="/pa/572/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="819 A.2d 33" data-case-ids="716470,9344704" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0588-01,/a2d/819/0033-01">819 A.2d at 47</a> (noting that trial counsel met with client and family members on several occasions and they failed to reveal potential childhood mitigation). Therefore, counsel’s inaction and failure to engage in any substantive investigation was not caused by appellee and his family’s noncooperation in supplying mitigation evidence. “Although counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to investigate evidence which he had no reason to know existed, counsel still has an obligation to conduct a reasonable investigation to uncover such information.” <em>Malloy, </em><a href="/pa/579/0424-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="856 A.2d 767" data-case-ids="1370926,1370995,9212057,9212126" data-case-paths="/pa/579/0424-01,/pa/579/0425-01,/a2d/856/0767-01,/a2d/856/0767-02">856 A.2d at 788</a>.</p>

In assessing prejudice, these two aggravating factors must be contrasted with the three mitigating circumstances actually presented by counsel, as well as the mitigating circumstances that counsel should have investigated, namely appellee’s abusive and dysfunctional childhood background and its residual mental health effects. Here, trial counsel presented no affirmative or testimonial evidence at the penalty hearing; instead, he forwarded only a brief argument and concession of the Commonwealth’s aggravating factors. Similar to counsel in <em>Malloy, </em>in a point stressed by this Court in that case, counsel failed to make an effort to personalize appellee for the jury.
